It's literally unprecedented.\"The Kentucky senator went on to say that \"these vacancies now properly belong to the next president. As I repeatedly warned the judiciary in other matters, if you play political games, expect political prizes.\"McConnell's colleague across the aisle, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, didn't mince words when he reminded the minority leader of his refusal to grant a confirmation hearing to Merrick Garland, whom President Barack Obama nominated in March 2016 to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.Obama nominated Garland eight months before the 2016 election, but McConnell insisted at the time that the next president should fill Scalia's seat on the court.\"I listened carefully to my colleague from Kentucky explain his concerns about the filling of four circuit court vacancies,\" Durbin said on Monday. \"And he raises a question about whether that's fair.\"Well, I'd like to call the Senate's attention to the fact that there was a moment in time when we were shocked to learn that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had died while on a hunting trip,\" he continued. \"And the decision was made almost instantly by the senator from Kentucky, the same senator who just talked about delaying and filling vacancies.\"\"The decision was made by him not to fill the Supreme Court vacancy,\" Durbin added.Indeed, McConnell said at the time, \"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\"The Kentucky senator reversed course four years later when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died less than two months before the 2020 election.Within hours of Ginsburg's death in September 2020, McConnell released a statement pledging that Trump's nominee to fill Ginsburg's seat would \"receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.\" Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett shortly after, and she was confirmed to the Supreme Court a month later.McConnell has long said that filling the federal bench with conservative judges is his \"top priority.\"\"There are over 1,200 executive branch appointments that come to us for confirmation, and among the most important — in fact, I would argue, the most important — confirmations we have are lifetime appointments to the judiciary,\" McConnell told NPR in 2018.The Kentucky senator's comments on Monday came on the heels of a deal that Democrats made with Republicans last month, in which Democrats agreed to cede four circuit court nominations in exchange for the Senate confirming more of President Joe Biden's lower-court judicial nominees.Schumer's office defended the deal last month, telling Politico, \"The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward.\"","summary":"Senator Dick Durbin wasted no time reminding McConnell of his own political maneuvering with judicial nominees.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mitch-mcconnell-complains-political-games-judicial-nominees-1994501","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2534529/senate-minority-leader-mitch-mcconnell.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 01:10:41","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":269848758,"title":"Supreme Court Weighs Fda Block Kid Friendly Flavored Vapes","text":"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday was divided over whether the Food and Drug Administration had unlawfully rejected millions of flavored e-cigarettes for approved sale in U.S. over concerns about nicotine addiction among young people.\n\nDuring oral arguments in a case that could have a significant impact on public health, the justices grappled with tobacco industry claims that the government had given unclear and shifting requirements for new product applications and failed to provide proper notice to the companies.\n\n\"FDA switched its position on what studies were required\" to show that the products have benefits to existing smokers that offset risks to youth, argued Eric Heyer, the attorney representing vape manufacturers Triton Distribution and Vapetasia, which are seeking a green light to market e-liquids such as \"Jimmy the Juice Man Peachy Strawberry\" and \"Iced Pineapple Express.\"\n\nFederal law requires sellers of new nicotine products to provide regulators with scientific evidence to show that the products would promote public health, but the statute does not spell out specifically what evidence is necessary and sufficient. The FDA's guidance on how to meet that requirement is at the center of the case.\n\n\"Their argument is that the guidance were actually a moving target, that either they weren't clear or you changed the guidance as time went on,\" said Justice Clarence Thomas, who appeared sympathetic to vape manufacturers.\n\n\"That is their argument,\" replied Biden administration lawyer Curtis Gannon, representing the FDA, adding, \"But I think that the key point is that they knew from the statute that they needed to be making this comparison about what the benefits were with respect to existing smokers and weighing that against the potential costs with respect to nonsmokers and attracting youth.\"\n\nJustice Neil Gorusch suggested that the companies might not have been given \"fair notice\" of how they could comply with the law. \"Wouldn't due process require an opportunity for notice and a hearing?\" he asked Gannon.\n\nE-cigarettes and vapes, which deliver nicotine without some of the harmful effects of smoking, have been booming in popularity. Kid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts, are not approved by the FDA and are on the market illegally.\n\nWhile vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands.\n\nManufacturers have acknowledged that their products may appeal to youth but insist that a \"growing body of scientific evidence\" shows that \"flavors are crucial to getting adult smokers to make the switch and stay away from combustible cigarettes.\"\n\nA federal appeals court sided with the companies last year, saying the agency had acted arbitrarily. If the Supreme Court upholds that ruling, it could clear the way for broader marketing and sale of flavored nicotine products.\n\nThe Court's three liberal justices all seemed to share the government's view that FDA did not illegally move the goal posts during the process and that the companies simply lacked the evidence to win approval.\n\nSince 2009, when Congress passed legislation aimed at curbing tobacco use among young people, the government has almost universally denied tobacco company requests to sell flavored nicotine e-liquids, citing risks of addiction among minors.\n\nThe FDA said the two companies in this case provided insufficient evidence that the benefits of their flavored e-products in helping tobacco smokers quit exceed the dangers of hooking children.\n\n\"I'm so totally confused,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Heyer. \"What (FDA) said is what you provided wasn't sufficient.\"\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was \"baffled\" by Heyer's argument because the FDA had explicitly articulated its standard.\n\n\"I guess I'm not really seeing what the surprise is here, or what the change is here,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"There's just not a lot of mystery here about what FDA was doing. You might disagree with that, because you think that, in fact, the world of 40-year-olds really wants to do blueberry vaping, but you can't say that FDA hasn't told you all about what it's thinking in this respect.\"\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, who could be a critical vote in the case, signaled sympathy to the industry's complaint about discretionary government regulation but suggested he wasn't convinced FDA had acted unreasonably.\n\n\"If the agency says (your claims of benefits to adult smokers) that doesn't outweigh the harm to youth, we've reviewed everything, we're aware of everything, of course they're aware of everything that's out there, that's kind of the end of it, isn't it?\" Kavanaugh asked.\n\nEven if they lose the case, several justices noted, the vape manufacturers could reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application.\n\nWhile the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale of sweet and candy-flavored vapes, president-elect Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to \"save\" flavored vapes.\n\n\"We don't know exactly what that's going to look like,\" said Heyer. But, he added, that his clients \"can't afford to wait that out.\"\n\nNearly a quarter of high school students who use e-cigarettes consume illicit menthol-flavored varieties, according to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey.\n\nJosie Shapiro, the 2024 national youth ambassador for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids who testified before Congress on the dangers of nicotine addiction, said illicit flavored vapes hooked her at age 14.\n\n\"I think that by marketing any sort of flavored product as bubble gum or any of the genres of candy, it's going to catch the eyes of children,\" Shapiro said. \"I'm still addicted, and I'm still trying to fight my addiction. Honestly, the FDA needs to regulate all flavored tobaccos to flavor 'tobacco' products and get them off the market.\"\n\nPublic health experts have credited the FDA's restrictions on flavored nicotine products with helping to drive down the number of teenagers who vape gradually from an \"epidemic\" level just five years ago.\n\nThe case, Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments, LLC, will be decided before the end of the Supreme Court's term in June 2025.\n\nABC News' Patty See contributed to this report.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/supreme-court-weighs-fda-block-kid-friendly-flavored-vapes/15613208/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15613242_120224-cc-ap-teen-vaping-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 01:06:30","author":"Devin Dwyer","authors":["Devin Dwyer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":269849832,"title":"Trump’s Cabinet picks meet with senators ahead of confirmation hearings","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air December 02, 2024 01:51 \n\n Trump’s Cabinet picks meet with senators ahead of confirmation hearings \n Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on 'The Bottom Line.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESPOLITICS","summary":"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on &apos;The Bottom Line.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6365446067112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/45b6d47e-88ef-46b6-af93-9a47fecdcc98/dac8f7b0-6dc0-47bc-b0ea-975f58a125b1/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 01:04:29","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":269848904,"title":"Trump should restart his bid to defend America’s heritage with a new Sabin Howard monument","text":"Donald Trump has big Day 1 decisions to make. Monumental ones, in fact.\n\nSuch as the decision to champion America’s heritage again.\n\nCourtesy of our elite, that heritage was under attack during his first term.\n\nAgainst a background of destroyed statues, defaced monuments, gutted curriculum, social-media censorship and 1619 Project euphoria, President Trump issued a series of executive orders countering the madness, promoting patriotism and imagining a country that tells its honest story of its exceptionalism in marble, stone and bronze.\n\nThese orders — which included creating a Presidential 1776 Advisory Commission, intensifying federal efforts against monument desecration and establishing a National Garden of American Heroes — enraged the intolerant political left.\n\nCanceling Trump’s orders was a political and ideological priority for his successor.\n\nIn his first Oval Office hours — indeed, in his first executive order — President Biden declared his spiteful independence from the 1776 Commission, formally killing it.\n\nSeveral weeks later, he revoked Trump’s other patriotic efforts.\n\nGone, but not forgotten. And, hopefully, like Trump, they’re now back.\n\nTrump’s orders, with their themes of American greatness and their call for proud, physical manifestations of the country’s heritage, were, in their way, endorsed in the recent elections.\n\nThe people made clear their contempt for the wokeness inflicted upon them by Biden and the Democratic Party.\n\nCome-uppance should arrive Jan. 20: Biden’s unpatriotic tit merits an emphatic MAGA tat.\n\nOn Day 1, as #47, Trump should reinstate his Biden-revoked efforts to reorient America to its roots.\n\nTrump should revise and expand them as needed (his Advisory Commission did issue a powerful “1776 Report”), and in one case, he should make them, literally, monumental.\n\nTrump’s powerful 2020 Fourth of July speech at Mount Rushmore shows him as a genuine champion of evocative public art.\n\nHis National Garden executive order —“America’s answer to this reckless attempt to erase our heroes, values and entire way of life” (and a de facto rejection of laughed-at, cultural elite connoisseurs who pay millions for duct-taped banana “art”) — is astonishing in its scope, calling for hundreds of statues of “a roll call of heroes who deserve honor, recognition and lasting tribute.”\n\nIt deserves a rebirth — and a major expansion.\n\nA stone’s throw from the White House is Trump’s inspiration for what could and should be a new and inspiring American monument: A Soldier’s Journey, the recently unveiled World War I memorial.\n\nThe man who has proven he knows how to make American monuments great again is the bold artist, Sabin Howard, who designed and sculpted the shockingly epic, beautiful, colossal and utterly patriotic memorial to both the sacrifice to America’s warriors, as well as its destiny.\n\nAfter generations of dull and ugly, of art for the artist’s sake, this exceptional and visionary artist — unembarrassed in his love for America and its promise of freedom — has gifted us with work emotive beauty, a thing packaged huge: His 60-foot-long, 10-foot-high, 38-figure movie in bronze, a result of a near-decade of relentless work, recalls the greatness of Michaelangelo and DaVinci.\n\nIt is art, as he says, for “We the People.”\n\nHoward’s work has instigated the idea for another monument, of profound scale and import: a Grand Freedom Arch — what he calls “an American Exceptionalism Monument” — that would be a “hero’s journey” of America.\n\nEchoing the kinetic-action and linked-scenes that make-up of his muscular and sinewy World War I bronze triumph, Howard envisions a masterpiece portraying the sweep of centuries, starting in 1776, arcing through the Revolution — giving prominence to the Liberty Bell’s raising — Civil War, emancipation and healing, industrialization, world wars, Great Depression, civil-rights movement and arriving at a New Frontier.\n\nNot a conclusion but aspiring to a destiny that surely must be manifested.\n\nThe themes are Trump’s themes, and more so, America’s.\n\nWith its enormous size, Howard’s Grand Freedom Arch would elevate the observer, and the country.\n\nThrough its historic tableau, it would rebuke victimization while celebrating autonomy and self-determination, God and freedom, and the centrality of free will.\n\nTrump and Howard — true Monuments Men — are a perfect combination to tell America’s compelling story.\n\nIt can start on Day 1.\n\nJack Fowler is a host of the Victor Davis Hanson Show","summary":"Donald Trump has big Day 1 decisions to make.

I’m feeling strong. I am in a good place.”\n\nVan Der Beek said of the concept, “We were all on board for the message, why it was important. We all recognized it, said yes, and then there was the actual doing of it, at which point most of our brains were like, ‘What are you saying?’”\n\nSo just how much of the “full monty” will we see? \n\nAnthony teased, “All of it. It’s called ‘The Real Fully Monty’ for a reason.’”\n\nJames joked, “It was full,” which made Anthony laugh.\n\nTyler insisted, “If we can show ourselves literally to millions of people, you can do it with your doctor,” adding that the concept, “hooked me immediately.”\n\nBruno said of filming the special, “We got embarrassed… There is one thing being at home and sunbathing naked,” but stripping for a good cause was another story. “I’ve never done that before… We were all very nervous.”\n\n James Van Der Beek on the Moment He Received Stage 3 Cancer Diagnosis\n\n View Story\n\nHe said he also loved working as a team after performing solo for so long.\n\nTonioli shared, “Being back in a team and working as a team and learning together… I loved it,” adding everyone “had such a laugh.”\n\nJames poked fun at Bruno saying, “I will say though having been on ‘Dancing with the Stars,’ I didn’t know how much I needed to watch Bruno struggle to learn a dance in a short amount of time. I was like this is very cathartic.”\n\nBruno replied he hadn’t danced with a group in 40 years, and said he “struggled” at first, but ultimately “loved it.”\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony, Taye and James are all dads, and they shared what their kids think! \n\nAnderson shares Nathan, 24, and Kyra, 28, with ex-wife Alvina Stewart. He explained, “I didn’t tell them… I was going to be doing ‘The Full Monty,’ like, now my son is asking me… ‘Hey Dad so what’s ‘The Full Monty’ about?’ Now I got to sit up there and explain to him, like, ‘Oh, it’s this little show I did with a couple of my boys…We learned a dance or two and got naked in front of hundreds of people.’”\n\n Getty Images\n\n James Van Der Beek ‘Feeling Good’ in Spite of Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis\n\n View Story\n\nTaye, who is the father of Walker, 15, with ex-wife Idina Menzel, said he’s proud to be setting a good example. “When you are trying to lead by example, this is one of those situations where I feel good about this one… It will hit.”\n\nJames, who has six kids with wife Kimberly, recalled telling his 14-year-old daughter.\n\n“I said, ‘Listen, there’s this special, it’s going to raise awareness for early cancer detection. It’s a dance,’” he said, “and she’s like, ‘Well, yeah, what’s the catch?’ I said, ‘Well, it’s based on this movie, these guys strip naked, and so we’d have to do it naked in a theater in Los Angeles,’ and she thought about it and she goes, ‘I don’t really see the downside,’ and I was like, ‘Wow, either you raised yourself or I did something right.’”\n\nHis 12-year-old son had a different reaction. James shared, “He’s like, ‘You’re gonna get naked? That’s weird, man.’ I’m like, ‘Well, thanks for keeping it real, bud.’”\n\n“The Real Full Monty” premieres December 9 on FOX.\n Checkout latest world news below links :\n World News || Latest News || U.S. News\n\n Source link\n\n Tagscelebrity gossip celebrity news and photos entertainment news hollywood entertainment tonight hollywood breaking news latest entertainment news world news era\n\nAshleigh Durden5 mins ago\n 3 minutes read\n\nShareFacebookXLinkedInTumblrPinterestRedditPocketShare via EmailPrint \n\nRelated Articles\n\nDiddy Accused of Dangling Fashion Designer Over Cassie’s 17th-Floor Balcony \n5 hours ago\n\nBethenny Frankel Is ‘Thriving’ After Denying Engagement Speculation \n6 hours ago\n\nCheck AlsoClose \n\n Celebrity News\n Who’s The Boss’ Danny Pintauro Hospitalized After Scooter Accident \n 7 hours ago\n\nMost Viewed Posts\n\nSeptember 24, 2024 \nUnlocking the Potential of Netwyman Blogs: A Comprehensive Guide \nOctober 26, 2021 \nIndustries That Will be Going Online 100%. \nMay 29, 2022 \nFirst she documented the alt-right.

Elected leaders (almost) always come to power with comprehensive plans and promises, only to have their attention diverted by crises and contingencies that no one anticipated.\n\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his second administration will not be immune to this pattern. Although Republican control of Congress and the vast resources of the U.S. federal government will give him plenty of room to maneuver, he will face a variety of crises – domestic and international – any one of which could overwhelm his administration.\n\nMany risks are beyond the control of today’s governments. The most obvious is the climate emergency. Not a week goes by without new reports of catastrophic climate-driven events – from raging wildfires to increasingly powerful hurricanes – and the resulting costs to lives and livelihoods. Yet the institutions charged with responding to these disasters continue to struggle, because the organizations, laws, regulations, technologies, and budgets available to such agencies are obsolete or insufficient. Owing to the novelty and sheer scale of the challenge, national governments’ incompetence is a global phenomenon.\n\nMoreover, the governmental response can be frustrated by outright denial of the problem. Trump, for example, has described global warming as a hoax perpetrated by China to undermine America’s industrial competitiveness. And even when he acknowledges the reality of the issue, he downplays the emergency, telling his supporters that rising sea levels will simply create “more oceanfront property.”\n\nBut, as Gillian Tett of the Financial Times reports, nearly half of all homes in the United States are already exposed to extreme weather events, and climate scientists agree that the frequency, ferocity, and costs of hurricanes and other climate-fueled disasters will only increase. Following this year’s devastating hurricane season, there is every reason to expect that over the next four years of his presidency, Trump will be forced to devote enormous public resources to emergency response and relief, rather than to his agenda.\n\nAnother major distraction could come in the form of a public-health crisis – like the COVID-19 pandemic that helped derail Trump’s re-election in 2020. As an article published by the Harvard School of Public Health recently warned, “new cases of bird flu and other infectious diseases continue to raise concern,” implying that the next pandemic is a case of “not if, but when.” Worse, experts agree that governments are not prepared to respond with the necessary speed and resources.\n\nIn this context, Trump’s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has understandably raised alarms. Kennedy is best known for denouncing vaccines and promoting alternative medicines that lack any scientific support. If he leads the U.S. government’s response to another pandemic, the result would not only be distracting for Trump; it would potentially endanger millions of lives.\n\nThe economy could hold plenty of unwanted surprises as well. The nature of the business cycle is such that specific sectors (like construction) or even entire countries periodically enter a crisis, implying that it may be just a matter of time before the bears drive out the bulls. Potential sources of instability are not hard to find, including America’s enormous and growing fiscal deficits, fragile global supply chains, China’s increasingly precarious economy, anemic European markets, and the wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nOn top of these preexisting vulnerabilities are the new ones that Trump will introduce if he launches another trade war against China, cuts taxes for the rich, recklessly reduces the size of the government, and slashes regulations on the private sector. His agenda is a recipe for unanticipated consequences and government ineffectiveness.\n\nTrump could also be caught off guard by his political opponents’ use of the judicial system to delay or block some of his initiatives. Yes, the Republicans’ electoral victory and previous success in confirming like-minded federal judges has opened possibilities for Trump that his recent predecessors did not have. But it is worth remembering that the U.S. judicial system is highly decentralized, and that judges enjoy great autonomy. Even some of Trump’s own appointees have surprised him with their independence – and they are likely to do so again.\n\nFinally, there is geopolitics, where the uncertainties are even more difficult to quantify or qualify. From an already boiling Middle East to an increasingly stormy Taiwan Strait, no region’s security or stability is assured. Trump may think that there are no serious consequences to his disdain for NATO and expressions of admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but what if he’s wrong?\n\nTrump’s supporters seem to believe that their leader is immune to the ups and downs of politics and history. But this illusion will not last long. Events will see to that.\n\nMoisés Naím is a distinguished fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author, most recently, of “What Is Happening to Us? 121 Ideas to Make Sense of the 21st Century” (Grupo Editorial, Penguin Random House, 2024).

They’re often claimed; seldom delivered. So, when one appears on the horizon, the wise leader must quickly seize it — or risk losing it forever.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump won his first mandate on Election Day, capturing a majority of Americans and an impressive 86 more electoral votes than his opponent. Obviously, the voters chose Trump for a reason. But not everyone voted for Trump for the same reason, so it beckons the question: A mandate to do… what?\n\nSome Trump voters were pro-life absolutists. Others were motivated by foreign policy. Many more voted with their pocketbooks and/or wallets. All of these (and more) might still be somewhere on Trump’s agenda, but not all of ‘em can sit atop his priority list. \n\nIt’s like Highlander: There can be only one.\n\nThis creates an inherent conflict — especially in a lurid, backstabbing, Machiavellian cesspool like D.C., where every pig wants first at the trough. If Trump doesn’t define his mandate himself, there’s a very long list of GOPportunists (new word I invented: GOP+ Opportunist = GOPportunist) who’ll elbow their way to the front and define it for him.\n\nHowever, there’s an undeniable, irrefutable mandate for a national course-correction. When 72% of Americans are unhappy with the direction of the country, simply changing directions is a move in the right direction. As long as it’s a deviation from the status quo, Trump’s mandate has a great deal of latitude.\n\nHe just needs to set it, sell it, and execute it.\n\nBut every now and then, a gift drops into your lap — like manna from Heaven. You’re just minding your own business, doing your own thing, and BOOM! A new mandate appears.\n\nWe should’ve seen it coming: Last weekend was the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. It’s when millions of Americans are on the open roads, spending time with their loved ones, and focusing on family. It’s a time of joy and love (and the Dallas Cowboys covering the point spread) — when we reconnect with our friends and family, creating moments of magic that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhich makes it a GREAT window to drop nasty PR!\n\nUsually in PR, you’re trying to drum up publicity. The more coverage, the better. But other times, you’re actually trying to do the opposite: You job is to release bad news, but to do so in a way that minimizes how many people will see and hear it.\n\nWhenever there’s an unpopular story to share, timing its release date around Thanksgiving, Christmas, or the July 4th weekend is a time-honored trick in the PR trade.\n\nIt wasn’t accidental that Joe Biden announced his full, unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, late on Sunday evening of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend!\n\nJoe Biden might’ve lost his marbles, but his PR team still knows which way is up. If he wasn’t going to wait until the morning of January 20th to save his son, this was always going to be the date.\n\nBut in doing so, he’s inadvertently given Donald Trump a second mandate: Reform the Justice Department ASAP!\n\nDon’t focus on Hunter being an addict or a criminal. Don’t focus on the Biden family corruption either. Instead, think about the substance of what President Biden actually said in his statement to the American people:\n\n…I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.\n\nIt is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\n\nThe charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\n\nNo reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong.\n\nHere’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice — and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. [emphasis added]\n\nHoly smokes! Our Justice Department is so corrupt — so morally depraved and easily manipulated — that not even the president’s son can have a fair trial anymore! \n\nAfter all, this was Joe Biden’s Justice Department! If his own kid can’t even get a fair trial from his Dad’s Justice Department, the rest of us don’t have a prayer! By the president’s own admission, “raw politics” has infected our judicial system. That’s terrible! Someone’s gotta do something about it.\n\nThe new guy, perhaps?\n\n(I did find it odd that Biden called it a “miscarriage of justice,” since he favors late-term abortions, but I digress.)\n\nThe incoming Trump administration must jump all over this: Hey, it’s one of the few areas in Washington where there’s (now) bipartisan consensus!

It was money well spent, and I highly recommend it. The movie spanned many decades and briefly touched upon the fact that American hostages in Iran were freed almost the moment Ronald Reagan took the oath of office on January 20, 1981. \n\nRecall that in April of 1980, the Carter administration launched a failed rescue operation to rescue the hostages.\n\n\"Equipment failure\" was blamed after two U.S. aircraft \"collided on the ground in a remote desert location in Iran.\" In the end, there was \"no fighting & no combat\" but plenty of \"deep regret\" after eight American crewmen were killed and several other Americans injured. \n\nOne can't help but compare Carter's botched hostage rescue to Joe Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2020. \n\nAt a welcoming ceremony at the White House for the freed hostages, Reagan warned, \"Let terrorists be aware that when the rules of international behavior are violated, our policy will be one of swift and effective retribution. We hear it said that we live in an era of limit to our powers. Well, let it also be understood, there are limits to our patience.\"\n\nIs President-elect Donald Trump about to have a similar foreign policy win? He wrote on Truth Social today: \n\nEverybody is talking about the hostages who are being held so violently, inhumanely, and against the will of the entire World, in the Middle East - But it’s all talk, and no action! Please let this TRUTH serve to represent that if the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity. Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!\n\nHamas savages abducted 251 innocent men, women, and children on October 7, 2023. The Washington Post, citing Israeli government sources, estimates that 63 hostages remain in Gaza. Other estimates put the number at closer to 100. We learned over the weekend that 21-year-old Omer Neutra was confirmed to have been killed in the October 7 attack, and Hamas has been holding his remains hostage since then. \n\nOmer Neutra, a 21-year-old American-Israeli, served as a platoon commander in the Armored Corps. Today we can confirm, based on intelligence, that he was killed in battle on Oct. 7 and his body has been held hostage in Gaza since.May his memory be a blessing. pic.twitter.com/gfQvXsuEbO— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) December 2, 2024\n\nPray for a miracle for those missing hostages and some semblance of closure for the families of murdered and missing loved ones. Whether it comes on Joe Biden's watch or Donald Trump's, the release of the remaining hostages would be a huge \"win\" for humanity, though it would never erase the vicious brutality visited on Israel on Oct. 7. May there be \"hell to pay\" for Hamas's atrocities.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/paula-bolyard/2024/12/02/trump-throws-down-the-gauntlet-to-hamas-n4934776","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2016/304/3dad1bb5-fa43-48cf-8141-35cd18fd891b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:56:32","author":"Paula Bolyard","authors":["Paula Bolyard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":269846032,"title":"Joe Biden Is Finished In The Democratic Party N4934780","text":"Biden’s growing list of gaffes has left the Democratic Party in turmoil. Naturally, this turmoil began with his decision to pursue a second term. While it is unlikely the outcome of the election would have resulted in anything but Trump’s victory, the talking point that, had he passed the torch early on and given another Democrat a chance to rise through a primary their party would have had a chance of winning, will linger on forever.\n\nBut it was so much more than that.\n\nIt was Biden’s disastrous performance in his debate with Donald Trump that exposed one of the biggest presidential scandals in history: the cover-up of Joe Biden’s cognitive decline. For three and a half years, Joe Biden's physical and mental health was a story that was pretty much only given the light of day in conservative media. \n\nThat debate sparked a series of events that left Democrats with pretty much no choice but to rally behind Kamala Harris—the most unpopular vice president in the history of polling. Since Kamala took over, it’s nearly impossible to imagine Joe Biden doing more to sabotage her candidacy without exposing himself as a double agent. As Kamala sought to distance herself from the Biden-Harris record, Joe did everything possible to link her directly to all of his major policy decisions. \n\nRelated: Here's How Pardoning Hunter Biden Was Really About Protecting Joe\n\nLater on, the Biden-Harris hurricane response exposed the administration’s incompetence mere weeks before the election, and then Biden called Trump supporters “garbage,” forcing the Harris-Walz campaign to go into damage control mode.\n\nWhile none of these factors could have altered the outcome, they undoubtedly provided ample opportunity for those on the left to hold him accountable for their party's shortcomings in the 2024 elections. \n\nThe situation continued even after the election. \n\nAfter Trump’s re-election, Biden’s Oval Office transition meeting with him undermined the Democrats’ narrative of Trump as a threat to democracy. The handshake and photo op boosted Trump’s public image at a pivotal moment. And boy did Joe Biden look happy.\n\nAnd then, on Sunday, the decision to pardon Hunter Biden after repeatedly insisting he wouldn’t wasn’t just legally controversial—it was politically catastrophic. By pardoning his son, Biden handed Trump a golden ticket to right the wrongs of the American justice system. \n\nAnd he will.\n\nJoe Biden single-handedly fractured the Democratic Party and handed Trump a series of political gifts on a silver platter. Joe Biden may see his legacy as the only Democrat who could beat Trump, but that’s not how his own party will view him. \n\nOnce Joe Biden retires, his party will be rushing to forget him.\n\nAnd probably Kamala Harris, too.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/02/joe-biden-is-finished-in-the-democratic-party-n4934780","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/229/3c59768c-9013-4aed-b028-c39a087b8ef8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:56:32","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":269845860,"title":"Dems In Disarray Raskin Challenges Nadler For Ranking Member Position On House Judiciary Committee N2648529","text":"Following the 2024 elections, Democrats will once more be in the minority in the House. Ahead of the 119th Congress, Democrats are vying for ranking member positions on crucial committees, especially the House Judiciary Committee. While the 77-year-old Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) has served as the top Democrat on the Committee for years, The Hill reported on Monday that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who currently serves as the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, is challenging him for the role.\n\nAs the report mentioned:\n\nThe announcement from Raskin, which had been the subject of speculation for weeks, sets the stage for a high-stakes clash between two House Democrats for the ranking member role on one of the most powerful committees on Capitol Hill....Raskin — who is currently the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee — announced his candidacy in a letter to colleagues.“After a week consulting most of our Colleagues and engaging in serious introspection about where we are, I am running today to be your Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee in the 119th Congress,” Raskin wrote. “This is where we will wage our front-line defense of the freedoms and rights of the people, the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI, and the security of our most precious birthright possessions: the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the rule of law, and democracy itself.”Nadler — who was the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for part of the first Trump administration — announced his intent to remain atop the panel in a letter to colleagues last month, highlighting his history of leading efforts against President-elect Trump.\n\nDemocrats don't look to be in disarray merely because of two top members competing for the role, but because of who else is involved.\n\nOn Saturday, The New York Times was out with a headline, \"Democrats Weigh Dumping Nadler, Regrouping to Counter Trump,\" which mentioned Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and other Democrats looking to focus on \"younger lawmakers who they see as better suited to take on the president.\" Raskin is 61, and at the time of publication had not decided if he would launch such a challenge against Nadler. Sarah also covered over the weekend how Pelosi looks to have such a role.\n\nPelosi, on the other hand, will turn 85 in a matter of months, and it looks like she's running for reelection. She was also instrumental in forcing President Joe Biden out of the presidential race in July in something of a coup. \n\nShortly after the November election this year that resulted in a win for President-elect Donald Trump, as well as Republicans gaining back control of the Senate and ultimately keeping control of the House, Pelosi gave an interview with the outlet in which she blamed Biden for not dropping out sooner and for endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris too quickly.\n\nAs The Hill further mentioned:\n\nBut several outlets reported in recent weeks that some Democrats were pushing Raskin to jump into t he race, seeing the Maryland Democrat — who is 16 years younger than Nadler — as better suited to lead the panel during a second Trump administration.According to The New York Times, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was one of those urging Raskin to run.Raskin lauded Nadler in his letter announcing his candidacy, writing that, if elected ranking member, he would consult the New York Democrat throughout his tenure in the top job. Thereafter, however, he referenced “New generations of Democratic leaders in the House.”“I take this step with respect and boundless admiration for my friend Jerry Nadler and his remarkable half-century of service in public office in New York and Congress,” Raskin said. “His career is a model of commitment to our shared Democratic vision of government as an instrument for the common good.”“If I’m lucky enough to be chosen for this responsibility in the 119th Congress, I will turn to Jerry first and throughout for his always wise counsel and political judgment,” he added. “New generations of Democratic leaders in the House will look to him — just as we look every day to our great leaders Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn — as we take the fight to Jim Jordan and an emboldened MAGA movement.”\n\nIn a lot of ways, this sounds similar to Pelosi being instrumental in ousting Biden, only to then try to heap praise upon him at the DNC in August. Weeks before that, she also also offered bizarre comparisons between Biden and President George Washington, suggesting he should be on Mount Rushmore. \n\nJudging from their \"Dear Colleague\" letters, it appears that Raskin and Nadler are looking to see who can portray themselves as a large foe of Trump, with his upcoming term approaching, as well as how much they tried to undermine him during his first term. This time, their pitches even include using the narratives that Democrats have still desperately cling to, like how Trump said in jest last year that he would be a \"Dictator on Day One.\"\n\nAs the report continued:\n\n“In the 119th Congress, the Judiciary Committee will be the headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism and MAGA’s campaign to dismantle our Constitutional system and the rule of law as we know it,” Raskin wrote in his letter. “I hope to be at the center of this fight and—as someone who has battled cancer and chemotherapy—I can tell you that I will never, never surrender.”Nadler, meanwhile, is a more than three-decade veteran in the House who has been the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee since 2017 and was an impeachment manager during Trump’s first impeachment. The New York Democrat called on that experience in making his case to continue leading Democrats on the panel.“As a New Yorker, I have stood up to Donald Trump my entire career,” Nadler said. “Prior to his entering politics, I worked to prevent him from abusing taxpayer dollars to line his own pockets. When he became President, I led the Judiciary Committee’s efforts to hold him accountable for his various abuses of power, culminating in two historic impeachments.”“I understand his playbook,” he added. “I am well prepared to help thwart his plans to be a “Dictator on Day One.”The House Democrats’ Steering and Policy Committee is expected to vote on a recommendation for the ranking member position. The entire caucus will then vote on who should assume the top Democratic post.\n\nNadler has held on before when facing a challenge from a fellow top Democrat. New York Democrats were in disarray for the 2022 Democratic primaries for the House. With New York's 12th Congressional District, Nadler faced former Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a race he handily won in the August primary that year. \n\nRaskin, who was first elected in 2016, objected to certifying the election results in favor of then President Trump in January 2017, as one of his first acts as a member of Congress. It was a move he even bragged about on his office website. Raskin and Nadler have both served as impeachment managers with Raskin serving as the lead manager for the second impeachment. The trial in the Senate didn't take place until Trump had already left office. Raskin has also been particularly relentless in trying to prevent Trump from serving as president again, even and including when it comes to having him kept off of the ballot, though the U.S. Supreme Court in March unanimously ruled against Colorado kicking Trump off of the ballot. Raskin also served on the former and thoroughly disgraced select committee investigating January 6, 2021","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/rebeccadowns/2024/12/02/dems-in-disarray-raskin-challenges-nadler-for-ranking-member-position-on-house-judiciary-committee-n2648529","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/240/1cc3b050-ab0d-463b-a971-273d155f141e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:55:32","author":"Rebecca Downs","authors":["Rebecca Downs"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.167},{"id":269845858,"title":"Trump Selects Who Will Fill Our Most Prestigious Foreign Service Post N2648527","text":"🚨President-elect Donald Trump picks businessman Warren Stephens as U.S. ambassador to the U.K. pic.twitter.com/RYjG3DzQFv\n\nI am pleased to announce that Warren A.

As we noted when covering them, such polls show Biden looking at rather low approval ratings, among his worst, in fact. The Emerson poll for November, shortly after President-elect Donald Trump beat Vice President Kamala Harris, had Biden at his lowest approval rating, of 36 percent. Gallup had him close to it, with a 37 percent approval rating. In the Gallup poll, only President Jimmy Carter, another failed, one-term president, dropped more in his approval rating from October before the election to November.\n\nRealClearPolling, as of December 1, has Biden's approval rating at an average of 40.5 percent, while 55.8 percent. The most recent poll included is from Rasmussen Reports, which actually is on the kinder side to Biden, despite being a right-leaning poll. Looking at their daily tracker for December 2, Biden actually has a 46-53 percent approval/disapproval rating. \n\nDo Biden's approval ratings have to do with his pardoning of Hunter? Cygnal President Brent Buchanan thinks so. In his daily takes for Monday, Buchanan referenced the exclusive reporting on the pardon from NBC News. \n\n\"Biden's pardon proves he knows the nation has already moved on from his presidency,\" read the subject line for the day's daily takes, with Buchanan pointing out, \"Why not?\" As he also noted as part of his take, \"The last deeply disliked Democratic president (FYI: Carter) restored Confederate President Jefferson Davis' full citizen rights, so why wouldn't Biden--potentially more disliked--pardon his criminal son?\"\n\nJust like Biden, Carter only served one term. He lost reelection to President Ronald Reagan in a catastrophic fashion for the 1980 election, whereas Biden's fellow Democrats forced him out of the race in something of a coup back in late July, less than one month after his disastrous debate performance against Trump. Carter, did, however, face a primary challenge by then Sen. Ted Kennedy. \n\nGallup's monitored presidential approval ratings for several years, going back to President Harry S. Truman. Sure enough, Carter was the only Democratic president with a lower approval rating at the end of his term, 34 percent in December of 1980, compared to Biden's current 37 percent approval rating for November 2024. \n\nEven when it looked like Biden was still going to be the Democratic nominee, and would likely face Trump in a rematch, there were still concerns about his candidacy due to his approval rating. In July 2023, Biden was once more compared to Carter, the most unpopular president at that point in his term, while Biden was the second most unpopular. On July 18, 2023, FiveThirtyEight showed Biden with a net approval rating of -16.3 percent. In his Yahoo! News article at the time, Andrew Romano pointed out that that number is \"really bad historically speaking.\"\n\nBringing us back to the present,. FiveThirtyEight now has Biden with a +19 disapproval rating for November 27, with 37.7 percent disapproving of his job performance and 56.7 percent disapproving of his job performance.\n\nWill Biden pardoning his son further drag his approval rating down? CNN's Scott Jennings certainly thinks so. As we covered earlier on Monday, he went on the network this morning to tear Biden apart for such a move, as well as those Democrats who defend him. Biden and White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is still pushing such a lie, are \"a disgrace\" as Jennings put it, with Biden \"draining\" his credibility, Jean-Pierre's credibility, and any others who defend such a move.\n\nJennings also specifically referenced how Biden is in the 38-39 percent approval rating range. \"He is going to leave office--you think 38-39 percent job approval is bad? Just you wait. Just you wait,\" Jennings warned, speaking about Biden's already low approval ratings. \"He's disgraced.\"\n\nBiden still has about a month and a half until he leaves office and Trump is inaugurated for his second term. Here's hoping there's another poll out to prove Buchanan and Jennings correct. \n\nScott Jennings Shuts Down CNN Panelist Trying to Blame Trump for Biden Pardoning HunterThis is the mic drop moment of the day.“We are sitting on the biggest cover-up of who knows what crimes, and Biden knows exactly when it started.

According to the White House, Adjmi was imprisoned for five years after being found guilty of a financial felony in 1996.\n\nFred Keith Alford: Alford was granted complete forgiveness. According to the White House, he was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation after being found guilty of a handgun offense in 1977.\n\nMichael Ashley: In 2019, Ashley received a three-year jail sentence after being found guilty of bank fraud related to the 2009 failure of the mortgage company Lend America. He served as the company’s principal business strategist and executive vice president. Ashley was mandated to pay $800,000 in forfeiture and $49 million in restitution. He received a commuted sentence.\n\nStephen K. Bannon: Trump’s former White House top strategist, who oversaw the last few months of his 2016 campaign, was charged in August with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Bannon’s “We Build the Wall” crowdfunding campaign, according to the prosecution, garnered over $25 million from Trump supporters and spent hundreds of thousands on personal costs. Agents from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service arrested him when he was on Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui’s yacht. Bannon was granted a complete pardon and will no longer be subject to a trial.\n\nLynn Barney: According to the White House, Trump fully pardoned Lynn Barney, who was previously convicted of dealing a minor amount of marijuana and was sentenced to 35 months in prison for possessing a pistol as a convicted felon.\n\nDavid Barren: Trump commuted the life sentence and 20-year sentence of David Barren, who was found guilty of narcotics conspiracy. President Barack Obama reduced his life sentence to 30 years in 2017. According to the White House, Barren has an impeccable prison record and is the father of six children.

I’m Susan Dziubinski with Morningstar, and I’m joined by Morningstar Research Services’ chief US market strategist Dave Sekera. Today’s episode of The Morning Filter is built around you, our viewers. Today, Dave will be answering some of the many questions viewers sent us over the past few weeks. And if we don’t answer your question, don’t lose hope. We plan to answer viewer questions more frequently each week on The Morning Filter as time permits. Dave and I are pretaping this special episode on Nov. 25. All right, Dave, you ready?\n\nDavid Sekera: Am I ready? No, but let’s go ahead, and do it anyway. And I’ve got the first of my holiday mugs here to start the show off with.\n\nDziubinski: There you go. Sounds good. All right. Cherise had a couple of questions, Dave. First, she wanted to hear Morningstar’s view about Chinese EV Maker Nio NIO. And secondly, she asks, what it would take for the Trump administration to impose tariffs on companies like Nio. Would that move require congressional support?\n\nSekera: NIO is actually covered by one of our analysts out of our Hong Kong office. And to be honest, Nio is a Chinese company, and I haven’t done my homework on it, so I don’t have any commentary on the company in and of itself. I would just note that it is a 4-star-rated stock, trades at, I don’t know, close to a 30% discount to fair value. It is a company that we don’t rate with an economic moat, and it does have a very high uncertainty rating. Now, as far as tariff goes, I’m no legal expert here, but my understanding is that the president does have the authority to implement international trade agreements and treaties. It doesn’t appear that they need any congressional approval to impose tariffs and will be able to do it on his own with the stroke of a pen.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Now viewer Aaron has a good problem. He has some holdings that have run up more than 200%, and he’s looking for a framework to use to determine whether he should be selling these stocks or perhaps adding stop losses to them. What are your thoughts, Dave?\n\nSekera: It’s one of those things where knowing when to sell a stock is actually just as hard if not even harder sometimes to guesstimate as far as when to start buying a stock. And again, you know me, I like scaling in and scaling out of positions over time, but I do think that this is a good instance where I can highlight using Morningstar’s star rating system to help determine appropriate times of when to sell or conversely when to buy. For those of you who aren’t familiar, we do assign star ratings to all of those stocks under our coverage, and they go 1 through 5. One-star stocks are those that are most overvalued and trade well above a risk-adjusted margin over our long-term intrinsic valuation. Whereas, 5-star stocks are those that are most undervalued and trade well below our risk-adjusted margin from our long-term intrinsic valuation.\n\nNow that risk adjustment is going to be based on our uncertainty rating. The greater the uncertainty, the wider range that we would allow a stock to deviate from our valuation before thinking about starting to sell it, and of course greater uncertainty then we’re looking for that stock to move further and further away before it’s a buy or sell from our intrinsic valuation. Now as a stock enters the 2-star range, it’s probably a good time to start looking at and reevaluating your original investment thesis, and think about maybe taking some profits as at that point we would expect a long-term investor would probably earn below risk-adjusted levels as compared to average returns over time. Personally, I would look to scale out of that position at that point. And then depending on the momentum, once it starts moving into a 1-star range is probably when I look to take the last of my profit and exit the position altogether.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Well, Manish is asking about Rio Tinto RIO. Specifically, Morningstar raised its fair value estimate on the stock on Nov. 1, and then Donald Trump won the election. Given Rio’s dependency on China, but also its ability to possibly benefit from deregulations to procure copper mines here in the US, what do we think of the stock today?\n\nSekera: As you mentioned, Rio’s largest customer is China. And I looked at our financial model, looks like China accounts for about 60% of sales last year in 2023. I also went through our forecast here and really tried to understand what we’re looking for going forward. And in my mind, I think our forecasts here are actually relatively conservative. I’d say kind of the overall investment thesis, the outlook is for Rio’s earnings actually to decline with the demand for many commodities, likely to soften as we get closer and closer to the end of the big economic boom in China. And of course, iron ore is going to be disproportionately hit here as it had benefited from the boom in infrastructure and real estate the most over the past couple of decades. Now, in our model, we use the two-year forward curve for pricing for commodities.\n\nIn this case, we assume iron ore is about $93 a ton through 2026, and then we start to bring that down into 2028 where our long-term price target is $70. Now, looking at copper in a similar story, it’s currently $4.20 a pound through 2026 in our model. But again, we start bringing that down toward our long-term price target of $3.65 by 2028. We’re looking for revenue to decline over the next five years. Our compound annual growth rate for revenue is a negative 2.9%. And we’re also looking for earnings to decline on that five-year compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. Yet, even after incorporating all of that into the stock and with the stock being down about 16% year to date and now trades at a 17% discount to fair value, that’s enough to put it in a 4-star territory. Plus, it looks like they pay a pretty healthy dividend yield at 7%. Now, I would caution it as a company, especially as a commodity company, that we rate with no economic moat, but it does have a medium uncertainty rating.\n\nDziubinski: Now, a couple of viewers have asked about Morningstar’s take on Pfizer PFE, particularly considering Robert F. Kennedy being appointed to the Health and Human Services post. The stock has a pretty attractive yield today above 6%.\n\nSekera: This is a really hard situation to get your arms wrapped around at this point. It is a 5-star-rated stock, trades close to a 40% discount to fair value. It’s a company we rate with a wide economic moat and a medium uncertainty. I did take a look at our outlook from Karen Andersen; she’s our equity analyst who covers Pfizer. And she noted in her most recent write-up that if his appointment is confirmed, that we may end up lowering our forecast for vaccine sales in the US. Now having said that, it looks like only 12% of the company’s sales are from vaccines in the US. And she noted that a reduction in those sales levels by in and of itself probably wouldn’t be enough to really reduce our valuation all that significantly.\n\nThe other thing that we could be looking at as another potential impact would be that they may try to implement programs to bring US drug prices closer to other international prices, other impacts that she noted that we might raise our uncertainty ratings here, which of course would widen the range around fair value that would impact our star ratings. Again, I would say this is a good one. Go onto morningstar.com, take a read through Karen’s last two notes. In her last stock analyst note following third-quarter earnings, she did note as well that just fundamentally, Pfizer is facing significant competition on several of its existing drugs, and we think that puts a lot of additional importance on Pfizer’s new drug pipeline to make up for that new competition as well.\n\nDziubinski: Richard points out that Morningstar has rated Kraft Heinz KHC a 4- or 5-star stock for most of the past five years. He asks, why has the market never realized the value that Morningstar sees in the company. And does Morningstar expect the market to place a value on KHC that’s more aligned with Morningstar’s in the next five years?\n\nSekera: That’s just an excellent observation and a great question. And I think there’s a lot of stocks that this applies to; when you look at stocks that look undervalue, they look cheap on a fundamental basis, but for whatever reason, just haven’t performed over time. In this case, I actually went and I pulled up our financial model that we had published back in December of 2019, and I compared that to where our forecasts are to where we are today. And honestly, it just looks like the company just hasn’t performed as well as we had expected five years ago. When I look at our revenue projection for this year here in 2024, that’s coming in about 8% below where our forecast was five years ago. Actually, in my mind, that’s actually a pretty good forecast if we’re within 8% over the course of the past five years.\n\nBut the real problem is where earnings are coming in? Our earnings projection for this year is currently $3 and 10 cents per share. Our projection for 2024 made five years ago is for $3 and 97 cents a share. Essentially, we’re coming in 22% below what we projected back then. Now, of course, over the past five years, we had the pandemic; we then had the supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions. We’ve had inflation. A lot of that has really hit this company relatively hard, and we see this in the food space just more general as well. But in this case, the gross margin is coming in about 80 basis points lower, SG&A is about a 100 basis points higher. So, the net result is that the operating margin is 200 basis points lower than what we had originally projected back then. Now, since December 2019, the stock’s gone up, it’s gone back down a number of times, but essentially, it’s gone nowhere over that time period, but yet, at least you’ve collected a $1.60 in dividends per year.\n\nApproximately a 4.5% to 5% average stock yield over those past five years. Now, of course, investing is all about looking forward. What do we think now? What’s different now? Probably the biggest differential is that, in June, we upgraded the company’s economic moat rating to narrow from none. Going back in the time capsule here when Kraft was bought out by 3G Partners in 2015, 3G Partners in our view just overemphasize short-term profitability as opposed to really trying to build long-term and economic value. Now initially, that worked. And the stock did very well, its operating margin increased a lot early on, but then we started to see that stock slide in 2018 and 2019 as its brand value deteriorated as they just weren’t correctly reinvesting back into their brands. Now Erin [Morningstar director Erin Lash] who covers the stock has noted that over the past five years, Kraft has really revamped its strategy, it’s refocusing itself back on building long-term value, looking at where they can improve efficiencies, reinvesting in their brands, improving their category management, and of course to do that has required spending more money on reinvesting in those brands and innovation.\n\nBut overall, we think the company is back on the right track, and that those changes it’s made has strengthened its brands. And of course, then strengths its intangible assets, which is what the moat source here is in this case. We think that, over time, the company will be able to expand its operating margin over the course of the next decade. In fact, we have it rising from 20.2% last year up to 21.9% in 2033, which I don’t think is unrealistic. And as a comparison, the operating margin had been as high as 25.9% back in 2017 after 3G had stripped out all that brand reinvestment. Coming in at a pretty much lower margin than where it had peeked out. But in my mind, I think that looks pretty reasonable.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Well, we had a couple of questions come in about Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B. Tim wants to know what we think Buffett is doing with all that cash. What changes might happen when Buffett is no longer running the show, and how the market might react to that?\n\nSekera: Well, actually Susan, you know what? I know you’ve covered Berkshire from your point of view for a long time now. Actually, I think that’s probably a better question suited for you.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Well, let me give this a whirl. This may be the first and last time we do this, Dave. As Dave mentioned, I do a lot of reporting from morningstar.com related to Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded portfolio. I’ll give this a try. Cash at the end of the third quarter at Berkshire was $325.2 billion, which was a record. Morningstar’s Berkshire analyst Gregg Warren, he doesn’t think that cash is being built up for any acquisition. Gregg doesn’t think that Buffett would want to make a big acquisition at this point, that could possibly tarnish his legacy. Now Gregg points out that, of course, the cash could come in handy if there is some sort of market correction, but he doesn’t think that’s actually the motivation behind the growing cash stake. Gregg actually thinks that the cash position is being built up.\n\nBerkshire’s management has something to tap into when Buffett is no longer on the scene. The cash could be used to buy back stock and potentially pay a one-time dividend or maybe a more frequent dividend because there’s no dividend now, to keep shareholders engaged. And that sort of leads into Tim’s question about what could happen when Buffett leaves. We can’t really say what the market reaction will be. But again, Morningstar’s analyst thinks Berkshire’s culture that’s been developed there of management autonomy and entrepreneurship, really is institutionalized at this point. But he does expect that the managers who are going to follow in Buffett’s footsteps will evolve the company from this reinvestment machine that it’s been for decades, to one that’s more focused really on returning capital to shareholders. And that’s only natural when you consider the company’s size, and therefore the fewer investment opportunities it really has. Thanks for the question.\n\nSecond Berkshire question, and this one’s for you, Dave. Berkshire recently took a position in Pool POOL, which is a company that distributes swimming pool supplies and related products. Now Morningstar’s analysts don’t cover the stock, so viewers are asking, would Morningstar cover the stock simply because Buffett owns it? And then more broadly, how does Morningstar determine which stocks its analysts cover?\n\nSekera: We wouldn’t cover a stock just because it’s owned by Berkshire. But more generally speaking, I think our intent here is really to try and cover the greatest amount of stocks that we think are relevant to the largest proportion of our clients. Generally, we start off covering out the largest companies by market capitalization. We also look to cover as much of the main external indexes as possible like the Dow Jones and the S&P 500. And then we start to work our way down from the list there, looking for stocks that are relatively actively traded in the marketplace. And we also try and skew our coverage a bit looking for those companies that we think may have a narrow or wide economic moat. And then lastly, we will try and cover those companies that we think are good comparisons or that we think that we need to cover from a fundamental basis, in order to help make sure that we cover the right names when we’re looking at a sector overall.\n\nDziubinski: Now, Phil has a question about the weighted cost of capital. And specifically asking when you say, Dave, that, say for 3-star rated stocks that investors can expect a rate of return equal to the weighted cost of capital. Phil wants to know, is this number unique to each company, or is it some sort of overall assumed rate of return index to a benchmark like Treasury notes?\n\nSekera: And this is actually just a very good reminder to me that when I do speak, I need to make sure I’m very careful in the word choices I use when we talk. Here, in this case, for a 3-star rated stock, we would actually expect a long-term investor to earn its cost of equity, not the weighted average cost of capital. And of course, the cost of equity being one of the components along with the cost of debt and the risk-free rate that we use in our calculation to determine the company’s weighted average cost of capital. And of course, depending on its capitalization and what the cost of equity and cost of debt are, each company will have its own whack or its own weighted average cost of capital. That weighted average cost of capital then is used to calculate the net present value of the cash flow stream that we expect a company to generate over its lifetime, which then ends up being our intrinsic valuation.\n\nNow the cost of equity in our models is going to be typically tied to how economically cyclical a company is, or really trying to make sure that we understand just how risky we think a company is over the long term. Of course, the higher the risk, the higher the cost of equity, or the greater return that the market is going to want to generate on that equity. Our different levels for the cost of equity is 7.5%. That’s for a company that has below-average cyclicality, think like utility companies are going to have lower cost of equity. 9% is our average rate, so that’s going to be for a company with average cyclicality, so just kind of the run to the mill. Typical companies under coverage are going to use that 9% rate. We get up to 11% for those companies that have above-average cyclicality or above-average risk. Think about companies like the Gap, the retailer, they’re going to be an 11% cost of equity. And then lastly, we go all the way up to 13.5%, but that’s going to be relatively rare.\n\nThat’s for a company that is going to have very high cyclicality or has idiosyncratic, specific risks to that company that we think the market’s going to want to get that kind of return over time.\n\nDziubinski: Well, Jim asks, “Is there any advantage to converting from a company’s common stock to its preferred stock?”\n\nSekera: I think the genesis of this question is we really need to understand the difference between what is a common stock versus preferred stock. Now just throwing my own opinion in there. Personally, I’m not a fan of preferred stock. I think it actually has the worst characteristics of equity and the worst characteristics of bonds, but neither of the benefits that you can get from each. Technically, preferred is equity, but preferred has a lot of bond-like characteristics. It does pay a dividend, typically it’s a fixed rate, although sometimes you see some that are floating rate. But these dividends on the preferreds can be halted, whereas a company can’t halt a payment on a bond without going into default. Now, when they halt the dividend on a preferred, usually the company’s not allowed to pay a dividend on the common equity either. They have to restart those dividends on the preferred, but again, they don’t have to restart the dividends on the preferred at any point in time until they’re ready to.\n\nNow the other part too is that some preferreds are cumulative dividends. Those would be the ones that I would prefer. So that way, if they do halt that dividend, they have to make up for all of those that they did not pay. But a lot of preferreds nowadays don’t have that cumulative nature, so that way, you don’t get paid what you might be owed or the backdo when they do start paying it. And then lastly, if a company does go into bankruptcy or if it does default, more likely than not the preferreds are just going to get wiped out along with the common equity. I really think of preferred as being very junior subordinated that would be in the capital structure. So typically, any recovery in bankruptcy is going to go to the debt holders as opposed to the preferred. You just don’t have that same kind of protection that you might see in a bond. But at the same point in time, because you’re only limited to those dividend payments, you don’t really have a call on the company’s long-term profits.\n\nYou also don’t have the same upside potential as you do for common. Depending on what your own individual portfolio needs, I prefer common equity for that portion of the portfolio that you’re looking for, that long-term appreciation potential, and then looking directly to bonds for that fixed-income portion of your portfolio.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Well, John would like to know if buying dividend aristocrats would be a good strategy for protecting a portfolio during a downturn. Now, for viewers who may not be familiar, the term dividend aristocrats means stocks that have increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more.\n\nSekera: I suspect that most of those dividend aristocrats, and again, I haven’t looked through the entire list here. But I figured most of them are probably going to be pretty high-quality, relatively stable companies, companies that’ll be less volatile to the downside during a market correction. And in fact, some of them may even benefit to some degree of a flight to safety trade when that happens. And of course, the dividend income is going to be a helpful cushion to help offset any kind of principal losses during a correction. But for the most part, during a correction, depending on how long and how severe it is, even the most steady-eddy companies out there will probably face price pressures, especially when portfolio managers get to the point where sometimes they have to sell what they can sell as opposed to what they might want to.\n\nAnd if it’s a steady-eddy kind of company, usually there’s going to be at least some bid for those kind of companies out there. There are other strategies out there for principal protection, maybe buying puts that can help offset losses during a downturn. But I think that’s probably maybe an interesting idea or a topic for a future show.\n\nDziubinski: Now, a viewer in the content section was asking about what Brazilian companies Morningstar covers. That’s your question, Dave. Do we cover any, and do any look undervalued today?\n\nSekera: It looks like we cover seven. Looking at these seven, Ambev is the only one that I’m familiar with. The others I don’t have any take on. But looking at the seven here, we cover Banco Bradesco, that’s a 4-star-rated stock. Itau Unibanco is 3-star-rated. Ambev looks quite attractive here at a 5-star rating. We also cover Vale, that’s a 4-star-rated stock. Petrobras, the energy oil development company down there, that’s rated 3 stars. And then two 4-star-rated stocks, Telefonica Brazil. And you know what? I’m going to murder this name. [TIM Participações] I’m not even going to try. Actually, I guess it would be Portuguese is lacking in this case.\n\nDziubinski: Well, it looks like a couple of opportunities. Feel free to go to morningstar.com to investigate them further. All right. Paul would like an update on a prior stock pick of yours, Baxter International BAX. The company cut its dividend in November, and it’s also divesting its kidney care business. Our analyst recently issued a new report on the company. What are some of the highlights?\n\nSekera: Unfortunately, I think this is going to be a relatively lengthy answer, so I hope everyone’s got their cup of coffee here. And in fact, I actually just got off the line here with Julie Utterback who covers the stock. Let me just dive into it here. Yes, we originally highlighted the stock on our May 20 show. The stock is down 5% since then. Now originally had moved up, but then it gave back all of that gain, and then some after Hurricane Helene hit at the end of September. It’s currently rated 5 stars, trades about half of our fair value. As you mentioned, the dividend did get cut there down to $0.17 per quarter. So that’s about a 2% dividend yield going forward. Company with a narrow economic moat and a high uncertainty rating. For those of you that don’t know the company, Baxter makes a wide range of medical instruments and supplies, anywhere from acute and chronic kidney failure, injectable therapies, IV pumps, and other hospital-focused offerings.\n\nNow, this is going to be long. The company’s really had a tough time. It’s gotten hit a number of times over the past few years. Originally, in 2022, the company got hit pretty hard with supply chain issues. And then as inflation ramped up, that hit their margins pretty hard. They didn’t have very good pass-throughs in their contracted agreements, so they kind of had to eat that inflation for a while. But looking forward, we do note that a substantial number of their three-year sales contracts are coming up for renewal. As they renew those contracts, we do think they’re going to be able to better negotiate cost pass-throughs going forward then from what they had. Then early this year, they did have some issue. Their sales declined from February through April. If you remember back then, UNH, their claims reimbursement system called Change Healthcare was down due to hacking for a number of months.\n\nNow we expected that to be temporary and normalized, and that appears to be the case when we look at third-quarter results. They were relatively solid, but then of course, the company got hit pretty hard by Hurricane Helene as it shut down their main manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Because of that, they did lower their adjusted earnings for the year to a range of $2.90 a share. That’s down from $2.93 to $3.01, but we expect that will be resolved probably in early 2025. Now the other thing that’s going on here, because it’s got to be a more complicated story than all of that, is the company is undergoing a planned divestiture of its kidney care business, which of course is going to be a lower-margin business, but there are a number of different stranded costs that the company has to eat for a couple of years, that’s going to lower their operating margin by a 100 basis points, but by 2027, the company thinks that they should be able to offset those costs.\n\nAgain, investing is all about looking forward. We do expect to see a rebound in their operating margins. We think the out margin bottomed out last year. We’re already seeing a rebound this year. We think that the combination of renegotiating those contracts, as well as divesting the low-margin kidney care business will all improve the margins over the next five years or so. Now, I would note we do expect earnings to decline in 2025, but again, that’s due to the divestiture of their kidney care business. And I think 2025 is really the number you need to gear in on as far as thinking about valuation for the company, as opposed to the 2024 earnings. And at this point, just as an indication of the value in the stock, it’s only trading at just under 13 times our 2025 earnings estimates.\n\nDziubinski: All right. It’s time to move on to the stock picks of the week. Your picks this week were inspired by viewer, Evan, who asked you to talk about undervalued stocks with economic moats, derived from multiple moat sources. Before we get to the picks, Dave, give viewers a rundown of the five moat sources that Morningstar has identified.\n\nSekera: Sure. The first is cost advantage. And again, that’s just simply as far as what company can produce goods or services cheaper than their competitors can. The second is efficient scale. It’s not often used, but again, this is where one company can effectively supply a service or a product in and of itself. Again, think about a railroad where you only need one railroad, two railroads is going to be one railroad, too many. How we have intangible assets. And again, that’s going to be patents, regulatory licenses, brands, things like that, that will allow a company to be able to charge higher prices. The network effect, this one is simply the more users that use the product or service, the more valuable the network becomes. The example here we always use is like Meta Platforms with Facebook. And then lastly, switching costs. This is where it’s just more expensive or disruptive to a business to move to a competitor than to stick with an existing provider.\n\nDziubinski: All right. Your first pick this week is Alphabet GOOGL. First, run us through the data.\n\nSekera: Alphabet is still a 4-star-rated stock. Trades somewhere close to a 20% discount to fair value. Small dividend, only a half a percent dividend yield, but it is a company we rate with a wide economic moat and a medium uncertainty.\n\nDziubinski: Talk a little bit about each of Alphabet’s moat sources.\n\nSekera: And again, I would actually just note here actually looking through all of our different moat sources, there are no companies that we cover that exhibit all five moat sources, but this is one of two companies that we think have four of the five moat sources. That being the cost advantage, specifically within the Google Cloud part of their business. The intangible assets, certainly everybody knows the Google brand and the YouTube. On the network side, Google search. The more people that use it, the better the search results end up becoming. Also, YouTube is building that network effect as well. And then lastly, switching costs. On Google Cloud, be very disruptive and very expensive for people to move away from their cloud business once they’re on it to a different cloud provider.\n\nDziubinski: Now, give us a little bit of an update on this one, Dave, where we stand as of when we’re taping this with the antitrust cases against Google.\n\nSekera: On Nov. 20, the DOJ did finally submit their proposal to the courts for remedies in Alphabet’s Google search antitrust case. And there’s a lot going on here, so I’d certainly highlight recommending going to Morningstar.com and read the full note published by our analyst in this case. The proposals here do call for a divestiture of Chrome, as well as a couple of other remedies. Just jumping to the conclusion, at the end of the day, we don’t think Chrome will be required to be divested. And even if we get to that point, there’s still a number of years away from even potentially that occurring. First, the ultimate ruling won’t come until mid-2025. We then expect the Alphabet will appeal that decision. That appeal could take at least another year, if not more. So, that will take us well into 2026.\n\nAnd then even after that, we think that they will need to implement whatever other changes and remedies the courts or the DOJ are looking for. They need to try those out, see if those may or may not impact or resolve the antitrust concerns. That could take another year or two. At that point, I think we’re getting all the way out to 2029 before we could even really see whether or not they’re going to get forced to make that divestiture, which, at the end of the day, and again, there’s a lot of detail in that note as far as why we don’t think that will come to fruition.\n\nDziubinski: Now your second pick this week is Microsoft MSFT. Give us the details on this one.\n\nSekera: It’s a 4-star-rated stock. Right now trades close to a 15% discount to fair value. Again, not a very high-dividend yield, a little bit under 1%, but wide economic moat and a medium uncertainty.\n\nDziubinski: Now tell us how many sources underpin Microsoft’s moat and then tell us a little bit about each.\n\nSekera: We’re looking at three different moat sources here. The primary moat source being switching costs, but then also bolstered by secondary moat sources of the network effect and cost advantages. And we see these moat sources in multiple different parts of their different business lines. Just a couple of examples here. As far as looking at switching costs, of course, there’s a huge amount of time and expense of implementing new software packages, while at the same time, they would have to maintain the existing platform, you then have to retrain employees on new systems. As much as Microsoft is already embedded within companies' operating structures, very difficult to move off of those systems. Plus, you always have the operational risk too of changing a software vendor. Definitely, switching costs are involved here. And then other parts of the businesses, we see that network effect. For example, LinkedIn, very similar to Meta. The more people that use LinkedIn, the more valuable it becomes to all of the rest of the users. And then looking at Office 365, very large installed base, that attracts a lot of developers.\n\nThen to create individual products like add-ins to be used for Office. And those add-ins, whether or not they’re used in Excel or some of the other products make the Office Suite more compelling and therefore it draws in even additional or more subscribers thereafter.\n\nDziubinski: And then your last pick this week is ASML ASML. And we’re going to need to talk about this one a little bit more in depth because we actually received a viewer question about it. But before we do, first, walk us through the numbers.\n\nSekera: Four-star-rated stock, right now about a 28% discount, 1% yield, company with a wide economic moat. But in this case, as a technology company, we do assign a high uncertainty rating.\n\nDziubinski: Which sources underpin ASML’s moat?\n\nSekera: First of all, I think you just have to realize with ASML, we think that they enjoy just a wide technology gap with all the rest of its competitors. They have very large investments in research and development that we think will continue to widen that moat and act as a barrier to entry. And a lot of it just has to do with the underlying business in and of itself that really they’re one of the only people that supply the type of products that they make. ASML is supported by three of the five moat sources, first being cost advantage, just as the economy of scale that they get as the world’s largest supplier of photolithography machines to semiconductors. I think they have about a 90% market share, really embeds that cost advantage. Huge amount of intangible assets, just all the intellectual property they have and the patents they have. Those just would not be able to be replicated without years of spending billions of dollars, trying to get up to their technology. And then lastly, switching costs. No one else makes like the EUV lithography machines.\n\nAnd then in order to be able to move to a different photolithography machine, a customer would need to essentially redesign their existing fab or their semiconductor manufacturing facilities to accommodate that competing product, which of course would be a huge disruption and a huge cost to do so.\n\nDziubinski: We had a viewer named Danny ask, “Dave, what happened to ASML? The stock really tanked after reporting earnings in October, and it hasn’t recovered. Looks like it’s down about 28% since reporting. So first, unpack what ASML had to say that sort of triggered those losses.\n\nSekera: Two things. It is really just their guidance that they lower the top end of their 2025 revenue guidance by EUR 5 billion. It’s currently a range of EUR 30 billion to EUR 35 billion. But they also lowered their 2025 gross margin range as well to 51% to 53%. It was 54% to 56% beforehand. But we think a large portion of this guidance reduction is due to Intel postponing the opening of one of its new fabs. Also, I just have to point out here, Samsung has had its own recent technological performance. The company has acknowledged that as well. To some degree, we think that both of these firms probably have a much more cautious perspective for 2025. And I think that’s flowing through then to ASML reducing their guidance.\n\nDziubinski: Then, what’s Morningstar’s long-term thesis on the stock?\n\nSekera: As far as a long-term investor, we think the market’s probably overly fixated on the short term. Pressures coming from Intel and Samsung. Over the next five years, our top line is looking for compound annual growth rate of 10%. We’re also expanding our operating margin on better fixed-cost leverage and higher-end equipment for AI being sold. Between both of those, we’re looking for compound annual growth rate getting up to 16% over the next five years for this company.\n\nDziubinski: Well, thanks for your time this morning, Dave, and thanks to the viewers too for their terrific questions.

Prior to this, the Buck caught a bid on more President-elect Trump tariff threats and weaker Euro, which saw EUR/USD hit a low sub 1.0475 post-disappointing PMIs and instability in the French government. The Yen was the distinct G10 outperformer amid its haven properties with continued focus on the anticipated BoJ hike in December. On the data footing, US ISM Mfg. was dubbed as a 'Goldilocks' report as it topped expectations on the headline while prices paid fell and employment rose. Indices saw strength with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperforming and further buoyed by the aforementioned Waller remarks, before selling off from highs into settlement amid a chunky market imbalance. Nonetheless, sectors are largely in the red with only Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology in the green. In terms of the biggest stock stories, there are rumours NVDA's GB200 facing delays, INTC CEO Gelsinger retired, and a SMCI special committee found no evidence of misconduct. The crude complex was choppy but settled with marginal losses as the eventual Dollar strength outweighed strong Chinese data and geopolitical tensions. Lastly, T-Notes were choppy on Monday in the wake of fresh Trump tariff threats, a \"Goldilocks\" ISM Manufacturing PMI, French political instability and dovish commentary from Fed's Waller. Ahead Williams is due to give remarks after-hours with the highlights thereafter being Fed Chair Powell on Wednesday and the pivotal NFP on Friday ahead of blackout for the Dec. FOMC meeting.\n\nWaller (voter) stated he leans towards supporting a cut in December, although added that one could argue a case for skipping a rate cut and that he will be watching data closely to decide. The influential member added that the policy rate is restrictive enough that a December rate cut still allows ample scope to slow the pace of cuts later if needed. On holding, Waller said he will support leaving rates unchanged if data shows forecasts of slowing inflation are wrong. He did add that recent data have raised concerns that inflation progress is stalling meaningfully above 2%. Ahead, Waller stated there is still 'a ways to go' in reducing the policy rate to neutral and he expects rate cuts to continue over the next year, while the speed and timing of rate cuts will be determined by economic conditions.\n\nBostic (2024 voter) said his base case is that inflation remains on track to reach 2%, and he is not going into the December meeting with a sense that the outcome is preordained and coming data will be important and keeping options open. Note, this continues to illustrate the importance of Friday’s payrolls report. The Atlanta Fed President added it is still an open question on how fast and by how much rates need to be cut to keep inflation declining while avoiding undue damage to the job market. Looking further ahead, Bostic has not yet decided on the pace and extent of cuts for 2025, and also said he does not want people focused on the view that there must be a cut at every meeting.\n\nISM MANUFACTURING PMI: The US ISM Manufacturing PMI rose to 48.4 from 46.5 and above the 47.5 consensus, although within the forecast range of 46.5 to 48.6. New orders returned to expansion, rising from 47.1 to 50.4 while production rose to 46.8 from 46.2. After the Hurricanes in October boosted the supplier deliveries index, that fell in November to 48.7 from 52.0, while inventories rose to 48.1 from 42.6. The components more related to Fed policy, prices and employment, both saw welcome prints with prices falling to 50.3 from 54.8, falling beneath the 52.8, a level that \"over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.\" Employment, meanwhile, rose to 48.1 from 44.4, but still beneath the 50.3 level, which \"over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment\". On the release, ING state that \"Election clarity probably saw some delayed orders getting pushed through, but the potential for tariffs and the associated risk of supply chain disruption and reciprocal tariffs placed on US exports means further gains will be limited until we have clarity\"\n\nFIXED INCOME\n\nT-NOTE (Z4) FUTURES SETTLED 2+ TICKS LOWER AT 111-03+\n\nT-Notes were choppy on Monday in the wake of fresh Trump tariff threats, a \"Goldilocks\" ISM Manufacturing PMI, French political instability and dovish commentary from Fed's Waller. At settlement, 2s +0.0bps at 4.174%, 3s +0.7bps at 4.119%, 5s +0.3bps at 4.080%, 7s -0.2bps at 4.129%, 10s -0.8bps at 4.186%, 20s -1.2bps at 4.457%, 30s -1.6bps at 4.359%\n\nINFLATION BREAKEVENS: 5yr BEI +0.3bps at 2.353%, 10yr BEI -0.8bps at 2.264%, 30yr BEI -1.3bps at 2.221%.\n\nTHE DAY: T-Notes were choppy on Monday in the wake of fresh Trump tariff threats, a \"Goldilocks\" ISM Manufacturing PMI, French political instability and commentary from Fed's Waller. Over the weekend, US President-elect Trump threatened 100% tariffs against the BRICS if they push to remove the USD as the world's reserve currency. T-Notes saw lows in the US morning of 110-22 before paring to highs of 111-09 with upside supported by the US ISM Manufacturing PMI, which beat on the headline while prices paid fell and employment rose, in what is being described as a \"Goldilocks\" report for the Fed. Fed's Waller spoke post-settlement but a slight dovish reaction was seen with the Governor stating he leans towards a rate cut in December but also kept options open noting he will let data decide the outcome which led to some marginal upside in T-Note futures but it failed to breach the earlier highs. Elsewhere, the focus was on political instability in France where a no-confidence vote has been filed against the French government after PM Barnier forced through the social security bill without the backing of parliament.\n\nSTIRS/OPERATIONS\n\nMarket Implied Fed Rate Cut Pricing: December 19bps (prev. 15bps), January 23bps (prev. 21bps), March 37bps (prev. 34bps).US sells USD 82bln in 3mth bills at 4.400%, covered 2.89x; sells USD 73bln in 6mth bills at 4.305%, covered 3.02xNY Fed RRP op demand at USD 136bln (prev. 198bln) across 56 counterparties (prev. 67)SOFR at 4.59% (prev. 4.57%), volumes at USD 2.209tln (prev. 2.136tln).EFFR at 4.58% (prev. 4.58%), volumes at USD 95bln (prev. 103bln)\n\nWTI (F5) SETTLED USD 0.10 HIGHER AT 68.10/BBL; BRENT (G5) SETTLED USD 0.01 LOWER AT 71.83/BBL\n\nThe crude complex was choppy but settled with marginal losses as the eventual Dollar strength outweighed strong Chinese data and geopolitical tensions. On the day, WTI and Brent saw strength overnight and through the European morning to hit highs of USD 69.11/bbl and 72.89/bbl, respectively, after Chinese Caixin Manufacturing PMI impressed coupled with the Lebanon ceasefire being breached by both sides but still holding in place, for now, as well as tensions flaring around Syria as opposition forces have taken control of much of Aleppo. The further tensions were exasperated in the US afternoon after Axios’ Ravid noted US officials are concerned the ceasefire could unravel. Nonetheless, and as alluded to, the crude complex saw notable weakness thereafter on account of the broad Buck bid due to a trifecta of reasons, such as President-elect Trump’s tariff threats, EUR weakness, and ISM Mfg. surpassing expectations. WTI and Brent settled just off lows of USD 67.71/bbl and 71.52/bbl, respectively, ahead of Chair Powell (Wed), OPEC (Thurs), and NFP (Fri) the key highlights this week.\n\nCLOSES: SPX +0.24% at 6,047, NDX +1.12% at 21,165, DJIA -0.29% at 44,782, RUT -0.02% at 2,434.\n\nSECTORS: Communication Services +1.45%, Consumer Discretionary +1.06%, Technology +1.03%, Consumer Staples -0.10%, Health -0.13%, Materials -0.20%, Industrials -0.66%, Energy -0.85%, Financials -0.90%, Real Estate -1.44%, Utilities -2.08%.\n\nEUROPEAN CLOSES: SMI +0.61% at 11,836, DAX +1.44% at 19,908, Euro Stoxx 50 +0.86% at 4,846, FTSE MIB +0.21% at 33,483, FTSE 100 +0.31% at 8,313, CAC 40 +0.02% at 7,237, AEX +0.67% at 888, IBEX 35 +0.81% at 11,735.\n\nSTOCK SPECIFICS:\n\nSuper Micro (SMCI): Special committee finds no evidence of misconduct.Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell GB200 architecture is reportedly facing delays due to technical issues.

Briefly recapping the bullish factors, was President-elect Trump’s tariff threats, whereby he demanded that BRICS nations commit to not creating a new currency to challenge the US dollar or they will face 100% tariffs. Data wise it saw ISM Mfg. surpass expectations, while mechanically it was supported by the notable EUR weakness, more below. Regarding the Fed, Bostic (2024 voter) said he is not going into December meeting with a sense that the outcome is preordained and coming data will be important and keeping options open, and he has no decided on pace and extent of 2025 cuts. Waller said he leans towards supporting a rate cut in December, absent of any data shocks, which saw a little bit of Dollar pressure and money markets price in a greater chance of a 25bps cut in Dec. Next up, attention is on Williams after-hours. The major events scheduled this week is Chair Powell on Wednesday followed by NFP on Friday. For the record, DXY saw a high of 106.73 against an earlier low of 106.02.\n\nThe vast majority of G10 FX saw losses vs. the Greenback with the safe-haven Yen, flat, the clear outperformer. Fresh macro drivers for Japan were lacking over the weekend, although focus remains on an expected imminent rate hike by the BoJ with money markets currently pricing in a 58% of a 25bps hike in December. USD/JPY hit a high of 150.74 against a later low of 149.09.\n\nCAD, NZD, AUD, GBP, CHF, and EUR all saw weakness to varying degrees, with performance in that order, with the last being the underperformer. EUR/USD hit a low of 1.0461 vs. a high of 1.0587, as the single-currency sank amid growing concerns about stagnant EZ growth and a possible government collapse in France – the far-right Marine Le Pen said her National Rally party would vote for all no-confidence votes after PM Barnier said he would try to ram a social security bill through parliament without a vote. Elsewhere, EZ manufacturing PMI’s were disappointing across the board in addition to a slew of ECB speak, with the most notable comments from known hawk Kazaks who had a dovish tilt.\n\nFor the others, the broad Dollar strength largely weighed absent of anything currency specific, and that is particularly true for the Antipodes in wake of stellar Australian and Chinese data overnight. For the Yuan, Caixin Manufacturing PMI rose much more than expected, while PBoC Governor said China will continue to maintain a supportive monetary policy stance and direction next year, adding they will strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments.\n\nEMFX was exclusively weaker, although the Rand saw strength in the European morning after South Africa responded to Donald Trump’s remarks noting that BRICS have no plans to create a new currency. On data, Brazilian Manufacturing PMI for November fell, while Chilean economy activity for October also underwhelmed.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/stocks-and-dollar-catch-bid-after-more-trump-tariff-threats-newsquawk-us-market-wrap","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-12/US-Market-Map.png?itok=6vOurGP9","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:48:31","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":269844424,"title":"Trump Warns Hamas Hell Pay If Hostages Arent Freed Inauguration","text":"It's no secret that President-elect Donald Trump is firmly in support of Israel, despite that after a year of Israeli war in Gaza the civilian death toll is in the multiple tens of thousands.

Israel has said that 251 Israelis and foreigners were taken on October 7, 2023.\n\nRecent analysis in The Washington Post tallied that 117 hostages have been freed or rescued, with the bulk of this figure having come as a result of the November 2023 short-lived truce deal.\n\nIsrael's military and intelligence believes that a total of 63 hostages remain alive.

Efforts at achieving a new truce completely fell apart within the last weeks, and Israel appears bent on pursuing a military solution.\n\nGiven the situation is now essentially a 'fight to the death' scenario, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are unlikely to care much about Trump's threat.

In contrast, 60 percent of Americans, one of the highest numbers on record, now hold unfavorable views of Mexico, perhaps because of the cynical harm it has done through a perforated border.\n\nMexico says its emigrants, along with those from Central and South America who cross its own borders with relative ease—often with tacit support—supply America with generations of industrious, low-cost labor, robbing it, in a sense, of millions of its own citizens.\n\nIt adds that the attractions of El Norte mean that Mexico must put up with human caravans crossing its own sovereign territory to supposedly meet the hungry American demand for labor, drugs, and sex. Indeed, nearly every recent Mexican president has argued that America’s thirst for lethal fentanyl is responsible for the creation of Mexican cartel lords that now run large swaths of Mexico itself.\n\nHowever, the problem with such ancient and modern disingenuousness is that even if the United States accepted these excuses, apologized, and promised to close the border and keep clear of Mexican affairs, Mexico would grow even more irate. The reason why is that the current relationship has now grown unbalanced to the point of absurdity—sometimes evidenced in past polls that revealed a majority of Mexican citizens both believed in the mutually exclusive propositions that the American Southwest properly still belongs to Mexico and yet they wished to leave Mexico to emigrate to a non-Mexican northward if given the chance.\n\nIn truth, Mexico would face insolvency if it did not receive its current some $63 billion in U.S. remittances, largely sent by its own people who crossed into the U.S. illegally. Trump talks of levying a 25 percent tariff on Mexican imports should Mexico not cease undermining the American border. An additional lever would perhaps be to slap a 30 percent tax on all remittances sent from the U.S. to Mexico. That would both encourage capital to stay in the U.S. and raise over $20 billion in excise fees, more than enough proverbially to “pay for the wall.”\n\nHowever, such largess is still more one-sided since much of the remittances are made available through not just the industriousness of Mexican expatriates but also the generosity of American taxpayers. Their multifaceted subsidies to the undocumented free up billions for them to help support millions of Mexico’s poor in a fashion that Mexico City apparently is either unable or unwilling to ensure.\n\nThe annual flight of millions from Mexico is a sort of updated version of Frederick Jackson Turner’s “frontier safety valve theory” of the American West. Accordingly, the Eastern poor and potentially rebellious fled westward in hopes of a new, better life rather than marching on Washington for cancellation of debts or redistribution of property. Mexico City apparently feels that without their own El Norte “frontier,” millions of southern and indigenous Mexican citizens might instead head en masse to Mexico City.\n\nAs for the cartels, Mexico knows well that China sends raw fentanyl to its country unimpeded, where cartel factories prepare it for export to America’s addicted and recreational users. There, disguised as less toxic drugs and even foodstuffs, fentanyl will end up killing up to some 100,000 Americans a year—an annual death toll nearly double the total number of U.S. fatalities in the Vietnam War.\n\nMexico, which also helps China avoid tariffs on its exports to the U.S. by assembling its products in NAFTA and tariff-free Mexico, certainly knows that the Chinese seek both to profit from its cartel ties and to kill Americans and undermine its security in the bargain. \n\nThe macabre gambit is likely seen as the Chinese version of an updated Opium War payback, with the twist that the former addicts are now the suppliers.\n\nIn an equally sick way, the cartels infuse into the Mexican trickle-down economy, albeit in nefarious and criminal ways, some $30 billion in additional U.S. dollars from Americans addicted to imported Mexican-made drugs tailored for the U.S. market. The presidents of Mexico usually say little about this second source of billions in U.S. foreign exchange or claim American addicts, not Mexican suppliers, explain the growing death and destruction on both sides of the border.\n\nWhile in office, former President Obrador often said strange things. Two of the most pugnacious were his high-five boast that some 40 million of his own citizens had fled Mexico to cross the border: “Just imagine. There are 40 million Mexicans in the United States—40 million who were born here in Mexico, who are the children of people who were born in Mexico.” (Obrador never explained why his own citizens would willingly flee their own country to a nation habitually caricatured in the Mexican press as racist and exploitive.)\n\nObrador also periodically delighted in interfering in US elections by urging Mexican expatriates in the U.S. to vote against all Republicans, presumably because they seemed at times to threaten to kill the Mexican golden goose of illegal immigration.\n\nIndeed, in 2023, Obrador urged American Hispanics to never vote for Ron DeSantis’s presidential primary campaign—an irony given Mexico’s chronic complaint of Yanqui interference in Latin American politics.\n\nObrador believed, as many presidents before him no doubt concurred, that the 40 million expatriates and Mexican-American children, if they were distant from Mexico long enough, would romanticize the country, and so, like most immigrants, become a powerful lobbying force on Mexico’s behalf.\n\nIn La Raza literature of the past, and in Mexico’s chauvinistic moments, illegal immigration was envisioned as the ironic response to the ancient “theft’ of the American Southwest. The problem with that thesis is that most Mexicans, as polls have shown, would prefer to live in an American Southwest than a Mexican south.\n\nAnd it is also increasingly likely that Mexican-Americans will be more prone to vote for border security than open borders—again further proof that their self-interest as patriotic Americans trumps Mexico’s cynical attempts to use them as political pawns. If those trends continue, the American Left and the Mexican government may well lobby for a secure border, in fear they are only augmenting a growing MAGA constituency.\n\nIn sum, Mexico understands the myriad ways that an open border, the destruction of U.S. immigration law, illegal immigration, and emigration of millions of its own citizens to America are entirely in its own interests and so hopes to see the continuation of the Biden-Harris-Mayorkas appeasement.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/yes-mexico-knows-exactly-what-it-doing","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-12/2024-12-02_09-32-03.jpg?itok=5HBCrG9r","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:48:31","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":269844398,"title":"Cartels Demand Higher Border Crossing Fees After Trump Victory","text":"Drug cartels and other human trafficking groups have begun demanding higher fees for illegals seeking to be smuggled across the border in the aftermath of President-elect Donald Trump’s comeback victory.\n\nAs Breitbart reports, illegals at an alleged “charity” shelter in Sonora, Mexico told a Mexican newspaper that the smuggling fee has doubled in recent weeks, with Trump’s victory and impending return to office being given as a major reason.\n\nThe previous fees of $5,000 have risen to at least $10,000, as illegals from all around the world, including Africa, Asia, and Central America, try desperately to sneak into the country before Trump returns to office.\n\nThe smugglers have also increased their fees for additional services, such as using vehicles to cross private property, with these fees increasing from $15,000 to $20,000.\n\nFees have also risen dramatically for certain illegals based on how far they have traveled to try to enter the United States illegally. \n\nChinese illegals are paying as much as $55,000 per person to attempt being smuggled into the U.S.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, at least 24,000 illegals from China were apprehended trying to cross the southern border.\n\nOther illegals paying increased fees include illegals from Africa and the Middle East, due to their designation as\n\nPresident-elect Trump once again campaigned heavily on the issue of immigration, vowing to finish building the border wall that he started constructing in his first term, and to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in American history.\n\nHe has announced former Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Tom Homan as his new Border Czar, with Homan repeatedly vowing to do whatever is necessary to deport as many illegals as possible.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/cartels-demand-higher-border-crossing-fees-after-trump-victory","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-12/GettyImages-1710097602-1-scaled.jpg?itok=3FqWEEPQ","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:48:31","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.043},{"id":269848660,"title":"Broad Pardon for Hunter Biden Troubles Experts","text":"President Biden’s pardon for his son not only allowed him to escape consequences from his current convictions, but likely for any crimes he might have committed in the past 11 years.\n\nThat sweeping amnesty is raising awkward historical comparisons and sharp questions about the use of presidential clemency.\n\nIt also has inflamed a debate about who deserves mercy and for what, while underscoring the Biden family’s concerns about Hunter Biden’s vulnerability to prosecution related to his foreign business activities.

The publication, written by playwright Sarah Bernstein, attributes Trump’s popularity with young men to resentment over women outpacing men in education and employment — a trend tied to cultural expectations rooted in age-old fairy tales.The ‘Cinderella effect’Bernstein points to the popular Disney princess Cinderella as a prime example of traditional narratives shaping societal expectations. In the story, Cinderella’s life improves by marrying a wealthy prince, reflecting the historical belief that a woman’s status depended on finding a successful husband. Meanwhile, the prince is valued solely for his wealth and position, reinforcing the idea that men are defined by their ability to provide and women by their ability to secure a provider.As women have advanced in education and careers, these old expectations have caused tension. Since the 1980s, women have steadily outperformed men in college enrolment and graduation. By 2022, only 42% of students in four-year colleges were men.Bernstein says this shift has left many men feeling left out, leading to the rise of the “manosphere” — an online space where podcasters and influencers promote traditional masculinity.Trump and the 'manosphere'Bernstein connects Trump’s popularity with young men to the manosphere, which she says links masculinity to financial success and supports the outdated idea of men as sole providers.“While so-called female gold diggers are an obsession of the manosphere, much of its content reinforces the male-breadwinner norm — tying money to manliness and women’s preference for providers to biology,” she wrote.Ahead of the election, Trump appeared on popular podcasts like The Joe Rogan Experience and Full Send Podcast, making direct appeals to young male voters. His efforts contrasted with Kamala Harris’s podcast appearances on shows like Call Her Daddy and Club Shay Shay. However, Harris’s team failed to secure an invitation to Rogan’s podcast, a platform widely regarded as influential among young men.Changing youth voteThe election saw a noticeable shift in the youth vote. While Democrats have historically relied on at least 60% of younger voters, early exit polls showed Harris capturing just 54% of this demographic, according to NPR.Bernstein suggests that the division between men and women in both work and relationships is worsening societal issues like loneliness and declining birth rates. “Now that women are pulling ahead, the fairy tale has become increasingly unattainable,” she wrote.In her closing argument, Bernstein urged society to challenge traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity for mutual benefit. “If we are willing to reject the manosphere’s narrow ideas of masculinity, we will find that it is possible for both men and women to thrive at the same time — in work and in love. This future is ours to create. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s a fairy tale.”","summary":"Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 US presidential election is attributed to his appeal to young men frustrated by women surpassing them in education and employment.

Lai's trip is seen as a strategic move to link the first, second, and third island chains, according to Sun Tzu-yun, a research fellow at the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, the Taipei Times reported. Taiwan lies on the first island chain, with Guam and Palau along the second, and Hawaii on the third. Su emphasized the strategic importance of these islands in countering China's expansion, particularly its BRI. \n\nThe first island chain is regarded as a critical line of defense against Chinese expansion and a vital maritime route for fuel, with Taiwan at its core, the Taipei Times reported. Su noted that China's infrastructure projects in the Solomon Islands, Peru, and Kiribati--such as deep-water ports and a space tracking station--underscore the importance of fortifying the second island chain to defend the first. These efforts align with the strategic interests of the US and its allies, the report added. Open-source data revealed the deployment of several US carrier strike groups, including the George Washington CSG in Yokosuka, Japan; the Abraham Lincoln CSG in Port Klang, Malaysia; and the USS Carl Vinson in the East Pacific. When asked if these deployments were connected to Lai's trip, Chieh Chung, a research fellow at the Association of Strategic Foresight, stated that they were likely intended to deter China but were not specifically tied to Lai's itinerary. Experts suggest that Lai's transit through the US could provoke Beijing into conducting large-scale military exercises near Taiwan to establish a response framework for US President-elect Donald Trump regarding Taiwan, according to the Taipei Times. However, such actions might backfire by provoking Trump, the academic noted. The three island chains are of considerable strategic importance. The first island chain includes the Aleutian Islands, Japan, South Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the Greater Sunda Islands. The second island chain spans the Izu, Bonin, Mariana, and Caroline Islands, Guam, Palau, and Halmahera Island. The third island chain includes Alaska, Hawaii, US-governed Pacific Islands, Australia, and New Zealand.

(Winston) Churchill did not choose.\n\n“The national interest demands that we work with both.”\n\nThe Prime Minister added: “That’s why, when President Trump graciously hosted me for dinner in Trump Tower, I told him that we will invest more deeply than ever in this transatlantic bond with our American friends in the years to come.”\n\nHe also repeated his commitment to “rebuild our ties with Europe” and insisted he was right to try to build closer links with China.\n\n“It is remarkable that until I met President Xi last month there had been no face-to-face meeting between British and Chinese leaders for six years,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Trump has meanwhile named investment banker Warren Stephens as his pick for the USA’s next ambassador to the United Kingdom although the appointment still needs to be confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nThe billionaire and Republican donor will act as top diplomat to one of “America’s most cherished and beloved allies”, Mr Trump said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also insisted the UK will back Ukraine “for as long as it takes” as he made a speech at London’s Guildhall, but for the first time acknowledged the conflict could move towards a negotiated end.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has in recent weeks suggested he is open to a possible ceasefire with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n\nThe Prime Minister said there is “no question it is right we support Ukraine”, as the UK’s aid to Kyiv is “deeply in our self-interest”.\n\nAllowing Russia to win the war would mean “other autocrats would believe they can follow Putin’s example,” he warned.\n\nSir Keir added: “So we must continue to back Ukraine and do what it takes to support their self-defence for as long as it takes.\n\n“To put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for negotiations so they can secure a just and lasting peace on their terms that guarantees their security, independence, and right to choose their own future.”\n\nMr Zelensky told Sky News over the weekend he would be open to speaking with Mr Putin, but branded the Russian president a “terrorist”.\n\nHe also suggested that Ukrainian territory under his control should be taken under the “Nato umbrella” to try to stop the “hot stage” of the war with Russia.","summary":"The Prime Minister’s speech came as Donald Trump announced Warren Stephens as his pick for the USA’s next ambassador to the United Kingdom.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-donald-trump-churchill-united-kingdom-prime-minister-b1197716.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/12/03/00/0ebb50fe67e2a4b54ae460bb81963c4eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzMzMjcwNTM2-2.78369812.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:44:20","author":"David Lynch","authors":["David Lynch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":269843116,"title":"Woody Johnson won’t head to UK, but Jets owner could get another Trump appointment","text":"It appears that Jets owner Woody Johnson will not be returning to England.\n\nThere had been speculation that Johnson might be appointed the Ambassador to the United Kingdom again by President-elect Donald Trump. \n\nJohnson served in that role during Trump’s first term as president.

Two South Korean firms -- Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix -- and Micron Technology lead the global HBM market.\n\nThe package comes as President Joe Biden is set to leave office on Jan. 20 with President-elect Donald Trump expected to adopt a tough policy stance on China. It is in line with Washington's efforts to limit China's access to key technologies on national security grounds.\n\n\"This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration's targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair the PRC's ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies that pose a risk to our national security,\" Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said. PRC stands for China's official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\nFor the latest package, the BIS applied Foreign Direct Product Rules, under which a product, produced in a foreign country, is also subject to restrictions if it is made using US technology, software or tools.\n\nThe HBM curbs -- with a compliance date of Dec. 31 -- target chips with a memory bandwidth density greater than 2 gigabytes per second per square millimeter, according to the BIS.\n\nThe curbs could affect Samsung as it ships some of its HBM products to China, while little immediate impact is expected for SK hynix given that the company exports all of its HBM products to the United States, according to industry observers.\n\nThe BIS stressed the importance of curbs on HBM commodities for AI applications that it said can enable advanced military and intelligence applications, lower the barriers to entry for non-experts to develop weapons of mass destruction, support offensive cyber operations and assist in using mass surveillance to commit human rights abuses.\n\nThe Commerce Department also announced new controls on 24 types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) and three types of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors as well as the addition of 140 entities -- linked to China's military modernization -- to its \"Entity List.\"\n\nThe department established new Foreign Direct Product controls for certain SME items that originate in foreign countries, but are produced with US technology, software or tools -- a move that could affect Korean-made chipmaking equipment exports.\n\nJapan, the Netherlands and 31 other countries, which implement export controls equivalent to those of the US, are excluded from certain SME license requirements for exports, but South Korea is not among those countries.\n\nOf the 140 entities added to the export control list, two are Korea-based companies -- ACM Research Korea Co. and Empyrean Korea.\n\nChina's foreign ministry vowed to take \"resolute measures\" in response to the fresh export curbs.\n\n\"We have repeatedly made clear our position on this issue.

The three-day trip to Angola, many analysts say, represents a final, desperate attempt to fulfil a promise Biden made long ago, and counter China’s expanding influence on the continent.\n\nThe anticipated visit, which was pushed back from October due to Hurricane Milton, will see Biden visit the Lobito Port, which is at the heart of US trade relations with Angola. There, he will assess an ongoing critical minerals infrastructure project that is set to see vast supplies of cobalt and copper delivered to the West.\n\nHere’s what to know about Biden’s Africa visit and why Lobito is important:\n\nWhy has President Biden not visited Africa?\n\nAnalysts say Biden’s failure to visit any African country – except Egypt for COP27 in November 2022 – until now shows that his administration has not prioritised the continent.\n\nBiden first promised to visit Africa in December 2022, two years into his presidency – which some note was already too late.\n\nHe made the promise at a US-Africa leaders summit in Washington, where 49 African leaders gathered. The US “is all in on Africa and all in with Africa”, Biden declared at the time. He also announced a support package of $55bn to the African Union.\n\nThe Biden administration has hosted several African leaders in the White House, but the promised visit never materialised – until now.\n\n“Presidential trips to Africa are rare enough that they always matter,” Cameron Hudson, a senior Africa analyst at the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This one would matter less coming as it does at the very end of a lame-duck presidency. Ironically, [an Africa trip] probably matters more to Biden, who is searching to establish a legacy in Africa…than for Africa, which is already preparing for his successor,” Hudson added.\n\nAfrica’s significant natural resources, rapidly growing population of 1.3 billion, and sizeable voting power in the United Nations – with 54 country votes – make the continent an increasingly important strategic player.\n\nHow has Biden approached ties with Africa so far?\n\nUS influence on the continent has been waning for years, even as China and Russia have strengthened their presence in several countries.\n\nChina has since 2013 overtaken the US to become Africa’s largest trade partner. This year, the US lost a major spy base in the West African nation of Niger, and its army got kicked out of Chad. That has left it struggling to find a military foothold in the Sahel region which has become a hotspot of violence by a range of armed groups.\n\nIn 2022, the White House released an ambitious Africa strategy document that shifted from the first Trump administration’s focus on trade relations.\n\nRather, the document promised, the US would push for Africa to have leadership roles at international platforms, including permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council and membership of the G20. Analysts lauded the approach as “modern” and “ambitious” at the time but enthusiasm for it quickly faded as little action followed.\n\nSeveral top officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have visited African countries at various times.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden found time to travel elsewhere. He has visited the United Kingdom alone five times, apart from numerous other visits to Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.\n\nIn contrast, President Xi Jinping of China and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin have visited African countries at least twice as heads of state.\n\nWhy is Biden visiting now, and why Angola?\n\nThe visit to Luanda will see Biden focus on an $800m US-backed railway project in the Lobito Corridor. The passage is a strategic trade route that connects the resource-rich Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia to Angola, which hosts the port of Lobito, located on the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nFunded largely by the US and the European Union, the Lobito Atlantic Railway project will see an existing rail network in the Lobito Corridor upgraded. That would allow for the faster export of cobalt and copper, amongst other minerals, mined from the DRC’s Kolwezi mining town, to the West.\n\nThe DRC is one of the world’s largest producers of copper and cobalt. The minerals are key components of batteries that power electric vehicles, which the US and EU are eager to develop more of as demand for clean energy supply chains grows.\n\nWashington has provided a $550m loan to start the project. The African Development Bank and the Africa Finance Corporation are also involved.\n\nThe rail line is about 1300km (800 miles) long and will likely see extensions into mineral-rich regions in Zambia. Portuguese company Trafigura is leading a three-company consortium that will operate the railway for 30 years under a concession agreement. In August, the company said it shipped the first container of minerals to the US via the Lobito Port.\n\nAnalysts say the US faces challenges in the corridor. China has eyes on the region, too, and has already locked in much of the minerals that would theoretically be sold to Western countries within its huge Belt and Road Initiative, notes researcher Wala Chabala in a paper for the Berlin-based think tank, Africa Policy Research Institute.\n\n“Not only are the Chinese ubiquitously present on the African continent, but China is already far ahead in building supply chains for cobalt, lithium and several other essential metals and minerals,” Chabala wrote.\n\nIn September, China’s state engineering corporation signed a concession agreement to operate the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), another railway line in the corridor that links central Zambia to the port of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania.\n\nWhat does Biden’s visit mean for Angola?\n\nUS officials say the visit is meant to highlight the close ties between Angola and the US.\n\nAt present, Luanda is also playing a lead role in mediating a spat between the DRC and Rwanda, concerning ongoing violence in eastern Congo.\n\nAngola was, until a few years ago, a heavy borrower from China. It has also been historically close to Russia: During Angola’s 27-year civil war, the US and the former Soviet Union backed rival sides, leading to cold ties between Luanda and Washington.\n\nHowever, the government of President Joao Lourenco, which has been in place since 2017, has favoured stronger ties with Washington. The two countries have deepened trade relations and by 2023, US-Angola trade totalled approximately $1.77bn. Angola is the US’s fourth-largest trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn 2021, and more recently, in November 2023, Biden hosted President Lourenco at the White House.\n\nHowever, analysts say Washington’s view of Lourenco’s government ignores alleged human rights violations under his watch. Lourenco is unpopular amongst many Angolans due to high living costs, corruption, and mounting crackdowns on dissent. In June, authorities opened fire on protesters angry at inflation, killing eight people in the central Huambo province. Several others were arrested in cities across the country.\n\nAnalysts say Biden’s refusal to acknowledge those concerns over alleged rights abuses is a stain on his legacy.\n\n“Many observers believe that Biden’s visit may inadvertently embolden an unpopular president,” said Florindo Chivucute, director of Friends of Angola, a group advocating for stronger democratic values in Angola and based in Luanda and Washington, DC.\n\n“While the US lags behind China in terms of trade and political influence in Angola, it should not compromise its core values of democracy and human rights in an attempt to catch up,” he said.\n\nWhat’s next for US-Africa ties?\n\nWhile President Biden has finally fulfilled his promise to visit Africa, his administration hasn’t been able to accomplish some of the other goals it set for itself.\n\nThe African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20 in September 2023. However, no African country is still a permanent member of the UNSC.\n\nIn September 2024, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced that her country would support two permanent UNSC seats for Africa. However, she warned that those seats would not have veto power, a position that many analysts criticised because it would set up a two-tier system – one for UNSC members with vetoes, and the second for those without that power.\n\nA Trump presidency, meanwhile, is likely to focus only on trade relations, as it did the first time, experts say.\n\nThe incoming administration will likely want to compete with Chinese and Russian influence, and land access to critical minerals, Tibor Nagy, a top envoy to Africa under the last Trump administration, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThere, at least, projects like the Lobito Railway could see sustained US investment. “This checks both boxes,” Nagy said, referring to the railway project.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/biden-in-angola-whats-behind-the-last-ditch-africa-trip/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AFP__20241001__36HH7Q2__v1__HighRes__SkoreaMilitaryAnniversary-1730696517-iNvv9f.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:40:30","author":"Us President Joe","authors":["Us President Joe"],"language":"en","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":269842780,"title":"Joe Biden Pardons Son Hunter What It Means And Why It Matters","text":"US President Joe Biden has pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases related to tax evasion and the purchase of a firearm.\n\nHere is what we know about the case and the pardon:\n\nWho is Hunter Biden and what are the charges against him?\n\nHunter Biden is Joe Biden’s 54-year-old middle child. He is also his only surviving son and the first child of a sitting US president to face criminal trial.\n\nIn a 2021 memoir, Hunter admitted to crack cocaine use and alcoholism, although he said he received treatment and recovered from his addictions.\n\nHunter faced the possibility of years in federal prison due to multiple charges related to gun possession and tax fraud.\n\nIn June, he was convicted by a jury for illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while being a drug user. Hunter had the .38 calibre Colt Cobra Special for approximately 11 days and never fired it, according to his lawyers.\n\nMonths later, in September, he pleaded guilty to charges of a scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4m in taxes.\n\nFor the tax case, he faced up to 17 years in prison, and the gun charges were punishable by up to 25 years. Still, Hunter was expected to receive a shorter sentence, and it was possible he could have avoided prison time entirely.\n\nHunter Biden was supposed to be sentenced on December 12 on the gun-related charges in Delaware and on December 16 on the tax charges in California.\n\nBut didn’t Joe Biden say he wouldn’t pardon Hunter?\n\nIn June, Biden ruled out a pardon or commutation for his son. “I abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him,” Biden said as his son was facing trial in the Delaware gun case.\n\nSeparately, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at least seven times – over more than a year – that Biden would not pardon his son.\n\nAs Biden faced off against former President Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election, he tried to draw a distinction with the realtor-turned-politician – who has been charged in multiple cases.\n\n“No one is above the law,” he wrote on X in early July, in seeming protest against the US Supreme Court verdict granting broad immunity to Trump for any legal violations he committed while president.\n\nSo how did Biden justify the change in his stance?\n\nIn a statement by the White House on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to grant executive clemency to his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nBiden explained that this decision was made in response to what he described as a politically motivated attack orchestrated by his opponents, to damage his reputation.\n\n“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said in the statement.\n\n“No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son – and that is wrong.”\n\nBiden also emphasised, “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice. … I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.”\n\nHow did Hunter react?\n\nHunter said in a statement he would never take the reprieve “for granted”.\n\n“I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport,” he said in a statement.\n\n“I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering.”\n\nWhat does a pardon do?\n\nThe US Constitution says a president has the power to grant clemency, which includes pardons, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.\n\nA pardon absolves individuals of federal criminal offences and restores all civil liberties and rights, while a commutation lessens penalties without completely removing them. An amnesty is the same as a pardon but it’s extended to a group of individuals.\n\nThis power originates from English law, where the king could show mercy to anyone, and it later travelled across the Atlantic Ocean to the American colonies. US presidents often use this authority.\n\nHow common is it for presidents to pardon family members?\n\nIt’s not uncommon for US presidents to use this power to pardon or commute the sentence of a family member.\n\nIn his final weeks in office in 2021, Donald Trump issued about 100 pardons and commutations. Among the people he pardoned were Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nIn 2005, Kushner was sentenced to two years for tax evasion, illegal campaign donations, and witness tampering. Fast forward to 2024, and Charles Kushner has just been nominated by Trump to serve as US ambassador to France in the incoming administration.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, before the end of his second term, pardoned his half-brother Roger. In 1985, Roger Clinton Jr. was convicted on a cocaine-related charge and sentenced to more than a year in prison after admitting guilt to conspiracy to distribute.\n\nAccording to analysts, this pardon could undermine the credibility of the US democratic system – and the notion that the law is indeed the same for everyone.\n\n“Now that an election is over and Joe Biden has no more races to run, I think that what we’re seeing now is a father who is steadfastly looking out for his son,” Eric Ham, a US political analyst, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I do believe that this will be a lingering question that many people will focus on, and I suspect that now there will be more eyes on any pardons that Joe Biden provides as he heads out the door. But also, I think it raises a much larger question of where the US stands now as a nation of laws,” he added.\n\nExperts also suggest that this also places the US in a challenging position in its global role.\n\n“It’s going to be very difficult for the US … as it tries to hammer other nations, including China, Russia, and North Korea,” Ham said.\n\n“I think it blurs the lines, and I think it makes it difficult for the US to make those arguments. When you look at successive moves being made by Biden and Donald Trump, who ran on pardoning January 6th insurrectionists, I think the argument for the US becomes harder as the nation moves forward,” he explained.\n\n“The law seems to only work for or doesn’t work for certain people,” Ham added.\n\nIs this similar to what Trump has said or done before?\n\nBoth Biden and Trump have alleged that the Department of Justice has been influenced by politics.\n\nBiden argued that the case was used to attack him and oppose his election. Trump has also argued that the justice system has been weaponised against him and he is a victim of prosecution.\n\nAfter Biden announced the pardon for Hunter, Trump called the move an abuse of justice.\n\n“Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?” Trump said in a social media post. He was referring to the rioters who were accused of attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\n“Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” he added.\n\nTrump’s supporters stormed the Capitol after he delivered a fiery speech urging the crowd to “fight like hell”, in a bid to stop Congress from certifying results of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden.\n\nHow have others reacted?\n\nRepublican Iowa Senator Charles E Grassley said on social media that he was “shocked” that the president had pardoned his son because “he said many many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me.”\n\nSeparately, Greg Stanton, Democrat representative of Arizona, posted on X: “I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically-motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies, and was convicted by a jury of his peers.”\n\n“Joe Biden is a liar and a hypocrite, all the way to the end,” Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican congresswoman from Georgia, said.\n\nBut others welcomed Biden’s decision, arguing that Hunter had been unfairly treated. Former US Attorney General Eric Holder posted on X that the pardon was “warranted”.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/joe-biden-pardons-son-hunter-what-it-means-and-why-it-matters/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AP24316735310621-1731406209-GZoc3y.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:40:30","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":269846176,"title":"Trump Names Businessman Warren Stephens for US Ambassador to UK","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Warren Stephens, a prominent investment banker and philanthropist, to be America’s next ambassador to the United Kingdom, pending Senate confirmation.\n\nStephens, 67, serves as the chairman, president, and CEO of Stephens Inc., a privately held financial services firm based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Under his leadership, the firm expanded into major U.S. markets and established European offices in London and Frankfurt, making it a global player in financial services.\n\nThe UK is a key ally of the United States, with a longstanding “special relationship” rooted in shared history, cultural ties, and cooperation on global security, trade, and diplomacy. This partnership has been critical on issues ranging from NATO operations to global economic stability, with both nations frequently aligning on international policies and initiatives.\n\nStephens’s appointment comes at a time of increased uncertainty on the trade front.

Biden, a Democrat whose term ends on January 20 when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office, signed an unconditional pardon for Hunter Biden on Sunday and said he believed his son had been selectively prosecuted and targeted unfairly by the president&apos;s political opponents. Biden had previously said he would not pardon his son, including to ABC News in June when he was asked if he would rule out a pardon, and replied \"Yes\". His surprise move was panned by his Republican political opposition, but also by Democrats who say it threatens to undermine public trust in the rule of law, a concept Biden and his party had used to criticise Trump. Hunter was prosecuted for tax offences and gun charges, after being targeted for years by Republicans in Congress who accused him of making business deals using his father&apos;s name but failed to establish any clear connections. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday defended the president&apos;s action and said Biden believed Hunter faced further grief from his adversaries without naming them, and suggested it could continue even after the president left office. Jean-Pierre was among the White House officials who had repeatedly said in the past Biden would not pardon his son. \"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because they didn&apos;t seem like his political opponents would let go of it. It didn&apos;t seem like they would move on,\" she told reporters on Air Force One during a trip to Angola. \"They would continue to go after his son. That&apos;s what he believed.\" Jean-Pierre stressed this was not the first time a president had pardoned a family member. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother Roger before he left office, and Trump his daughter&apos;s father-in-law, Charles Kushner. She said Biden believed in the Department of Justice despite his statement that his son&apos;s process in the judicial system was \"infected with politics\". \"Two things could be true: the president does believe in the justice ... system and ... Department of Justice, and he also believes that his son was singled out politically,\" she said. She declined to give further details on why or how Biden had changed his mind, or whether the recent election that put Republicans in charge of the White House and both branches of Congress played a role. Republicans have accused Biden of corruption, while Democratic lawmakers have been split, with some suggesting he put family over country, and others pointing to Trump&apos;s nominees for judiciary positions as a rationale. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty in September to federal tax charges in federal court in Los Angeles and was due to be sentenced on December 16. A jury found him guilty in June of making false statements on a gun background check; he was due to be sentenced for those charges this month as well. Biden on Sunday said his son had been selectively prosecuted and treated differently than others with similar situations. \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter&apos;s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son - and that is wrong,\" he said. Late on Sunday, Hunter Biden&apos;s lawyer filed to dismiss the indictments against him.

In January, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery blocked the stock compensation package – which would see Mr Musk paid the enormous sum across a 10-year period – after the performance-based award had been approved by Tesla shareholders in 2018. When it was originally approved by Tesla&apos;s shareholders, the company&apos;s shares were worth less than US$25 (A$38). They&apos;re now worth more than US$350 (A$541) each, and the carmaker is the largest EV manufacturer in the world. 100s of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now. Tesla and Mr Musk started a campaign in April to once again ask shareholders to vote for his proposed compensation package, which was approved in June – alongside proposals to declassify the Tesla board and introduce a simple majority voting system for company decision making. However, Bloomberg Lawreports Chancellor McCormick overnight ruled Mr Musk isn&apos;t entitled to the pay package, while also ordering Tesla to pay its attorneys US$345 million (A$532.8 million) in either cash or the company&apos;s stocks. \"There were undoubtedly a range of healthy amounts that the board could have decided to pay Musk,\" Chancellor McCormick said, according to the publication. Mr Musk now has 30 days to file an appeal, though the decision could have larger ramifications for Tesla. Some large US corporations such as Tesla and Facebook are incorporated in Delaware due to its lax taxation approach towards companies which don&apos;t do business in the state. In April, Tesla chairperson Robyn Denholm called for the company&apos;s shareholders to vote in favour of a proposed move to incorporate the company in Texas – which would be aligned with its new headquarters in Austin. \"2024 is the year that Tesla should move home to Texas,\" Ms Denholm said in a letter submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \"We have a significant number of manufacturing, operations, and engineering employees in Texas, and our executives are based there. \"Texas is where we should continue working towards our mission of accelerating the world&apos;s transition to sustainable energy, as we lay the foundation for our growth with our ramp and build of factories for our future vehicles and to help meet the demand for energy storage as well as with our progress in artificial intelligence via full self-driving and Optimus. \"We have received letters from thousands of Tesla stockholders – large and small – supporting a move home to Texas. We have heard you, and now we formally ask that you speak in a meaningful way: and vote in favour of taking Tesla to our business home of Texas.\" Mr Musk&apos;s future at Tesla has also previously been questioned, especially on the back of the proposed compensation deal. The outspoken executive has been appointed by US President-elect Donald Trump to co-lead the new \"Department of Government Efficiency\", however details of his role have yet to be formally announced.

But, when a big old guy starts to move fast and break things, chances are you will get an unholy mess. Donald Trump has started superfast, appointing his senior advisors and making announcements, the first of which was that on Day 1, he will implement tariffs of 25% on all imports from Mexico and Canada (unless they act to prevent immigrants coming to their borders), and an additional 10% on all imports from China (over and above the significant tariffs already in place). China, recognising that its huge trade surplus with the US is like a red rag to the Make America Great Again (MAGA) bull, has already responded by reducing the value added tax rebate it was providing to exporters on aluminium and copper products. This has immediately led to a sharp rise in prices of these metals on the London Metal Exchange. In a natural dance, the local producers of these products in India at least (and I would suspect elsewhere) have immediately pushed up domestic prices. The unsurprising conclusion is that even discussion, let alone imposition, of tariffs directly increases prices. Another immediate knee-jerk effect is the weakening of the currencies of Trump’s targets — the euro has fallen by 1.5% since his election, as has the Chinese yuan. With China clearly the major MAGA target, global banks are expecting further sharp falls in the yuan over the next few months. While this may provide some comfort to manufacturers in these countries, there is a limit on how low they can go, particularly since currency weakness would certainly reignite — and, in some cases, sustain — inflation. However, the biggest issue with Trump’s approach is that it will do precious little to bring support to the forgotten Americans, who I believe he genuinely wants to help as an essential part of his MAGA push. Let us say that as a result of the tariffs on automobile imports from Mexico, Ford (for instance) decides to close down a plant (or plants) there and open them back in the US, paying the higher US wages. Let us also say that these higher costs could be absorbed if the domestic prices rose to at least the tariff-adjusted level. This would generate jobs, to be sure — a key priority — but also create more than a whiff of inflation. That is unless Trump is willing — and able — to put pressure on the companies to squeeze their margins to square the circle. Lower margins could tank the stock market, which is certainly flying on a lot of gas, unless, of course, he also cuts corporate taxes, as he plans to. But this would continue to widen the deficit, again pushing up inflation. It looks like whichever way you turn, inflation is going up in the US, and the Fed will probably have to stop dead in its tracks in its monetary easing and may well have to raise rates sometime in 2025. Boom, boom, splat! to the stock market and uppity, up, up! to the dollar. The market will get you every time, even if you are Donald Trump. The impact of all this on India is that it is exposing the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) flawed approach to managing the rupee. Growth is sharply down — 5.4% in Q3 as compared to 6.7% in Q2, well below the expectations of 6.5% and the lowest in seven quarters; inflation, at 6.21% in October, is the highest in a year, up from 5.49% the previous month, and well above forecasts of 5.81%; and, most relevant in this context, the foreign currency reserves are collapsing. The RBI’s foreign currency assets (FCA) were reported at $567 billion as of November 22; if you add the $70 billion the RBI is short in the forward and non-deliverable forward markets, the FCA are lower than $500 billion. The last time they were this low was two years ago (November 2022), when the FCA were $487 billion and forward holdings were a long $8 billion. (Note these numbers are for foreign currency assets, not total reserves which include gold and special drawing rights.) Again, with the rupee falling less than other currencies, particularly the yuan, and the likelihood that Chinese dumping is bound to accelerate as China struggles to find buyers with the US getting progressively more closed to it, Indian business could suffer a double whammy — reduced domestic sales and less competitive exports. It’s more than time that the RBI gives up on its incomprehensible and dangerous balancing act and gives the rupee some more room to float. The writer is CEO, Mecklai Financial.

Such thinking was completely foreign to him. I remember him saying that when he sees a crisis, his instinct is always to find the way through, no matter how narrow or convoluted the path. He seems to relish the opportunity to rise to a challenge.\n\nI was reminded of this conversation when I spoke to Wikler on Sunday, after he’d announced that he was running for Democratic National Committee chair. The political discussions I’ve had since Donald Trump was re-elected have generally been bleak and depressive, at best leavened with a bit of gallows humor. But while Wikler admitted to the same anxiety many of us are feeling, he sounded animated, almost cheerful.\n\n“The thing that I find energizing is the opportunity to fight back,” he said. “I’m drawn to big fights where if you pour everything you can into it, you can make a difference in a way that actually affects people’s lives.” This combination of focused pragmatism and deep, genuine optimism is part of what makes Wikler the obvious candidate to rebuild a broken and demoralized Democratic Party.\n\nThere may be decent arguments for some of the other candidates who’ve entered the race, though I confess I don’t quite understand them. The front-runner is reportedly Ken Martin, head of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, mostly because he’s a consensus choice. “If he wins, the party won’t be electing him as a force of personality, but as a safe pair of hands,” wrote Politico.

Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a “dangerous joke” and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. “To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we’re going to sanction you,” Graham said on Fox News.\n\nThis marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western all.\n\nGraham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court’s chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence minister and Hamas’ military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza.\n\nThe decision has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nGraham’s threat isn’t seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court’s previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan.\n\nAkane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. “Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council,” she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin.\n\nThe Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC’s 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court’s budget against a backdrop of unfavourable headlines.\n\nThe ICC was established in 2002 as the world’s permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression.\n\nThe court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China.\n\nThe ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants.\n\nUS President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defence minister “outrageous” and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin “justified” and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The US is not an ICC member country.\n\nFrance said it would “respect its obligations” but would need to consider Netanyahu’s possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would “lend its support to the essential work” of the court.\n\nAnother member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants “utterly incomprehensible.” Italy called them “wrong” but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court.\n\nGlobal security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. “It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,” she told The Associated Press.\n\nMilena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court’s work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others.\n\n“Sanctions are a huge burden,” Sterio said.\n\nAlso hanging heavy over the meeting in the Hague, are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her.\n\nTwo co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims.\n\nThe Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It’s not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting.\n\nThe court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large.\n\nMember states don’t always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan’s former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over.\n\nLast week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request.\n\n“It becomes very difficult to justify the court’s existence,” Sterio said.

His surprise visit comes as Ukrainian forces are buckling across the eastern front and amid fears about future US support once Donald Trump returns to the White House in January.\n\nRussia launched another aerial barrage of hundreds of drones hours before Scholz arrived, leaving one dead and three wounded in the western Ukrainian city of Ternopil. Scholz had said he would meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky and announce another package of military support worth €650 million ($680 million) to be delivered by the end of the year. Scholz and Zelensky later met at an undisclosed location and reviewed military drones manufactured by Ukrainian and German firms. They also visited a hospital and spoke to people wounded in the war.\n\n“I would like to make it clear here on the ground that Germany will remain Ukraine’s strongest supporter in Europe,” said Scholz, who faces new elections in February after his coalition collapsed last month. “Ukraine can rely on Germany — we say what we do. And we do what we say,” he added in a post on social media. Scholz in mid-November spurred controversy and concern in Ukraine by becoming the first Western leader in years to speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nLow Kremlin expectations for visit\n\nZelensky at the time slammed the call, saying it had opened a “Pandora’s Box” by weakening Putin’s international isolation. In the call, Scholz condemned the war and “urged Russia to show willingness to negotiate with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace”, the chancellor’s office said.\n\nThe Kremlin said Monday that it had no expectations from Scholz’s visit. “I would not say we have expectations from this visit. Germany is continuing its line of unconditional support to Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Putin had not passed on a message to Zelensky through Scholz.\n\nUkraine faces a tough winter, with Russia unleashing drone and missile attacks against its power grid. The air force said Russia had attacked overnight with 110 drones, including the Iranian-designed Shahed unmanned aerial vehicle from four regions of Russia. The bombardment killed a 45-year-old man in Ternopil, a town of around 224,000 people, where strikes last month left thousands without electricity, authorities said.\n\n“Unpunished evil never stops. And it will not limit itself by our borders,” Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak wrote on social media in response to the attack. Scholz’s visit comes ahead of the January 20 inauguration of Trump, who has pledged to speedily end the war, raising fears he will try to force Ukraine to accept a deal on Moscow’s terms.\n\n‘Russian roulette’\n\nSeparately, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Monday warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing’s support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the Ukraine conflict. Zelensky said Sunday that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia. He made the comments after meeting the EU’s new head of diplomacy Kaja Kallas and EU Council chief Antonio Costa, who were visiting Kyiv as a show of support on their first day in office.\n\nUnder Scholz, Germany has become the second-biggest arms supplier to Ukraine after the United States, but has refused to send Kyiv long-range missiles that could strike deep inside Russia. Berlin has stuck to that approach even after US President Joe Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russia for the first time.\n\nIn a campaign speech in Berlin on Saturday, Scholz criticized political rivals pushing for Germany’s Taurus long-range missile system to be delivered to Ukraine. Speaking to his Social Democratic Party, Scholz said that confronting Moscow, a nuclear power, with such a threat would amount to playing “Russian roulette” with Germany’s security. — AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/21860/world/europe/scholz-promises-aid-in-surprise-visit-to-ukraine/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/12/02/186907.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:20:31","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kw","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":269839114,"title":"Lai Talks China Threats In Call With Pelosi","text":"HONOLULU: Taiwan President Lai Ching-te discussed “China’s military threats” toward the island in a call with former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday, drawing a fresh barrage of criticism from Beijing. Pelosi’s long-standing support for Taiwan has infuriated China, which responded to her visit to Taipei in 2022 with massive military drills around the island.\n\nLai and Pelosi discussed “China’s military threats toward Taiwan”, presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo told reporters, describing the 20-minute call between the “long-time friends” as “warm and amicable”. China, which insists the island is part of its territory, opposes any international recognition of Taiwan and its claim to be a sovereign state.\n\nBeijing especially bristles at official contact between the island and the United States, which is Taiwan’s most important supporter and biggest arms supplier. China has already fumed over more US arms sales to the island and Lai’s stop in Hawaii, where he was welcomed with red carpets, garlands of flowers and “alohas”.\n\nIn response to Lai’s conversation with Pelosi, China called on the United States to “stop meddling with Taiwan” and cease “supporting and indulging Taiwan independence separatist forces”. “The Taiwan issue is the core of China’s core interests and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing.\n\nSince arriving in Hawaii on Saturday at the start of a Pacific tour, Lai has met with state Governor Josh Green, members of the US Congress, officials from the de facto US embassy in Taiwan and others. In his first public speech of the trip, Lai said Saturday that we have to “fight together to prevent war,” warning there were “no winners” from conflict.\n\nOn the eve of Lai’s week-long Pacific tour, the United States approved a proposed sale to Taiwan of spare parts for F-16s and radar systems, as well as communications equipment, in deals valued at $385 million in total. China’s foreign ministry called on the United States over the weekend to “immediately stop arming Taiwan”. “China will take strong and resolute countermeasures to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” it added. In a separate statement, the foreign ministry said China “strongly condemns” the United States for Lai’s stopover and that it had “lodged serious protests with the US”.\n\nPelosi was one of “several long-time friends in the United States” whom Lai spoke to on Sunday, Kuo told reporters. They included “cross-party figures who reiterated their steadfast support for Taiwan”, she said. Lai and Pelosi also discussed artificial intelligence and the semiconductor industry, Kuo said.\n\nThe Taiwanese leader addressed the East-West Center in a closed-door forum on Sunday, emphasizing Taiwan’s “commitment” to boosting its defenses and to “its own security”, as well as the “shared commitment between Taiwan and the US to regional peace”, according to Kuo.\n\nTaiwan faces the constant threat of a military attack by China, which regularly deploys fighter jets and warships around the self-ruled island to press its claims, and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. While the United States has sold billions of dollars worth of arms to Taiwan, Washington has long maintained a “strategic ambiguity” when it comes to putting boots on the ground to defend the island from Beijing. — AFP\n\nLai’s remarks followed China’s threats last week to “resolutely crush” any attempts for Taiwan independence and ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump taking office in January. Trump caused jitters during his campaign by suggesting Taiwan should pay the United States for its defense and accusing the island of stealing the US semiconductor industry.\n\nAfter Hawaii, Lai will visit Taiwan’s allies the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — the only Pacific island nations among the 12 remaining allies that recognize Taiwan’s claim to statehood — and stop over for one night in the US territory of Guam. Lai said shortly before take-off in Taipei that the trip “ushered in a new era of values-based democracy” and thanked the US government for “helping to make this trip a smooth one”.\n\nHe said he wanted to “continue to expand cooperation and deepen partnerships with our allies based on the values of democracy, peace and prosperity.” “I once again emphasize that we are all Team Taiwan. We all work together, and we can successfully achieve our goals,” Lai told reporters on board the plane. — AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/21859/world/asia/lai-talks-china-threats-in-call-with-pelosi/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/12/02/186895.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:20:31","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kw","sentiment":0.008},{"id":269839098,"title":"Trump Will Keep Us In Ai Lead Openais Altman","text":"WASHINGTON: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Sunday expressed confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration would support the artificial intelligence sector to ensure the United States and its allies continue to lead it.

However, IT stocks were resilient, with the Nifty IT index up 32% on 29 November from a year ago. The November rally started after Donald Trump’s win in the 2024 US presidential election. The market anticipates that his proposed policies will be favourable for the IT services business. The expected proposals include corporate tax cuts, sparking optimism about increased discretionary spending by US companies—a key market for IT services providers, which get 60–70% of their earnings from the US market.\n\nAlso read | Slowdown: Time to recalibrate India’s growth story in FY25?\n\nWill a weaker rupee impact IT services?\n\nA weaker rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar will boost exports (even as it makes imports dearer), giving a leg-up to the IT services businesses in India. In the past six months, the rupee has declined by 1.7% versus the dollar. A decline in the rupee enhances earnings of IT services exporters, as about 70% of their revenue comes from the US. For every 100 basis point (bp) change in the rupee-dollar exchange rate, the margins and net profit of IT services companies are impacted positively. While currency depreciation will make exports more competitive, a lot depends on demand and related trade policies as well.\n\nAlso read | Natural farming: Ambitious plan, but will it work?\n\nIs discretionary spending back in the US market?\n\nInterest rate cuts of 50 and 25 bps by the US Fed in September and November are likely to increase spending in the banking, financial services and insurance segment. It accounts for around 35% of the $260 billion business for IT services firms. The rate cut also changes business sentiment and could result in higher discretionary spend by global clients.\n\nAlso read | IT services: When will the tide turn?\n\nWill Trump’s AI stance help Indian IT firms?\n\nDonald Trump’s stance on easing regulations on AI will boost this space. The market will see a fast shift from proofs of concept to AI deployments and bigger deals being signed. Already the AI outlook was getting better with bellwether Accenture ending FY24 with Gen AI order inflows of $3 billion. AI projects for Indian firms are expected to increase at a fast clip. This will have a cascading impact across verticals including hi-tech, consumer, energy, and BFSI as more companies lean on AI to build their competitive edge.\n\nAlso read | Why are banks issuing fewer credit cards?\n\nCould there still be some headwinds?\n\nNotwithstanding positives for the software services exports sector, much will depend on the policy statements post 20 January, when Trump assumes office. Whether the IT business grows and IT stocks continue to rally depends on policy decisions by the US Fed and Trump’s proposed tariff measures. As of now, what shape the US import duties could take and their wider ramifications are still unknown. While the services sector may be immune to an extent, a negative shock cannot be ruled out at this stage.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/industry/infotech/mint-primer-ai-positive-how-donald-trump-may-grow-india-s-it-business-it-services-artificial-intelligence-11733152122129.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/02/1600x900/IT-km0F--621x414LiveMint_1733157715822_1733157716031.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-03 00:19:32","author":"Mint","authors":["Mint"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":269838832,"title":"Trump names billionaire banker Warren Stephens as envoy to Britain","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included $2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC.\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced he was selecting Stephens to be the US ambassador to the Court of Saint James.
