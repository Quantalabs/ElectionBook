Polls suggest these issues are critical to the Latino voting bloc, and many of these questions were posed by people who had very personal, emotional stories to tell.Supports \"Dreamers,\" pins blame on Trump for bipartisan border billJesus Aispuro, a first-time voter from California, told Harris he has friends who are \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. Pressing her on what she'd do to protect Dreamers under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Harris said she'd prioritize an immigration plan that establishes a pathway to citizenship. In response to a case in front of a federal appeals court over the fate of DACA, Harris' campaign issued a statement during the town hall saying Harris \"will always stand with Dreamers and keep families together\" and urging Congress to pass \"an earned pathway to citizenship for these young people.\"Yvette Castillo began her question by noting she and Harris have something in common: both of their mothers are dead. Castillo noted her mother died six weeks ago, and while she was alive, she did not succeed in acquiring U.S. citizenship. Harris' mother died in 2009. \"What are your plans to support that subgroup of immigrants who have been here their whole lives and have to live and die in the shadows?\" Castillo asked.Harris repeatedly said she was sorry for Castillo's loss, and then she said the bipartisan border bill that former President Donald Trump lobbied Republican lawmakers to vote against could have created \"a comprehensive earned pathway to citizenship for hard working people.\"She went on to argue that this failure to enact legislation bore responsibility for the outcome Castillo's mother had. \"Had your mother been able to gain citizenship, she would have been entitled to health care that may have alleviated her suffering and yours. And this is one example of the fact that there are real people who are suffering because of an inability to put solutions in front of politics,\" Harris added. The Latino vote is crucial for Harris' path to the White House, and polling shows it's a more competitive fight than in 2020. Harris holds an 18-point advantage over former president Donald Trump, according to a September CBS News poll. It's a smaller gap compared to President Joe Biden's 33-point advantage with Latino voters in a 2020 CBS News exit poll. \"The largest segment of undecided voters right now are still within the Latino community. So doing town halls like this, it's going to places like Arizona… having folks like the rest of us all across those state, are going to be very important,\" Rep. Robert Garcia of California said after the debate. \"Latinos are going to have an outsized influence in this election because the margins are so tight,\" he added. Criticizes Trump over reports he sent COVID tests to Putin, can't list three virtues about himMario Sigbaum, a 70-year-old independent and undecided voter, questioned how Harris was able to become the Democratic nominee and said the late switch resulting from President Biden's late exit from the race \"inclined me to vote for Trump.\"After Harris praised Mr. Biden for supporting her run, she highlighted her own support from Republicans and argued Trump admires \"dictators and autocracy.\" She criticized Trump over reports he sent Russian President Vladimir Putin a COVID test machine during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"I'm sure people here have family members or friends who died [from COVID], and he secretly shipped off COVID tests to Vladimir Putin of Russia. When people died — hundreds were dying every day,\" Harris said, adding that she and Mr. Biden tried to address the disproportionate rate of Latino and Black Americans dying from COVID infections.\"So, I present that to you, sir, to say, this is an extraordinary time,\" she said. Asked by a voter at the end if she could name three virtues of Trump, Harris noted his love for his family, but declined to add more.\"Family is one of the most important things that we can prioritize. But I don't really know him to be honest with you. I've only met him one time on the debate stage. So, I don't really have much more to offer you,\" she said. Hurricane Milton responseThe town hall began with Ramiro Gonzalez, a voter from Tampa, Florida, who noted more than one hurricane had struck his home. \"Rumors are that your administration didn't do enough to respond to the last hurricane. What would you specifically do, or your administration do, to help us in the Tampa Bay area or the Central Florida area with this hurricane?\" he asked Harris. Harris responded by decrying disinformation spread about the federal response to recent hurricanes. \"I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,\" she said. She then listed her continual briefings and contact with state and local officials on the ground, and warned against companies that are raising prices in impacted areas. Economy and health care: \"Prices are too high, still… and we have to deal with it.\"Asked by Wendy Solares — a mother who houses her children, as well as her parents — what Harris would do to help the middle class, Harris took a more sympathetic tone to the rise in the cost of living. \"I know prices are too high, still. You know prices are too high, still. And we have to deal with it,\" she said, before listing out her economic plan to lower costs through being more aggressive on price gouging by grocery companies and by issuing tax credits for parents and down payment assistance for first time home buyers. Martha Rodriguez, a 62-year-old homeless woman whose medical conditions — a heart attack and \"long COVID\" — caused her to lose her job and income, asked Harris how she'd help disabled citizens get their insurance faster through Social Security. Harris noted that she pushed to designate long COVID as a condition that should be covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that as president, she would work to make sure medical debt does not affect credit scores. \"The point is being very simple, frankly, which is that all people, regardless of disability, should have equal access to housing, to job opportunities, to education, and again, community, and there's still a lot of work that we have to do in that regard,\" Harris responded.","summary":"Harris fielded questions at a Univision town hall about immigration, the economy

excited about robotaxi event that might reveal Elon Musk’s much-anticipated humanoid robot","text":"After years of teases, Tesla is finally about to pull back the curtain and unveil the long awaited robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night.\n\nThe company, which began selling software it calls ‘Full Self-Driving’ nine years ago that still can’t drive itself , is expected to show off the so-called ‘Cybercab’ vehicle, which may not have a steering wheel and pedals.\n\nAlso referred to as ‘Cybercab’, the taxi is expected to be fully driverless – with no steering wheel or pedals – and offer a new Tesla-operated ride-hailing service. \n\nThe event, dubbed ‘We, Robot,’ by the company, is set for 7 p.m. local time on Thursday evening at the Warner Bros. studio.\n\nThe unveiling comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to persuade investors that his company is more about artificial intelligence and robotics as it struggles to sell its core products, an aging lineup of electric vehicles.\n\nBillionaire Musk has already confirmed the unveiling event on Thursday, which is dubbed ‘We Robot’, thought to be a reference to the film ‘I Robot’. \n\nOn X, he posted an image of the official event invite with the caption: ‘This will be one for the history books.’ \n\nThere’s no official word on how much it would cost, but it could be similar to Cybertruck, which retails for around $80,000 or more. \n\nMusk’s concept of a Robotaxi, mooted nearly a decade ago, is a self-driving vehicle and an alternative to the manned taxis lining the world’s streets.\n\nPassengers could request a Robotaxi ride through an app, similar to Uber or Lyft, and be transported from A to B without having to interact with any driver – because there isn’t one. \n\nThe Robotaxi owner, meanwhile, would be able to send their vehicle out to make the trip, rather than having to get in the vehicle and drive it themselves, with the tap of an app. \n\nTheoretically, people could buy multiple Robotaxis from Tesla and send them all out to perform different trips at the same time – making money from the comfort of their own armchair. \n\nMusk previously tweeted: ‘Much more productive to manage a fleet of Robotaxis than only drive one taxi yourself.’ \n\nFor the passenger, trips could cost less than a bus ticket, according to Musk, while the money would go mostly to the Robotaxi owner (Tesla would get a certain percentage of each fee).\n\nBut aside from potentially putting taxi drivers out of business, Robotaxi’s lack of human driver could prove concerning for customers. \n\nSome analysts are predicting that it will be a historic day for the Austin, Texas, company as it takes a huge step toward a long-awaited robotaxi service powered by AI.\n\nBut others who track self-driving vehicles say Musk has yet to demonstrate Tesla’s system can travel safely without a human driver ready to step in to prevent crashes.\n\n‘I don’t know why the headlines continue to be `What will Tesla announce?´ rather than `Why does Tesla think we´re so stupid?” said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who studies autonomous vehicles.\n\nHe doesn’t see Tesla having the ability to show off software and hardware that can work without human supervision, even in a limited area that’s well-known to the driving system.\n\n‘We just haven’t seen any indication that that is what Tesla is working toward,’ Walker Smith said. \n\n‘If they were, they would be showcasing this not on a closed lot, but in an actual city or on an actual freeway.’\n\nWithout a clear breakthrough in autonomous technology, Tesla will just show off a vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel, which already has been done by numerous other companies, he said.\n\n‘The challenge is developing a combination of hardware and software plus the human and digital infrastructure to actually safely drive a vehicle even without a steering wheel on public roads in any conditions,’ Walker Smith said. \n\n‘Tesla has been giving us that demo every year, and it’s not reassuring us.’\n\nMany industry analysts aren’t expecting much from the event either. \n\nWhile TD Cowen’s Jeff Osborne expects Musk to reveal the Cybercab and perhaps the Model 2, a lower-cost electric vehicle, he said he doesn’t expect much of a change on self-driving technology.\n\n‘We expect the event to be light on details and appeal to the true long-term believers in Tesla,’ Osborne wrote in a note. \n\nMusk’s claims on the readiness of Full Self Driving, though, will be crucial ‘given past delays and ongoing scrutiny’ of the system and of Tesla’s less-sophisticated Autopilot driver-assist software.\n\nTesla’s model lineup is struggling and isn’t likely to be refreshed until late next year at the earliest, Osborne wrote. \n\nPlus, he wrote that in TD Cowen’s view the ‘politicization of Elon’ is tarnishing the Tesla brand among Democrat buyers in the U.S.\n\nMusk has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and has pushed many conservative causes. Last weekend he joined Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nThe CEO has been saying for more than five years that a fleet of robotaxis is near, allowing Tesla owners to make money by having their cars carry passengers while they’re not in use by the owners.\n\nBut he has acknowledged that past predictions for the use of autonomous driving proved too optimistic. \n\nIn 2019, he promised the fleet of autonomous vehicles by the end of 2020 .\n\nHowever, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is bullish on Tesla stock, wrote in an investor note that robotaxi event will be a new chapter of growth for Tesla.\n\nIves expects many updates and details from Tesla on the robotaxi, plus breakthroughs in Full Self Driving and artificial intelligence. \n\nHe also is looking for a phased-in strategy for rolling out the robotaxis within the next year, as well as a Tesla ride-sharing app, and demonstrations of technology ‘designed to revolutionize urban transportation.’\n\nIves, whose organization will attend the invitation-only event, wrote that he also expects updates on Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, which the company plans to start selling in 2026.\n\n‘We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co. lay out the company´s vision for the future,’ Ives wrote.\n\nThe announcement comes as U.S. safety regulators are investigating Full Self Driving and Autopilot based on evidence that it has a weak system for making sure human drivers pay attention .\n\nIn addition, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration forced Tesla to recall Full Self-Driving in February because it allowed speeding and violated other traffic laws, especially near intersections. \n\nTesla was to fix the problems with an online software update.\n\nLast April in Snohomish County, Washington, near Seattle, a Tesla using Full Self-Driving hit and killed a motorcyclist, authorities said. \n\nThe Tesla driver told authorities that he was using the system while looking at his phone when the car rear-ended the motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.\n\nNHTSA says it’s evaluating information on the fatal crash from Tesla and law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department also has sought information from Tesla about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, as well as other items.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAfter years of teases, Tesla  is finally about to pull back the curtain&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Enthusiastic Tesla supporters excited about robotaxi event that might reveal Elon Musk&#8217;s much-anticipated humanoid robot first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/enthusiastic-tesla-supporters-excited-about-robotaxi-event-that-might-reveal-elon-musks-much-anticipated-humanoid-robot/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/11/00/90721683-13947863-image-a-14_1728603538664.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 00:33:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":259261356,"title":"Debate between Utah hopefuls running for Mitt Romney’s vacant US Senate position","text":"OGDEN, Utah – The Republican and Democratic contenders vying for Mitt Romney’s open U.S. Senate seat in Utah are set to square off Thursday night in a debate that will likely center on their shared focus on climate policy.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. John Curtis, who leads the Conservative Climate Caucus on Capitol Hill, faces an environmental activist and mountaineer who has tried to undercut her opponent’s credentials as a climate-focused congressman.\n\nDemocrat Caroline Gleich is the clear underdog in a deeply red state that has not elected a member of her party to the Senate since 1970. Utah voters typically favor moderate Republicans such as Romney and Curtis in statewide elections.\n\nThe winner in November will succeed one of Washington’s most prominent centrists and an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump.\n\nCurtis has often been compared to Romney for his willingness to push back against Trump and others in his party who have falsely claimed that climate change is a hoax. The congressman and former mayor of Provo pledges to carve out his own brand of conservatism if elected to the Senate.\n\nIn a Western state where residents value outdoor recreation, air quality and water access, both Curtis and Gleich view the environment as a winning issue — but their approaches differ. Each aims to convince voters during Thursday’s debate that they have the better blueprint to tackle climate change and protect Utah’s vast natural resources.\n\nCurtis, 64, is the longest-serving member of Utah’s House delegation. His seven years on Capitol Hill have been defined by efforts to bring conservatives to the table on what has historically been a Democrat-dominated issue. He has carved out a Republican approach to climate policy that he said aims to lower emissions without compromising American jobs or economic principles.\n\nHe was backed in the primary election by some leading environmental interest groups such as EDF Action, the advocacy partner of the Environmental Defense Fund, which typically throws its support behind Democratic candidates.\n\nGleich, 38, has pulled in the League of Conservation Voters Action Fund and Protect Our Winters, an environmental group she used to work with to lobby lawmakers, including Curtis.\n\nStill, Curtis has received broad support from the state’s coal, oil and gas hubs. He has urged lawmakers to not rule out the fossil fuel industry — an economic driver in his congressional district — as part of an affordable clean energy future. The U.S. he argues, can achieve its emission-reduction goals while still using some natural gas, which emits less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels when combusted.\n\nGleich has accused Curtis of pandering to the fossil fuel industry and has criticized him for voting against climate-focused proposals posed by Democrats, such as the Inflation Reduction Act. If elected, Gleich said she would support phasing out federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry and would push to invest in public transportation and electric vehicle infrastructure.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOGDEN, Utah – The Republican and Democratic contenders vying for Mitt Romney’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debate between Utah hopefuls running for Mitt Romney&#8217;s vacant US Senate position first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/debate-between-utah-hopefuls-running-for-mitt-romneys-vacant-us-senate-position/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/6JEQNBCQQRB5DJGKQ4ERWP4HWU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 00:29:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.152},{"id":259261744,"title":"‘Don’t boo, vote!’ Obama calls for action as he skewers ‘crazy’ Trump in first appearance on 2024 campaign trail","text":"People who go to a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris might be inclined to boo when they hear Donald Trump’s name, but Barack Obama doesn’t want to hear it.\n\nThe former president, who made his first appearance on the campaign trail in support of Harris, her running-mate Tim Walz, and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey at a Pittsburgh rally on Thursday, wasted no time in taking apart the man who he famously roasted so badly at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner that many believe it inspired Trump’s 2016 campaign for the presidency.\n\nObama told the crowd that he understands why Americans might be “looking to shake things up” in this country, because many “are still struggling” and “striving to make life better for themselves, for their families, and for their kids.”\n\n“Let’s face it, as a country, we’ve been through a lot these last few years, we had a historic pandemic wreaking havoc on communities and businesses. Disruptions from the pandemic then caused prices to spike, and that put a strain on family budgets, and in many ways, it’s felt like the aspirations of working people have taken a backseat to the priorities of the rich and the powerful,” he said.\n\n“So I can understand people feeling frustrated, feeling we can do better. What I cannot understand, is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you!”\n\n“I don’t understand that, because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody but himself,” he continued, calling Trump “a 78 year old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.”\n\nObama took a filet knife to his successor, whose “ranting and raving about crazy conspiracy theories” and “two-hour speeches” and “word salads” he compared to Fidel Castro, the Cuban communist dictator known for his marathon harangues against America.\n\nHe also invoked the non-stop stream of products hawked by Trump and his family members, including the Trump-branded bibles, gold sneakers and watches that have made appearances on Trump’s social media feeds during his presidential campaign.\n\n“Who does that? He wants you to buy the Word of God Donald Trump edition. Got his name right there, next to Matthew and Luke!”\n\n“It’s crazy,and the reason he does it is because all he cares about is his ego and his money and his status. He’s not thinking about you,” Obama continued, adding that Trump “sees power as nothing more than a means to an end” and would hurt America’s middle class with tax cuts for his “country club buddies” while taking away women’s reproductive rights.\n\nAs the crowd expressed their displeasure by booing loudly, Obama stopped them.\n\n“Don’t boo — vote!” he said.\n\n“They can’t hear your boos, but they can hear your votes.”\n\nObama said Trump’s callousness extends to wanting Americans to remain “hopelessly divided” and “angry” because he thinks doing so will help him retake power, citing his failure to act while a riotous mob of his supporters sacked the Capitol and tried to lynch his then-running-mate, Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n“If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own Vice President, do you think he cares about you? Pennsylvania, we do not need four more years of that,” he said.\n\n“We don’t need four more years of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division. America is ready to turn the page. We are ready for a better story, one that helps us work together. Instead of turning against each other. Pennsylvania, we’re ready for President Kamala Harris!”\n\nAnd Harris, Obama said, is “ready to do the job.”\n\nHe described her as “a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people” and someone who understands the struggles of middle-class Americans.\n\n“Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been. That’s who Kamala is,” he said.\n\nHe also said Harris’s running-mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, would make an “excellent partner” for her in the White House, recalling Walz’s history as a veteran, a teacher, a high school football coach, and a “great governor” who has been “working with Democrats and Republicans to get stuff done.”\n\n“If you elect Kamala and Tim, they won’t be focused on their problems. They understand that too many folks here in Pennsylvania and across the country are struggling to pay the bills, even though wages are still growing and inflation is finally slowing,” he continued.\n\n“The price of everything from health care to housing to groceries, it’s still too high, and that takes a real bite of paychecks. It hurts. So the question is, who’s really going to do something about it? That’s what you should be asking yourself,” he said.\n\nTurning the subject back to Trump, Obama acknowledged that some Americans might recall the US economy as having been “pretty good” during much of the time when Trump was in office.\n\n“It was pretty good because it was my economy,” he said. “We had 75 straight months of job growth that I handed over to him. It wasn’t something he did. I spent eight years cleaning up the mess that the Republicans had left me the last time … so just in case everybody has a hazy memory, he didn’t do nothing!”\n\nHe also savaged Trump for his recent tactic of spreading blatant lies about the response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton — lies that have left many Americans reluctant to ask for help from the government because they are fearful of emergency management officials.\n\n“The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments — when did that become okay?”\n\nThe 46th president also took aim at the cult of masculinity Trump has tried to cultivate around himself over the last four years.\n\n“Even if you had a family member who acted like that, you might still love him, but you tell him you got a problem and you wouldn’t put him in charge of anything. And yet, when Donald Trump lies or cheats or shows utter disregard for our Constitution, when he calls POWs ‘losers’ or fellow citizens ‘vermin,’ people make excuses for it. They think it’s okay,” he said.\n\n“I’m sorry, gentleman — that’s not what real strength is. It never has been. Real strength is about working hard and having a heavy load without complaining. Real strength is about taking responsibility for actions and telling the truth even when it’s inconvenient,” he continued.\n\n“Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves. That is what we should want for our daughters and for our sons, and that is what I want to see in a President of the United States of America,” he said.","summary":"Obama slammed the ‘78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago’ as he stumped for Kamala Harris and Senator Bob Casey in Pittsburgh","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/obama-election-trump-campaign-trail-b2627566.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/11/01/2024-10-11T001730Z_1017155945_RC20IAA05SPO_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-OBAMA.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 00:27:20","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":259261258,"title":"How did Trump become Trump? ‘The Apprentice’ has a theory","text":"Decades before he hosted “The Apprentice,” Donald Trump was … an apprentice.\n\nHis mentor: Roy Cohn, the ruthless attorney who was a prominent New York power broker in the ‘70s and ‘80s after famously serving as a top aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\n\nThe Trump-Cohn connection is well known. But in “The Apprentice,” his provocative if not quite shocking, entertaining if not quite illuminating, impeccably acted and inherently controversial film, Ali Abbasi takes it farther.\n\nIt’s this relationship, posits the Danish Iranian director, that essentially made a young real estate heir — inexperienced but wildly ambitious — into the man who would become the 45th U.S. president, smashing the norms of American politics along the way.\n\nSpeaking of unlikely paths: The mere route of “The Apprentice” to the big screen is fodder for its own movie.\n\nWritten by Gabriel Sherman and starring an ingeniously cast trio of Sebastian Stan as Trump, Jeremy Strong as Cohn and Maria Bakalova as Ivana Trump, the film failed to get picked up at Cannes in May. That was surely due at least in part to a cease and desist letter from Trump lawyers.\n\nTrump’s campaign spokesman called the movie “pure fiction” (the filmmakers call their script “fact-based”). One of the film’s investors — Trump supporter Dan Snyder, former owner of the Washington Commanders — saw it and wanted out. It was only weeks ago that Briarcliff Entertainment announced it would open “The Apprentice” this Friday — less than four weeks before the U.S. election.\n\nSo, what kind of movie do we have here?\n\nContrary to some descriptions, Abbasi says his film isn’t a biopic at all, but a look at a relationship — and at a system that’s about winning at any cost.\n\nHe’s also not, he says, trying to be political. \n\nBut the core of the film is his relationship with Cohn, whom a young Trump, son of Queens developer Fred Trump, meets in the ‘70s. “Anybody who’s anybody comes here,” he tells an uninterested date in an exclusive Manhattan club. “They say I’m the youngest person ever admitted.”\n\nHe’s invited to Cohn’s table. Trump hopes the brash attorney will help his family fight a federal case alleging they discriminate against Black tenants.\n\nMost importantly, Cohn imparts to Trump his three most important rules. First, “Attack, attack, attack.” Then: “Admit nothing, deny everything.” And finally: “No matter what happens, you claim victory and never admit defeat.”\n\nThe younger Trump is portrayed here as a bit of a charmer — there are even comparisons to Robert Redford. Although familiar mannerisms and speech patterns emerge as Trump ages, this is no “Saturday Night Live” skit.\n\nAs for Strong, who better to play Cohn than the exquisitely tortured Kendall Roy of “Succession”? Strong, famous for losing himself in roles, seems to have heard the word “reptilian” and, through sheer force of will and talent, found a way to actually resemble a snake.\n\nIvana has turned cold and bitter by the time she informs Cohn, now dying of AIDS, that a bejeweled gift Trump just gave him is a mere cheap imitation. “Donald has no shame,” she says.\n\nSoon, the mentor is gone. And 30 years after the film ends, Trump will become president. This film’s biggest lack is the connective tissue — we don’t ever really understand, alas, how young Trump became President Trump.\n\nBut we do at least see the power of Cohn’s lessons. As Trump sits down at the end with the writer he’s hired to co-author his 1987 “Trump: The Art of the Deal,” he recites for him his three most important rules.\n\nGuess what they are?

So I understand people feeling frustrated and feeling we can do better,” Obama said. “What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, Pennsylvania.”\n\nHe painted Trump as out-of-touch and not the choice to lead the country to change, calling him a “bumbling” billionaire “who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.”\n\nHe called Harris “a leader who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a chance” and declared, “Kamala is as prepared for the job as any nominee for president has ever been.”\n\nThe former president’s appearance at the University of Pittsburgh was his first appearance at a campaign rally for Harris as he sets off on a swing-state tour on her behalf. Obama last month appeared at a Harris fundraiser in California and in August spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August,\n\nObama, eight years out of power, has been one of the Democratic Party’s most reliable surrogates to galvanize voters. Until he was elected president in 2020, Joe Biden had also taken on that role for Democrats, but this year, since ending his reelection campaign and letting Harris ascend to the ticket, he’s yet to hit the trail.\n\nAs the nation’s first Black president, Biden’s appearance for Harris underscores the history-making nature of her own political career. Harris, the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, would be the first woman to serve as president if elected next month.\n\nGlenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh, said she is feeling “a little nervous” about the election but “prayerful that it’s going to turn out in our favor.”\n\nEllison said she sees Obama as a party spokesperson with a large following who can hopefully sway voters that might be on the fence about voting for Harris.\n\n“As a former president, and also as a Black president, I think that is something that might connect with the African American community, the fact that we do have our Black president supporting another Black candidate,” said Ellison, who is Black.\n\nObama was among the key Democrats who were part of a behind-the-scenes effort to encourage Biden, his former vice president, to drop out of the 2024 race.\n\nObama and Harris have been friends for two decades since he ran for Senate in Illinois. She campaigned for him when he sought the presidency in 2008.\n\nPennsylvania is a state Obama won in his 2008 and 2012 presidential races, but Trump won in 2016. Biden narrowly carried it in 2020 and the state is shaping up to be one of the most closely contested in this year’s race.\n\nTrump was in the eastern part of the state Wednesday for back-to-back rallies in Scranton and Reading. He also campaigned in eastern Pennsylvania over the weekend when he returned to Butler, where he was shot in July as he survived an assassination attempt. \n\nObama’s appearance was also aimed to bolster the reelection campaign of Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who is being challenged by Trump-endorsed Republican David McCormick.\n\nEarlier in the day, Obama visited a campaign office in Pittsburgh, where he brought pastries for volunteers and thanked them for their work, according to his office. \n\n“I’m excited because that’s what Allegheny County needs, is him to promote Harris and Walz, just really to get the momentum going and to get those blue votes out,” Sherry Werner, a 60-year-old who works at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nWerner, who was wearing a Harris button pinned to her sweater, said she is volunteering to help the campaign and feels more momentum already than in past years, and noted the long line of people waiting to get into the event hours before Obama was set to take the stage.\n\n“Who doesn’t love Obama?” she said.","summary":"Obama hits campaign trail in critical Pennsylvania to shore up support for Harris  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/obama-harris-trump-2024-election-d9874edf5ae646bf632dc463bcee3625","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/423ff5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1969+0+183/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F08%2F67%2Fba5382b8a47c95501c34e0676e0f%2F623bdc75b2024f11a122b788c0bf4de0","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 00:06:00","author":"Michelle L.

I’m also concerned about the way I feel President Biden was pushed aside. How can you clarify this?”\n\nHarris acknowledged the “unprecedented” way she secured the nod.\n\n“President Biden made a decision that I think history will show is probably one of the most courageous that a president could make, which is he decided to put country above his personal interest. And he made that decision he very within that same period of time, supported my candidacy and urged me to run,” Harris said in one of her signature word salads. “And I am honored to have earned the Democratic nomination.”\n\nBut former President Donald Trump — who, unlike Harris, bested a field of rivals in two presidential primary cycles — represents the actual anti-democratic threat, she said in a quick pivot.\n\n“Donald Trump said he would, and I’m using a quotation, ‘terminate the Constitution of the United States,’” Harris said. “Imagine the Constitution of the United States would guarantee the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure by a government on you, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment.”\n\nThe Democrat did not mention the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, or the Second Amendment, codifying citizens’ right to bear arms.\n\n“Noticias Univision Presents: Latinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds,” sponsored by the Spanish-language network, will air Thursday at 10 p.m. \n\nThe one-hour program, recorded on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, campus, featured questions from Hispanics said to be undecided about their choice next month. The network flew in at least two voters — from Florida and Wisconsin — for the event.\n\nVoters queried the veep in Spanish and English, with moderator Enrique Acevedo providing Harris a translation when needed; she answered in English.\n\nAt one point, Harris offered sympathy to a questioner who said her noncitizen mother — who apparently resided in America for decades — died without getting necessary health care.\n\n“You must remember her as she lived,” the veep said. “Not how she died.”\n\nBut later in the discussion, Harris displayed a harder edge. Asked to name three positive things about Trump by an audience member, the candidate could only praise the ex-prez for “having love for his family.”\n\nHarris continued, “I don’t really know him. To be honest with you, I only met him one time on the debate stage. I’ve never met him before, so I don’t really have much more to offer you.”\n\nShe then made a pitch for “80 pages of policy positions” on her campaign website.\n\nThe rest of the Q&A saw Harris reach into her stump-speech grab bag for stock answers on subjects such as inflation — she blamed “price gouging” — and abortion — “in the year of our Lord 2024,” women shouldn’t have to worry about “politicians” deciding their options.\n\nHarris took questions as part of an effort to shore up support from a community whose voters are drifting towards Trump. \n\nA September NBC News/Telemundo poll shows the lowest level of Hispanic support for Democrats since 2012. While 7 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, Harris has just 54% backing this year, with Trump at 40%.\n\nUnivision — which is expected to host a similar event with Trump next week — refused to make audience members available to reporters. A spokeswoman would not provide a reason for their segregation.","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Vice President Kamala Harris finally confronted the question of her candidacy’s primary-free path after 10 weeks as the presumptive and then actual Democratic presidential nominee.

It is the third that Ukraine faces in this war, and today, half of its electricity grid is out of order. The responsibility of the international community is to support Ukraine in this effort,” she said at a joint press conference.\n\n“President Zelenskyy knows well that Italy has stood by Ukraine from the very beginning of this conflict. We have done everything we can, and as we reiterated this evening, we are ready to continue doing so for as long as necessary.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Zelenskyy’s talks in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were quickly followed by another meeting in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron, who just the previous day sent a strong signal of support for Ukraine by visiting Ukrainian troops being trained in France.\n\nZelenskyy posted on X that he had “outlined the details” of the Ukrainian victory plan to Starmer and added, “We have agreed to work on it together with our allies.”\n\nDowning Street said the leaders discussed the blueprint, the challenges for Ukraine of the approaching winter and “how investment in the country’s security today would support Europe’s broader security for generations to come.”\n\n“And I think we need to continue to make that point, which is of course about Ukraine’s sovereignty, but it’s also about the rest of us as well. It matters way beyond the situation,” Starmer said.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also met Rutte with Starmer. Zelenskyy posted afterward that they discussed trans-Atlantic cooperation and further reinforcing Ukraine militarily.\n\nHe gave no details but posted that “these are the steps that will create the best conditions for restoring a just peace.”\n\n“It’s crucial, what we also want to make clear today is this is about Ukraine, but it is also about defence domestically and how we stay safe,” Rutte said in brief comments in London.\n\nZelenskyy has yet to publicly present his proposals for victory. But the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appeared to have November’s US presidential election in mind.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who could return to the White House next year, has long been critical of US aid to Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy had planned to present his blueprint at a weekend meeting of Western leaders in Germany, but it was postponed after Biden stayed home because of the hurricane crisis currently playing out in Florida.\n\nZelenskyy then embarked on his whistle-stop tour of European capitals that have been among Ukraine’s staunchest allies outside of the United States.\n\nIn Paris, Macron and Zelenskyy hugged before talks on the plan at the French presidential Elysee Palace.\n\nAfterward, Zelenskyy said “all the details” would come in November and that he’s talking with allies about securing more military aid and permission for Ukrainian forces to carry out long-range strikes.\n\nKyiv wants Western partners to allow strikes deep inside Russia, using long-range weapons they provide.\n\nSome, including the UK and France, appear willing, but Biden is reticent about escalating the conflict.\n\n“The situation looks bleak for all sides,” Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said on X.\n\n“The West hesitates amid internal divisions, Ukraine struggles while bracing for a harsh winter, and Russia presses forward without any strategic shifts in its favour yet grows increasingly impatient.”\n\nUkraine relies heavily on Western support, including tens of billions of euros’ worth of military and financial aid, to keep up the fight against its bigger enemy after almost 1,000 days of fighting since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022.\n\nFearing that crucial help could be in jeopardy due to political changes in donor countries, Ukraine has been building up its domestic arms industry. It also wants to raise more money from taxpayers to pay for the war effort.\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament passed a bill on second reading on Thursday that raises the so-called military tax from 1.5% to 5%. Some amendments are expected before it becomes law.\n\nZelenskyy’s tour comes as Russia continues a slow but relentless drive deeper into Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and targets key infrastructure with air strikes.\n\nZelenskyy said on Wednesday that the victory plan seeks to strengthen Ukraine “both geopolitically and on the battlefield” before any kind of dialogue with Russia.\n\nUkraine’s leader is expected to meet Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday.","summary":"Zelenskyy has yet to publicly present his proposals for victory but the timing of his efforts to lock in European support appear to have November&#8217;s US presidential election in mind.

How has the AI been developed, who's involved, what type of testing has been thought through?\n\n'These are the key questions to consider whether AI-driven change of the defence sector is heading in the right direction.'\n\nThe AI model being used as part of the SDR was created by US 'spy-tech' company Palantir Technologies.\n\nThe Silicon Valley firm has previously faced controversy over its NHS deal to upload patient info onto a central database, with critics raising concerns over confidentiality.\n\nIt is the first time the MOD has given AI such a prominent role in strategy and planning - and it comes as part of a broader push by the government to harness the technology.\n\nLast night, defence sources told the Mail it was 'risky' to use an untested system on such an important project as the SDR.\n\nA source said: 'The SDR will shape MOD decision making for the next decade, including spending.\n\n'We need to be assured there is the appropriate human oversight of submissions to the review, it cannot be left to high-powered computers looking for key words.\n\n'There is also the risk, as has been highlighted, that if Palantir is hacked or compromised, a third party could access some very sensitive documentation.'\n\nThe SDR will be led by former Nato Secretary General George Robertson and foreign policy expert Fiona Hill, a former aide to ex-US President Donald Trump.\n\nWith the assistance of AI, the findings of the review are expected to be published early next year. The conclusions will then form part of a MoD presentation to the Treasury to pitch for additional revenue.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has ordered MOD to save millions of pounds in efficiencies – and to cover the costs of a pay-rise for troops.\n\nThe Mail recently revealed how the cost-cutting has including slashing the Army's training budget.\n\nDefence officials also considered withdrawing £13 million in funding from the Royal Chelsea Hospital, home to the world-famous Chelsea Pensioners. But the plans were ditched following an intervention by the Mail.\n\nLast night, the Ministry of Defence said: 'We have been transparent about our ambition to use AI for a wide range of defence applications.\n\n'The team are utilising this technology to help review and analyse the high volume of submissions received by the SDR.\n\n'We have consulted serving military, veterans, MPs, industry, academia and the wider public.

She responded, “In this crisis — like in so many issues that affect the people of our country — I think it so important that leadership recognizes the dignity” to which people are entitled.\n\n“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,” Harris added.\n\nThose comments came after the former president spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, offering sympathy to people affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, the latter of which came ashore in Florida Wednesday night. But Trump also suggested that the Biden administration’s response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Helene.\n\n“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” said Trump, who has for several days promoted falsehoods about the federal response.\n\nHarris virtually attended a briefing, held in the White House Situation Room with President Joe Biden, on emergency efforts in Milton’s wake. In subsequent comments to reporters, Biden slammed Trump for spreading misinformation about federal assistance available to victims, including falsely claiming that it was capped at $750. In reality, that is just for immediate needs, the first potential payout rather than the total.\n\n“That $750 that they’re talking about, Mr. Trump and all those other people know it’s a lie to suggest that’s all they’re going to get,” Biden said Thursday. “They’re being so damn un-American with the way they’re talking about this stuff.”\n\nHe added directly to Trump: “Get a life, man. Help these people.”\n\nDespite the storm, Trump and Harris are both visiting key swing states strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nIn Michigan, where he’s looking to appeal to primarily to blue-collar voters, Trump took a swipe at the city he happened to be campaigning in, suggesting that Detroit was “a mess.”\n\n“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” he said of Harris. “You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nHarris responded that Trump “yet again has trashed another great American city when he was in Detroit, which is just a further piece of evidence on a very long list of why he is unfit to be president of the United States.”\n\nTrump’s economic speech featured multiple errors\n\nThe former president used his appearance at the Detroit Economic Club to echo core themes from his 2016 campaign, saying some other countries, especially China, are ripping the U.S. off and taking manufacturing business away. Trump said powerful companies have “raped” the United States. He vowed to impose huge tariffs that he said would force other countries to negotiate what they charge on American products.\n\n“They’ve been screwing us for so many years that we’re allowed to get some of that back,” Trump said about charging tariffs from countries.\n\nEconomists warn Trump’s proposed tariffs would drive up consumer costs. Trump has also claimed, without providing specifics, that he can use tariffs to reduce the U.S. budget deficit and pay for an expansion of childcare funding, even as he proposes other ideas without saying how he would replace the lost funding. .\n\nBut the former president seemed to not understand the difference between the budget deficit and trade imbalances, conflating the two different economic measures as essentially being the same thing.\n\nHe noted that the federal government has nearly $36 trillion in total debt, a byproduct of the annual borrowing needed to cover the gap between tax revenues and government spending. Except Trump then seemed to indicate that the debt was a byproduct of the trade deficit with China — which is a separate issue that reflects the difference between how much a country exports and how much it imports.\n\n“We have $36 trillion in debt,” Trump said. “For years and years and years, we’ve been accumulating. We’d have these deficits that are monstrous. We had 5,6,7 $800 billion deficit with China.”\n\nHe also claimed that “we had the highest job numbers in my administration,” but that isn’t true any longer. The unemployment rate fell slightly lower under Biden — to 3.4% early last year, the lowest in a half-century, below 3.5% before the pandemic under Trump.\n\nHarris looks to boost Hispanic support\n\nHarris has a rally in Phoenix after participating in the town hall for the Spanish-language network Univision. She’s looking to increase support among Hispanic voters, especially men.\n\nHer campaign began a group this week known as “Hombres con Harris” — Spanish for “Men for Harris” — that is planning to hold events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day.\n\nAt Univision’s “Latinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds” event, Ivett Castillo, 40 and a Las Vegas resident, told Harris that she’s an American citizen born to two Mexican parents and that her mother died six weeks ago. She cried as she asked the vice president about “plans to support that subgroup of immigrants here their whole lives and who live and die in the shadows.” When the town hall ended, Harris went over and clasped hands with Castillo, whose face was still streaked with tears.\n\nIn response to her question, Harris noted that Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office seeking to create pathways to U.S. citizenship for many people in the country illegally that was never considered.\n\nUnauthorized border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration before declining this year after the president issued an executive order restricting asylum claims.\n\nAnother audience member asked Harris to explain how she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, prompting her to respond, “President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous a president could make.”\n\nShe said Biden “put country before personal interest” and “urged me to run.”\n\nHispanic voters are about evenly split on whether to trust Harris or Trump to do a better job handling the economy, but they give the former president an edge on handling immigration. Hispanic women are more likely to trust Harris to better handle the economy and immigration, and Hispanic men are more likely to trust Trump on both issues, according to polling from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. Obama’s team says he will focus on swing states, especially those with key Senate races. Biden has just made one joint campaign appearance with Harris since he himself left the race in July.\n\nAmong those attending was Glenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh. She said she is feeling “a little nervous” about the election but “prayerful that it’s going to turn out in our favor.”\n\nVolmert reported from Detroit. Weissert reported from Washington.

In Arizona and Nevada, she needs to appeal to Latino voters, who have become increasingly important in the Sun Belt states. But at the moment, one month before Election Day, she is underperforming with both demographics.“Regarding black voters, she is doing much better than Biden was [in] 2024 but not quite his 2020 numbers,” Marist Institute for Public Opinion director Lee Miringoff told the Washington Examiner. “Latinos are clearly a weak spot for her, hence the town hall.”\n\nAhead of Harris’s town hall Thursday in Nevada with Spanish-language television network Univision, for example, polls supervised by Miringoff underscore that Harris and former President Donald Trump are “even” among Latino voters, remarkable compared to previous elections.\n\nDespite a wider margin of error in Latino polling because of their smaller sample sizes, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the demographic over Trump 66%-28% and President Joe Biden repeated her success four years later 65%-32%, according to Miringoff.\n\nSome of the decrease in Democratic support among Latinos coincided with an increase in the party’s acceptance of socialism, namely its warm embrace of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).\n\nBut Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray also attributed the development to Trump’s appeal to men more broadly.\n\n“Harris — and Biden before he dropped out of the race — is not doing as well as prior Democratic candidates among men under age 50 in these groups,” Murray told the Washington Examiner. “They are more attracted to Trump’s ‘get tough’ persona this year than they were in 2020 or 2016.”\n\nWhile Harris is appealing to Latinos through her town hall, Michigan Democrats are imploring her to do the same to black men in their state before it is too late.\n\nRev. Horace Sheffield, III., a black Michigan pastor and radio host, for one, encouraged Harris to bring together black men and ask them “what they need” her “to do,” not make empty promises.\n\n“They probably needed to get started a little earlier,” Sheffield told the Washington Examiner. “If you want to reach some black men, Kamala Harris, call me up and let me put them in a room for you, small room, big room, large room. But you need to get in front of them and hear from them.”\n\nThe practical repercussions of Trump’s appeal to minority voters are that he is leading Harris in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, on average, by less than 1 percentage point, according to RealClearPolitics, though Harris is ahead in Nevada by the same margin. In comparison to this time four and eight years ago, Clinton and Biden had comfortable leads over Trump in Michigan and Pennsylvania, though the former secretary of state eventually lost them, and Biden was ahead in Nevada. Arizona was close throughout both elections.\n\nRepublican strategist Cesar Conda contended Trump’s appeal is not only because of the former president’s personality, but his policies. \n\n“Under former President Trump, black, Hispanic, and Asian unemployment fell to record lows, real wages increased, and inflation was under control,” Conda told the Washington Examiner. “Under Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, minorities have experienced stagnating real wages and higher costs for groceries, gasoline, and housing. Working class Americans, including minorities, have faced increased competition for scarce jobs from the explosion of illegals entering this country caused by Harris’s border policies.”\n\nConda cited Harris’s appearance this week on The View, in which she responded, “Not a thing that comes to mind” when asked for differences between herself and Biden.\n\n“The bottom line is Kamala Harris is struggling with minority voters because she offers the same failed policies that produced record inflation and illegal immigration,” he said.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are emphasizing Harris’s policies, such as her proposal for home builder tax credits and providing an up to $25,000 down payment for first-time homebuyers, with affordable housing an important issue in Nevada.\n\n“Nevada’s Latino and union voters have the power to decide who wins the Silver State in November,” Democratic National Committee Hispanic media director Marco Frieri told reporters. “These blocs are vital communities that help keep Nevada’s economy moving forward every single day. As Vice President Kamala Harris makes her case to Latino voters today, we’re making sure they have all of the information they need to access the ballot box at IWillVote.com and cast an informed vote for Democrats up and down the ballot.”\n\nAmid Harris’s work to appeal to minority voters, Trump has one major advantage: Trump does not have to win the respective demographics; he only has to undermine her support.\n\nRegardless, to mitigate Democrats’s organizing and fundraising advantage, the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee have conducted traditional canvassing and phone banking, in addition to holding community events, from haircuts to Cafecito door launches and Spanish postcard writing nights.\n\nHarris’s town hall is part of her new, more open media strategy that has created problems for her apart from her appearance on The View.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nHer 60 Minutes interview, for instance, raised questions concerning the registration of her personal firearm, a “Glock,” and why she considers Iran to be the country’s “greatest adversary” and not China.\n\nTrump’s town hall was delayed until next week because Hurricane Milton was scheduled to make landfall during its original broadcast.","summary":"Kamala Harris&#8216;s struggles to convince minority voters, particularly&#160;black&#160;and&#160;Latino&#160;men, to support her could cost the vice president the November election.

As Hurricane Milton churned across the Gulf of Mexico last night, I saw an onslaught of outright conspiracy theorizing and utter nonsense racking up millions of views across the internet. The posts would be laughable if they weren’t taken by many people as gospel. Among them: Infowars’ Alex Jones, who claimed that Hurricanes Milton and Helene were “weather weapons” unleashed on the East Coast by the U.S. government, and “truth seeker” accounts on X that posted photos of condensation trails in the sky to baselessly allege that the government was “spraying Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton” in order to ensure maximum rainfall, “just like they did over Asheville!”\n\nAs Milton made landfall, causing a series of tornados, a verified account on X reposted a TikTok video of a massive funnel cloud with the caption “WHAT IS HAPPENING TO FLORIDA?!” The clip, which was eventually removed but had been viewed 662,000 times as of yesterday evening, turned out to be from a video of a CGI tornado that was originally published months ago. Scrolling through these platforms, watching them fill with false information, harebrained theories, and doctored images—all while panicked residents boarded up their houses, struggled to evacuate, and prayed that their worldly possessions wouldn’t be obliterated overnight—offered a portrait of American discourse almost too bleak to reckon with head-on.\n\nEven in a decade marred by online grifters, shameless politicians, and an alternative right-wing-media complex pushing anti-science fringe theories, the events of the past few weeks stand out for their depravity and nihilism. As two catastrophic storms upended American cities, a patchwork network of influencers and fake-news peddlers have done their best to sow distrust, stoke resentment, and interfere with relief efforts. But this is more than just a misinformation crisis. To watch as real information is overwhelmed by crank theories and public servants battle death threats is to confront two alarming facts: first, that a durable ecosystem exists to ensconce citizens in an alternate reality, and second, that the people consuming and amplifying those lies are not helpless dupes but willing participants.\n\nSome of the lies and obfuscation are politically motivated, such as the claim that FEMA is offering only $750 in total to hurricane victims who have lost their home. (In reality, FEMA offers $750 as immediate “Serious Needs Assistance” to help people get basic supplies such as food and water.) Donald Trump, J. D. Vance, and Fox News have all repeated that lie. Trump also posted (and later deleted) on Truth Social that FEMA money was given to undocumented migrants, which is untrue. Elon Musk, who owns X, claimed—without evidence—that FEMA was “actively blocking shipments and seizing goods and services locally and locking them away to state they are their own. It’s very real and scary how much they have taken control to stop people helping.” That post has been viewed more than 40 million times. Other influencers, such as the Trump sycophant Laura Loomer, have urged their followers to disrupt the disaster agency’s efforts to help hurricane victims. “Do not comply with FEMA,” she posted on X. “This is a matter of survival.”\n\nThe result of this fearmongering is what you might expect. Angry, embittered citizens have been harassing government officials in North Carolina, as well as FEMA employees. According to an analysis by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an extremism-research group, “Falsehoods around hurricane response have spawned credible threats and incitement to violence directed at the federal government,” including “calls to send militias to face down FEMA.” The study also found that 30 percent of the X posts analyzed by ISD “contained overt antisemitic hate, including abuse directed at public officials such as the Mayor of Asheville, North Carolina; the FEMA Director of Public Affairs; and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.” The posts received a collective 17.1 million views as of October 7.\n\nOnline, first responders are pleading with residents, asking for their help to combat the flood of lies and conspiracy theories. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said that the volume of misinformation could hamper relief efforts. “If it creates so much fear that my staff doesn’t want to go out in the field, then we’re not going to be in a position where we can help people,” she said in a news conference on Tuesday. In Pensacola, Florida, Assistant Fire Chief Bradley Boone vented his frustrations on Facebook ahead of Milton’s arrival: “I’m trying to rescue my community,” he said in a livestream. “I ain’t got time. I ain’t got time to chase down every Facebook rumor … We’ve been through enough.”\n\nIt is difficult to capture the nihilism of the current moment. The pandemic saw Americans, distrustful of authority, trying to discredit effective vaccines, spreading conspiracy theories, and attacking public-health officials. But what feels novel in the aftermath of this month’s hurricanes is how the people doing the lying aren’t even trying to hide the provenance of their bullshit. Similarly, those sharing the lies are happy to admit that they do not care whether what they’re pushing is real or not. Such was the case last week, when Republican politicians shared an AI-generated viral image of a little girl holding a puppy while supposedly fleeing Helene. Though the image was clearly fake and quickly debunked, some politicians remained defiant. “Y’all, I don’t know where this photo came from and honestly, it doesn’t matter,” Amy Kremer, who represents Georgia on the Republican National Committee, wrote after sharing the fake image. “I’m leaving it because it is emblematic of the trauma and pain people are living through right now.”\n\nKremer wasn’t alone. The journalist Parker Molloy compiled screenshots of people “acknowledging that this image is AI but still insisting that it’s real on some deeper level”—proof, Molloy noted, that we’re “living in the post-reality.” The technology writer Jason Koebler argued that we’ve entered the “‘Fuck It’ Era” of AI slop and political messaging, with AI-generated images being used to convey whatever partisan message suits the moment, regardless of truth.\n\nThis has all been building for more than a decade. On The Colbert Report, back in 2005, Stephen Colbert coined the word truthiness, which he defined as “the belief in what you feel to be true rather than what the facts will support.” This reality-fracturing is the result of an information ecosystem that is dominated by platforms that offer financial and attentional incentives to lie and enrage, and to turn every tragedy and large event into a shameless content-creation opportunity. This collides with a swath of people who would rather live in an alternate reality built on distrust and grievance than change their fundamental beliefs about the world. But the misinformation crisis is not always what we think it is.\n\nSo much of the conversation around misinformation suggests that its primary job is to persuade. But as Michael Caulfield, an information researcher at the University of Washington, has argued, “The primary use of ‘misinformation’ is not to change the beliefs of other people at all. Instead, the vast majority of misinformation is offered as a service for people to maintain their beliefs in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.” This distinction is important, in part because it assigns agency to those who consume and share obviously fake information. What is clear from comments such as Kremer’s is that she is not a dupe; although she may come off as deeply incurious and shameless, she is publicly admitting to being an active participant in the far right’s world-building project, where feel is always greater than real.\n\nWhat we’re witnessing online during and in the aftermath of these hurricanes is a group of people desperate to protect the dark, fictitious world they’ve built. Rather than deal with the realities of a warming planet hurling once-in-a-generation storms at them every few weeks, they’d rather malign and threaten meteorologists, who, in their minds, are “nothing but a trained subversive liar programmed to spew stupid shit to support the global warming bullshit,” as one X user put it. It is a strategy designed to silence voices of reason, because those voices threaten to expose the cracks in their current worldview. But their efforts are doomed, futile. As one dispirited meteorologist wrote on X this week, “Murdering meteorologists won’t stop hurricanes.” She followed with: “I can’t believe I just had to type that.”\n\nWhat is clear is that a new framework is needed to describe this fracturing. Misinformation is too technical, too freighted, and, after almost a decade of Trump, too political. Nor does it explain what is really happening, which is nothing less than a cultural assault on any person or institution that operates in reality. If you are a weatherperson, you’re a target. The same goes for journalists, election workers, scientists, doctors, and first responders. These jobs are different, but the thing they share is that they all must attend to and describe the world as it is. This makes them dangerous to people who cannot abide by the agonizing constraints of reality, as well as those who have financial and political interests in keeping up the charade.\n\n In one sense, these attacks—and their increased desperation—make sense. The world feels dark; for many people, it’s tempting to meet that with a retreat into the delusion that they’ve got everything figured out, that the powers that be have conspired against them directly. But in turning away, they exacerbate a crisis that has characterized the Trump era, one that will reverberate to Election Day and beyond. Americans are divided not just by political beliefs but by whether they believe in a shared reality—or desire one at all.","summary":"What’s happening in America today is something darker than a misinformation crisis.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/hurricane-milton-conspiracies-misinformation/680221/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AOIM2JPQYD07NGwYLpoYa4ZtMvk=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/10/weather_disinfo_horz-1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:45:06","author":"Charlie Warzel","authors":["Charlie Warzel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":259259294,"title":"Harris finally forced to address her ‘unprecedented’ nomination route at Univision town hall","text":"LAS VEGAS — Vice President Kamala Harris finally confronted the question of her candidacy’s primary-free path after 10 weeks as the presumptive and then actual Democratic presidential nominee. \n\nAnd it wasn’t a reporter who asked — it was an undecided voter at Univision’s Thursday town hall.\n\n“You earned your candidacy without going through the normal process, that is primary elections or through a caucus,” said property manager Mario Sigbaum, a Uruguay native who became a US citizen 28 years ago. “That really caught my attention. I’m also concerned about the way I feel President Biden was pushed aside. How can you clarify this?”\n\nHarris acknowledged the “unprecedented” way she secured the nod.\n\n“President Biden made a decision that I think history will show is probably one of the most courageous that a president could make, which is he decided to put country above his personal interest. And he made that decision he very within that same period of time, supported my candidacy and urged me to run,” Harris said in one of her signature word salads. “And I am honored to have earned the Democratic nomination.”\n\nBut former President Donald Trump — who, unlike Harris, bested a field of rivals in two presidential primary cycles — represents the actual anti-democratic threat, she said in a quick pivot.\n\n“Donald Trump said he would, and I’m using a quotation, ‘terminate the Constitution of the United States,’” Harris said. “Imagine the Constitution of the United States would guarantee the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure by a government on you, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment.”\n\nThe Democrat did not mention the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, or the Second Amendment, codifying citizens’ right to bear arms.\n\n“Noticias Univision Presents: Latinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds,” sponsored by the Spanish-language network, will air Thursday at 10 p.m. \n\nThe one-hour program, recorded on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, campus, featured questions from Hispanics said to be undecided about their choice next month. The network flew in at least two voters — from Florida and Wisconsin — for the event.\n\nVoters queried the veep in Spanish and English, with moderator Enrique Acevedo providing Harris a translation when needed; she answered in English.\n\nAt one point, Harris offered sympathy to a questioner who said her noncitizen mother — who apparently resided in America for decades — died without getting necessary health care.\n\n“You must remember her as she lived,” the veep said. “Not how she died.”\n\nBut later in the discussion, Harris displayed a harder edge. Asked to name three positive things about Trump by an audience member, the candidate could only praise the ex-prez for “having love for his family.”\n\nHarris continued, “I don’t really know him. To be honest with you, I only met him one time on the debate stage. I’ve never met him before, so I don’t really have much more to offer you.”\n\nShe then made a pitch for “80 pages of policy positions” on her campaign website.\n\nThe rest of the Q&A saw Harris reach into her stump-speech grab bag for stock answers on subjects such as inflation — she blamed “price gouging” — and abortion — “in the year of our Lord 2024,” women shouldn’t have to worry about “politicians” deciding their options.\n\nHarris took questions as part of an effort to shore up support from a community whose voters are drifting towards Trump. \n\nA September NBC News/Telemundo poll shows the lowest level of Hispanic support for Democrats since 2012. While 7 in 10 Hispanic voters supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, Harris has just 54% backing this year, with Trump at 40%.\n\nUnivision — which is expected to host a similar event with Trump next week — refused to make audience members available to reporters.

As night fell and power outages swept the coast, I watched live streams of palm trees swaying in the dark rain.On one hand, this live video was exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to see. And it's a dream for some tech moguls — as Elon Musk has said about X — to host on-the-ground citizen journalists streaming unvarnished live video.But it was also utterly confusing. Scrolling through the live streams, I wasn't sure if they were filmed in the direct path of the storm or somewhere else in Florida. Were these pre-recorded? Or filmed during another hurricane? Or were they truly live? What, exactly, was I looking at here? Regardless, I couldn't look away.Reporting live from a hurricane has been a staple of news since before Dan Rather's famous soaked-trenchcoat broadcasts. (The modern version would be Anderson Cooper getting nailed in the face with flying debris Wednesday night on CNN.) It's a visceral human experience to be in awe of extreme weather.Want to know what it feels like to be inside a hurricane? Turn on @CNN. Here's @BillWeirCNN losing his hat a few minutes ago: pic.twitter.com/EZNnpz3K6eBut there was another modern element happening with the TikTok coverage — a weird, ugly theme that TikTok uniquely has seemed to encourage: the viral villain.Like \"couch guy,\" \"West Elm Caleb,\" or the \"Womblands\" messy breakup, TikTok is good at creating a deluge of negative focus on characters. It's slightly different from the classic idea of the \"main character of the day\" on old Twitter since the algorithmic nature of the TikTok FYP strips away context.And indeed, TikTok found controversy for Hurricane Milton. A woman posted a series of videos earlier this week of her large home, saying she wouldn't leave even though she was in a mandatory evacuation zone near the water. She said, \"My husband built this house commercial ... it's residential, but it was built commercial-grade. It's solid concrete.\"The videos went viral, and she became the \"villain\" of the day. (She turned off comments for her more recent videos that showed that she made it through the hurricane safely; BI has reached out for comment.)Having seen the destruction of Hurricane Helene just weeks ago and the devastating flooding in North Carolina, people were primed for outrage at Floridians who ignored evacuation orders.There was also outrage on other platforms about people who didn't evacuate, like controversial memoirist Caroline Calloway, who Instagram-storied her way through the storm. On the streaming platform Kick, a man attempted to ride out the storm on an air mattress in exchange for $70,000 offered by streamer Adin Ross, who had recently interviewed Donald Trump. The streamer eventually gave up, but Ross gave him $10,000 for the effort.If you feel like you lost several IQ points reading that last paragraph, you are not alone.Max Read wrote about these villainous hurricane streamers in his newsletter:It's certainly true that the attention economy rewards attention-seeking trolls and bad behavior, and loves a good dogpile. This, I think, is a problem with the way that TikTok served the content. There were many videos showing people's experiences preparing for and riding out a historic storm — but only the most anger-inducing people went viral.Normally, the \"Live\" section is a mishmash of ASMR creators, randos, and people trying to hustle for digital coins. But Wednesday night, there actually was a lot of live, interesting, compelling news footage of an important event happening in a specific location. That was far different from on X, which previously used to be the best place to get live news.The problem was that TikTok's warping effect always leads us toward these specific outrageous stories. Instead of some sort of curated live feed of storm coverage, I saw multiple videos discussing two or three people who had decided against all good judgment to stay in their homes.TikTok isn't meant for live, breaking news, and I imagine it probably doesn't want to be. Turns out, platforms have realized that's a bad business to be in! But at this moment, I see how TikTok could — with some tweaks in the algorithm — be useful for the sort of coverage we'd otherwise get from TV news.","summary":"TikTok's algorithm leads us toward outrage-inducing stories.

Tom, the White House director of digital strategy, told me earlier today. “We view Reddit as a good example of a service that allows people to align around shared interests,” including specific topics and locations, Tom said.\n\nThe White House is still posting on other major social platforms; Tom noted that using Reddit was among the White House’s various digital strategies, which include working with content creators, and he emphasized that having a presence on the platform doesn’t come at the expense of dealing with misinformation on platforms such as X. (Reddit itself is, of course, not immune to misinformation.)\n\nThat Reddit is now an appealing home for such content is a bit of a swerve: The site was once infamous for hosting unwieldy conversation threads and even hate speech. But since the mid-2010s, the platform has put major effort into moderating its content. Its user base has also grown dramatically in recent years. As Reddit’s competitors, especially Elon Musk’s X, have become vectors of inaccuracy and lies, Reddit is standing out as an unexpected place for real-time, accurate information to reach an engaged public.\n\nThe Reddit cleanup began after several high-profile crises—including a staff revolt against its former CEO Ellen Pao and swells of violent speech on the platform at the time of the 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. The company soon updated the language of its content-moderation policies and banned accounts it found to be in violation. As the Reddit co-founder and now-CEO Steve Huffman told The New Yorker at the time: “We let the story get away from us. And now we’re trying to get our shit together.” For Reddit, part of the effort to tamp down on bad actors was clearly about revenue growth, and on that score, the company’s efforts seem largely to have worked; it went public this past March, debuting on the stock market at a $6.4 billion valuation.\n\nMy colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany, who has covered the world of Reddit, told me that the platform has always been a product of its time—including 20 years ago, when the web had different norms. The site today is no utopia, she cautioned. But its unusual system of volunteer moderators has allowed Reddit to evolve. The site has shifted “fairly organically because of a content-moderation system that empowers users to keep their own siloed spaces clean,” she said. Reddit can be understood as a collection of “fiefdoms,” known as subreddits, Kaitlyn explained, governed by rules laid down by the moderators of that space—and subject to the site’s broader policies. The system of allowing users to upvote and downvote posts “works as a built-in check against bad information spiraling out of control,” she added (though bad actors could always overtake a page and try to manipulate it).\n\nReddit’s role in this moment also speaks to the fact that other platforms have let lies proliferate unchecked: X, once carefully moderated and admired for its utility in fast-changing news moments, is now overrun with disinformation—some of it personally boosted by its owner, Elon Musk. The site formerly employed a robust team of trust and safety officials; Musk fired many of them in 2022, and has mocked the idea of content moderation. Meanwhile, Google is clogged with AI tools and nonsensical, not-always-accurate summaries. Into this landscape comes Reddit: 100 people per second are appending “Reddit” to their Google searches in order to get the results they’re seeking, a Reddit spokesperson told me; the site’s users were at an all-time high last quarter, she said, adding that subreddits for various Florida communities affected by the storms saw boosts in traffic over the past two weeks.\n\nAs my colleague Elaine Godfrey wrote yesterday, right-wing efforts to politicize the hurricanes “offer a foretaste of the grievance-fueled disinformation mayhem that we’ll see on and after Election Day.” In a moment when America’s elected leaders are fanning the flames of disinformation, and social-media lords are working against the spread of accurate content (in Musk’s case, literally leaping into an alliance with a political candidate doing the same), people sharing real-time facts are looking for somewhere to go. In our topsy-turvy media ecosystem, the answer may be—of all places—Reddit.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nGet Off the Family Plan\n\nBy Arthur C.

Overleveraging means borrowing too much money and being unable to pay it all back.\n\nChina’s State Council released a 4 trillion yuan stimulus package (US$559 billion) in 2008 and the following year to cushion the impact from the global financial crisis and it is credited with helping economic growth recover to double digits by mid-2009.\nHowever, the stimulus also built up trillions of yuan worth of debt within local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) and accelerated “shadow banking”, which refers to unregulated financial activity.\nLGFVs were created to aid off-budget financing, especially for infrastructure spending, but weak disclosure requirements have led to concerns about so-called hidden debt risks.\nKhor linked the monetary stimulus announced in late September to other economic revitalisation measures announced since the Communist Party Central Committee’s plenary session in July.\nThe People’s Bank of China began making a net 100 billion yuan (US$14.1 billion) bond purchase from secondary the market in August, before it acquired another 200 billion yuan last month.\nAnd following its larger than expected rate cut announced at the end of September, the central bank on Thursday also launched a 500 billion yuan swap tool to boost stock market liquidity.\n\nLast month, officials also sought to mobilise government departments to do their part in bucking up the world’s second-largest economy.\nUpcoming stimulus measures, even if short of a huge windfall, would “be enough to revive the economy” by stimulating domestic demand and quickening the pace of recovery for the Chinese property market that has struggled since 2020, Khor said.\nAmro’s Asean+3 Financial Stability Report, released on Thursday, voiced caution about “highly leveraged Chinese developers”.\nHit by a tightening of regulations in Beijing, default cases among major real estate developers rose in 2021 before peaking a year later, the report said.\nThe number of defaults stabilised after that, it said, but property prices have been declining since 2022 based on data from 70 cities.\nPrice falls are “exacerbated by oversupply” plus doubts among homebuyers about the “delivery of pre-purchased homes”, according to the report.\n\nSales have also declined, making it harder for developers to raise funding, the report added, calling revenue from home presales “a key source of financing for developers”.\nDefaults on offshore bonds issued by Chinese developers have also declined since a 2022 peak, it said, but Chinese developers “remain under scrutiny”.\nKhor said China and its Asian neighbours should monitor the impact from the US presidential election until the end of the year should former president Donald Trump win another term.\nA victory for Trump would generate “uncertainty” especially if he added tariffs against Chinese imports, Khor added.\nHe suggested that the Asean bloc hang together as a “connector” between the two powers because that approach had helped Southeast Asia “manage” in the past.","summary":"Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office chief economist Hoe Ee Khor says China will avoid the huge stimulus package it rolled out in 2009.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3281873/china-unpacking-economic-stimulus-steps-avoid-overleveraged-response-economist","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/10/b02fcaf1-dc6b-4eb0-bcb0-316bfbf364f3_af651e94.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:30:07","author":"Ralph Jennings","authors":["Ralph Jennings"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.128},{"id":259259132,"title":"Trump Trashes Motor City as Obama Hits the Trail","text":"Welcome to October Surprise, the Daily Beast’s daily countdown to the biggest election of our lifetime.

Even if true, what could the Russian strongman do with it? \n\nRemember, there was no treatment or vaccine for the virus at the time; and lots of countries were trading equipment and information in a bid to stem COVID’s spread. \n\nLooks like a cheap way to make Putin feel respected, and so less likely to, say, launch a fresh invasion of Ukraine (which Trump, incidentally, provided with lethal weaponry, breaking from the Obama policy). \n\nAnd if Trump refused to help Russia, the left would be howling about that.\n\nBesides, how do free COVID tests even begin to compare to the billions Kamala Harris and Joe Biden gave Iran — which used it to spark a major Middle East war via its proxies?\n\nLet’s face it: Dems are desperate as polls show Harris losing and she struggles in even friendly media hits.\n\nAnd so they rush to Russia Hoax 2.0: Even if it doesn’t change a single vote, it’s proven clickbait!","summary":"Democrats and lefty media outlets are blasting out stories of supposedly sinister ties between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin because they know they can't tout Kamala Harris' record.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/opinion/with-kamala-harris-flailing-the-left-is-resorting-to-russia-hoax-2-0/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/former-us-president-republican-presidential-91377379.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:22:37","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":259257996,"title":"CBS must release the full Kamala Harris transcript to live up to its own stated standards","text":"With even the Harris-Walz campaign disavowing CBS’s hack editing job of Bill Whitaker’s interview with the Democratic nominee, the network’s only hope of regaining any credibility is to release the full transcript.\n\nAs we’ve noted, the network left no question it had reshaped the “full video” to conceal Kamala Harris’ inept answers to Whitaker’s entirely professional questioning.\n\nIt released an uncut back-and-forth to promote the airing of the “full” interview — then broadcast a version that deceptively made it seem like she’d given a (somewhat) coherent answer to his question about why Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu “is not listening” to the Biden administration’s advice and requests.\n\nAnd the transcript CBS later released also cut her word-salad response.\n\nWhat else wound up on the cutting-room floor, both on video and in print?\n\nThe American people deserve to know the full truth.\n\nGiven how awful Harris looked even after CBS chose to deceive its viewers, this may well be the last serious interview she does before Election Day: The network has a clear duty to the public to share the whole thing.\n\nFormer CBS reporter Catherine Herridge notes there’s even precedent for the network releasing a complete, raw transcript: It did so for her interview with then-President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nCBS News claims it’s “dedicated to providing the highest quality journalism.” More: “Our mission is to empower Americans across all ages and demographics to understand the stories and issues that shape the world around us.”\n\nAnd: “We will always seek to hold your elected officials accountable through fair, unbiased and fact-based reporting.”\n\nKeeping the full transcript secret breaks every one of those promises.

Ron DeSantis had declined to take calls from Harris as he managed the Sunshine State’s recovery from Helene and preparations for Milton.\n\nWhile DeSantis himself professed to have been unaware of Harris’ efforts to reach him, the veep went scorched earth.\n\n“People are in desperate need of support right now. And playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations, these are the height of the emergency situations,” she raged, deriding the governor as “irresponsible” and “selfish.”\n\nIn response, DeSantis rightly noted that it was Harris who was playing political games with a natural disaster poised to threaten the lives and livelihoods of his constituents.\n\n“She has never called on any of the storms we’ve had since she’s been vice president until apparently now,” he pointed out.\n\nBiden has twice been asked about the dispute over DeSantis’ behavior.\n\nAnd to the world’s surprise, he’s now twice come to the defense of the arch-conservative governor, leaving Harris twisting in the wind.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden was asked whether DeSantis had been “cooperative” in coordinating with the federal government.\n\nNot only did the president reply in the affirmative, he said he had thanked DeSantis for doing “a great job.”\n\nThen on Wednesday, Biden was asked directly if DeSantis should be taking Harris’ calls.\n\n“All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Gov. DeSantis,” he replied. \n\n“He’s been very gracious, he’s thanked me for all we’ve done, he knows what we’re doing, and I think that’s important.”\n\nIn a career full of indignities, this humiliation should leave even as cynical a creature as Harris reeling.\n\nFaced with a question about the Harris-DeSantis spat, the president explicitly sided with the Republican.\n\nEven Biden can’t deny that his veep is a crude opportunist — one who once came within inches of accusing him of racial animus during the 2020 Democratic primaries — in the wake of this disgraceful episode.\n\nIt has been theorized that Biden is deliberately undermining Harris as revenge for his ouster from the Democratic ticket earlier this year.\n\nAnd reports have indicated that there is tension between the pair’s camps as Harris balances her dueling interests in remaining loyal to Biden and enumerating her differences with him.\n\nBut Biden wouldn’t set out to sabotage his right hand.\n\nIf she loses, Biden will be castigated as the bumbling fool whose presidency was so great a failure that he handed the White House back over to Trump.\n\nIf she wins, at least the Democrats will rewrite history to remember him as a selfless elder statesman who gave up power to beat the Donald.\n\nNo, the truth is much more incriminating.\n\nIt’s not that Biden wants to blow up Harris’ campaign, it’s that he can’t possibly abide her self-centered tantrum.\n\nDespite her attempted rebrand as an amiable consensus-builder, Harris has none of those attributes.\n\nFor her, everything — including 170-mile-per-hour winds and deadly floods ripping through the southeast — is about her, and how she can use it to her political advantage.\n\nThat’s why she’s so angry that DeSantis has spent no energy feeding her ego, and has even gone so far as to manufacture a feud about it.\n\nIt’s seemingly her belief that the governor hasn’t paid her ample attention as he tends to the needs of his state’s beleaguered citizens.\n\nDeSantis prioritized them over her, and she had the gall to characterize that as some kind of scandal.\n\nThat doesn’t pass the smell test — not even for Joe Biden.\n\nFor his part, the president still wants Harris to succeed him, but he’s just not willing to indulge her smears or delusions of grandeur to help her do it — at least not right now.\n\nSo it isn’t that Biden is trying to rebuke Harris. It’s that her behavior is so unbecoming that his more professional — and truthful — approach can only come across as a rebuke.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Biden can’t deny that his veep is a crude opportunist in the wake of this disgraceful episode.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/opinion/even-joe-biden-cant-stomach-harris-pique-in-hurricane-spat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/bhuhuh.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:20:26","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":259257724,"title":"How 2,000 Haitian migrants changed Rust Belt town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania","text":"Charleroi, Pennsylvania, is a deeply troubled place. The former steel town, built along a stretch of the Monongahela River, south of Pittsburgh, has experienced the typical Rust Belt rise and fall. The industrial economy, which had turned it into something resembling a company town, hollowed out after the Second World War. Some residents fled; others succumbed to vices. The steel mills disappeared. Two drug-abuse treatment centers have since opened their doors.\n\nThe town’s population had steadily declined since the middle of the twentieth century, with the most recent Census reporting slightly more than 4,000 residents.\n\nThen, suddenly, things changed. Local officials estimate that approximately 2,000 predominantly Haitian migrants have moved in.\n\nThe town’s Belgium Club and Slovak Club are mostly quiet nowadays, while the Haitians and other recent immigrants have quickly established their presence, even dominance, in a dilapidated corridor downtown.\n\nThis change — the replacement of the old ethnics with the new ethnics — is an archetypal American story. And, as in the past, it has caused anxieties and, at times, conflict.\n\nThe municipal government has felt the strain. The town, already struggling with high rates of poverty and unemployment, has been forced to assimilate thousands of new arrivals.\n\nThe schools now crowd with new Haitian pupils, and have had to hire translators and English teachers. Some of the old pipes downtown have started releasing the smell of sewage.\n\nAnd, according to a town councilman, there is a growing sense of trepidation about the alarming number of car crashes, with some vehicles reportedly slamming into buildings.\n\nAmong the city’s old guard, frustrations are starting to boil over. Instead of being used to revitalize these communities, these residents argue, resources get redirected to the new arrivals, who undercut wages, drive rents up, and, so far, have failed to assimilate. Worst of all, these residents say, they had no choice — there was never a vote on the question of migration; it simply materialized.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump, echoing the sentiments of some of Charleroi’s native citizens, has cast the change in a sinister light.\n\nAs he told the crowd at a recent rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, “it takes centuries to build the unique character of each state. . . . But reckless migration policy can change it quickly and permanently.”\n\nProgressives, as expected, countered with the usual arguments, claiming that Trump was stoking fear, inciting nativist resentment, and even putting the Haitian migrants in danger.\n\nNeither side, however, seems to have grappled with the mechanics of Charleroi’s abrupt transformation. How did thousands of Haitians end up in a tiny borough in Western Pennsylvania? What are they doing there? And cui bono — who benefits?\n\nThe answers to these questions have ramifications not only for Charleroi, but for the general trajectory of mass migration under the Biden administration, which has allowed more than 7 million migrants to enter the United States, either illegally, or, as with some 309,000 Haitians, under ad hoc asylum rules.\n\nThe basic pattern in Charleroi has been replicated in thousands of cities and towns across America: the federal government has opened the borders to all comers; a web of publicly funded NGOs has facilitated the flow of migrants within the country; local industries have welcomed the arrival of cheap, pliant labor.\n\nAnd, under these enormous pressures, places like Charleroi often revert to an older form: that of the company town, in which an open conspiracy of government, charity, and industry reshapes the society to its advantage — whether the citizens want it or not.\n\nThe best way to understand the migrant crisis is to follow the flow of people, money, and power — in other words, to trace the supply chain of human migration. In Charleroi, we have mapped the web of institutions that have facilitated the flow of migrants from Port-au-Prince.\n\nSome of these institutions are public and, as such, must make their records available; others, to avoid scrutiny, keep a low profile.\n\nThe initial, and most powerful, institution is the federal government. Over the past four years, Customs and Border Patrol has reported hundreds of thousands of encounters with Haitian nationals. In addition, the White House has admitted more than 210,000 Haitians through its controversial Humanitarian Parole Program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV), which it paused in early August and has since relaunched.\n\nThe program is presented as a “lawful pathway,” but critics, such as vice presidential candidate J. D. Vance, have called it an “abuse of asylum laws” and warned of its destabilizing effects on communities across the country.\n\nThe next link in the web is the network of publicly funded NGOs that provide migrants with resources to assist in travel, housing, income, and work. These groups are called “national resettlement agencies,” and serve as the key middleman in the flow of migration.\n\nThe scale of this effort is astounding. These agencies are affiliated with more than 340 local offices nationwide and have received some $5.5 billion in new awards since 2021. And, because they are technically non-governmental institutions, they are not required to disclose detailed information about their operations.\n\nIn Charleroi, one of the most active resettlement agencies is Jewish Family and Community Services Pittsburgh.\n\nAccording to a September Pittsburgh Post-Gazette report, JFCS staff have been traveling to Charleroi weekly for the past year and a half to resettle many of the migrants. The organization has offered to help migrants sign up for welfare programs, including SNAP, Medicaid, and direct financial assistance.\n\nWhile JFCS Pittsburgh offers “employment services“ to migrants, it denies any involvement with the employer and staffing agencies that were the focus of our investigation.\n\nAnd yet, business is brisk. In 2023, JFCS Pittsburgh reported $12.5 million in revenue, of which $6.15 million came directly from government grants. Much of the remaining funding came from other nonprofits that also get federal funds, such as a $2.8 million grant from its parent organization, HIAS. And JFCS’s executives enjoy generous salaries: the CEO earned $215,590, the CFO $148,601, and the COO $125,218 — all subsidized by the taxpayer.\n\nWhat is next in the chain? Business. In Charleroi, the Haitians are, above all, a new supply of inexpensive labor. A network of staffing agencies and private companies has recruited the migrants to the city’s factories and assembly lines.\n\nWhile some recruitment happens through word-of-mouth, many staffing agencies partner with local nonprofits that specialize in refugee resettlement to find immigrants who need work.\n\nAt the center of this system in Charleroi is Fourth Street Foods, a frozen-food supplier with approximately 1,000 employees, most of whom work on the assembly line.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Chris Scott, the CEO and COO of Fourth Street Barbeque (the legal name of the firm that does business as Fourth Street Foods) explained that his company, like many factory businesses, has long relied on immigrant labor, which, he estimates, makes up about 70% of its workforce.\n\nThe firm employs many temporary workers, and, with the arrival of the Haitians, has found a new group of laborers willing to work long days in an industrial freezer, starting at about $12 an hour.\n\nMany of these workers are not directly employed by Fourth Street Foods. Instead, according to Scott, they are hired through staffing agencies, which pay workers about $12 an hour for entry-level food-processing roles and bill Fourth Street Foods over $16 per hour to cover their costs, including transportation and overhead. (The average wage for an entry-level food processor in Washington County was $16.42 per hour in 2023.)\n\nAccording to a Haitian migrant who worked at Fourth Street and a review of video footage, three staffing agencies — Wellington Staffing Agency, Celebes Staffing Services, and Advantage Staffing Agency — are key conduits for labor in the city.\n\nNone have websites, advertise their services, or appear in job listings. According to Scott, Fourth Street Foods relies on agencies to staff its contract workforce, but he declined to specify which agencies, citing nondisclosure agreements.\n\nThe final link is housing. And here, too, Fourth Street Foods has an organized interest.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Scott said, Fourth Street Foods was “scrambling” to find additional workers. The owner of the company, David Barbe, stepped in, acquiring and renovating a “significant number of homes” to provide housing for his workforce.\n\nA property search for David Barbe and his other business, DB Rentals LLC, shows records of more than 50 properties, many of which are concentrated on the same streets.\n\nAfter the initial purchases, Barbe required some of the existing residents to vacate to make room for newcomers.\n\nA single father, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was forced to leave his home after it was sold to DB Rentals LLC in 2021. “[W]e had to move out [on] very short notice after five years of living there and being great tenants,” he explained. Afterward, a neighbor informed him that a dozen people of Asian descent had been crammed into the two-bedroom home. They were “getting picked up and dropped off in vans.”\n\n“My kids were super upset because that was the house they grew up in since they were little,” the man said. “It was just all a huge nightmare.”\n\nIn recent years, a debate has raged about “replacement migration,” which some left-wing critics have dubbed a racist conspiracy theory.\n\nBut in Charleroi, “replacement” is a plain reality. While the demographic statistics have shifted dramatically in recent years, replacement happens in more prosaic ways, too: a resident moves away. Another arrives. The keys to a rental apartment change hands.\n\nIn one sense, this is unremarkable. Since the beginning, America has been the land of migration, replacement, and change. The original Belgian settlers of Charleroi were replaced by the later-arriving Slavic populations, who are now, in turn, being replaced by men and women from Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe economy changed along the same lines. The steel plants shut down years ago. The glass factory, the last remaining symbol of the Belgian glass-makers, might suspend operations soon. The largest employer now produces frozen meals.\n\nIn another sense, however, legitimate criticisms can be made of what is happening in Charleroi. First, the benefits of mass migration seem to accrue to the organized interests, while citizens and taxpayers absorb the costs.\n\nNo doubt, the situation is advantageous to David Barbe of Fourth Street Foods, who can pay $16 an hour to the agencies that employ his contract labor force, then recapture some of those wages in rent — just like the company towns from a century ago.\n\nBut for the old residents of Charleroi, who cherish their distinct heritage and fear that their quality of life is being compromised, it’s mostly downside.\n\nThe evictions, the undercut wages, the car crashes, the cramped quarters, the unfamiliar culture: these are not trivialities, nor are they racist conspiracy theories. They are the signs of a disconcerting reality: Charleroi is a dying town that could not revitalize itself on its own, which made it the perfect target for “revitalization” by elite powers — the federal government, the NGOs, and their local satraps.\n\nThe key question in Charleroi is the fundamental question of politics: Who decides?\n\nThe citizens of the United States, and of Charleroi, have been assured since birth that they are the ultimate sovereign. The government, they were told, must earn the consent of the governed. But the people of Charleroi were never asked if they wanted to submit their borough to an experiment in mass migration. Others chose for them — and slandered them when they objected.\n\nThe decisive factor, which many on the institutional Left would rather conceal, is one of power.\n\nMartha’s Vineyard, when faced with a single planeload of migrants, can evict them in a flash. But Charleroi — the broken man of the Rust Belt — cannot.\n\nThis is the reality of replacement: the strong do what they can, and the weak do what they must.\n\nFrom City Journal.","summary":"Charleroi, already struggling with high rates of poverty and unemployment, has been forced to assimilate thousands of new arrivals from Haiti.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/opinion/how-2000-haitian-migrants-changed-rust-belt-town-of-charleroi-pennsylvania/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-qn9aqvyeh-1728601230444.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728586883&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:16:03","author":"Christina Buttons,Christopher F.

Now Vice President Kamala Harris is enlisting him in her quest to make history and become the first female and first Indian American president.\n\nObama is set to host a rally Thursday in Pittsburgh, a crucial part of this battleground state that he carried twice and may decide whether Harris or Donald Trump wins the presidency.\n\nObama and Harris aides see a connection between what fueled his victories and the vice president’s theory of how to win: supercharge base turnout, max out with Black voters and “lose by less” in the vast rural areas where the margins can be make-or-break.\n\n“They both effectively seized the mantle of change, not just through messaging but through an authentically fresh energy and mentality. That resonates with people in a personal way,” said Jesse Lee, a political consultant who worked in the Obama and Biden White Houses. “Just like Obama, the more she stays authentic and makes it joyous to be on her side — both in the campaign and as president — the more successful she’ll be.”\n\nLee said Obama and Harris both have middle-class roots and faced wealthy Republicans — Obama defeated Mitt Romney by winning the battle of who voters believed cared more about regular people like them, which he said Harris is on her way to replicating.\n\n“A key element of both coalitions was the segment of people that were tempted by the ‘businessman’ but ultimately sided with the candidate who was looking out for people like them,” he said.\n\nPaulette Aniskoff, senior adviser for Harris in Pennsylvania and a former Obama aide, told NBC News that she sees “similarities” between her current and former boss. That begins with a heavy focus by Harris on ground game and door-knocking, which was the “core of the sort of Obama organizing method.”\n\nShe said Obama and Harris share a philosophy of “showing up everywhere” and listening to voters, including in hostile terrain. But she declined to lay out specific targets of how well Harris must do in the cities, suburbs or small towns.\n\n“The puzzle is how to make sure that we get enough votes out of everywhere, including the red counties. We can’t just run up the score in Philadelphia. That’s the old style of organizing — to just go into cities and mobilize,” Aniskoff said. “And when we’re talking about these really small margins that campaigns often come down to, that is how you win.”\n\nEric Schultz, an Obama White House aide who continues to advise him, said that while “no two campaigns are the same,” as times have changed, “there are some parallels.”\n\n“What she has built feels larger than an electoral campaign and more like a movement that represents big ideas like freedom,” Schultz said. “She’s generated a level of excitement that has people rallying around her because of what her election may mean about who we are as a country. Her campaign has been smart and ambitious in using technology to reach young audiences and mobilize supporters.”\n\nHarris’ Black voter puzzle\n\nCentral to Harris’ hopes is to dominate among Black voters and defuse Trump’s bid to make modest gains with younger Black men.\n\nFormer Obama pollster Cornell Belcher said there is “no actual evidence” that a high number of Black men are drifting to Trump in this election. In fact, he said, there has been a “phenomenal” rise in Black voter motivation to turn out since Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the ticket.\n\nDuring the Obama era, the number of Black men voting for Democrats went up but then went right back down after he left office. “She’s got to earn the vote of Black men just like any other group,” Belcher said.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have made “an unprecedented lean in and targeting of African American men,” Belcher said. “Is it smart from a strategic standpoint? Yes, it’s absolutely smart on their side.”\n\nBut, he said, recent polling shows a shift among Black voters in the last month and a half toward Harris’ campaign. “Their motivation-to-vote numbers broadly, and especially in the battleground states, they’ve improved. … She has an opportunity, both in turnout and performance, to see an Obama-like performance by her,” Belcher said.\n\nThat’s a priority for Quentin James, founder and president of the Collective PAC, which launched a $4 million effort primarily aimed at engaging and mobilizing Black male voters for Harris in key battleground states.\n\n“We want to make sure that Black men are showing up to vote in numbers that we haven’t seen since Obama. We think both the threat to democracy as well as the opportunity to provide an amazing future for our kids and our families is at stake,” James said. “And we can’t, obviously, just continue to be frustrated and opt out of the system. We actually have to show up and change the system at the ballot box. So victory and success for us will be record numbers of Black men showing up to vote in November.”\n\nHe said there has been an Obama-like energy with Harris.\n\n“Whether it be fundraising, whether it be the rally sizes, this feels like the Obama days all over again,” he said. “And it’s an important moment to shut down and stop the MAGA movement.”\n\nTrump changes the equation for Harris\n\nRallying a raucous crowd here Wednesday, Trump went after Obama and took care to emphasize his middle name, as he often does, a move critics decry as a racist dog whistle.\n\n“Barack Hussein Obama. Has anyone ever heard of Barack Hussein Obama?” Trump said as the Scranton crowd lit up with boos.\n\nTrump’s candidacy highlights a major difference between the Obama and Harris coalitions. Obama kept the Democratic margins of defeat down in the red rural areas before Trump ran them up sharply with a right-wing populist appeal. But while Obama struggled in the suburbs and among well-educated white voters, many of those voters have soured on the GOP in large part because of Trump’s inflammatory style and anti-democratic tendencies, giving Harris an opportunity.\n\nDemocratic pollster Anna Greenberg cautioned against thinking anybody can replicate Obama’s performances in 2008 and 2012, especially in rural areas and small towns where the bottom has fallen out for Democrats since he left the scene.\n\n“Obama was a phenomenon in ’08,” Greenberg said. “But Hillary Clinton did terribly,” she added, suggesting that a reasonable target for Harris in rural America is somewhere between those two.\n\nJames, the Collective PAC founder, said Obama’s legacy is also at stake this year as he works to help Harris replicate that element of the coalition he built in 2008.\n\n“This is also a bigger political moment where his legacy is at stake, honestly,” he said. “There’s a question of whether his elections were flukes.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSCRANTON, Pa. — Sixteen years ago, Barack Obama made history by becoming&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris aims to revive Obama-era enthusiasm while campaigning in Pennsylvania first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/harris-aims-to-revive-obama-era-enthusiasm-while-campaigning-in-pennsylvania/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-10/241007-kamala-harris-barack-obama-2-up-split-3x2-ac-1151p-3ff6fb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:15:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.503},{"id":259260606,"title":"Obama’s first Harris rally aims at young Pennsylvania voters","text":"PITTSBURGH >> Former President Barack Obama will make his case for Vice President Kamala Harris today during a rally at a Pittsburgh college campus, as Democrats seek to spur young people to vote in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nObama has been a vocal supporter of Harris since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden stepped aside in July following a poor debate performance against Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nObama, whose White House term ended in 2017, is still popular with his party’s base. His rally at the University of Pittsburgh, which he will headline while Harris campaigns in Nevada and Arizona, is the first of several events he plans to do in battleground states across the country in the coming weeks.\n\nObama is not the only former president the Harris campaign plans to deploy.\n\nBill Clinton, a two-term Democratic president and former Arkansas governor, will make stops in Georgia on Sunday and Monday before traveling to North Carolina for a bus tour later in the week in an effort to reach rural voters.\n\nIn remarks slated to begin around 7:15 pm ET (1:15 p.m. Hawaii time), Obama will say Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her running mate, are uniquely positioned to lead the United States at this moment, according to his adviser Eric Schultz.\n\n“He’ll also talk about the enormous stakes and the risks involved in returning President Trump into office,” Schultz said.\n\nYouth are a critical part of the coalition that the Harris campaign hopes will propel her to victory.

To fact-check or not fact-check?\n\n“If it wasn’t so serious, I would just be fascinated by all of it,” said Parker Molloy, media critic and author of The Present Age column on Substack. “If it didn’t have to do with who is going to be president, I would watch this and marvel at how difficult it is to cover one person who seems to challenge all of the rules of journalism.”\n\nBooks and studies will be written about Trump and the press long after he is gone. He’s always been press-conscious and press-savvy, even as a celebrity builder in Manhattan who took a keen interest in what tabloid gossip columns said about him.\n\nMost issues stem from Trump’s disdain for constraints, his willingness to say the outrageous and provably untrue, and for his fans to believe him instead of those reporting on him.\n\nIt has even come full circle, where some experts now think the best way to cover him is to give people a greater opportunity to hear what he said – the opposite of what was once conventional wisdom.\n\n‘Sanewashing’ creates an alternative narrative, some say.\n\nMolloy first used the phrase “sanewashing” this fall to describe a tendency among journalists to launder some of Trump’s wilder or barely coherent statements to make them seem like the cogent pronouncements of a typical politician.\n\nOne example she cited: CNN distilling a Trump post on Truth Social that rambled on about the “radical left” and “fake news” into a straight news lead about the former president agreeing to debate his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAt its best, polishing Trump creates an alternative narrative, she said. At its worst, it’s misinformation.\n\nDuring a Wisconsin rally the last weekend of September, Trump talked of danger from criminals allowed in the country illegally.\n\n“They will walk into your kitchen, they’ll cut your throat,” he said. The New Republic writer Michael Tomasky was surprised not to find the quote in The New York Times’ and Washington Post’s coverage, although The Times noted that Trump vilified undocumented immigrants, and there were other media references to what Trump himself called a dark speech.\n\n“Trump constantly saying extreme, racist violent stuff can’t always be new,” Tomasky wrote.\n\n“But it is always reality. Is the press justified in ignoring reality just because it isn’t new?”\n\nOne likely reason the remark didn’t get that much attention is because Trump – at the same rally – referred to Harris without evidence as “mentally disabled.”\n\nThat comment merited quick mention on the ABC and CBS evening newscasts the next day, in the context of criticism from two fellow Republicans, and after stories about Hurricane Helene’s devastation and war in the Middle East.\n\nNBC’s Nightly News didn’t bring it up at all.\n\nIn other words, Trump said something wild. What’s new? More than sanewashing, political scientist Brian Klaas calls that the banality of crazy, where journalists become accustomed to things Trump says that would be shocking coming from other candidates simply because they’re numbed to it.\n\nIT’S A HARD FIT FOR A DAILY NEWS CYCLE\n\nIlluminating reporting on Trump rarely fits the model of quick news stories that sum up daily developments.\n\n“This really serves the small group of news consumers that we would call news junkies, who follow the campaign day to day,” said Kelly McBride, senior vice president of the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. “But it doesn’t help people decide how to vote, or understand the candidate better.”\n\nTrump critics often complain about how the nation’s leading news outlets cover him. But they sometimes overlook attempts to bring perspective to issues they’re concerned with.\n\nThe Times, for example, used a computer to compare his speeches now with older ones in a story on Sunday, and similarly had a September 9 examination of questions about Trump’s age and mental capacity.\n\nThe Post has written about how Trump doesn’t mention his father’s Alzheimer’s Disease as he attacks others about mental capacity, and distortions about a cognitive test he took.\n\nThe Associated Press wrote of Trump’s Wisconsin rally that he “shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times”.\n\n“Trump is a really difficult figure to cover because he challenges news media processes every day, has for years,” The Times’ Maggie Haberman, one of Trump’s best-known chroniclers, told NPR last month. “The systems… were not built to deal with somebody who says things that are not true as often as he does or speaks as incoherently as he often does. I think the media has actually done a good job showing people who he is, what he says, what he does.”\n\nPress critics may instead be frustrated that the work doesn’t have the impact they seek.\n\n“The people who don’t like or are infuriated by him cannot believe his success and would like the press to somehow persuade the people who do like him that they are wrong,” said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland. “And the press can’t do that.” – David Bauder","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/rallies-fact-checks-and-chaos/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/P24-A_11102024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:07:46","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":259257314,"title":"Kamala Harris leans on Dem heavyweights, stages media blitz as polls show her slipping against Trump","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping famous fellow Democrats and appearances on friendly media outlets will be enough to pull her presidential campaign over the finish line — as a series of polls suggest Republican Donald Trump has the advantage in their race to the White House. \n\nOn Thursday, the same day that former President Barack Obama, 63, held his first rally for Harris in Pittsburgh, Pa., the campaign announced that another former chief executive, Bill Clinton, 78, will make the case for Harris in Georgia and North Carolina.\n\n“The Harris campaign unleashes the Big Dog,” spokesman Ian Sams said in a jubilant tweet that quoted a CNN report about Clinton’s assistance. “Bill Clinton to hit the rural South for Harris this week, stumping in Georgia and eastern North Carolina, ‘going back to a kind of campaigning that he hasn’t done since before he became the “Comeback Kid.”‘”\n\nOn the other side of Pennsylvania, seen by many as the state that will determine whether Trump, 78, or Harris, 59, becomes the 47th president, the Democratic campaign is making a “significant” ad buy on Philadelphia hip-hop and R&B-focused stations in an apparent bid to shore up slipping black support, according to local radio host Dan O’Donnell.\n\nNot inclined to give Pennsylvanians a break, the Harris team also announced she would participate in an Oct. 23 town hall hosted by CNN.\n\nAfter being anointed the Democratic nominee in early August, Harris rode a polling surge to catch and pass Trump both nationally and in battleground states. But with fewer than four weeks to go until the polls close, the picture has darkened for the veep.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics polling average has Trump narrowly leading Harris in five of the seven vital states that will decide the election: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Of those five, only North Carolina went for Trump in 2020. \n\nWhile Harris is clinging on to her polling average lead in Wisconsin, no survey used by RCP has shown her leading Trump in the Badger State since late September.\n\nMore concerning for the VP, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that an internal poll conducted by Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s campaign showed Trump in front of Harris by three percentage points, more than triple the Republican’s winning margin in the state (0.77%) over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nThe Trump campaign piled on Thursday by blasting out internal polls of the seven swing states, showing the Republican up five percentage points in Georgia, three points in Arizona and Nevada, and a single point in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. \n\n“There are lots of Republicans — I say lots — a not insignificant number of Republicans, who say the race is effectively over,” longtime political journalist Mark Halperin said Tuesday on 2WAY’s “Morning Meeting” program.\n\n“[They think] that … Trump is going to lock up the Sun Belt states [Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina], probably all four, but at least three, and then he’s going to win Pennsylvania, and that checkmates [Harris]. They may be wrong, but there’s not an insignificant number of them who are quite confident of that.”\n\nHalperin gave a similar diagnosis Thursday, emphasizing that while Harris could still win, “the snapshot of where we are now is, there are a lot of really worried Democrats and there are really no worried Republicans, including at Mar-a-Lago.”\n\nWhile most surveys show Harris winning clear majorities of women and college-educated white voters, her margins among black and Latino voters lag below what President Biden received in 2020, while Trump swamps her among male voters.\n\nA recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also shows that although black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris compared to Trump, they are less sure that she would make a positive change in the country.\n\nHarris allies appear to be feeling the strain, anonymously griping to Axios in a report published Thursday that the Democratic nominee “seems stuck, even sliding a bit” in surveys of voters in the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — despite out-fundraising Trump and blanketing the airwaves with ads.\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), running for Senate in the Wolverine State, also recently expressed worry about Harris’ standing there.\n\n“I’m not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,” Slotkin said in leaked audio of a virtual campaign event with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).\n\n“We have her underwater in our polling,” Slotkin reportedly added.\n\nOne senior Democratic source told The Post that they were “not in a blue wall panic,” but acknowledged they were concerned by the narrow margins between Harris and Trump and suggested the Democrat’s push for a second debate was rooted in the polling slump.\n\n“The debates help her,” stressed the source, who added the campaign wasn’t doing Harris any favors by booking her on friendly, frothy platforms like the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.\n\nDemocratic pollster Brad Bannon told The Post that Harris’ new campaign strategy was designed to ensure “maximum turnout” of core Democratic constituencies, rather than persuading the vanishingly small number of undecided voters. \n\n“Of course they should be worried about voter turnout,” Bannon said. “And they should be doing everything to generate Democratic-based turnout.”\n\n“She’s clearly worried about her campaign,” a Trump adviser said, pointing to the radio ad spending aimed at black male voters and the launch of a new initiative aimed at Hispanic men called “Hombres con Harris.”\n\n“I think she’s playing defense, not offense,” the person added. “That’s pretty clear.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping famous fellow Democrats and appearances on friendly media outlets will be enough to pull her presidential campaign over the finish line &#8212; as a series of polls suggest Republican Donald Trump has the advantage in their race to the White House.

He went on an eight-minute rant calling for the death penalty","text":"Donald Trump was asked about his family and parenting style at an event in Detroit, Michigan on Thursday.\n\nAt first, his response was on-topic. But his answer quickly devolved into an eight-minute rant about drugs that ended in him explaining why some people convicted of fentanyl-related crimes should face the death penalty.\n\nTrump was speaking at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday afternoon when the rant began. Businessman John Rakolta Jr., who interviewed the former president in front of club members, complimented his parenting style before asking how he made his children “so responsible.”\n\n“You did a great job raising them...What did you do with your children to make them so responsible and so involved in everything that you do?” Rakolta asked Trump.\n\n“Well, I’m fortunate in that, you know, they’re smart children,” Trump responded. \n\n“I have smart children...I would always tell them, no drugs, no alcohol,” he added.\n\nBefore Rakolta could say anything else, Trump then began to discuss fentanyl, claiming he “had that problem almost solved with President Xi [Jinping]” while serving as president. \n\n“Almost all of it comes through Mexico, and the maximum penalty is the death penalty, and he was going to impose that,” Trump said.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has praised the idea of the death penalty for fentanyl-related offenses in China. He made a similar comment in 2018 while serving as president, according to CNN. \n\n“One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States,” Trump tweeted at the time. “It will now be considered a ‘controlled substance.’ This could be a game changer on what is...considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all.”\n\n“Last year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl. If China cracks down on this ‘horror drug,’ using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!” he continued.\n\nThe next year, nine people were imprisoned in China on charges related to smuggling fentanyl into the US. One of those arrested received a suspended death sentence. This marked one of the first cases of its kind between the US and China, Reuters reports.\n\nIn practice, that suspended death sentence will likely be commuted to a life sentence, a Chinese official said at the time, according to Reuters. \n\nTrump went on to blame Biden for his plans going ‘down the tubes’ and explained why the death penalty could help solve “a lot of the problem.”\n\n“And then we had the transfer power, and this guy came in, and he didn’t know what to do with everything, so that went down the tubes,” Trump said. “But one of the first things I’m going to do is talk to him about that, because they were going to give the death penalty to anybody sending fentanyl into this country, and that would have really solved a lot of the problem.”\n\n“First time I met [President Xi], I said, ‘Do you have a drug problem?’ ‘No, no, no,’ 1.4 billion people. ‘And why don’t you have a drug problem?’ He says, ‘Death penalty. Quick trial...The dealer is immediately put on trial,’” Trump continued.\n\nHe ended his rant by, again, calling for the death penalty for fentanyl-related offenses.\n\n“Everybody in this room knows a lot of people that...lost a child to fentanyl, and that wouldn’t have happened if we had the death penalty,” the former president said. “But the country’s going to have to tell us that they’re ready for it because you know, it’s a pretty big step.”\n\nThe death sentence can only be handed down if someone has been convicted of a capital offense. These offenses include murder, treason, genocide, as well as the killing or kidnapping of a Congressperson, the President or a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nNotably, drug trafficking is not a capital offense.\n\nSince 1971, more than 1,600 people have been executed by the US government. At least 200 people executed in the last 50 years were wrongfully convicted, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which is an average of four people per year.","summary":"Trump explained why fentanyl-related offenses should receive the death penalty when asked about his kids","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-fentanyl-death-penalty-b2627521.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/10/22/SEI225188959.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:06:53","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":259257316,"title":"Hypocrite Kamala Harris is using deadly storms for political gain, and it’s gross","text":"Hurricane Milton tore through the west coast of Florida, ripping the roof off Tropicana Field — and doing serious damage to the floundering Kamala Harris campaign.\n\nWith her gale force winds of desperation, the veep has tried so hard to appear presidential by inserting herself into the storm effort this week.\n\nBut she’s come across like a party crasher trying to get into the VIP section of an A-list soiree. A political interloper. A useless limb.\n\nOr, as Florida governor Ron DeSantis said more bluntly this morning on “Squawk Box”: “She has no role in this process.”\n\nStill, Harris worked the phones as Milton blew in, calling in to the Weather Channel and CNN to blast Donald Trump and DeSantis for politicizing the disasters. Oh, the hypocrisy.\n\nLast night she posted to her VP account on X a video conversation with St. Petersburg, Fla., mayor Ken Welch — a shamelessly transparent campaign ad that had all the authenticity of a Canal Street Gucci belt.\n\n“Thank you for just answering the call to lead in the way that you have in a time of crisis,” Harris said. “Folks are looking in your eyes to see something in you that lets them know that everything is going to be OK.” \n\nWelch, who had a lot on his plate, clearly tossed her campaign a bone as he said he appreciated “her partnership.” \n\nSounding like a disinterested customer service agent reading a script, a performative Harris offered Welch this inanity as his city was threatened by 100-mph winds and more than 18 inches of rain: “Know that you are invited to give any feedback about what you might need in real time because you’re the leadership on the ground, so you know what your folks need.”\n\nThis Harris clean-up effort all kicked off Monday, when it was reported that DeSantis, who was dealing with both the aftermath of Helene and the incoming Milton, ignored her call. \n\nAsked directly about the reported snub, Harris dug in. \n\n“Playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations — these are the height of emergency situations — is just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish, and it is about political gamesmanship,” said the candidate, who was already facing backlash for finally breaking her media fast and traveling to New York as parts of the country were battered and without power.\n\nAn exasperated DeSantis, who has a proven reputation for stellar hurricane preparedness and recovery, said he had no clue the VP even called. \n\n“I’ve been dealing with these storms in Florida under both Trump and Biden. Neither of them ever politicized it,” he told CNBC.\n\nOn “The View,” the “brat” candidate doubled down, saying that she spoke to governors from both parties and “Obviously this is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe is for others.”\n\nThen she called CNN and accused Trump of spreading “disinformation” about FEMA in the aftermath of town-destroying Hurricane Helene.\n\n“We all know it’s dangerous, and the gamesmanship has to stop. At some point the politics has to end, especially in a moment of crisis,” Harris told Dana Bash.\n\nIt’s like she’s been unburdened of her self-awareness.\n\nOn to the Weather Channel, where Harris spoke with meteorologist Mike Bettes who asked her about DeSantis. Harris said it wasn’t a time to point fingers, then did just that. \n\n“Anybody who considers themselves to be a leader should really be in the business right now of giving people a sense of confidence that we’re all working together and that we have the resources and the ability to work together on their behalf,” she said.\n\nThe network noted that Trump had also been offered an interview but did not respond. (Eric Trump tweeted that his family housed over 275 power linemen at their Trump Doral property in Miami, so perhaps there were other tasks at hand.)\n\nEven more jarring, Joe Biden seems to gleefully be leaving Harris out in the cold — reiterating how DeSantis was “cooperative” and “doing a great job.” Is this part of bitter Biden’s revenge since being shivved in the back by his party?\n\nWhen a reporter asked the president if DeSantis should take Harris’ call, Biden dodged the question.\n\n“All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Gov. DeSantis. He’s been very gracious. He’s thanked me for all we’ve done. He knows what we’re doing. And I think that’s important.”\n\nBut Harris is right. A natural disaster is about the safety of Americans — and not a time to wade into politics. It’s a shame she spent the last few days doing it.","summary":"Hurricane Milton tore through the west coast of Florida, ripping the roof off Tropicana Field — and doing serious damage to the floundering Kamala Harris campaign.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/opinion/hypocrite-kamala-harris-using-deadly-storms-for-political-gain/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/kamala-weather-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:05:54","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":259257566,"title":"Univision Town Hall: Kamala Harris FREE stream | Watch today","text":"The Univision Town Hall: Kamala Harris airs today, Thursday, Oct. 10, at 10 p.m. Eastern on Univision.\n\nIf you are a cable cord cutter and want to watch Harris speak, you can do so with a free trial on FuboTV or DirecTV Stream.

If they care about journalistic integrity, they would conduct an investigation or release the full transcript.”\n\nA second CBS source said the discrepancy in the answers makes it seem that the network’s flagship show is “biased.”\n\n“Their credibility has been called into question and their impartiality has been called into question,” the source said. “Don’t you need a full-throated review of what went wrong?”\n\nOn Thursday, CBS again declined multiple requests from The Post to release the full transcript. \n\nThe network did not comment on whether it planned on launching a probe into the matter. \n\nHowever, CBS has a history of both releasing full transcripts of its news programs and launching probes. \n\nIn 2013, the network investigated a “60 Minutes” segment by correspondent Lara Logan about a terror attack on the US compound in Benghazi that left Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. \n\nThe probe, led by then-executive director of standards and practices Al Ortiz, discredited the reporting, finding it “deficient in several respects.” Logan and her producer were asked to take a leave of absence. \n\nTwo sources suggested CBS tap Ortiz, who retired in 2012 after 43 years at the network, to conduct an outside review of the Harris interview. \n\nOrtiz did not respond to requests for comment. \n\nCBS also has released full transcripts in the past. It published Catherine Herridge’s 2020 interview with Trump, as well as Jan Crawford’s 2019 interview with then-Attorney General Bill Barr. \n\nEarlier this year, “60 Minutes” provided Bloomberg News with a full transcript of its interview with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nReleasing a full transcript would provide clarity about where Harris’ answer came from — but it also may raise more questions about “60 Minutes'” impartiality. \n\nOther networks also publish full transcripts of high-profile interviews that are unedited, such as ABC News’ interview with President Biden in July and CNN’s sit-down with Harris and her running mate Tim Waltz in August.\n\nAt issue for CBS are two clips that have circulated on social media side-by-side showing a discrepancy in Harris’ answers to the same question. \n\nIn the “Face the Nation” clip, a wide shot reveals Whitaker asking Harris about Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \n\n“But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,” he says.\n\nHarris replies: “Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.”\n\nOn “60 Minutes,” the camera is zoomed in on Whitaker, who asks the same question. \n\n“We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nA network insider said it is the same shot of Whitaker just a tighter focus on the correspondent’s face. \n\nThe insider did not know why “60 Minutes” aired a tight shot of Whitaker. \n\n“Why is the answer to the same question so different?” the former CBS News staffer asked. “This needs to be answered. Was this answer the continuation of a longer answer or was it an answer that came much later in the interview.”\n\nFormer CBS journalists said it is possible that there was a miscommunication between the show and the department that edits promotions as “60 Minutes” was still editing the show when the promo went out. \n\nIn a best-case scenario, Harris’ answer to “60 Minutes” may have come shortly after the wordy answer she gave in the “Face the Nation” clip. \n\nThey said if her answer was part of an extended answer to the same question then no journalistic malpractice was committed.\n\nBut if the answer came from another question about Israel and was made to look like an answer to Whitaker’s question, then it’s ethically problematic.\n\n“’60 Minutes’ holds itself to the highest journalistic standards,” the former CBS staffer said. “Releasing the transcript would answer everyone’s questions and it would allow them to stand behind the integrity of the story they broadcast.”\n\n“The stakes are too high. It’s a presidential election. Trump is asking for the transcript and journalists are asking for answers,” the source concluded.\n\nThe discrepancy in the clips has caused the Internet to spin theories that “60 Minutes” took an answer from another part of the interview and doctored it to look like an answer to Whitaker’s question in order for the Harris to look better. \n\nIt is also unclear if Harris was allowed to answer the same question in another take.\n\nSources close to the network have said the interview was edited for time constraints and clarity but that still doesn’t answer the larger question of where Harris’ response came from and why was it edited that way. \n\nThe source added that “Face The Nation” had a longer version of the exchange on “60 Minutes” and that it was a “normal edit.”\n\n“It is normal practice for every television broadcast to edit for time,” offered a television news insider. “There is no deceit.”\n\nThe Harris campaign distanced itself from CBS’ edit snafu on Wednesday evening amid speculation from sources that their may have been pressure from the vice president’s team to run a more succinct, stronger answer. \n\n“We do not control CBS’s production decisions and refer questions to CBS,” an aide for the Harris campaign told Variety. \n\nIn recent days, Trump accused CBS of “election interference,” posting on Truth Social Tuesday : “A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes. Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.”\n\nHe continued: “A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal. TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. Election Interference.”\n\nOn Thursday, Federal Communications Commission chair Jessica Rosenworcel pushed back on Trump’s attacks on the broadcast station. She called his demand to strip CBS of its license “threats against free speech” that “should not be ignored.”","summary":"The long-running news show has come under fire after allegedly cleaning up the Democratic presidential candidate's answer to a question from \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker about Israel that aired during a special episode on Monday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/10/media/ex-cbs-staffers-call-for-outside-probe-of-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris-amid-editing-scandal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/60-minutes-election-special-bill-91375865.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ttPJwcT2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-10 23:03:16","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":259257654,"title":"Letters: S.J.

Harris has also said she would invoke the USMCA’s renegotiation provision.\n\nRecent polls show the two are locked in a tight race, with the outcome likely to be decided by narrow margins in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nIn a speech largely focused on economics, Trump in Detroit blasted what he called the “twin disasters” of China joining the World Trade Organization and the launch of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a free-trade deal that preceded the USMCA.\nHe also touted his pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in his first week in office as president; slapping tariffs on Chinese cars and steel; and negotiating the phase-one trade deal with Beijing.\nTrump’s presidency ushered in a bilateral trade war that led to tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions’ worth of mainland goods.

With 400,000 people spread over 164 square miles, it has swank subdivisions, working-class neighborhoods and the high-end resort where Donald Trump will hold a rally Friday to highlight a city turned into “a war zone” by immigrants, in the words of his campaign.\n\nThe reality is much different from the one Trump has been portraying to his rally attendees. As with many other American cities, Aurora’s crime rate is actually declining.\n\nThe matter that brought the Denver suburb to Trump’s attention occurred in August in a single block of the city, in an apartment complex housing Venezuelan migrants.\n\nIt was then that video surfaced of heavily armed men going door to door in the complex, where the New York-based owners claimed a Venezuelan gang was extorting rent from tenants. Someone was shot and killed outside the complex around the time the video was recorded, police said.\n\nNow, two months later, authorities say they have identified six suspects and arrested one. Tenants of the building say police check in regularly and that the area is safe.\n\n“They left, and it’s been nice and calm,” said Edward Ramirez, 38, of the gunmen as he climbed into his car this week. He was one of more than a dozen of tenants who said the threat has ebbed. “It’s quiet, we can work, it’s normal.”\n\nAurora’s crime rate has followed a downward trend seen across the country, a decline that has overlapped with the influx of Venezuelans fleeing their country who have funneled into Colorado and other cities nationwide.\n\nMultiple studies show immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. But Aurora also is an example of how Trump has been able to use real but isolated episodes of migrant violence to tar an entire population. He uses those examples to paint a picture of a country in chaos due to what he regularly calls an immigrant “invasion.”\n\n“Do you see what they’re doing in Colorado? They’re taking over,” Trump, who often warns of “migrant crime,” said of Venezuelan gang members during a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday. “They’re taking over real estate. They become real estate developers from Venezuela. They have equipment that our military doesn’t have.”\n\nTrump’s sweeping claims about Aurora — his campaign’s announcement of the rally calls the city “a war zone,” linking to a story in the conservative New York Post that uses those words — have drawn sharp rebukes from local residents.\n\n“Former President Trump’s visit to Aurora is an opportunity to show him and the nation that Aurora is a considerably safe city — not a city overrun by Venezuelan gangs,” Mayor Mike Coffman, who was a sometimes Trump critic when he served as a Republican congressman, said in a statement. “The reality is that the concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated.”\n\nAurora did see a “slight” uptick in crime that coincided with the arrival of large numbers of Venezuelans in the city during September 2023, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain told a press conference last month. But that increase has since ebbed. According to Aurora police data, there were 12% fewer major crimes in the city — ranging from homicide to vehicle theft — last month than in September 2023.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about how it supports its claim that the city is a “war zone” as crime is declining.\n\nThe migrants began arriving in Denver at the end of 2022, which Colorado crime statistics show was the peak of a steady increase in crime in the state since the pandemic. In 2023, when Venezuelans became a staple on some Denver streetcorners selling flowers or offering quick car windshield washes, frustrating many Colorado voters, crime dropped statewide.\n\nAurora’s city council passed a resolution opposing resettlement of the migrants in their city, but nonprofits found willing landlords to take some, anyway. Others moved independently, drawn by cheaper rents.\n\nTrump has claimed Venezuela and other countries are emptying their prisons, mental institutions and “insane asylums” to send dangerous people to the U.S. and has contended that Venezuela’s notoriously violent capital of Caracas is safer than many U.S. cities. The latter claim drew disbelief from Venezuelan migrants who say they feel safe in Aurora.\n\n“It’s a thousand times better than Venezuela here,” said Dexe Medina, 44, as she left the Aurora apartment complex.\n\nThe neighborhood where many Venezuelans settled has long been one of Aurora’s rougher stretches, close to Colfax Boulevard, a sometimes run-down drag that bills itself as the nation’s longest street and runs from Aurora west through neighboring Denver and into the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nLongtime residents say they’ve heard the occasional gunshot for years, but things seem relatively calm now.\n\n“Honestly, this general area has improved,” said Diego Garcia, 18, a high school senior who lives a block away from the complex where the video was filmed. “It used to be a lot worse.”\n\nThough residents feel safer, they acknowledge that the days in August when the armed men roamed the neighborhood were terrifying.\n\nDustin Zvonek, an Aurora City councilman, stressed that Aurora remains a safe city with falling crime, but warned against minimizing specific problems like those in the apartment complexes. He noted that residents of the buildings and its immediate neighbors haven’t been assuaged when told crime is dropping overall.\n\n“It’s always not a big deal,” Zvonek said, “until it happens to you.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is coming to a Colorado city where crime is down to warn about the danger he says criminal migrants pose to voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-ap-colorado-venezuelan-denver-b2627546.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/11/00/Election_2024_Trump_68386.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-10 22:57:36","author":"Nicholas Riccardi","authors":["Nicholas Riccardi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.005},{"id":259257978,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Strikes Back at Donald Trump: ‘How Dumb Are You?’","text":"Whoopi Goldberg and her View co-host Sunny Hostin fired back at Donald Trump, a day after the former president railed against them during Pennsylvania rallies for interviewing Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n Speaking at his rally Wednesday, Trump had called Goldberg “filthy, dirty, disgusting,” which the comedian embraced in her response Thursday. “I was filthy and stand on that fact.

She responded, “In this crisis — like in so many issues that affect the people of our country — I think it so important that leadership recognizes the dignity” to which people are entitled.\n\n“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,” Harris added.\n\nThose comments came after the former president spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, offering sympathy to people affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, the latter of which came ashore in Florida Wednesday night. But Trump also suggested that the Biden administration’s response had been lacking, particularly in North Carolina after Helene.\n\n“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” said Trump, who has for several days promoted falsehoods about the federal response.\n\nHarris virtually attended a briefing, held in the White House Situation Room with President Joe Biden, on emergency efforts in Milton’s wake. In subsequent comments to reporters, Biden slammed Trump for spreading misinformation about federal assistance available to victims, including falsely claiming that it was capped at $750. In reality, that is just for immediate needs, the first potential payout rather than the total.\n\n“That $750 that they’re talking about, Mr. Trump and all those other people know it’s a lie to suggest that’s all they’re going to get,” Biden said Thursday. “It’s just bizarre. They got to stop this. They’re being so damn un-American with the way they’re talking about this stuff.”\n\nAsked if he planned to speak with Trump to urge him to stop, Biden said no, but followed that with a message he delivered directly into television cameras: “Mr. President Trump, former President Trump, get a life, man. Help these people.”\n\nDespite the storm, Trump and Harris are both visiting key swing states strategically, trying to increase support with key voting blocs who could decide an election expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nIn Michigan, where he’s looking to appeal to primarily to blue-collar voters, Trump took a swipe at the city he happened to be campaigning in, suggesting that Detroit was “a mess.”\n\n“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” he said of Harris. “You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nTrump’s economic speech featured multiple errors\n\nThe former president used his appearance at the Detroit Economic Club to echo core themes from his 2016 campaign, saying some other countries, especially China, are ripping the U.S. off and taking manufacturing business away. Trump said powerful companies have “raped” the United States. He vowed to impose huge tariffs that he said would force other countries to negotiate what they charge on American products.\n\n“They’ve been screwing us for so many years that we’re allowed to get some of that back,” Trump said about charging tariffs from countries.\n\nEconomists warn Trump’s proposed tariffs would drive up consumer costs. Trump has also claimed, without providing specifics, that he can use tariffs to reduce the U.S. budget deficit and pay for an expansion of childcare funding, even as he proposes other ideas without saying how he would replace the lost funding. He also proposed new tax breaks for overseas Americans subject to so-called “double taxation” and deductions for auto loan interest.\n\nBut the former president seemed to not understand the difference between the budget deficit and trade imbalances, conflating the two different economic measures as essentially being the same thing.\n\nHe noted that the federal government has nearly $36 trillion in total debt, a byproduct of the annual borrowing needed to cover the gap between tax revenues and government spending. Except Trump then seemed to indicate that the debt was a byproduct of the trade deficit with China — which is a separate issue that reflects the difference between how much a country exports and how much it imports.\n\n“We have $36 trillion in debt,” Trump said. “For years and years and years, we’ve been accumulating. We’d have these deficits that are monstrous. We had 5,6,7 $800 billion deficit with China.”\n\nHe also claimed that “we had the highest job numbers in my administration,” but that isn’t true any longer. The unemployment rate fell slightly lower under Biden — to 3.4% early last year, the lowest in a half-century, below 3.5% before the pandemic under Trump.\n\nHarris looks to boost Hispanic support\n\nHarris is campaigning out West and had a rally coming Thursday night in Phoenix after participating in the Univision town hall. She’s looking to increase support among Hispanic voters, especially men.\n\nHer campaign began a group this week known as “Hombres con Harris” — Spanish for “Men for Harris” — that is planning to hold events at Latino-owned small businesses, union halls, barbecues and community events until Election Day.\n\nAt the Univision event, which was titled, “Latinos Ask, Kamala Harris Responds,” Ivett Castillo, 40 and a Las Vegas resident, told Harris that she’s an American citizen born to two Mexican parents and that her mother died six weeks ago. She cried as she asked the vice president about “plans to support that subgroup of immigrants here their whole lives and who live and die in the shadows.” When the town hall ended, Harris went over and clasped hands with Castillo, whose face was still streaked with tears.\n\nIn response to her question, Harris noted that Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office seeking to create pathways to U.S. citizenship for many people in the country illegally that was never considered.\n\nUnauthorized border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration before declining this year after the president issued an executive order restricting asylum claims.\n\nAnother audience member asked Harris to explain how she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, prompting her to respond, “President Biden made a decision that I think history will show was probably one of the most courageous a president could make.”\n\nShe said Biden “put country before personal interest” and “urged me to run.”\n\nHispanic voters are about evenly split on whether to trust Harris or Trump to do a better job handling the economy, but they give the former president an edge on handling immigration. Hispanic women are more likely to trust Harris to better handle the economy and immigration, and Hispanic men are more likely to trust Trump on both issues, according to polling from The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Barack Obama hit the campaign trail Thursday night, making his first appearance for Harris at a rally in Pittsburgh. Obama’s team says he will focus on swing states, especially those with key Senate races. Biden has just made one joint campaign appearance with Harris since he himself left the race in July.\n\nAmong those attending was Glenda Ellison, a 71-year-old retired schoolteacher and Democrat from Pittsburgh. She said she is feeling “a little nervous” about the election but “prayerful that it’s going to turn out in our favor.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

With its performative bravado and proneness to saber-rattling, the Trump-led GOP has branded itself as the party most aligned with the armed services. And yet, Republicans have been waging a quiet war on service members’ voting rights. The latest example is a lawsuit filed by six House Republicans out of Pennsylvania, all of whom voted not to certify Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. The suit baselessly claims that their state’s process for voters who register overseas — a group that includes many service members and their families — is susceptible to election fraud. The Washington Post noted that critics say the lawsuit could lead to thousands of eligible ballots being disqualified and added: This is part of a trend we’ve been seeing play out in swing states, where Republicans have filed multiple lawsuits designed to needlessly sow doubt about the veracity of the election results and the electoral process. GOP officials have filed lawsuits in North Carolina and Michigan targeting overseas voting, as Donald Trump and Elon Musk push conspiracy theories about these voters. And in Michigan, Republicans have filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from using some Veterans Affairs offices in the state as voter registration sites. The suit has been denounced by veterans advocates. All of this is odd, no? With the GOP’s rhetoric, one might think that Republicans would steer clear of doing anything that could infringe on the voting rights of America’s service members.

While, TD Cowen's Jeff Osborne expects Musk to reveal the Cybercab and perhaps the Model 2, a lower-cost electric vehicle, he said he doesn't expect much of a change on self-driving technology.\"We expect the event to be light on details and appeal to the true long-term believers in Tesla,\" Osborne wrote in a note. Musk's claims on the readiness of Full Self Driving, though, will be crucial \"given past delays and ongoing scrutiny\" of the system and of Tesla's less-sophisticated Autopilot driver-assist software.\"Politicization of Elon\"Tesla's model lineup is struggling and isn't likely to be refreshed until late next year at the earliest, Osborne wrote. Plus, he wrote that in TD Cowen's view the \"politicization of Elon\" is tarnishing the Tesla brand among Democrat buyers in the U.S.Musk has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and has pushed many conservative causes. Last weekend he joined Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.Musk has been saying for more than five years that a fleet of robotaxis is near, allowing Tesla owners to make money by having their cars carry passengers while they're not in use by the owners. But he has acknowledged that past predictions for the use of autonomous driving proved too optimistic. In 2019, he promised the fleet of autonomous vehicles by the end of 2020. \"We, Robot\" robotaxi eventHowever, Wedbush's Ives, who is bullish on Tesla stock, wrote that the robotaxi event, dubbed \"We, Robot,\" by the company, will be a new chapter of growth for Tesla.Ives expects many updates and details from Tesla on the robotaxi, plus breakthroughs in Full Self Driving and artificial intelligence. He also is looking for a phased-in strategy for rolling out the robotaxis within the next year, as well as a Tesla ride-sharing app, and demonstrations of technology \"designed to revolutionize urban transportation.\"Ives, whose organization will attend the invitation-only event at the Warner Bros. studio, wrote that he also expects updates on Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, which the company plans to start selling in 2026.\"We believe this is a pivotal time for Tesla as the company prepares to release its years of Robotaxi R&D shadowed behind the curtains, while Musk & Co. lay out the company's vision for the future,\" Ives wrote.The announcement comes as U.S. safety regulators are investigating Full Self Driving and Autopilot based on evidence that it has a weak system for making sure human drivers pay attention. In addition, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration forced Tesla to recall Full Self-Driving in February because it allowed speeding and violated other traffic laws, especially near intersections. Tesla was to fix the problems with an online software update.Last April in Snohomish County, Washington, near Seattle, a Tesla using Full Self-Driving hit and killed a motorcyclist, authorities said. The Tesla driver told authorities that he was using the system while looking at his phone when the car rear-ended the motorcyclist. The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.NHTSA says it's evaluating information on the fatal crash from Tesla and law enforcement officials. The Justice Department also has sought information from Tesla about Full Self-Driving and Autopilot, as well as other items. What time is Tesla robotaxi event?Tesla's robotaxi event will be held at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, on Thursday, October 10. Tesla will livestream the event on X at 7 p.m. PT and 10 p.m. ET.A countdown to the event can be found on the Tesla homepage. \"This counter will come to a close as the opening remarks of the event begin. Later on, Elon Musk's presentation and Robotaxi demonstrations will follow,\" according to Tesla Oracle.","summary":"Skeptics say CEO Elon Musk has yet to show Tesla's self-driving system can travel safely without human supervision.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-robotaxi-event-cybercab-hollywood-thursday/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/10/921ec375-bbd7-43eb-95d5-3c46af636ee3/thumbnail/1200x630/3d9876f58b9a323eec591d21744f89b0/ap24284721891139.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42effd073","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/10/03/2377548355594/3255504_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-10 22:35:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":259257554,"title":"Trump vows to renegotiate USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico","text":"MORE POLITICS NEWS \n\n Trump vows to renegotiate USMCA free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico\n\n Ottawa announces $4.9M oil recovery operation on B.C. shipwreck from 1946\n\n Poilievre, Guilbeault claim victory after federal budget watchdog's updated carbon tax report\n\n Poilievre says 'other ways' to address affordability for seniors than Bloc's proposed pension boost\n\n Hajdu, Woodhouse Nepinak urge MPs to drop politics, support First Nations water bill\n\n Bloc leader, MPs and farmers press Senate to pass supply management bill\n\n Focus on possibly treasonous MPs could become 'kangaroo court': ex-minister\n\n Poilievre supports mandatory drug, psychiatric treatment for kids, prisoners\n\n Jagmeet Singh pulls NDP out of deal with Trudeau Liberals, takes aim at Poilievre Conservatives\n\n NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has pulled his party out of the supply-and-confidence agreement that had been helping keep Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority Liberals in power.\n\n 'Not the result we wanted': Trudeau responds after surprise Conservative byelection win in Liberal stronghold\n\n Conservative candidate Don Stewart winning the closely-watched Toronto-St. Paul's federal byelection, and delivering a stunning upset to Justin Trudeau's candidate Leslie Church in the long-time Liberal riding, has sent political shockwaves through both parties.\n\n 'We will go with the majority': Liberals slammed by opposition over proposal to delay next election\n\n The federal Liberal government learned Friday it might have to retreat on a proposal within its electoral reform legislation to delay the next vote by one week, after all opposition parties came out to say they can't support it.\n\n Budget 2024 prioritizes housing while taxing highest earners, deficit projected at $39.8B\n\n In an effort to level the playing field for young people, in the 2024 federal budget, the government is targeting Canada's highest earners with new taxes in order to help offset billions in new spending to enhance the country's housing supply and social supports.\n\n 'One of the greatest': Former prime minister Brian Mulroney commemorated at state funeral\n\n Prominent Canadians, political leaders, and family members remembered former prime minister and Progressive Conservative titan Brian Mulroney as an ambitious and compassionate nation-builder at his state funeral on Saturday.\n\n opinion | \n\n Don Martin: Gusher of Liberal spending won't put out the fire in this dumpster\n\n A Hail Mary rehash of the greatest hits from the Trudeau government’s three-week travelling pony-show, the 2024 federal budget takes aim at reversing the party’s popularity plunge in the under-40 set, writes political columnist Don Martin.

Vance’s transparently racist campaign against Haitian migrants. Baldwin Wallace University’s Community Research Institute surveyed 877 registered voters across Ohio, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 1, and found that a whopping 84% of those respondents favored teaching America’s history of systemic racism. Respondents were specifically asked about what educators should teach, whether prayer belongs in school and if parents should have control over what students are taught in classrooms. The results indicate that while Republicans would have us believe that most Americans prefer a more conservative approach to educating the youth — which would include giving parents more say so when it comes to educational material, whitewashing Black history in order to preserve white America’s delusional perception of their “shining city on the hill,” and generally pretending the LGBTQ community doesn’t exist — voters prefer a more progressive approach. From Cleveland.com: They’re the same questions the team asked in 2022, when critical race theory was a hot-button issue in political races. Lauren Copeland, director of BW’s Community Research Institute, said they asked again to see whether public opinion had changed. The results? The vast majority of Ohio voters continue to support – and have even strengthened support for – teaching the history and impact of race and racism in the United States and sexual orientation in schools. They also prefer to keep parental opinions out of the classroom. In 2022, 75% of respondents supported teaching race and racism, and 57% supported teaching students in sixth through twelfth grade about sexual orientation. Today, numbers have increased to 84% and 61%, respectively, the latest results show. The margin of error for most of the questions in the survey is plus or minus 4%. “I think this says conservative politicians may try to use issues like curriculum and critical race theory as wedge issues in elections to try to mobilize their base, but that these issues don’t resonate with the electorate at large,” Copeland said. “What these results show is that Ohioans largely trust the schools to teach on issues such as race and racism and on sexual orientation.” Ohio Democratic Rep.Joyce Beatty, Source: Bill Clark / Getty The numbers don’t lie Here’s how the percentages in favor of teaching the truth break down: 94% of Democrats, 84% of Independents–and a surprising 78% of Republicans surveyed agreed that students learning about the history of racism in America, including its impact on modern society is important. And, 68% agreed that teachers are doing a good job of teaching these subjects in an unbiased manner, and that the concepts taught to students are age-appropriate. The results of the survey became notably less progressive when it came to the subject of teaching about gender identity. While 61% of respondents favored teaching students from the sixth through twelfth grades about sexual orientation, only 43% supported teaching about gender fluidity. Either way, though, more than half of the respondents agreed that, while book-banning Republican officials have tried to frame their war on wokeness as a fight for parental rights, the truth is parents need to fall back and let educators do their jobs. More from Cleaveland.com: While 56% of respondents opposed giving parents the ability to stop schools from teaching topics they do not like, only 52% opposed giving parents a say over which books are available in school libraries, results show. Responses strongly followed party lines. Roughly 74% of Democrats and 61% of Independent voters favored keeping parents out of the classroom, compared with 39% of Republicans. Meanwhile, 66% of Democrats and 59% of Independents favored keeping parents out of libraries, compared with 38% of Republicans. Unsurprisingly, Republican respondents were the reason why the results were as close as they were regarding parental control. It’s not necessarily that parents shouldn’t have a say — they have a right to know what their kids are being taught, after all — but what we’ve been seeing in white conservative America is parents trying to enforce their ideologies into the education system. The result of that has been blatant propaganda against critical race theory, LGBTQ+ studies, and the ubiquitous thing they call “woke.” Arguably, the most nefarious aspect of this right-wing projection is that conservatives pretend they represent popular opinion in America, and studies keep indicating that is not the case.

The president told Donald Trump to ‘get a life’ as he spent the quick briefing slamming the former president and his allies for spreading disinformation about the federal government’s response to the concurrent storms.\n\n‘It’s bizarre,’ Biden said of claims online that FEMA is only giving $750 in aid and will try to seize Americans’ land if they reach out to the government for relief. As the president wrapped the briefing, he was asked if he has spoken with Trump. ‘Are you kidding me?’ the 81-year-old chuckled awkwardly.\n\nHe then delivered a message to the former president: ‘Mr. President Trump, former President Trump – get a life man, help these people.’ As he began to walk out of the room Biden stopped in his tracks and abruptly turned around when asked if he plans to hold the 2024 Republican nominee accountable for spreading lies.\n\n‘The public will hold him accountable. You better – the press,’ he said pointing his finger at reporters, ‘hold him accountable because you know the truth.’ Asked if he plans to speak with Trump, Biden said without turning around and as he was halfway out of the room: ‘No.’\n\nBefore that point, Biden gave a very off-color joke when a reporter tried to ask an off-topic question about the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas terrorists operating out of Gaza. ‘What did Prime Minister Netanyahu tell you about his plans related to retaliation?’ a reporter posed.\n\n‘He’s coming over to help with the storm,’ Biden clapped back. The White House revealed that Biden spoke for 30 minutes with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the conflict but did not share specific details of their conversation.\n\nAs reporters continue to press for answers about the ongoing conflict, Biden and his team were focused on keeping Thursday’s discussion about rescue, recovery and relief plans to deal with Hurricanes Milton and Helene. And the president wanted to make sure that Americans are not listening to what Trump is saying about the federal response.\n\n‘Our fellow Americans are putting their lives on the line to do this dangerous work and received – some receive death penalties (sic) yesterday as a result of reckless, irresponsible and relentless disinformation and outright lies that continue to flow,’ Biden said in appearing to mix up the word ‘threats’ and ‘penalties.’\n\n‘These lies are also harmful to those who most need help,’ Biden added in Thursday’s briefing. ‘Lives are on the line. People are in desperate situations.’ ‘Have the decency to tell them the truth,’ he demanded of the former president.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?
