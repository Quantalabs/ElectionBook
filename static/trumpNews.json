may be working together more closely than ever before, but U.S. intelligence analysts think that for now, they are falling short of forming a tight-knit alliance that could more effectively counter the United States.\n\nConcerns among the United States and its allies about growing cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been increasing steadily since Moscow launched its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine — sustained by intelligence showing Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang providing Russia with technology, missiles, drones and even troops for the war effort.\n\nThe former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific earlier this year went as far as to describe the growing ties between the four U.S. adversaries as a nascent \"axis of evil.\"\n\nYet U.S. intelligence officials believe the axis, in some ways, has been bogged down by its own shortcomings.\n\n\"They're not acting as a bloc,\" said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, speaking Thursday in Washington at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\"We don't see them as a sort of four-part alliance or something along those lines,\" she said. \"We don't see them likely as becoming allies in the same way that we are allies with our NATO partners, for example — that kind of level of interoperability and military collaboration.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts, however, still see the axis as a concern on several fronts.\n\nHaines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has contributed to a further erosion of international norms around weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhere Russia and China were once more willing to cooperate with the United States and the West on nuclear counterproliferation, Moscow and Beijing now seem more inclined to give Iran and North Korea additional leeway.\n\n\"In large part, that's because Russia is now beholden to some extent to both the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and to Iran for advanced weapons, for ammunition, for things that they need in the context of their fight with Ukraine,\" Haines said.\n\n\"They're less likely to push back,\" she said. \"And of course, we've been watching the degree to which they actually, for example, accept DPRK as a nuclear weapon power.\"\n\nHaines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has helped all four countries to evade sanctions.\n\nAnd she said there are even some indications that Russia is willing to take action that would allow Beijing to surpass the U.S. in critical areas.\n\n\"They're willing to potentially put more on the table with China to give them things that could actually make China sort of leapfrog in certain technology areas or in other spaces that are of concern to us,\" Haines said.\n\nWashington's NATO allies have sounded similar alarms in recent months, with some NATO officials telling VOA the axis has already sparked the beginnings of a new global arms race.\n\nRussian sabotage\n\nThere are also ongoing concerns about the willingness of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea to engage in so-called gray zone activity.\n\nA declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate issued in July warned that the next five to six years are \"likely to feature more frequent, diverse and damaging acts of coercion and subversion — particularly by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea — below what constitutes armed conflict but outside the bounds of historically legitimate statecraft.\"\n\nHaines on Thursday said Russian gray zone activities — including efforts at sabotage in Europe — have been \"increasing across the board.\"\n\n\"Russia has just invested money, personnel, just an extraordinary amount of effort in this area and just will continue to do so,\" she said. \"And even though we are getting a little better at disrupting some of this activity, we're certainly not, I think, where it makes anybody really comfortable.\"\n\nUS presidential transition\n\nU.S. intelligence analysts are keeping a close watch on how other countries are behaving as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to take office in January.\n\n\"There are certain actors that are trying to pre-position themselves for a next administration,\" Haines said.\n\nShe said intelligence analysts are preparing reports on the activity to share with the incoming Trump administration, as well as keeping an eye out for the potential that some countries may seek to escalate tensions during the transition period.\n\n\"Typically, for example, the DPRK engages in some provocative action during transitions,\" Haines said. \"This is sort of one of the classic things we're constantly looking at.\"","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/emerging-anti-us-axis-worrisome-but-not-acting-as-a-bloc-/7888967.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/76EA1BF3-4F61-42FF-8602-38BB90624C3C_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06

The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from less than $70,000 on Election Day, but it quickly fell back as Thursday progressed toward $99,000, according to CoinDesk.\n\nSharps swings for bitcoin are nothing new, and they took stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto world on a similar ride.

Removing those barriers could boost the economy by more than the expected damage from Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"Removing non-geographic internal trade costs increases trade volumes as a share of GDP by roughly 15 percentage points,\" wrote University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe in a 2019 paper for the International Monetary Fund. \n\nThat study found real GDP per capita would rise by 3.8 per cent nationally. Smaller provinces would see some of the biggest gains. The authors found real GDP in a province like P.E.I. could increase by as much as 16 per cent.\n\nGraham Sherman started a brewing company in Calgary more than 15 years ago. It's won awards and been named among Calgary's top breweries. Tool Shed Brewing Co. now produces as much as two million litres of beer a year.\n\nBut for all his success in Alberta, Sherman still can't sell his beer in Ontario.\n\n\"That province almost acts like a cartel. It's virtually impossible to get our beer into Toronto,\" he told CBC News.\n\nFor years, Sherman has been trying to crack the biggest market in Canada. But he says the provincial alcohol distributors impose strict control over who can sell to consumers.\n\nHe says the enormous Ontario market would be a game-changer for his business.\n\n\"In my own country, I don't have access to the most unbelievable, incredible retailer of alcohol,\" he said, referring to the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, that province's near-monopoly on alcohol sales. \n\n\"And I have some of the products that are virtually the best in the country.\"\n\nMyriad rules\n\nThe list of provincial trade barriers is long.\n\nThe biggest and hardest to change, of course, is geography. Canada is a big country and shipping goods across it takes time and money. But geographic trade barriers only make up 57 per cent of the trade barriers faced by Canadian businesses.\n\nMyriad rules and regulations, labelling requirements and shipping procedures stack up and make it difficult to move goods from one jurisdiction to another. Professional licensing standards and trade qualifications vary greatly from province to province. Business registration fees have increased.\n\nSherman says every time he asks why it's so hard to make changes, he's told \"that's how it's always been done.\"\n\nBut changes have been made.\n\nIn September, the federal government launched a pilot project to \"mutually recognize regulatory requirements in the trucking sector.\"\n\nThat may sound eye-glazingly boring, but transportation remains one of the most important factors in making sure goods move freely through the economy.\n\nOne oft-cited example of internal barriers is that Nova Scotia has different weight limits for certain 18-wheel transport trucks. That means a truck loaded to legal capacity in British Columbia would have to off-load or make changes before entering Nova Scotia.\n\nThe pilot project doesn't actually change that rule, but requires provinces to respect regulations from other jurisdictions. \n\nThe Canadian Trucking Alliance says that will lead to more opportunities.\n\n\"Canada moves by truck, and bringing all levels of government together to identify and eliminate trade barriers is an important step in improving the movement of trucking equipment, drivers and their goods,\" said alliance president Stephen Laskowski in a statement.\n\nBig potential boost\n\nIn its most recent report card on inter-provincial co-operation, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says half of its members have reported issues navigating regulatory requirements across different Canadian jurisdictions. \n\n\"Due to this, many small businesses report finding it easier to conduct business in the U.S. than within Canada,\" reported the CFIB.\n\nThe organization says removing internal trade barriers could boost Canada's economy by as much as $200 billion per year, or $5,100 per person.\n\nEasy, unfettered access to markets is the basic promise of free trade. Canada has spent years pursuing and prioritizing free trade deals with the U.S. and Mexico, but also with Europe and Asia.\n\nMany small- and medium-sized businesses in Canada have said inter-provincial trade is just as important and necessary.\n\nNow, though, anti-free trade sentiment is on the rise. Tariffs are being threatened by the U.S. and other close allies. \n\nSo, Tombe, the economist, says there's an opportunity to make good on years of promise to remove barriers within Canada.\n\n\"In a world where so much is increasingly beyond our control, and adverse to the health of the Canadian economy, then the importance of us looking at things that are within our own jurisdiction rises,\" he said.\n\nIs there a chance Trump's threat could finally push Canadian provinces and territories to address those barriers? Tombe says that's a political question, not an economics issue.\n\nBut he says the numbers tell a clear story.\n\n\"If this doesn't prompt governments to think more about it, then it is missing an important opportunity,\" said Tombe.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trade-tariffs-internal-trade-barriers-provinces-1.7401277","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.5379807.1733355952!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/graham-sherman.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 01:07:47","author":"Peter Armstrong","authors":["Peter Armstrong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":270817596,"title":"Did Justin Trudeau's meeting with Donald Trump break a 225-year-old U.S law?","text":"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's meeting with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump last week likely violated a 225-year-old U.S. law, but experts say it's highly unlikely that Trump will face any consequences.\n\nOn Friday, Trudeau surprised Canadians by making an unannounced trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach, Florida. Over dinner, Trudeau, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc and the prime minister's chief of staff Katie Telford talked about a series of contentious issues with Trump and three of his cabinet nominees — Howard Lutnick (Commerce), Mike Waltz (National Security) and Doug Burgum (Interior).\n\nAmong the topics discussed were trade and Trump's threat of a 25 per cent tariff on Canadian imports, border security, fentanyl, NATO, the war in Ukraine, pipelines and the upcoming G7 meeting.\n\nA lively debate has been circulating online about whether the meeting violated U.S. law. Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he was told by Trump's transition team that a face-to-face meeting he had sought with the president-elect wouldn't be possible because meetings with world leaders before the inauguration in January were restricted by the Logan Act.\n\nThe Logan Act, enacted by the U.S. in 1799, prohibits private U.S. citizens from engaging in talks or negotiations with foreign governments without the permission of the U.S. government. Since its enactment, there have only been two indictments and no convictions.\n\nAmerican politicians, including Trump, have at times used the Logan Act as a political weapon by accusing opponents of violating it. More recently, questions have been raised about whether Trump broke the law in July when he hosted foreign leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nLogan Act applies to U.S. citizens only\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday aboard Air Force One, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby was asked about Trudeau meeting with Trump and whether Trudeau had also spoken to Biden. Kirby said Biden had not spoken with Trudeau since the meeting with Trump and did not raise concerns about Trump meeting with Trudeau.\n\n\"Is it appropriate for foreign leaders to speak to an incoming president-elect?\" he told reporters. \"Yeah, of course it is.\"\n\nJulian Ku, director of international programs at the Hofstra University law faculty in New York, said Trudeau is in the clear but Trump may have violated the Logan Act.\n\n\"With respect to Prime Minister Trudeau, he himself has no liability because the law would only apply to U.S. citizens,\" Ku told CBC News.\n\n\"With respect to the meeting itself, it is potentially a problem with the Logan Act because the Logan Act would apply to president-elect Trump.\"\n\nAlthough the law is still on the books, nobody has been charged with violating it for decades, Ku pointed out.\n\n\"The plain text of that law suggests that it might apply to President Trump,\" he said. \"But I think it is highly unlikely that any prosecution would ever be brought under the Logan Act against President Trump or, frankly, anyone else.\"\n\nPolitical tool\n\nStill, the Logan Act is a popular political tool, said Ku.\n\n\"The language is very attractive for political talking points as a way to criticize what is a real concern about people who are not actually empowered under U.S. law to do things, carrying on, sort of, foreign policy,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's more of a political tool than any sort of serious legal jeopardy.\"\n\nFen Hampson, chancellor's professor at Carleton University and a professor of international affairs, said Trump may have broken the Logan Act when he met Trudeau but he's unlikely to face any consequences.\n\n\"The Logan Act has only been invoked twice in its long history,\" Hampson said in an e-mailed response. \"The reluctance to invoke it has largely [been] because it might involve a violation of free speech. As some of the 'disputes' between the U.S. and Canada, such as the threat to enact tariffs, are of Trump's own making via tweets, this would not be a dispute in the classical sense.\"\n\nHampson also said he wonders who would launch such a prosecution and suggested it would be unlikely to \"go anywhere, given the current complexion of the … Supreme Court.\"\n\nLaw unlikely to be enforced\n\nRenan Levine, who teaches U.S. politics at the University of Toronto, agrees Trump has no reason to fear prosecution for violating the Logan Act.\n\n\"It's a possible violation of a law that is rarely enforced and will certainly not be enforced vis-a-vis Trump,\" Levine said.\n\nA possible violation of the Logan Act pales in comparison to other accusations against Trump, he said, citing his decision to keep presidential documents at Mar-a-Lago and his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nPlus, it would be hard to argue that discussing issues like fentanyl trafficking runs contrary to the U.S. government's position or its interests, Levine said.\n\nIn the end, though, he says the Logan Act is still on the books and can still be enforced.\n\n\"We can have a discussion about why the Logan Act actually still exists and perhaps they should get rid of it,\" he said. \"But if they haven't gotten rid of it, well, it's a law like any other law.\"\n\nThe prime minister's office did not address any of the questions posed by CBC News about whether it was aware of the Logan Act when it organized the trip.\n\n\"The Prime Minister and U.S. President Donald Trump shared a productive dinner last Friday, centred on collaboration and strengthening our relationship,\" wrote Jenna Ghassabeh in an e-mailed response. \"As Canada's closest friend and ally, the United States is our key partner, and we are committed to working together in the interests of Canadians and Americans.\"\n\nThe Trump transition team has yet to respond to questions from CBC News.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-logan-act-1.7401412","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7398065.1733084557!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/trudeau-and-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 01:07:47","author":"Elizabeth Thompson","authors":["Elizabeth Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":270817748,"title":"House Republican Says 'Donald Trump Has Never Been About Retribution'","text":"A House Republican lawmaker said in an interview Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump isn't interested in vengeance or retribution.The discussion with Fox Business arrived after reports that President Joe Biden is weighing the issuance of preemptive pardons to officials who could be targeted by the incoming second Trump administration.

Bragg's office secured a 34-count conviction of Trump in New York this year.The president-elect has frequently and publicly called for his critics and law enforcement officials to be prosecuted and jailed. Over the summer, he amplified a post on his social media website, Truth Social, calling for Cheney—a longtime Trump critic who was vice chairwoman of a House panel that investigated the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol—to face a military tribunal.\"ELIZABETH LYNNE CHENEY IS GUILTY OF TREASON,\" the post, from another Truth Social user, said. \"RETRUTH IF YOU WANT TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS.\" Trump re-shared the post.Another post that Trump magnified the same day displayed 15 photos of current and former elected officials who have all been in the president-elect's crosshairs, saying: \"THEY SHOULD BE GOING TO JAIL ON MONDAY NOT STEVE BANNON.\"Among others, the post featured photos of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.Schiff has also frequently drawn the president-elect's ire and spearheaded the 2019 impeachment proceedings against Trump.In a post to X at the time, Trump demanded that Schiff be \"questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason,\" claiming his \"lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber.\"\"Rep.

RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!”\n\nTrump is taking a page from President Ronald Reagan’s playbook.\n\nWhen Reagan was elected, Iran held 53 American hostages seized from the US Embassy in Tehran.\n\nThe humiliating hostage crisis and failed Desert One rescue mission bolstered perceptions of American weakness and contributed to President Jimmy Carter’s electoral defeat.\n\nNegotiations for release of the hostages were ongoing after the election, and one day before Reagan took office, the mullahs caved and agreed to let the Americans go.\n\nThe timing of the settlement was no coincidence: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini knew little about Reagan, but during the 1980 campaign, the mainstream media had portrayed “The Gipper” as a Cold War nuclear cowboy, hawkish and unpredictable.\n\nThe mullahs feared if they held on to the Americans into Reagan’s term they’d face an ultimatum — or a swift and significant attack.\n\nIranian regime proxies reached out to the Reagan transition team to gauge the mood.\n\nIncoming National Security Advisor Richard Allen said that when the team heard Tehran’s concerns about Reagan’s alleged instability, it went right on letting the mullahs believe the worst.\n\nThe message back to Iran’s leaders was that all they had heard was true, that Reagan was completely unpredictable, potentially unstable and there were no guarantees once he took the oath.\n\nTheir best course of action would be to conclude a deal ASAP.\n\nThe back-channel messaging encouraged the Iranians to let the hostages go, and it fell to the newly sworn-in president to announce that the freed Americans were on their way home.\n\nPresident-elect Trump is communicating the same message to Hamas, more overtly and with the added benefit that the terrorists already know he means business.\n\nThey saw how Trump dealt with ISIS in his first term, extinguishing its caliphate and taking out its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nThey watched as Trump eliminated its chief patron, Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani.\n\nAnd Hamas knows that as a US-listed foreign terrorist group, there’s no practical limits as to what Trump can do to it.\n\nHamas also understands Trump’s past strong support for Israel and special relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nSo, it can expect an end to Biden administration policies that sought to reign in Israel and accommodate Hamas’ backers in Tehran.\n\nThe terrorists can anticipate a more gloves-off approach from the United States, especially since they are holding American citizens hostage, some of whom have been killed.\n\nOne of the dead, new reports revealed, is New York City native Omer Neutra, whose parents Ronen and Orna appeared at the Republican National Convention to chants of “bring them home.”\n\nThe Trump team will soon inherit the ongoing cease-fire negotiations, and could profitably encourage Hamas’ fears of what’s coming to push the process along.\n\nThe terrorists have been able to scuttle previous cease-fire proposals and hostage deals with outrageous conditions and last-minute demands.\n\nThey should know that the Trump team will be out for results, and Hamas will not be allowed to set the terms.\n\nThis is not about creating a temporary cease-fire but imposing an end to the fighting.\n\nTrump can authorize increased intelligence-sharing, covert action, moves against Hamas finances and supplies, sanctions and seizures against Hamas supporters, selective strikes using the most advanced US weaponry — the full spectrum of American instruments of power.\n\nThere is more on the menu now than deploying a sinking offshore pier.\n\nResponding quickly to the big changes to come may save Hamas suffering later when Trump takes office.\n\nSerious people are returning to the White House, and it will be a very different world for terrorists after Jan. 20.\n\nHamas would be well-advised to meet Trump’s inauguration-day deadline — because unlike with Reagan, this is no bluff.\n\nJames S.

He then served 12 years in Congress, because he ‘felt it was important for his constituents to have a Representative who has signed the front of a check!’\n\n“Since leaving Congress, Billy has worked as a Business and Tax advisor, helping Small Businesses navigate the complexities of complying with the IRS Rules and Regulations.”\n\nWhat Trump failed to mention was that Long was voted “Best Auctioneer in the Ozarks” multiple times and is an inductee in the National Auctioneers’ Association Hall of Fame.\n\nLong went on to make colorful use of his talents as a congressman.\n\nIn 2011, he adopted his auctioneer persona to emphasize the rapid growth of the national debt:\n\nThat same year, he mocked how Democrats’ $3.5 trillion spending bill turned into a $4.3 spending plan:\n\nAppearing at an event with Donald Trump at the Southern Border that same year, Long playfully auctioned off the remainder of the former president’s border wall that went unbuilt after Joe Biden entered the White House.\n\nIn 2018, then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) employed Long’s talents in a light-hearted video cheering the nation’s economic strength during the Trump Administration.\n\nAt a House hearing in 2018, Congressman Long drew laughs and applause when he launched into auctioneer mode to drown out a heckler disrupting the proceedings.\n\nIn 2019, Rep.

After all, here in the United States, we’ve just been through a fierce, hard-fought election, and it’s fair to say that it did not turn out as they had hoped,” Obama said at his namesake foundation’s third annual Democracy Forum. “It felt far-fetched, even naive, especially since, as far as they were concerned, the election proved that democracy is pretty far down on people’s priorities.”\n\nBut in an often solemn 45-minute keynote address, the 44th president, former Illinois senator and Kenwood resident argued now is the most important time to bolster welcoming democratic values — especially as his own party grapples with a stinging election loss due largely to the defection of working class voters.\n\n“It’s easy to give democracy lip service when it delivers the outcomes we want. It’s when we don’t get what we want, that our commitment to democracy is tested. And at this moment in history, when core democratic principles seem to be continuously under attack, when too many people around the world have become cynical and disengaged — now is precisely the time to ask ourselves tough questions about how we can build our democracies and make them work in meaningful and practical ways for ordinary people.”\n\nFor much of his speech, Obama harkened back to his roots as a University of Chicago law professor while dissecting the concept of pluralism, or the idea that welcoming diverse viewpoints and values leads to a stronger democracy and society.\n\nThat was the theme of the day at the Obama Foundation’s Democracy Forum, which also featured appearances from longtime Obama confidant and foundation CEO Valerie Jarrett, country star Reyna Roberts and actor Ryan Reynolds.\n\n“Pluralism is not about holding hands and singing kumbaya. It is not about abandoning your convictions and folding when things get tough,” Obama told hundreds of supporters at the Marriott Marquis hotel ballroom in the South Loop. “It is about recognizing that in a democracy, power comes from forging alliances and building coalitions, and making room in those coalitions not only for the woke, but also for the waking.”\n\nObama, who served as a top campaign surrogate for Harris, struck a more conciliatory tone than he did during his last Chicago appearance on the Democratic National Convention stage in August, when he railed against a “whining” Trump and his “weird obsession with crowd sizes.”\n\nA month after Harris’ defeat, Obama advised against doling out political barbs that are simply “easy to tweet.”\n\n“It may feel satisfying in the short term. Unfortunately, it actually reinforces the sense that we are inevitably and immutably divided, and that makes it harder for people to reimagine how they might see themselves and they might see others,” he said.\n\n“In order to build lasting majorities that support justice… we have to be open to framing our issues, our causes, what we believe in, in terms of ‘we’ and not just ‘us and them.’ We have to try to frame issues in ways that at least consider the possibility of a win-win situation rather than a zero-sum situation.”\n\nObama pointed to pluralism within his own “multiple identities.”\n\n“I am 63-year-old African American man, for example. But I am also a husband. I am a father. I am a Christian who is constantly wrestling with his doubts about organized religion. I’m a writer. I’m a Bears fan, which has not been easy,” he said to laughs. \n\nWithout naming Trump, Obama still called for vigilance “when the other side has repeatedly and abundantly made clear they are not interested in playing by the rules.”\n\n“There are going to be times, potentially, when one side tries to stack the deck and lock in a permanent grip on power… In those circumstances, a line has been crossed, and we have to stand and speak out and organize and mobilize as forcefully as we can.”\n\nBefore Obama’s speech, supporters examined a large-scale model of the Obama Presidential Center, which could host the foundation’s forum next year.\n\nThe sprawling Jackson Park campus is about two-thirds complete, slated to open next spring, officials said. The 19-acre site will include an eight-story museum, an athletic facility, an auditorium, a fruit and vegetable garden and a Chicago Public Library branch, among other attractions.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/12/05/barack-obama-foundation-democracy-speech","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c992829/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4567x2607+0+219/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F35%2Fa0ac1cb64590af13f8a38386e13a%2Fobam","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:56:41","author":"Mitchell Armentrout","authors":["Mitchell Armentrout"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.117},{"id":270817686,"title":"Donald Trump Names David Sacks as White House AI and Crypto Czar - Bloomberg","text":"Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not\n blocking them from loading.\n For more information you can review our Terms of\n Service and Cookie Policy.","summary":"Donald Trump Names David Sacks as White House AI and Crypto Czar  Bloomberg","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=55a2e927-b36e-11ef-8f0a-32320a3c0fff&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyNC0xMi0wNi90cnVtcC1uYW1lcy1kYXZpZC1zYWNrcy1hcy13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS1haS1hbmQtY3J5cHRvLWN6YXI/c3JuZD1ob21lcGFnZS1hc2lh","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:55:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":270816064,"title":"Is Israel’s war in Gaza putting the global order at peril? - Premium","text":"When it comes to global institutions, why is the world so polarised? In particular, what explains the policy of the U.S. on enforcing rules on Israel?\r\n\nTrita Parsi: Put simply, this is a genocide and we can see it happening live, on our phones. The Lancet estimates the toll to be over 1,86,000 because 43,000 is only the number of bodies that have been counted in hospitals. So, I’m not surprised by the world’s outrage in comparison to what was felt over [Russia’s invasion] of Ukraine. Roughly, 700 children were killed in Ukraine through Russian bombardment over two-and-a-half years. More than 20,000 children have been killed in Gaza in about a year already. The intensity of this exceeds anything we have seen in any modern war.\n\n What is surprising is America’s reaction. The Biden administration, in particular, has violated its own regulations to allow the Israeli government to do exactly what it wants. This has never happened before. The U.S. is shifting away from supporting the same international institutions, regulations, and laws that it played a crucial role in establishing. The first shift was away from international law to what it calls the ‘rules-based international order’. The rules-based order is not centred on law; it is centred on rules, and it is unclear who makes those rules. In reality, it ends up being a coalition or a willing partnership of countries, mostly allies, which is not universally accepted or applicable. This is what we are seeing when it comes to the ICC warrants as well.\r\n\nNavtej Sarna: The U.S. has a sort of umbilical relationship with Israel. The U.S. has treated Israel as if it is a part of the U.S. which needs to be protected at all costs. Now the protection is for strategic reasons, but also because Israel represents a sort of a moral burden. It is the Jewish homeland, and after the Holocaust, there is a need to protect all Israelis and not let them lose the homeland. In the view of the U.S., Israel is also a democracy, a vulnerable democracy in a very hard neighbourhood, the only democracy in West Asia. While it is unstated so far, Israel is also believed to be a nuclear power, and one that can be a deterrent against another potential nuclear power that could be Iran. Now there are some contradictions: Israel’s democracy comes up against the fact that it has also been an occupying power and it is no longer vulnerable. But that has been overlooked because of the U.S.’s need to protect Israel for the other reasons I mentioned, particularly after the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas.\n\n Israel has said the ICC warrant makes no sense because it is not a member state of the ICC, much like how India isn’t, and doesn’t submit to its jurisdiction. Can a warrant still be issued against Prime Minister Netanyahu?\r\n\nTrita Parsi: Of course it can, because Israel is conducting war crimes in another country’s territory [Palestine]. This was an issue that the ICC had to address before taking up this issue.\n\nNavtej Sarna: More than the ICC warrant, it is necessary to look at what has been done to international humanitarian law on the ground. Countries may react to the warrants one way or the other, but the sad part is that international humanitarian law has been flouted for months in [full] visibility of the world. Therefore, everybody has a responsibility to bear for allowing the [bombardment of Gaza to continue]. The U.S. has simply been putting up a diplomatic performance. If it really wanted to stop this, it could have.\n\n Why didn’t India join the ICC and what is its position on this warrant now?\r\n\nNavtej Sarna: The ICC has only 124 member states. India participated in the negotiations in the preparatory stages that led up to the setting up of the ICC in 2002. India participated in the negotiations of the Rome Statute. But it did not sign it or ratify it. India negotiates in good faith and when it finds that it can’t agree to some of the terms, it doesn’t sign. It is better than signing and flouting the terms. The reasons for not signing at the time were many. The Indian government felt that the ICC did not give sufficient place for national administrative and judicial institutions to deal with such crimes and it did not recognise the use of nuclear weapons and the use of other weapons of mass destruction as a crime which could be punished. It also did not recognise terrorism as a punishable crime against humanity, which, I think, was probably the breaking point for India, which had been a victim of terrorism for decades. Regarding the present ICC warrants [in the cases of both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr. Netanyahu], India has made it clear that it does not have much faith in the ICC.\n\n At the UN Security Council (UNSC), there has been a logjam over votes involving Israel and Russia. Even in cases where the UNSC has passed resolutions, such as Afghanistan and Myanmar, the regimes in power are flouting directions with impunity. Are we reaching a point where the international world order, as is defined by these institutions, is unable to function? What would it take to make states including Israel compliant?\r\n\nNavtej Sarna: It is clear that UNSC resolutions don’t mean a thing any more. In the case of Israel, the U.S. veto is used almost automatically. Naturally, Russia is going to use its veto for its own purposes, to protect itself, as it has in the past few years. The fact remains that the situation in which the UN was formed has changed from 1945. So even if the UNSC believes it can still deliver, the truth is it cannot. Every country has decided to live on a transactional, immediate short-term policy paradigm. There are no ‘value-based international relations’ today. It is not as if countries did not work in national interest earlier, but the brazenness with which we see ‘realpolitik’ used is at a different level. Until this situation changes — and I don’t see any signs of that — this kind of breakdown of international systems will probably increase.\n\nTrita Parsi: I agree that we are in a very bad situation. However, I don’t think there is a collective desire not to have any rules and laws that will guide state to state conduct at this point. We can point to all of these examples in which clearly the system has not worked, but those are perhaps 5% of the situations. Of the interactions that are taking place in the world, there are many in which laws are being followed.\n\n The UNSC absolutely needs reform. It has become a joke and at some point, it will become irrelevant. Things are going to get worse, but there is going to be a tipping point in which a critical mass of countries will recognise that it is actually in their interest to have a functioning global order and effective institutions that help uphold international conventions and laws.\r\n\n Do you see Israel being brought to account internationally, or a ceasefire in Gaza any time soon, especially given the upcoming change in U.S. administration?\r\n\nTrita Parsi: There is a likelihood of a ceasefire because incoming U.S. President Donald Trump will take a tough position on ending the war. While he has shown little regard for global institutions, and sees transactional value in backing Israel, I think he does not want to see the U.S. get dragged into another war in West Asia.\n\nNavtej Sarna: I think Mr. Trump’s main motivation would be to show himself as the ultimate winner who can say he delivered on his campaign promise to stop the wars. But a ceasefire will not mean peace. Mr. Trump’s next step will be to want to go back to the Abraham Accords, which will be more difficult than it was in Trump 1.0 (2017-2021). The landscape has changed considerably for the countries that signed the accords (the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco) and those that the U.S. was trying to bring on board (Saudi Arabia). There won’t be a return to peace or negotiations until the heart of the problem is addressed, which is the need for the establishment of a Palestinian state. \n\nListen to the conversation in The Hindu Parley podcast","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/is-israels-war-in-gaza-putting-the-global-order-at-peril/article68952162.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/dnwceu/article68952151.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/AFP_36PJ4AU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:54:47","author":"Suhasini Haidar.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency surged 6% to an all-time high of $103,800, following Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.

So far this year, Bitcoin has gained almost 150% buoyed by institutional confidence, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and increasing acceptance of digital assets, experts said. Analysts predict the rally could push Bitcoin to $120,000 by end of the year and potentially surpass $150,000 in 2025. Global investment firm Bernstein has projected Bitcoin at $200,000 by 2025 and $1 million by 2033. “The re-election of Trump has reinvigorated enthusiasm within the crypto community, supported by a significant uptick in institutional investments,” said Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch. Based on historical post-halving trends, Bitcoin could reach a peak of around $150,000 in 2025, with the April 2024 halving leading to a rally of 300-400%, he said. Trump’s pledge to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve has further fuelled investor optimism, which is only expected to rise as he takes office in January. Market participants expect this pro-crypto stance could drive global adoption, with countries like China lifting restrictions on personal crypto ownership, and Brazil and Russia exploring Bitcoin for reserves. “Key developments, including Elon Musk heading the newly-established department of government efficiency, plans for a dedicated White House crypto policy role and Trump’s appointment of Atkins as SEC chair, have fuelled this remarkable rally towards this mark,” said Edul Patel, CEO and co-founder of Mudrex. “With Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and Atkins’ leadership, the market is bound for friendlier reforms and wider adoption, setting Bitcoin on track to reach $120,000 in the coming weeks,” he said. Other cryptocurrencies are also riding the wave. XRP, Binance Coin and Solana hit lifetime highs as investors flock to digital assets.

Bush who has since pivoted to the left in the era of Trump, made a joke about Defense Secretary nominee and ex-Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth’s reported drinking, saying: ‘If you’re too drunk for Fox News, you’re very, very drunk indeed’\n\nAfter co-host Mika Brzezinski apologized for the comment on-air, Frum wrote a column in The Atlantic later that day titled ‘The Sound of Fear On Air.’ \n\nOn Thursday’s show, Scarborough was clearly angered by Frum’s attempt to paint himself and Brzezinski as cowardly toward the president-elect. \n\n‘That wasn’t the sound of fear, that was the sound of civility. In saying that Mika had apologized, she didn’t apologize. She simply said it was too flippant,’ he said.\n\nScarborough added that ‘you can’t be fearful’ and that anyone who has worked with him at MSNBC or in Congress would tell you he’s not. \n\nHe doubled down on Brzezinski’s apology, saying that it was fair for her to apologize and that the joke was not acceptable. \n\nThe anchor then clearly wanted to address the criticism of himself and Brzezinski in the weeks since they made amends with Trump in a surprise Mar-a-Lago meeting. \n\n‘We went down to talk to the President-elect. And people wrote articles that were just false. But you know what we did? We did the corporate thing. Corporate said, ‘don’t say anything. Just keep your head down.’ What did the royal say? Never explain, never complain. We did that.’\n\nHe then apologized if he felt they had blindsided Frum with their apology but reiterated that nothing they did was because of Trump, or anyone in a position of influence or power. \n\n‘I always have Republicans say, ‘Oh, they’re telling you exactly what to say.’ No! Nobody’s once told me what to say here.’\n\nThe hosts then said that Frum, who was supposed to appear on the show to discuss the controversy Thursday, will appear to hash it out on Friday’s show. \n\nLater Thursday, Frum posted to social media: ‘I want to stress: I am very sympathetic to the predicament faced by TV hosts. These are worrying times.’ \n\nThe show has come under fire in recent weeks after hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski patched things up with Donald Trump at a secret Mar-a-Lago summit.\n\nIt has many, including Frum, wondering if the network is going to start censoring progressives after the show apologized for his joke about troubled Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth.\n\nA recent NBC News report claims 10 current and former Fox News staffers said they were concerned about his drinking and could smell alcohol on him ‘as recently as last month.’ \n\nOn Wednesday’s show, Frum joked that ‘if you’re too drunk for Fox News, you’re very, very drunk indeed.’\n\nIn the next segment of the show, Brzezinski offered an apology for Frum’s flippant comments.\n\n‘And before we go to break or a little bit earlier in this block, there was a comment made about Fox News in our coverage about Pete [Hegseth] and the growing number of allegations about his behavior over the years and possible addiction to alcohol or issues with alcohol,’ she said. \n\n‘The comment was a little too flippant for this moment that we’re in. We just want to make that comment as well. We want to make that clear.’ \n\nBrzezinski noted that MSNBC is a very different place in terms of coverage than Fox News but felt it went over the line. \n\n‘I just want to say there’s a lot of good people that work at Fox News who care about Pete Hegseth, and we want to leave it at that.’\n\nA furious Frum wrote about the entire saga in a column for The Atlantic published on Wednesday night.\n\nHe called the experience ‘unsettling’ and ‘ominous’ for the future of MSNBC, which is set to be spun off by owners Comcast.\n\nFrum claimed that he was warned not to repeat his remarks, which he called a joke and a reference to a failed secretary of defense nominee from the 1980s. \n\n‘At the next ad break, a producer spoke into my ear. He objected to my comments about Fox and warned me not to repeat them. I said something noncommittal and got another round of warning,’ he wrote.\n\nFrum reasoned that if the allegations about Hegseth’s drinking are true, it’s ‘a startling and shameful shirking of responsibility on a matter of grave national importance. What’s the appropriate language to call it out?’\n\n‘It is a very ominous thing if our leading forums for discussion of public affairs are already feeling the chill of intimidation and responding with efforts to appease,’ he said.\n\nHe noted that he believed it was probably the end of his television career for saying so. \n\nRichard Hudock, MSNBC’s VP of Communications, responded to the controversy on social media. \n\n‘Joe and Mika have consistently expressed their strong reservations and perspectives regarding Pete Hegseth’s nomination from the very beginning, and that stance remains unchanged.\n\nWe would have responded in the same manner regardless of when these comments were made or what news organization was referenced.\n\nWe have great respect for @davidfrum and his contributions; he is a valued member of the @Morning_Joe family. We invite him to join us tomorrow to discuss this topic and other pressing news stories of the day.’\n\nFollowing Scarborough and Brzezinski’s Mar-a-Lago meeting, the morning show hosts were met with criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. \n\nBoth hosts defended the move, after media colleagues also slammed the stars, and the pair claimed that the backlash proved there is a ‘massive disconnect’ between ‘social media and the real world’. \n\nAfter the meeting was announced, Brzezinski said they decided to reach out to Trump due to their viewers expressing fear over his election win.\n\nShe added: ‘My father [diplomat Zbigniew Brzezinski] often spoke with world leaders with whom he and the United States profoundly disagreed. That’s a task shared by reporters and commentators alike.\n\nBrzezinski shared that Trump was cheerful during their meeting and seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats.\n\nHowever, Scarborough concluded by telling viewers they will not stop their criticism of the president-elect.\n\nHe said: ‘Don’t be mistaken. We are not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump.’\n\n‘We are here to report on him and to hopefully provide you insights that are going to better equip all of us in understanding these deeply unsettling times.’\n\nTrump told Fox News that he took the meeting in order to ‘Make America Great Again, it is very important, if not vital, to have a free, fair and open media or press.’\n\n‘I am not looking for retribution, grandstanding or to destroy people who treated me very unfairly,’ he added.\n\n‘Many things were discussed, and I very much appreciated the fact that they wanted to have open communication,’ he said. ‘In many ways, it’s too bad that it wasn’t done long ago.’\n\nTrump used to be a routine contributor to Morning Joe, and Scarborough was an early cheerleader for the billionaire’s maverick bid for the GOP nomination in 2016.\n\nBut relations soured as Trump pulled off a surprise victory in the Republican primaries and began to look like a serious challenger to the Democrats’ Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe four-hour morning show became a bastion of the Democratic establishment after Trump’s first term, with President Joe Biden routinely tuning in while doing his morning exercises to see his acolytes promote the party’s talking points.\n\nWith Trump in the White House and Scarborough engaged to co-host Brzezinski he began cementing his show’s identity as an outpost of opposition to the new administration.\n\nThe couple even recorded a Christmas album called ‘A Very Drumpf Christmas’ with children’s songs portraying the president as Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.\n\nIt eventually attracted the attention of the president himself, who delivered a series of withering put-downs, labeling Scarborough ‘Psycho Joe’ and his then-fiancée as ‘low IQ Crazy Mika’, while mischievously claiming she had been ‘bleeding badly from a face-lift’ during a visit to his Mar-a-Lago estate. \n\nBrzezinski later confirmed she’d been recovering from cosmetic surgery during the trip.\n\nAnd the feud deepened when the president revived long-debunked claims that Scarborough had been involved in the death of his former congressional staffer who was found dead on his office floor in 2001.\n\nAn autopsy found that Lori Bolterstein Klausutis, 28, had hit her head on a desk after collapsing from an undiagnosed heart-valve irregularity but Trump called for a fresh investigation into the case.\n\nThe allegations earned Trump his first rebuke from Twitter, which would eventually kick him off the platform altogether in January 2021.","summary":"Joe Scarborough went on a lengthy tirade against his critics, specifically targeting&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/morning-tv-host-had-emotional-outburst-on-air-when-guest-claimed-he-was-afraid-of-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/rewrite-this-title-Morning-Joe-on-screen-meltdown-after-guest-said-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:49:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.636},{"id":270817038,"title":"Hegseth continues Capitol Hill push for defense secretary post","text":"Hegseth continues Capitol Hill push for defense secretary post\n Military veteran and former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth took part Thursday in a fourth day of door-to-door visits with senators who will decide whether to confirm him as secretary of defense once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.

Now he could land in jail","text":"Hours before a final deadline to answer why he should not be held in contempt of court for repeatedly lying about women he defamed, Rudy Giuliani was hit with yet another threat of contempt, in a separate court, by the same women.\n\n“Severe” sanctions are warranted, they argued.\n\nDonald Trump’s former attorney is now juggling motions against him in Washington, DC and in Manhattan, where he is also in the middle of a protracted legal battle to relinquish a long list of property and valuables to chip away at the nearly $150m he owes the mother-daughter duo.\n\nThe former New York City mayor — who falsely accused Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss of manipulating election results in the volatile aftermath of the 2020 presidential election — is also a criminal co-defendant alongside the president-elect in Georgia, and among more than a dozen Trump allies facing criminal charges in a similar election interference case in Arizona.\n\nHe filed for bankruptcy shortly after a jury determined he must pay the women $148m for his defamatory statements about them. A judge initially tossed his bankruptcy case, citing his lack of financial transparency and apparent attempts to evade court orders, leaving Giuliani’s lawyers and the people to whom he owes money trying to figure out how he would pay tens of thousands of dollars he owes in court fees, and whether he actually can pay any of it.\n\nThe parties ultimately agreed to dissolve the case, unfreezing a mountain of lawsuits against him.\n\nFour months later, the 80-year-old former mayor faces the prospect of greater financial penalties, or even jail, after failing to keep up with — or purposefully trying to avoid — the ongoing legal fallout from election conspiracy theories that defined his spurious attempts to keep Trump in office in 2020.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from a spokesperson for Giuliani.\n\nHe remains under a court order that prevents him from saying anything that resembles his defamatory statements.\n\nBut he has recently accused the women of “quadruple counting the ballots” and “passing hard drives that we maintain were used to fix” voting machines — echoing similar claims that landed him in a trial court for defamation last year.\n\nHis statements “repeat the exact same lies for which [he] has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,” attorney Michael Gottlieb wrote in a court filing in Washington, DC on November 20.\n\nGiuliani missed a deadline to respond to the women’s demand for contempt. He sent a letter to the judge himself, two days after blowing the initial deadline, asking for a 30-day extension, because he needed “more time” to find an attorney.\n\nHe said four have turned him down.\n\nGiuliani told the judge that his prospective attorneys believe she is “unreasonable” and “biased” against Trump, and that an outcome is a “foregone conclusion” and a “no-win proposition.”\n\nOn December 5, attorneys for the women filed a second contempt motion, this time in Manhattan, where lawyers for the defamed election workers say he has “not produced a single document” in response to court orders to turn over information about his Palm Beach condominium the women are trying to seize from him.\n\nAfter a prolonged legal battle, Giuliani turned over his multi-million dollar New York penthouse apartment, a 1980 Mercedes Benz convertible, high-end watches and access to a storage facility where other valuables are stored.\n\nBut now “the time has come” for the court to hold him in contempt for violating what are now weeks-old court orders, and to “impose whatever coercive sanction it deems appropriate in its expertise,” according to the women’s attorneys.\n\nThey argue that a monetary penalty would not be insufficient. They did not rule out asking for jail time.\n\nBut giving Giuliani more time to “obfuscate in response to unambiguous discovery orders — especially when he has not provided any [indication] of an attempt to comply — risks jeopardizing” upcoming court dates, according to lawyers.\n\nThey have asked New York District Judge Lewis Liman to determine that Giuliani never planned to live at his Florida condo before he claimed it was his primary residence, and that he never intended to live there full-time until the proceedings against him — answers that would effectively resolve the central issues for a trial in the case set for January.\n\nIn press conferences outside a Manhattan courthouse where Giuliani and election workers are navigating what he owes them, Giuliani has blamed his legal turmoil on what he believes is a Democratic conspiracy against him. He claims he is being “punished” by President Joe Biden’s administration for disseminating damaging information about his son Hunter.\n\nAsked whether he is waiting for Trump to help him, he said “Trump doesn’t have to help me get out of it.”\n\n“All Mr. Trump has to do is straighten out the legal system,” he said.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump can help his former attorney once he returns to the White House.\n\nGiuliani was struggling financially before the defamation ruling against him last year. He had put his Manhattan penthouse on the market and he began representing himself in several cases to save money on legal fees.\n\nAfter his indictment in Georgia, he called on supporters to donate to a legal defense fund.\n\nHe reportedly made a desperate plea for Trump’s support during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago last year. The former president ended up hosting a fundraiser dinner; entry was $100,000 a plate.\n\nLast month, Giuliani asked the judge in his property turnover case to move a trial so that he could attend Trump’s inauguration. That was rejected.\n\n“My client regularly consults and deals directly with President-elect Trump on issues that are taking place,” Giuliani’s attorney Joseph Cammarata told Judge Liman. “My client wants to exercise his political right to be there.”\n\nGiuliani, while sitting inside the federal courthouse he helped open in 1996 when he was mayor, furiously clicked a pen while his attorney spoke to the judge. Then he spoke up for himself.\n\n“The implication you make is against me, and every implication against me is wrong,” he told the judge.\n\n“I’m not impoverished,” he said. “Everything I have is tied up. I don’t have a car. I don’t have a credit card. I don’t have cash.”\n\nThe next time he speaks up, Judge Liman said, “The court will take action.”","summary":"Trump’s former attorney faces threats of court-ordered sanctions in Manhattan and Washington, DC, Alex Woodward reports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/giuliani-contempt-jail-defamation-case-b2659744.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/05/21/c848dce8f9084e4bb5258413a88d1be8.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UoFGxs2A-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:45:47","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":270814974,"title":"Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy&#039;s DOGE mission: Revolutionising governance on Capitol Hill","text":"WASHINGTON: It's DOGE time at the US Capitol.Billionaire Elon Musk arrived at Capitol Hill on Thursday, expected to be joined by fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, for meetings with legislators behind closed doors about President-elect Donald Trump's plans to “dismantle” the federal government.Trump tapped the two business titans to head his Department of Government Efficiency, tasked with firing federal workers, cutting government programs and slashing federal regulations — all part of what he calls his \"Save America\" agenda for a second term in the White House.“I think that’ll be a great start to the whole process,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who will chair a House Oversight subcommittee in the new year as part of “building the bridge between Congress and DOGE.”Washington has seen this before, with ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government that historically have run into resistance when the public is confronted with cuts to trusted programs that millions of Americans depend on for jobs, health care, military security and everyday needs.But this time Trump is staffing his administration with battle-tested architects of sweeping proposals, some outlined in Project 2025, to severely reduce and reshape the government. Musk and Ramaswamy said they plan to work alongside the White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Trump's nominee Russ Vought, a mastermind of past cuts.“DOGE has a historic opportunity for structural reductions in the federal government,” Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. “We are prepared for the onslaught.”The duo were invited by House Speaker Mike Johnson to visit Capitol Hill and face a first test in private with House and Senate lawmakers — some eager to hear what they have in mind.“I am fired up to go out and do something,” said Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., who joined with Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, in launching what they are calling the DOGE caucus in the House, with more than 50 Republicans and two Democratic members.Bean said the DOGE caucus will unveil an email tip line where people can report wasteful spending. He also envisions a scoreboard of sorts that people can view on a website showing “how many positions we’ve cut, agencies we’ve cut, what the actual number is.”In the Senate, Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa and Rick Scott, R-Fla., have launched a similar caucus.While neither Musk nor Ramaswamy have much public service experience, they bring track records in private business — Musk's operations have vast government contracts — and enthusiasm for Trump's agenda, having campaigned alongside him in the final stretch of the election.The world's richest man, Musk poured millions into a get-out-the-vote effort to help the former president return to the White House. He is known politically for having transformed the popular social media site formerly known as Twitter into X, a platform embraced by Trump's MAGA enthusiasts.Despite its name, the Department of Government Efficiency is neither a department nor part of the government, which frees Musk and Ramaswamy from having to go through the typical ethics and background checks required for federal employment. They said they will not be paid for their work.One good-government group has said that DOGE, as a presidential advisory panel, should be expected to adhere to traditional practices of transparency, equal representation and public input — as happened with similar advisory entities from the Reagan to the Obama administrations.The Federal Advisory Committee Act “is designed expressly for situations like this,\" wrote Lisa Gilbert and Robert Weissman, the co-chairs of Public Citizen in a letter to the Trump transition team.\"If the government is going to turn to unelected and politically unaccountable persons to make recommendations as grand as $2 trillion in budget cuts, it must ensure those recommendations come from a balanced and transparent process not rigged to benefit insiders.”The nation's $6 trillion federal budget routinely runs a deficit, which this year ran $1.8 trillion, a historic high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It has not been balanced since the Clinton administration more than two decades ago.Republicans generally blame what they see as exorbitant spending for the deficit, while Democrats point to tax cuts enacted under Republican presidents Trump and George W. Bush as the major driver.Receipts last year as a percentage of gross domestic product came in just below the average for the past 50 years, while outlays were equal to 23.4% of GDP, compared to the 50-year average of 21.1%Some of the biggest increases in spending last year occurred with politically popular programs that lawmakers will be reticent to touch. For example, spending on Social Security benefits went up 8%, Medicare outlays increased 9%, spending on defense went up 7% and spending on veterans health care rose 14%, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said he would like to see Musk testify before the House Armed Services Committee on the “bloated defense budget.”“I’d like to see Elon recommend some cuts. Let’s have him testify,” Khanna said.He said he’s open to hearing proposals on non-defense spending, but was skeptical.“If they find waste, maybe, but in terms of big numbers, I mean, no one is going to allow for cutting education funding for special needs kids and for low-income schools, or for cutting Social Security and Medicare,” Khanna said. “If they want to do that, they’re going to hand us a landslide in 2026.”Published By: indiatodayglobal Published On: Dec 6, 2024Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamys-doge-mission-revolutionising-governance-on-capitol-hill-2645729-2024-12-06","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202412/indian-origin-businessman-vivek-ramaswamy-and-billionaire-elon-musk-photo-ap--reuters-250128249-16x9.jpg?VersionId=1InD_xwi2Y04mr74AoSVMF09A3z1qCXt?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:45:47","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.029},{"id":270814972,"title":"Emmanuel Macron vows to stay in office, will name new Prime Minister soon","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister in the coming days whose top priority will be getting a 2025 budget adopted by parliament, he said on Thursday after the government was toppled by lawmakers.Michel Barnier, a veteran conservative, became the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history when he resigned on Thursday after parliament voted him out over his fiscal plans, barely three months after he was appointed.In a televised address to the nation, Macron said he would name a successor to Barnier \"in the coming days.\"\"The priority will be the budget,\" Macron said.A special law to roll over the 2024 budget and avoid any gap will be put forward by mid-December. Then the new government will prepare a full budget early next year, in particular to account for inflation, for a vote by parliament.Macron, whose ill-fated decision to call a snap ballot in June delivered a much-divided parliament, denied he was responsible for the political crisis.The president, who represents a centrist party, said the far-right and left-wing parties united in an \"anti-republican front\" to create \"a mess\" by ousting Barnier.Macron has been weakened by the crisis but resisted calls by some in the opposition for him to resign. He reaffirmed that he will stay in office until his term ends in May 2027.\"The mandate you have given me is for five years and I will fulfil it until the very end,\" he said.In a 10-minute speech, he added that the new government should represent a variety of parties willing to take part in it or at least agree not to censure it. He did not say which ones.Meanwhile, Macron has asked Barnier and his government to stay in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed.FISCAL DEFICIT, DIVIDED PARLIAMENTIt was unclear if a new government will be in place before a ceremony on Saturday to reopen Notre-Dame Cathedral, which has been renovated after a devastating fire. World leaders including U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are expected to attend.Macron cited the rebuilding of the Gothic cathedral and successful Paris Olympics over the summer as evidence that France can deliver.\"They are proof that we can do great things. We can do the impossible,\" he said. \"The world admires us for that.\"Macron had lunch on Thursday with Francois Bayrou, whose name has been cited by French media as a possible successor to Barnier, Le Parisien newspaper reported. An aide to Bayrou did not respond to a request for comment.Any new prime minister will face the same challenge of dealing with a fractured parliament that Barnier did, notably passing a budget at a time when France needs to rein in its public finances.French bonds and stocks rallied on Thursday on what some traders said was profit-taking following the widely expected outcome of parliament's no-confidence vote that ousted Barnier. But the relief rally is unlikely to last, given the scale of political uncertainty.\"Until potential new elections, ongoing political uncertainty is likely to keep the risk premium on French assets elevated,\" SocGen analysts said in a note. The earliest possible date for a parliamentary election would be in July.The fall of France's government leaves the country without a clear path towards reducing its fiscal deficit, and the most likely outcome is less belt-tightening than previously planned, credit rating agency Standard and Poor's said.Published By: Akhilesh NagariPublished On: Dec 6, 2024Trending

deportations.\n\nTrump’s team made no immediate comment Thursday on the Bahamas’ rejection, which appeared to reveal one part of how he plans to enact radical migration reform when in office.\n\nREAD

Ramaswamy bring Trump's DOGE to Capitol Hill","text":"WASHINGTON - \n\n Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy spent several hours Thursday swapping ideas with lawmakers about president-elect Donald Trump's DOGE initiative to dismantle parts of the federal government.\n\n Meeting behind closed doors at the Capitol, Musk told the mostly Republican lawmakers they would be keeping a \"naughty and nice\" list of those who join in the budget slashing proposals and those who don't, according to lawmakers who attended.\n\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App \n\n \"We're going to see a lot of change around here in Washington,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, as Musk, with his young son on his shoulders, breezed by and into the private meeting.\n\n Trump tapped the two business titans to head his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations -- all part of what he calls his \"Save America\" agenda for a second term in the White House.\n\n Washington has seen this before, with ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government that historically have run into resistance when the public is confronted with cuts to trusted programs that millions of Americans depend on for jobs, health care, military security and everyday needs.\n\n But this time Trump is staffing his administration with battle-tested architects of sweeping proposals, some outlined in Project 2025, to severely reduce and reshape the government. Musk and Ramaswamy have said they plan to work alongside the White House's Office of Management and Budget, headed by Trump's nominee Russ Vought, a mastermind of past cuts.\n\n \"DOGE has a historic opportunity for structural reductions in the federal government,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. \"We are prepared for the onslaught.\"\n\n The duo faced a first test as they sat on a auditorium stage in the Capitol basement, as House and Senate lawmakers, almost exclusively Republicans, lined up at the microphones to share ideas for ways to address the nation's budget imbalances.\n\n Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the chair of the Education and Workforce Committee, brought up the Department of Education as a good place to cut. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., said to look at office space and how little of it is being used. Others talked about the need for workers to return to their offices.\n\n Afterward, Johnson declined to say if Medicare, Social Security or other popular programs were off limits for cuts, describing this first meeting as a \"brainstorming\" session with more to come.\n\n \"They said everything has to be looked at,\" said Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., who joined with Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, in launching what they are calling the DOGE caucus in the House, with more than 50 Republicans and two Democratic members.\n\n Vivek Ramaswamy arrives at the Capitol in Washington, Dec. 5, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\n Musk and Ramaswamy appeared to be taking it all in, Musk at times even taking notes, lawmakers said -- experiencing a day in the life of congressional leadership, as the meeting went on and on, with lawmakers lined up 20-deep for their chance to speak.\n\n \"It was just what I'd hoped for, where it was a question and answer session, so that members could come up, express their ideas, concerns, ask questions,\" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who will chair a House Oversight subcommittee in the new year on DOGE.\n\n To be sure, it wasn't the full Congress participating, as most Democrats did not join.\n\n New York Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi said when he heard Musk mention that he was open to hearing from Democrats, he dashed over to join toward the end of the session.\n\n \"Let's do some things to try and make government more efficient -- without hurting people,\" Suozzi said.\n\n Musk and Ramaswamy left lawmakers with the impression they would be back for more, holding regular meetings and starting a podcast or some other way to share information with Americans to gauge public support -- or opposition -- to the proposals.\n\n While neither Musk nor Ramaswamy have much public service experience, they bring track records in private business -- Musk's operations have vast government contracts -- and enthusiasm for Trump's agenda, having campaigned alongside him in the final stretch of the election.\n\n The world's richest man, Musk poured millions into a get-out-the-vote effort to help the former president return to the White House. He is known politically for having transformed the popular social media site formerly known as Twitter into X, a platform embraced by Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" enthusiasts.\n\n Despite its name, the Department of Government Efficiency is neither a department nor part of the government, which frees Musk and Ramaswamy from having to go through the typical ethics and background checks required for federal employment. They said they will not be paid for their work.\n\n One good-government group has said that DOGE, as a presidential advisory panel, should be expected to adhere to traditional practices of transparency, equal representation and public input -- as happened with similar advisory entities from the Reagan to the Obama administrations.\n\n The Federal Advisory Committee Act \"is designed expressly for situations like this,\" wrote Lisa Gilbert and Robert Weissman, the co-chairs of Public Citizen, in a letter to the Trump transition team.\n\n \"If the government is going to turn to unelected and politically unaccountable persons to make recommendations as grand as $2 trillion in budget cuts, it must ensure those recommendations come from a balanced and transparent process not rigged to benefit insiders.\"\n\n Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp \n\n The nation's US$6 trillion federal budget routinely runs a deficit, which this year ran $1.8 trillion, a historic high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It has not been balanced since the Clinton administration more than two decades ago.\n\n Republicans generally blame what they see as exorbitant spending for the deficit, while Democrats point to tax cuts enacted under Republican presidents Trump and George W. Bush as the major driver.\n\n Receipts last year as a percentage of gross domestic product came in just below the average for the past 50 years, while outlays were equal to 23.4 per cent of GDP, compared to the 50-year average of 21.1 per cent.\n\n Some of the biggest increases in spending last year occurred with politically popular programs that lawmakers will be reticent to touch. For example, spending on Social Security benefits went up eight per cent, Medicare outlays increased nine per cent, spending on defence went up seven per cent and spending on veterans health care rose 14 per cent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said the significance of the meeting was that it was even taking place, \"that there's honest dialogue between Congress and two, like, rock star administration guys.\"\n\n Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said he would like to see Musk testify before the House Armed Services Committee on the \"bloated defence budget.\"\n\n \"I'd like to see Elon recommend some cuts. Let's have him testify,\" Khanna said.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-bring-trump-s-doge-to-capitol-hill-1.7134936","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/12/5/donald-trump-news--elon-musk-1-7134948-1733418091722.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:38:46","author":"Lisa Mascaro And Kevin Freking,The Associated Press","authors":["Lisa Mascaro And Kevin Freking","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.147},{"id":270814020,"title":"There's Another Ridiculous Hit Piece on Pete Hegseth","text":"Another liberal outlet wrote a pathetic hit piece on President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, claiming he had a drinking problem during his tenure as a host on Fox News. \n\nNBC News published an article alleging that ten unnamed, unverified sources, who the outlet claims are current or former Fox News employees, said that Hegseth, “on more than a dozen occasions,” would come to work smelling of alcohol. The sources chose to remain anonymous “out of fear of retaliation.” \n\n“Those same two people, plus another, said that during his time there, he appeared on television after they’d heard him talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set,” the so-called sources said. \n\nHowever, none of the “sources” the outlet spoke to could recall an instance when Hegseth missed a scheduled appearance because he’d been drinking or was hungover. \n\nOn Sunday night, The New Yorker detailed concerns about Hegseth’s drinking at two jobs he held at nonprofit veterans’ groups before he joined Fox. “A previously undisclosed whistle-blower report on Hegseth’s tenure as the president of Concerned Veterans for America, from 2013 until 2016, describes him as being repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity — to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization’s events,” the magazine reported. Three current employees said his drinking remained a concern up until Trump announced him as his choice to run the Pentagon, at which point Hegseth left Fox.\n\nFollowing the scathing article, several of Hegseth’s colleagues came forward to defend their embattled former colleague amidst the sexual misconduct allegations against him. \n\n“Bullsh*t,” Fox and Friends co-host Will Cain declared. “100 percent bullsh*t. Actually…horsesh*t.” \n\nCain and Hegseth co-hosted Fox and Friends every Saturday and Sunday for five hours starting at 6 a.m.\n\nThe losers at @NBCNews never reached out to me either. @willcain is right - your story IS horseshit.

During the call, Bellavia dismissed their story as nonsense and said their claims were inaccurate.\n\nDespite this, NBC News chose not to include a single word from the conversation in their coverage.\n\nRachel Campos Duffy, Cain, and Hegseth’s other Fox and Friends co-host also denied the “losers” at NBC News and demanded the outlet retract or correct its story. \n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself for posting these lies!

Ron DeSantis (R-FL.) for defense secretary, the former Fox News host said that Trump told him to \"keep going\" and to \"keep fighting\" as the left attempts to bully him into withdrawing his name from consideration. \n\n\"I spoke to the President-elect this morning. He said, ‘Keep going. keep fighting.

Their optimism feels naive.","text":"Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to attempt to build support for the Department of Government Efficiency, the nongovernmental group President-elect Donald Trump created to slash government spending (which apparently means suggesting drastic austerity measures). Musk and Ramaswamy, who are co-heading the group, didn't stop to take questions from the media, according to The Washington Post, which is too bad given there are many questions worth asking about their project. I’m on the record with my disbelief in Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s knowledge of how to effectively run the government, in part because they have no experience doing it. And yet, one of the more jarring things I’ve witnessed in recent weeks is budding Democratic support — some of it offered with cautious optimism — for Musk and Ramaswamy’s commission, which seems ripe for corruption and could spike America’s poverty rate if it leads to cuts in programs that help seniors and the poor. Still, multiple Democrats have been outspoken in touting what they deem to be the potential upsides (which, to be clear, will advise the White House from outside of the government). The list, as Business Insider reported, includes Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley and optimistically claimed the organization could “help bring accountability to defense contractors”; Rep. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, who said he was “happy” to join the so-called “DOGE caucus” but said he would call out “stupid” stuff; independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Khanna, claimed Musk could cut military spending; and New York Mayor Eric Adams, who, for some reason, thinks the group is going to improve U.S. education. As I wrote in late November, Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware is also optimistic. I think it’s necessary to tamp down some of this naïveté. In that regard, I'm in alignment with Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greg Casar, who told Business Insider they're doubtful this Musk-led group will do much of anything productive. We have ample reason to believe them. The right-wingers who will be most empowered to carry out this organization’s mission of deep spending cuts have used some pretty ominous language to describe its goals. Musk has openly said his plan will require Americans to suffer “hardship.” Ramaswamy has vowed to “crush the bureaucracy.” House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the goal of the group is to take a “blowtorch” to the federal government (which he suggested he preferred to the chainsaw wielded by far-right, austerity-loving, Argentinian leader Javier Milei as a prop). This is the language of destruction. So, while some Democrats sound encouraged that this organization will do some good, others seem to be applying the \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" principle. They all ought to ask themselves whether something designed to kneecap the government will do anything but that.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/musk-ramaswamy-doge-aoc-democrats-rcna183080","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241205-elon-musk-ch-1531-423dfe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:37:46","author":"Ja'han Jones","authors":["Ja'han Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":270814324,"title":"Watch former RNC Chair demolish Trump, Musk ‘voodoo BS’ agenda ","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

Trump’s selection of former Fox News contributor (and MSNBC alum) Monica Crowley — who reportedly spread the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was secretly Muslim — as chief of protocol at the State Department brings the total number of prospective former Fox News employees in his administration to 12, according to a tally by left-leaning media accountability group Media Matters. (The outlet also notes that several other frequent Fox News guests are slated to serve in high-ranking positions.) The White House could soon become a Fox den (see what I did there?) — just as it was the first time Trump was president. Trump — cable news-obsessed septuagenarian that he is — could become an even greater hero to like-minded armchair curmudgeons in just a few months, going from yelling at the Fox News talent on his television to barking orders at them face to face. On Wednesday's episode of “The ReidOut with Joy Reid,” former NBC executive John Miller, who helped market Trump’s reality show “The Apprentice,” gave some insight into Trump’s decision-making on that show that could apply to his Cabinet picks, as well. In picking winners on the show, Miller said, Trump prioritized several things above competence, including “loyalty,” how much a person praised him, how public that praise was and how someone looked physically doing the job. Miller said “actual ability to do the job based on credentials or experience does not seem to be important” to Trump and is last on his list of qualifications. There’s no reason to believe the batch of former Fox News talent Trump has selected to work in his administration are being judged on anything other than how well they follow his orders — and how good they look on TV doing it.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-cabinet-fox-news-white-house-rcna183074","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240618-Des-Moines-donald-trump-ac-506p-91f0f0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:37:46","author":"Ja'han Jones","authors":["Ja'han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.007},{"id":270814318,"title":"Trump's pick of Peter Navarro for trade adviser shows a commitment to extremism","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has picked his former trade adviser, Peter Navarro, to join his next administration as his “Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing.” Compared to some of Trump’s other choices — like Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and Matt Gaetz (who has since withdrawn) for attorney general — Navarro appears at first blush to be a tame choice. He is not dogged by personal sex scandals. And he has substantial formal qualifications for the job — he is a Harvard-trained economist and was a tenured professor at the University of California. But his policy knowledge and more buttoned-up appearance shouldn’t obscure the reality that he is very much a stick of Trumpian dynamite. The president-elect chose Navarro for his fanatical devotion to two causes: economic nationalism and Trump himself. Navarro can serve as a relatively competent lieutenant — at least by Trump’s standards — while the president pursues his promised radical agenda on tariffs and China. He can also be trusted to help Trump undermine democratic institutions and sit in on top conversations with Trump that could potentially be legally incriminating — and not flip on his boss. The Navarro pick comes just months after he was released from a four-month prison sentence after being convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress. Navarro refused to comply with a congressional subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. As Politico explained at the time of his sentencing, Navarro had a significant role in Trump’s efforts to deny the results of the 2020 election: Navarro defied the subpoena, claiming he could not be compelled to provide documents or testimony due to executive privilege. That is the concept that, as CNN explains, “presidents can shield their aides from having to share internal communications with Congress when it is conducting oversight.” But a federal judge ruled that Navarro failed to prove that Trump had blocked him from testifying to the select committee. Navarro became the first former White House official to be imprisoned for a contempt of Congress conviction. In other words, even though Trump didn’t come to Navarro’s rescue, Navarro went to jail refusing to say anything that might strengthen the case against Trump. What explains his extreme devotion? It doesn’t hurt that they have similar personality traits, such as grandstanding and a tenuous relationship with the truth. “I still have some principles. But not as many as you might think because I don’t have any concern at all about making stuff up about my opponent that isn’t exactly true,” Navarro wrote in 1998 while reflecting on his many failed efforts to win public office. But their main link is a shared interest in fierce economic nationalism, protectionist views on trade and outright paranoia about China. Navarro is formally trained as an economist, but he stands on the fringe of his field in his hostility toward free trade and his views on how tariffs work. That position made him appealing to Trump long before Trump’s presidential run. Trump even wrote a blurb endorsing Navarro’s 2012 alarmist documentary “Death by China,” a film adapted from his book by the same name. Navarro described that book as a “survival guide” to outmaneuvering “the planet’s most efficient assassin,” cautioning against ever buying products made in China and prescribing a trade war to generate new jobs in the U.S. His antipathy toward Beijing goes well beyond economics: Navarro also likened China’s growing military to Nazi Germany and counseled an aggressive defense posture toward China. Navarro played a key role in shaping Trump’s trade strategy during his first term, and his return signals Trump is as serious as ever about pursuing an aggressive tariff strategy, unraveling free trade norms and agreements, and potentially escalating trade wars with China, as well as U.S. allies. To the extent that Navarro influences high-level conversations on China policy, he’s likely to have a high threshold for risk when it comes to destabilizing the complicated and competitive U.S.-Chinese relationship. Perhaps the best illustration of the kind of figure Navarro is in Trump World — industrious, wonky, obedient — is that even when he was in prison this year for refusing to comply with an inquiry into his involvement in efforts to overturn the election, he was still working on detailed policy proposals for a future Trump administration. While incarcerated he also mocked his former “globalist” rivals within the first Trump administration in correspondence with Semafor. And in August, just hours after being released from prison, he offered the audience classically Trumpian sounding rhetoric at the Republican National Convention: “If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful. They will come for you.” Does he believe it? Who knows. But Navarro knows that his political window is open for a little longer.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/peter-navarro-trump-trade-tariffs-china-rcna182938","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241204-pete-navarro-donald-trump-2020-ac-535p-84b229.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:37:46","author":"Zeeshan Aleem","authors":["Zeeshan Aleem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":270814320,"title":"When to lean in — or let go — if politics enter your family holiday gathering","text":"The holidays are meant for joy and connection, yet they often bring their fair share of tension — especially when politics or social issues enter the conversation. I grew up believing that the family gathering table, particularly around the holidays, was a sacred space. It was never just about sustenance. The family gathering was about being in community with the people whom you share an unshakable bond — those who would always protect the best interests of others at that table. At least, that was what I was taught. In recent years, however, I have seen another side of what it means to be family: the reality that sometimes, instead of fostering connection, it reveals the bad actors in our lives — even among those we once held dearest. It can illuminate the boundaries that must be built or the bridges that must be burned to protect our emotional safety and well-being. I have come to realize that being related by blood doesn’t necessarily mean that those gathered will protect you. Finding family isn’t always about unity, or forcing yourself to remain in a place that causes you harm. Sometimes, it’s about clarity, and the difficult choices that come with it. This fall, after a conversation that spanned more than 1,000 texts in various family group chats, my husband and I made the difficult decision to hold a hard and fast boundary with much of my immediate family, whose stated values and votes made it clear to us that we could not feel comfortable around them. Earlier this year, we faced a similar decision with my father-in-law when it became clear that Donald Trump was running for president again and that he would be supporting him once more. Additionally, there have been co-workers, even people we considered friends, where bridges had to be burned when their beliefs became a threat to my humanity. We all have three choices as we approach our various gathering tables: break bread, build a boundary, or burn a bridge. These choices aren’t easy, but they are essential. With my family, the decision to build boundaries or burn bridges, instead of continuing to break bread, came after years of painstaking effort to converse, actively listen, reframe issues, and try to align on values. These were decisions we did not make lightly or hastily, but sometimes the best course of action is, in fact, to ban the bad actors. I’ve always believed in the power of better arguments over avoiding them. Engaging in respectful, thoughtful discussions helps us understand opposing viewpoints and strengthens our relationships. The Better Arguments Project advocates for this approach by encouraging meaningful dialogue. But, as you head into your holiday gatherings, I want you to remember this simple truth: You do not have to be nice. You do not have to betray yourself or your boundaries for the comfort of others. You do not have to be a peacemaker in a world engulfed in flames of division. The opposite of “nice” is not “mean”; it is not even “kind” as many purport. Instead, I think of the antithesis of nice as nerve. Having the nerve to build a boundary or even burn a bridge when necessary. Having the nerve to say, “This is where I draw the line,” and to honor your own emotional safety and values, even when others don’t. Nerve is about standing firm in your beliefs and protecting your well-being, even when it’s uncomfortable. Showing up with a strategy for which option to choose — and when — is a powerful way to navigate the complexities of holiday gatherings. Breaking Bread Breaking bread is one of the most intimate actions we can take in a relationship. Sitting at a table to share a meal is about so much more than satisfying one’s appetite. It’s an opportunity to connect, share and build relationships. It’s a space where life’s biggest decisions are made. It’s where handshake deals are struck, life plans are forged, and meaningful conversations shape the course of relationships and futures. When you choose to break bread, it’s about staying open to meaningful conversations, even when there are differences. One way to approach these moments is with a “Yes, and” mindset. This doesn’t mean you agree with everything being said — it means you acknowledge someone’s perspective and build on it with curiosity and compassion. For example, if someone says, “I just think people need to work harder,” you might respond: “I hear you — hard work is really important, and I think we can all agree that everyone deserves a fair chance. Sometimes, though, the systems around us make it harder for people to access the resources they need to succeed. If we want fairness, we need to address those barriers together.” Breaking bread is about using thoughtful framing to keep the conversation open. By focusing on shared values, asking questions, and staying curious, we can turn what could be tense moments into opportunities to foster connection. Building a Boundary Sometimes, when a conversation or relationship begins to feel unsafe or harmful, it’s time to build a boundary. A boundary is a line you draw to protect yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically. Boundaries aren’t about controlling others — they’re about respecting yourself and maintaining your peace. At the holiday table, boundaries might look like: Redirecting the conversation to a neutral topic.Politely but firmly stating, “I’d rather not discuss this right now.”Excusing yourself from the table or gathering if things escalate. For instance, if a family member starts making hurtful or inflammatory comments, you might say: “I appreciate your perspective, but I’d prefer to focus on something else tonight so we can all enjoy this time together.” Boundaries allow you to stay in the room while protecting your well-being. They’re not a failure of connection — they’re a tool for preserving it healthily and respectfully. Burning a Bridge Burning a bridge is the hardest choice, but sometimes it’s the only one left. When someone refuses to respect boundaries, engages in toxic behavior, or consistently brings harm into your life, walking away may be the best option. For me, burning bridges has been a painful but necessary part of protecting myself, my family, and my values. Again, these decisions came after years of trying to have conversations, actively listening, and reframing issues to find common ground. When it became clear that the other person wasn’t willing to engage respectfully, I had to let go. Burning a bridge doesn’t mean you don’t care; it means prioritizing your emotional health and safety. It’s not a decision to make lightly, but sometimes, it’s the most loving choice you can make for yourself. Tools for Navigating Holiday Conversations When deciding whether to break bread, build a boundary, or burn a bridge, having a plan or some phrases on hand can help you navigate these moments with intention. Here are some tools I’ve found helpful: Lead with shared values: Start with principles like fairness, justice, or opportunity. These values set the tone for a respectful exchange.Use “Yes, and” Framing: Acknowledge part of the other person’s perspective before gently introducing your own. For example: “Yes, I understand where you’re coming from, and I think there’s another piece to consider…”Ask questions: My go-to phrases, “How might we” and “Say more,” invite others to elaborate without escalating the conversation. It shows curiosity and keeps dialogue flowing.Use explanatory chains: Link causes to effects to provide clarity. For example: “I agree that hard work is important, but not everyone starts with the same opportunities. Schools in underfunded areas, for instance, often lack resources, which means even hardworking kids don’t always get a fair chance. Addressing those disparities can create a more level playing field.”Know when to step away: If a conversation becomes hostile, it’s OK to walk away or redirect. Protecting your peace is just as important as fostering dialogue. Embracing the Complexity This holiday season, I know I will embrace both the joy and the challenge of gathering. Whether you choose to break bread, build a boundary, or burn a bridge, approach each choice with intention, compassion and courage. In my communications role, every month, I provide colleagues with ideas on what to read, watch, and do to have more meaningful conversations. Here are some tools I have personally found helpful that may inspire you this holiday season: Read: Storytelling can help others become more receptive to your values and beliefs. Tell your personal story to make it easier for people to engage with and understand your point of view. This approach fosters empathy and encourages open, constructive conversations. Read the study for a deeper dive into this idea. Watch: Fatimah Gilliam, resolutionary lawyer and trusted friend, offers insightful tips on navigating difficult conversations, perfect for any upcoming gatherings. Her practical advice ensures you can approach sensitive topics with grace and understanding, making her guidance invaluable for fostering positive interactions during the holiday season. Do: Simplify your conversations and remove the guesswork by curating meaningful exchanges. Earlier this year, I picked up a deck of conscious conversation cards to engage more thoughtfully with my daughter. These cards encourage deeper connections and more intentional dialogue. Check them out on Instagram for inspiration: Conscious Conversations. Family itself is complex. Sometimes, the best way to protect what matters most is to let go — and sometimes, it’s to lean in. Both are acts of love that demand courage and nerve, rather than being nice. Whether you choose to break bread, build a boundary, or burn a bridge, know that each choice reflects your love for yourself and the people who truly matter. I encourage you to believe that there is a family gathering table out there that will accept you and protect you. Sometimes, that family is chosen rather than inherited — and that’s OK. The most important thing is finding — or creating — a space where you can be fully seen and valued.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/lean-let-go-politics-enter-family-holiday-gathering-rcna183068","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241205-holiday-dinner-mn-1645-365121.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:37:46","author":"Amira Barger","authors":["Amira Barger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.122},{"id":270814314,"title":"Trump’s new nepotism explained","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

Matt Gaetz. One, from Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, would have required the committee to make the report public; and another, from Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee, would have directed the committee to preserve and release records related to its investigation. Both resolutions were referred back to the committee almost entirely along a party-line vote, effectively ending the matter. Earlier on Thursday, the House Ethics Committee failed again to come to an agreement to release its report on its investigation into Gaetz, a move that set the stage for the full House vote on Thursday evening. The ethics committee, which consists of five Republicans and five Democrats, had previously failed to reach a consensus on whether to make the report public in a closed-door meeting on Nov. 20. At the time, Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, D-Pa., suggested that the vote split along party lines. “I’m not going to speculate on future action that the committee may take,” Ethics Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss., said when asked whether it might still vote to release the report, according to NBC News. Gaetz was investigated by the ethics committee over allegations of sexual misconduct and illegal drug use. A separate Justice Department investigation into allegations that Gaetz engaged in sex trafficking ended last year without any charges being brought against him. Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing in both investigations. The ethics report became the subject of fierce debate after President-elect Donald Trump announced the Florida Republican as his nominee for attorney general. Gaetz then abruptly resigned from the House, effectively ending the committee’s jurisdiction over him. As the controversy over the report has threatened to bubble over, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the AG post. Despite Gaetz dropping out of contention for attorney general, Democrats have continued to advocate for the report’s release, saying there is precedent for doing so after a lawmaker has resigned. House Republicans have so far unanimously resisted those calls.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-house-vote-rcna183071","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-11/241116-matt-gaetz-ch-0915-0aedb9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:37:46","author":"Clarissa-Jan Lim","authors":["Clarissa-Jan Lim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":270813914,"title":"Mystery, volatility, Trump: the Bitcoin phenomenon","text":"Despite being the world's most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin -- whose value on Thursday passed $100,000 for the first time -- has always been surrounded by mystery and controversy.\n\nHere are some things to know about the volatile digital unit, which has soared since Donald Trump won the US election promising to make the country the \"bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world\":\n\nIn the 16 years since Bitcoin was invented, no one has been able to name its founder.\n\nIt all started in October 2008, when a nine-page \"white paper\" attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto theorised \"a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash (that) would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another\".\n\nThe idea was to break free from the control of central banks, traditionally the only institutions who can create money. But is Satoshi Nakamoto a real name, a pseudonym, or a team of people? Despite various theories, the mystery endures. An Australian computer scientist called Craig Wright claimed to have written the white paper, but the High Court in London ruled this year that he was not the mythical Nakamoto.\n\nSince its creation, bitcoin has been accused of being the currency of choice on the dark web for illegal payments that leave no trace. It is also the currency that hackers usually demand to be paid in during ransomware attacks.\n\nThe crypto world has been shaken by high-profile bankruptcies and the fall of several star entrepreneurs.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, formerly head of the world's largest cryptocurrency platform Binance, was sentenced to four months in jail for violating US anti-money laundering laws.\n\n\"No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn't mind a pardon,\" Zhao said on X this week, alluding to Trump's presidential authority to grant clemency.\n\nBinance's main rival, FTX, filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced in March to 25 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy.\n\nHis downfall has smeared the sector's reputation, but the crypto industry has continued to call for more regulatory clarity, a cause championed by Bankman-Fried.\n\nBitcoin investors on Thursday cheered Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing hopes that the leader will push through looser measures.\n\nEven though much of the hype around bitcoin is speculative, the currency has gained some respectability in recent years.\n\nUS financial regulators in January approved bitcoin ETFs, or exchange traded funds, which allow a wider public to invest without having to hold the cryptocurrency directly.\n\nEl Salvador in September 2021 became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender.\n\nBut the crypto money hasn't won over the country's population.

Each transaction is recorded in real time, in a tamper-proof register.\n\nBitcoins are created -– or \"extracted\" -- as a \"reward\" when powerful energy-sucking computers solve complex problems. So-called \"miners\" validate the transactions to create bitcoins.\n\nTo prevent uncontrollable growth, Satoshi Nakamoto limited the global number of coin units to 21 million, a level that should be reached around 2140.\n\nEvery four years, the reward for \"miners\" is cut in two -- slowing down the rate that new bitcoins enter the market, further boosting their scarcity and their value.","url":"https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/mystery-volatility-trump-the-bitcoin-phenomenon-3769501","image":"https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/all/themes/sloth/images/bangla-banner.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:36:47","author":"Central America University","authors":["Central America University"],"language":"en","source_country":"bd","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":270813508,"title":"Ivanka Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio hit Palm Tree Club pre-opening during Art Basel Miami Beach","text":"Ivanka Trump and Leonardo DiCaprio were spotted separately at a techno-fueled pre-opening of the new Palm Tree Club in Miami, Fla. \n\nA source tells us that Trump, 43 — the daughter of President-elect Donald Trump — had private security with her. \n\nDiCaprio, 50, an avid art collector, comes to Art Basel annually.

News portals were reporting that India’s cryptocurrency exchange WazirX had been hacked. At first, he thought that meant a “technical glitch” and things would get back to normal. The full extent of his misfortune was yet to be revealed.“My cousin told me some Rs 2,000 crore had been stolen from the company,” said the 32-year-old man. “I immediately rushed to withdraw my Rs 7 lakh investment on WazirX but it was too late--no transactions were allowed.”The prospect of never being able to get his money back has caused sleeplessness, anxiety, emotional distress and setbacks in business. At home, he pretends nothing has happened. “My wife thinks I do some stock market trade,” he said. “She doesn’t understand crypto stuff--she thinks we are rich.”He dwells on what might have been.“Every day, I take a pen and paper (to calculate) and tell my co-worker that today the value of my crypto would have been Rs 25 lakh,” he said. “(Auto) agency guys would have given us so much business on such credit.”He’s not alone. About 15 million users of WazirX were victims of one of the largest cyberattacks on a cryptocurrency exchange in July, leading to the theft of investor holdings worth $235 million or nearly half of the platform's estimated reserves. Since then, the remaining funds on the platform have been frozen and trading has been halted.ET spoke to about a dozen people who had invested between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1.5 crore on the platform. Many recounted tales of financial distress--individuals driven into debt, some having to flee their villages and others grappling with suicidal thoughts.Where is the money?Somewhere the thief (or thieves) who masterminded this heist is watching the tokens swell in value in the ongoing crypto bull run. As per an analysis of Lookonchain data, that $235 million will now be valued at about $330 million.Crypto prices have skyrocketed in the past month following the victory of Donald Trump—a sceptic-turned-champion—in the US elections. In the past month, crypto market cap has grown from $2.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion, surpassing that of companies like Apple and Nvidia.Netherlands-based blockchain intelligence firm Crystal Intelligence recently said that the WazirX thief has almost finished laundering the stolen funds via TornadoCash. Only $6 million of Ether (ETH) remains traceable. TornadoCash is an open source, non-custodial, fully decentralised cryptocurrency platform that shuffles crypto tokens, making it difficult to track the source of funds and recover any stolen money.The rebalancingOwned by Singapore-based Zettai Pte Ltd, WazirX was once the largest Indian exchange, holding over $535 million in investor assets. Investors have been incensed at the manner in which the crisis has been handled, with much of the anger directed at cofounder and CEO Nischal Shetty.To be sure, on November 6, WazirX announced that it plans to return 52% of total creditor claims through remaining liquid assets ($284 million) while the remaining 48% will be distributed over the coming years from future profits and recoveries of the stolen assets. It must be noted that the unstolen liquid funds are today valued at $577 million.But WazirX has set a cut-off of 1 pm India time on July 18 to determine claim value. This has enraged investors as their holdings would have surged in value since then. For instance, when WazirX was drained, Shiba Inu (SHIB), was the largest category token stolen by value. Since then, this has grown to $173 million from $102 million. Similarly, Pepe’s value has grown from $7.6 million to $14 million.It should be noted that Bitcoin (BTC) has been the biggest gainer, soaring 60% in value since the hack. But BTC was not stolen by the hacker because the underlying blockhain’s design makes it hard to compromise. Therefore, BTC investors on WazirX are fuming over why they must pare their gains due to the company’s lack of security.Also Read: Crypto’s legal tangles seem as mystifying as digital asset itself“If the platform undergoes restructuring or liquidation, all users’ claims are treated equally, with available assets distributed proportionally,” a WazirX spokesperson told ET.Zettai is undergoing a restructuring programme under the Singapore High Court and the scheme requires approval by a minimum 75% of creditors.WazirX and its third-party custody solutions partner Liminal Custody are at loggerheads, accusing each other over vulnerabilities in systems that were exploited by the hacker. WazirX blamed Liminal and terminated its contract with the custody and wallet infrastructure platform. Meanwhile, through an independent audit, Liminal showed that it’s merely a software provider and did not have any control over WazirX’s funds.Pressing questionsSince the incident, serious concerns have been raised about WazirX’s conduct by the investor community, crypto experts and blockchain security firms.“The two most alarming questions, which Nischal Shetty has consistently failed to address are, one--why, for all these years, were investors not informed that the ownership of the company was disputed between WazirX and Binance?” said Romy Johnson, a leading representative of the WazirX investor community. “Second—and perhaps more troubling—why did WazirX store $235 million worth of tokens in a single wallet while spreading $300 million across 240,000 wallets? Was this an open invitation for hackers to strike?”WazirX said handling thousands of wallets is “normal” for large exchanges.Also Read: WazirX suffers security breach; $235 million worth of funds movedIn 2019, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, announced that it had acquired WazirX. However, Binance now claims the deal never materialised due to Zettai’s failure to meet its obligations. This dispute is currently being litigated in a Singapore court, leaving investors in a lurch.Johnson questioned why WazirX had failed to maintain surplus reserves to handle crises.“The hack amount is too huge and large exchanges cannot maintain such a high surplus ratio,” WazirX said in response to this.Investor Johnson also sought clarification on Shetty’s funds and queried the cut-off date.“What happened to Nischal Shetty’s personal wealth or the company’s past profits?” he said. “What is the rationale behind selecting July 18 as the cut-off date for liabilities?”Johnson also asked why investors’ ₹100 crore was being used as a crisis management fund.“The lack of transparency and accountability is deeply troubling,” Johnson added, highlighting how these unresolved issues have undermined confidence.The investor community is demanding immediate action and clearer communication to safeguard the interests of those affected.Legal recourseScores of first information reports (FIRs), lawsuits, petitions to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), letters to the finance ministry, CERT-In and hundreds of daily social media posts appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Although crypto isn’t illegal, it isn’t recognised as an investment class under Indian law. But crypto trading income is taxed under the Income Tax Act. CERT-In is the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team, the nodal agency on cyber security.Last month, the Delhi Police special cell arrested SK Masud Alam of West Bengal, accusing him of selling a fake login to the thief.“Our police départements are unequipped to investigate such a sophisticated cybercrime… hence this is just scratching the surface,” said a lead lawyer in the case. “Neither can law enforce its weight because India does not recognise crypto as a legitimate investment class. It is only taxed as a virtual digital asset under the Income Tax Act. Only CERT-In is required to investigate the case as a cyberattack under the Information Technology Act.”Also Read: WazirX parent looking for ‘white knights’ to rescue crypto exchange","summary":"A July 18 hack on cryptocurrency exchange WazirX wiped out $235 million, affecting 15 million investors.

face Madrid [Full draw]","text":"Lionel Messi and Inter Miami will kick off FIFA’s new 32-team Club World Cup when the Major League Soccer side take on Egypt’s Al Ahly in the June 15 opener, the draw for the tournament revealed on Thursday.\n\nBrazilian team Palmeiras and Portugal’s Porto complete Group A alongside Argentina World Cup winner Messi, whose Miami team were handed a spot by FIFA after finishing top of the regular season standings in MLS.\n\nMessi’s former Barcelona team-mate, Brazilian Neymar, will have a reunion with La Liga rivals and European champions Real Madrid in Group H.\n\nTwelve European clubs will feature in the tournament with Manchester City facing Juventus in Group G of a tournament which FIFA president Gianni Infantino said would “start a new era in club football”.\n\nParis Saint-Germain were drawn in a tough group with Atletico Madrid, Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo of Brazil and Seattle Sounders.\n\nFIFA has had to deal with some scepticism over the need for the tournament and the chances of it capturing the imagination of fans but there was plenty of support for the competition among those at the draw.\n\nClub officials and former players gathered for Thursday’s draw and US President-elect Donald Trump sent his best wishes in a video message before the ceremony, which took place during a 90-minute live broadcast from a television studio in Miami.\n\n“The event is going to be incredible,” said Trump in his message where he praised Infantino as a “winner”.\n\n“We’ve known each other a long time and I’m so honoured to have this kind of relationship because soccer is going through the roof as everyone knows,” he added.\n\nThe USA will co-host the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada.\n\n– Clubs supportive –\n\nTrump’s daughter Ivanka took part in the draw which was presented by former Juventus and Italy forward Alessandro Del Piero and featured celebrities such as model Adriana Lima.\n\nThe final of the tournament will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 13.\n\nFIFA had struggled to find sponsors and broadcasters for the new tournament but on Wednesday announced a global deal with streaming company DAZN, who will show the games for free.\n\nThe world governing body has faced opposition from some in the game over the new tournament.\n\nFIFpro and the European Leagues body filed a joint complaint to the European Commission against FIFA over the introduction of the tournament into the international match calendar.\n\nOpponents of the new tournament have said it adds further congestion to an already crowded schedule and increases the workload of players.\n\nBut there was little but backing for the competition from the clubs and leagues who will be represented next year.\n\n“We are very supportive of this tournament, We are excited,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who is also chairman of the European Clubs Association.\n\nAl-Khelaifi said the tournament was a better way for clubs to perform in the USA than in pre-season friendly tours and would help PSG to spread their brand.\n\nThere was also support from Don Garber, commissioner of Major League Soccer and vice-chair of the World Leagues Association.\n\n“The tournament took time to generate all the interest that you are seeing here today,” said the American.\n\n“Good things come to those that sort of put in the work and FIFA put in the work and we’re going to have lots of our stadiums involved,\n\n“There are 100 million fans who follow what we call league (club) soccer and they’re going to be interested to see MLS teams and Mexican teams and see teams from all Europe, South America and the rest of the world, so I’m excited about it, I really am,” added Garber.\n\nPalmeiras (BRA)\n\nPorto (POR)\n\nAl Ahly

migrants","text":"The Bahamas on Thursday said it had rejected a proposal from the incoming Trump administration to receive deported migrants, with Mexico and Panama also stressing they would only take back their own citizens.\n\nDonald Trump’s team has drawn up a list of countries to which it wants to deport undocumented migrants when their home countries refuse to accept them, according to NBC News.\n\nSources told the television network that the countries that are being considered include the Bahamas, Grenada, Panama and the Turks and Caicos Islands.\n\nBut the Bahamas — an island nation in the Atlantic Ocean — said it had “reviewed and firmly rejected” the plan from the US president-elect, who campaigned for the White House on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants.\n\nBahamas Prime Minister Philip Davis’s office said in a statement that his government had received a proposal from the Trump transition team “to accept deportation flights of migrants from other countries.”\n\n“Since the Prime Minister’s rejection of this proposal, there has been no further engagement or discussions with the Trump transition team,” the statement added.\n\nThe Panamanian foreign ministry said it had received no such proposal from the Trump team, officially or unofficially.\n\n“What is more, under international law we are under no obligation to take in deportees who are not Panamanian,” it said in a statement.\n\nPanama wants to have good relations with the United States but “the foreign ministry believes clearly that our main mission is to protect the interests of Panama.”\n\nThe Turks and Caicos also said it would not accept deportees.\n\n“Turks and Caicos, like all nations, has the sovereign right to determine who may reside within its borders,” Immigration Minister Arlington Musgrove told the Miami Herald.\n\n“The unilateral imposition of third-country deportation policies, such as those reportedly under consideration by the incoming Trump administration, is fundamentally at odds with international norms and legal standards,” Musgrove told the newspaper.\n\n– ‘Invasion’ –\n\nMexico’s new President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country has an agreement with the Biden administration under which non-Mexicans crossing into the United States from Mexico without papers are sent directly back to their countries of origin, and she hopes this will continue with Trump.\n\n“Of course, we show solidarity with all people but our main function is to take in Mexicans and we hope to have an agreement with the Trump administration in case there are these deportations,” she said.\n\nTrump’s team made no immediate comment Thursday on the proposal reported by NBC, which appeared to reveal one part of how the incoming president plans to enact radical migration reform when in office.\n\nThe deportation plan could mean that migrants are permanently displaced in countries to which they have no links.\n\nIt is not clear if the migrants would be allowed to work — or what pressure Trump may apply to get countries to agree, NBC said.\n\nThe US government has struggled for years to manage its southern border with Mexico, and Trump on the campaign trail targeted concerns by claiming a migrant “invasion” is underway.\n\nAt rallies, he repeatedly railed against undocumented immigrants, accusing them of rape and murder and attacking those who “poison the blood” of the United States.\n\nHe has vowed to tackle migrant gangs using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — which allows the federal government to round up and deport foreigners belonging to enemy countries.\n\nTrump also promoted the fictitious story that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating residents’ pets.\n\nThe incoming president last month said he was bringing back hardline immigration official Tom Homan to oversee the country’s borders.\n\nHoman led immigration enforcement during part of Trump’s first administration.\n\nA British plan to deport its asylum seekers to Rwanda was dropped earlier this year when the Labour Party took power under Keir Starmer after ousting the Conservatives.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/12/us-neighbors-balk-at-trump-plan-for-deported-migrants/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Trump-US-President.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06

heading for the presidency... or prison","text":"Not even the massive storm predicted in Paris this weekend will dampen the excitement about Emmanuel Macron’s gala re-opening of Notre-Dame cathedral tomorrow.\n\nFive years after the fire that gutted the great religious symbol of France, its lame-duck president is planning a global media spectacular. Even Donald Trump is flying in.\n\nBut while this restoration may be magnificent, fixing France’s economic and political chaos looks vastly more difficult.\n\nTo lose one prime minister may seem a misfortune, but Macron – the head of state and grand strategist for government – has managed to get through five. Michel Barnier, defenestrated this week after just three months in the job, is merely the latest.\n\nThose who remember Barnier as the hard-nosed Brexit negotiator, who made steak tartare out of Theresa May, might be surprised by his failure to have won over the French parliament. He was no match for the Left-Right coalition that sunk his €50billion budget package of tax rises and spending cuts, and with it his minority government.\n\nBut Barnier was fundamentally right: France does need to pay its bills. Its high-tax, high-borrowing ways are unsustainable. The commentariat here are grasping for superlatives to express the depth of the crisis. Centre-Right newspaper Le Figaro said yesterday that the nation is ‘on the brink of financial collapse’.\n\nBut how close to the edge is France really? When might it break – and how? The 66-year-old Fifth Republic has its constitutional particularities. In most countries, when you kick a government out, you have an election. Not here. Since there was a National Assembly election in June, there can’t be another one until next summer.\n\nWhy? Them’s the rules.\n\nThat means, I’m afraid, that this paralysed political system could blink and gasp onwards for several months to come.\n\nInstead of the government shutdown in France that Barnier’s emissaries threatened, France will probably do what it has done for years – and simply borrow more money.\n\nBut the cost of this overdraft is going up. With national debt at more than 110 per cent of GDP, France is now paying an interest rate as high as that of the historic basket case Greece for its stupendous borrowings.\n\nMacron knows this – but without a prime minister he has limited ability to act. He could, though it seems unlikely, declare a national emergency and rule by decree. Even if he limps on, the campaign has already started for a presidential election that must be held by April 2027.\n\nMacron would be ineligible to run for a third consecutive term, even putting aside his staggering unpopularity, with an approval rating in the low 20s. The question is: Who will replace him?\n\nFrom the Left, the candidate could well be Jean-Luc Mélenchon, in loose terms a French Jeremy Corbyn, though angrier – a rabble rouser given to epic tantrums. He received a three-month suspended prison sentence after a 2018 incident in which he squared up to a policeman and screamed, ‘I am the Republic. I’m a politician. Get out of my way!’\n\nReportedly a millionaire, 73-year-old Mélenchon is chummy with numerous extreme Leftists, wokeists, transgenderists, greenies and Islamists. His economic policy is Venezuelan. He talks of a 90 per cent tax rate and lowering the retirement age.\n\nHis party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) has 71 of 577 deputies in the National Assembly, including a member of far-Left terror group Antifa on a security services watch list.\n\nThen there’s the populist Marine Le Pen, 56. Her hobby is breeding Bengal cats, an especially strong-willed and aggressive breed – rather reflective of her own character. Her party, National Rally, occupies 124 seats in the assembly and promises a firmer line on immigration, integration and crime – policies that play well here.\n\nThe big ‘but’ is that in 2027 she could be in jail – she has been on trial for alleged embezzlement for paying party functionaries from European Parliament budgets. Judges will rule in March with a maximum sanction of three years and disqualification from public office.\n\nIf she escapes prison, the startling scenario is that the Revolutionary will face the Cat Lady – a contest Le Pen would win.\n\nThe French may be romantics but they are fundamentally bourgeois – and they won’t buy what Mélenchon is selling. Yet is France ready for Madame la Presidente?\n\nThis week has been a disaster for Barnier and Macron’s attempt to save France from its self-destructive spending spree, another reminder of the colossal systemic crisis caused by the president, and a giant leap into the unknown for the Republic.\n\nNow what? No government. No budget. And nobody in charge. Stay tuned.","summary":"Five years after the fire that gutted the great religious symbol of France, its lame-duck president is planning a global media spectacular.

here’s why unstable Bitcoin is not worth your investment","text":"THE price of Bitcoin has smashed through $100,000 for the first time — fuelled by the return of Donald Trump.\n\nThe world’s first, largest and most valuable cryptocurrency has now more than doubled in value since the start of the year.\n\nAnd it has been most dramatic since November, surging by more than 50 per cent since Trump’s election win.\n\nDuring the election campaign, the Republican pledged to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and build a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, while also setting up his own crypto- currency venture.\n\nHe has appointed Elon Musk as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in an explicit nod to the tech boss’s favoured crypto, Dogecoin.\n\nThe frenzy around digital currency has been given an even bigger boost after Trump nominated Paul Atkins, a big crypto advocate, to run the main US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.The appointment will mark a dramatic shift from outgoing SEC boss Gary Gensler, who led a crypto crackdown.\n\nIn the US, exchange-traded funds investing in crypto- currency are now backed by the biggest investment managers, such as Blackrock, which has £35billion put into Bitcoin.\n\nIn the UK, there are no regulatory safeguards for crypto investors, with the financial watchdog telling Brits last week they had to be prepared “to lose all their money”.\n\nAround 7million adults in the UK already hold some form of digital currency.\n\nCarol Alexander, finance professor at Sussex University, accurately predicted the $100,000 record last month.\n\nShe told The Sun yesterday: “I think in the next year it will hit $200,000. \n\n\"It will remain volatile, but Trump is a hugely bullish factor in Bitcoin.”\n\nProf Alexander also notes crypto’s downsides, and successfully predicted a previous crash due to a fraud scandal.\n\nBy Eswar Prasad, Professor at Cornell University\n\nBITCOIN’S surge to $100,000 is a staggering price for a virtual object that is nothing more than computer code.\n\nCrypto currencies have been on a wild ride, surging and tumbling sharply based on little more than a post by Elon Musk.\n\nThere have been massive swings in their value in recent years. \n\nWhile the total value of the crypto- currency market is now over $3trillion, it is worth remembering that nearly $1trillion was wiped off its valuation three years ago.\n\nAs an asset class it is unstable — it is as though a £10 note could buy you a beer on one day and a bottle of fine wine on another.\n\nIt has no intrinsic value and is not backed by anything.\n\nBitcoin devotees will tell you that, like gold, its value comes from its scarcity. \n\nBut scarcity by itself can hardly be a source of value. \n\nBitcoin investors seem to be relying on the “greater fool” theory — all you need to profit from an investment is to find someone willing to buy the asset at an even higher price.\n\nAs with any speculative bubble, naive investors who come to the party late are at greatest risk of losses.\n\nThe Government should certainly caution retail investors that they act at their own peril.\n\nSophisticated investors may tap into the benefits but the danger is the less well-off, dazzled by new technologies, will take on risks they do not fully comprehend.\n\nM&S REBUILD OK\n\nMARKS & SPENCER will be allowed to demolish and rebuild its Marble Arch store after a battle that has become a litmus test for the new Government’s planning reforms.\n\nDeputy PM Angela Rayner yesterday granted permission after ex-Housing Secretary Michael Gove blocked plans on environmental grounds.\n\nM&S argued the store is “impossible to modernise” and threatened to quit the site on London’s fading Oxford Street.\n\nCEO Stuart Machin said the “flagship M&S store will support 2,000 jobs”.\n\nVODA 3 ’N’ EASY\n\nVODAFONE and THREE will create the UK’s biggest mobile operator after a £16.5billion merger got the green light.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority approved it on the condition the combined firm invests £11billion in the UK’s 5G network and caps certain mobile tariffs for three years. \n\nRival BT raised competition fears but Vodafone’s CEO, Margherita Della Valle, insisted it would “unlock investment”.\n\nAnalyst Kester Mann, of CCS Insight, called it “one of the most significant moments in the history of UK mobile”.\n\nSALES OF E-CARS UP TO 1 IN 4\n\nELECTRIC cars accounted for one-in-four vehicles sold last month, with petrol versions plunging to an all-time low, according to industry figures.\n\nBattery-powered vehicle sales were 58.4 per cent higher than last year, with 38,581 sold in November, equivalent to 25.1 per cent of the market.\n\nBut the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the number of petrol vehicles given to dealerships was rationed — and an “unsustainable” £4billion in discounts had been given on e-vehicles so far this year.\n\nManufacturers have been racing to comply with a 22 per cent Government mandate on annual sales of electric cars to avoid hefty penalties. \n\nThe SMMT says even with a strong November and December, sales will still be short.\n\nFord UK boss Lisa Brankin this week called for more Government incentives as it launched an electric version of its best-seller Puma car.\n\nSHELL IN MERGER\n\nSHELL and Equinor say they will combine their offshore oil and gas assets in the North Sea, forming a new company with 1,300 employees.\n\nBased in Aberdeen, it will become the North Sea’s biggest oil and gas producer — expected to produce more than 140,000 barrels of oil per day.\n\nShell said there will be no job losses as a result of the deal and that it could “enhance” the longevity of its 1,000 UK jobs in oil and gas.\n\nFASHION ‘ESPIONAGE’ BOOHOODUNNIT\n\nPOLICE have launched a probe into claims of stalking and “corporate espionage” of several Boohoo executives.\n\nThe online fashion retailer has -complained that co-founder Mahmud Kamani, former boss John Lyttle and new chief executive Dan Finley have all been targeted.\n\nThey claim the trio have been followed near their homes and offices in London, Manchester and Sevenoaks, Kent. \n\nA complaint about surveillance equipment outside offices has also been made. \n\nThe perpetrators’ identity is unconfirmed.\n\nThe astonishing claims, which have caused “serious alarm and distress”, were first reported by The Times.\n\nIt comes amid a bitter boardroom battle between Boohoo and Mike Ashley’s Fraser Group — and an investor showdown later this month.\n\nFrasers’ chief executive, Michael Murray, yesterday told The Sun that he “wouldn’t comment on media speculation” about corporate espionage.\n\nBut when asked about the attempted Boohoo boardroom coup, he said: “When firms destroy shareholder value, we will not sit

Gaetz ethics report","text":"Washington — The House shut down Democrats’ efforts Thursday to release the long-awaited ethics report into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, pushing the fate of any resolution to the yearslong investigation of sexual misconduct allegations into further uncertainty.\n\nThe nearly party-line votes came after Democrats had been pressing for the findings to be published even though the Florida Republican left Congress and withdrew as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., was the sole Republican to support the effort.\n\nMost Republicans have argued that any congressional probe into Gaetz ended when he resigned from the House. Speaker Mike Johnson also requested that the committee not publish its report, saying it would be a terrible precedent to set.\n\nWhile ethics reports have previously been released after a member’s resignation, it is extremely rare.\n\nShortly before the votes took place, Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., who introduced one of the bills to force the release, said that if Republicans reject the release, they will have “succeeded in sweeping credible allegations of sexual misconduct under the rug.” Gaetz has repeatedly denied the claims.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Ethics panel met to discuss the Gaetz report but made no decision, saying in a short statement that the matter is still being discussed. It’s unclear now whether the document will ever see the light of day as lawmakers only have a few weeks left before a new session of Congress begins.\n\nIt’s the culmination of weeks of pressure on the Ethics committee’s five Republicans and five Democrats who mostly work in secret as they investigate allegations of misconduct against lawmakers.\n\nThe status of the Gaetz investigation became an open question last month when he abruptly resigned from Congress after Trump’s announcement that he wanted his ally in the Cabinet. It is standard practice for the committee to end investigations when members of Congress depart, but the circumstances surrounding Gaetz were unusual, given his potential role in the new administration.\n\nRep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., the committee chairman, said Wednesday that there is no longer the same urgency to release the report given that Gaetz has left Congress and stepped aside as Trump’s choice to head the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve been steadfast about that. He’s no longer a member. He is no longer going to be confirmed by the Senate because he withdrew his nomination to be the attorney general,” Guest said.\n\nThe Gaetz report has also caused tensions between lawmakers on the bipartisan committee. Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the panel, publicly admonished Guest last month for mischaracterizing a previous meeting to the press.\n\nGaetz has denied any wrongdoing and said last year that the Justice Department’s separate investigation against him into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls ended without federal charges.\n\nHis onetime political ally Joel Greenberg, a fellow Republican who served as the tax collector in Florida’s Seminole County, admitted as part of a plea deal with prosecutors in 2021 that he paid women and an underage girl to have sex with him and other men. The men were not identified in court documents when he pleaded guilty. Greenberg was sentenced in late 2022 to 11 years in prison.","summary":"Democrats had been pressing for the findings to be published.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2024/12/house-gop-blocks-democrat-effort-to-release-matt-gaetz-ethics-report.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/XYTKUBL57VH5PAFQTX6VZPFZBQ.jpg?auth=1ac4e1c2d1e0e7cbafcd25f93a677481aa98ccb2590c25e3a5dff786e17baf11&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:23:15","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.623},{"id":270811736,"title":"MSNBC's Joy Reid Compares Opposition to 'Gender-Affirming Care' for 'Trans' Kids to Nazism","text":"In the aftermath of President-elect Donald Trump's decisive win over Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election, MSNBC's ratings -- already in the toilet before the election -- have continued to fall faster than Michael Moore downing a sack of McDonald's Quarter Pounders with Cheese.\n\nThen things got worse for the hopelessly biased, TDS-riddled outlet, after parent Comcast announced it would spin off MSNBC into a separate entity, along with other Comcast-owned outlets CNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel. MSNBC's on-air hosts were visibly shaken, with top \"talent\" Rachel Maddow reportedly taking an annual, $5 million pay cut.\n\nREAD: MSNBC in Panic, Now Rachel Maddow Takes a Big Hit With Comcast Changes\n\nMSNBC has only itself to blame for its uncertain future, and at the top of the list of its predicament, in my not-so-humble opinion, sits Trump-loathing, racist extraordinaire, Joy Reid, host of \"The ReidOut.\"\n\nMy headline tells the story. Make that one on a long list of stories about Reid's bitter, delusional show. \n\nLook, when you compare opposition to so-called \"gender-affirming care\" -- which includes hormone shots, irreversible mutilation of minors' bodies, including double mastectomies, and castrations -- to... wait for it... Nazism in 1930s Germany, you're more than a bit off your Trump-hating rocker. Here's Reid:\n\nTargeting trans people isn't new. It is an age-old tradition which Nazi Germany did with brutally violent ends in the 1930s. While the Supreme Court refuses to do anything about weapons of war in schools, today they seemed inclined to uphold Tennessee's ban on gender affirming care for minors.\n\nYeah, I got nothin'.\n\nReid kicked off the ridiculous segment by spewing a list of radical-leftist grievances against Trump and the Republican Party:\n\nAmerica's dealing with many issues, from grocery prices to gun violence, which is the number one cause of death for kids and teens, but the one issue that Republicans successfully exploited in this year's elections was their fear of the transgender community. Republicans spent at least, get this, $215 million on anti-trans TV ads with the most prominent coming from the Trump campaign itself.\n\nUh-huh. And Kamala Harris blew through more than a billion dollars comparing Trump to Hitler and his followers to Nazis. How'd that all turn out, Ms. Reid? She then attempted an analogy that was far from analogous: \n\nFor context, in the 50 states, transgender adult Americans make up .5, not 5, .5 percent of the population, or 1.3 million Americans out of, like, 320 million. There are a little over 300,000 transgender youths in America. That's 1.4 percent of all young people between ages 13 and 17. That would be the numerical equivalent of the Republican Party targeting the entire city of Phoenix, Arizona, population 1.65 million, because they don't like the desert landscape.\n\nThe point? \n\nIt would take just one so-called \"transgender\" athlete (a biological male)- to seriously hurt, or God forbid kill, a female athlete in a women's sporting event, and I'm talking about accidentally doing so. Sorry, Ms. Reid, we're still unconvinced.\n\nFinally, Reid showed two headlines without commenting on their context. Then again, comparing not giving hormones to 10-year-olds to Nazi concentration camps is beyond absurd.\n\nThen again, we've known that Joy Reid is beyond absurd for years.","url":"https://redstate.com/mike_miller/2024/12/05/msnbcs-delusional-joy-reid-compares-opposition-to-so-called-gender-affirming-care-to-nazism-n2182857","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/188/02c99621-f373-4fc7-a7bb-83092c32fef2.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-06 00:21:48","author":"Mike Miller","authors":["Mike Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152}]}
