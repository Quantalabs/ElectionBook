Online people were calling Daniel “massive”, “gigantic”, and even “ginormous”. \n\n“Gary Barlow’s trending because of his very tall son! I love it here,” one fan praised. \n\nThe memes started when someone posted a photo of Gary in a spa and went viral because they captioned the photo, “Gary fell into his son’s coffee mug”. \n\nAnother meme that gained huge traction online was Gary standing in front of a checkered wall with the caption, “Gary standing in front of his son’s new cardigan”. \n\nThere was even a photo of Gary standing with gold confetti falling from the sky and someone captioned it. \n\n“Gary standing next to his son eating a croissant!” \n\nIf there’s one thing the internet loves, it is a famous man with a son that towers over him. \n\nWe’ve seen it before with survivalist Bear Grylls’ 18-year-old son Marmaduke, who went viral for towering over his dad.\n\nThe internet went nuts at the sight of the survivalist being dwarfed by his kid. \n\n“What have you been feeding him? 18 and already looks incredibly strong,” one commented.\n\n“Bear Junior is turning out to be a Grizzly,” one quipped.\n\n“You must look up to him a lot,” another joked.\n\nAnother tall son who often goes viral for his staggering height is Donald Trump’s son Barron. \n\nThe 18-year-old is 206cm, compared to Mr Trump’s 190cm. \n\n“Wow, Barron Trump is so tall,” one person wrote.\n\n“I know Barron Trump is tall but when you see Lara in heels, Trump and Melania in heels. How he just towers over them,” another noted.\n\nMr Trump has also addressed his teen son’s staggering height,\n\n“He’s a little on the tall side. I will tell you, he’s a tall one, but he is a good-looking guy … And he does like politics.

Is It Legal in India, How to Invest?","text":"Surging after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections,\nBitcoin has touched an all-time high of $80,000. With this, the benchmark cryptocurrency has surged 80 per cent this year and 30 per cent since Trump’s victory, surpassing equities and bullion gains. Is it legal in India? Everything you need to know.\nWhy Are Cryptos Rising on Trump’s Win?\nBitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency that skyrocketed in the run-up to US presidential election, rose sharply immediately on election night after it became clear Donald Trump would win and has continued rising in the days since his victory.\nThe crypto industry believes Trump’s victory is a bullish sign for bitcoin and other digital currencies. In August 2024, he said cryptocurrencies could “define the future”. The president-elect also proposed a strategic national bitcoin stockpile, akin to America’s strategic petroleum reserve, directly purchasing and investing in cryptocurrencies as a national security measure.\nElon Musk, one of Trump’s most visible and ardent supporters, is also a crypto bull. Musk’s favourite coin, Dogecoin, surged more than 20 per cent on Sunday and had been soaring all last week.\nHowever, the Biden administration sought to rein in crypto.\nAlthough Trump was once a bitcoin skeptic, he has changed his tone know to support it. In September, Trump and his children started a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial.\n“It’s very young and very growing,” Trump said of the cryptocurrency industry on September 16 while unveiling World Liberty Financial. “I do believe in it.”\nLarge Investors’ Shift to Bitcoin. Will Bitcoin Rise Further?\n“The election of Donald Trump as US President has lifted the regulatory weight from the industry. Since the November 5 election results, Bitcoin has gained over 30%, signalling a fresh wave of confidence among investors. We now have large institutional investors accumulating Bitcoin and offering it as an asset to customers in the form of exchange traded funds (ETFs), a positive regulatory environment and several innovative projects ready for take off. It’s the perfect set up for a bull cycle,” said Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch.\nThe trading volumes in Bitcoin have risen by 350 per cent within a week since the US election results, he said, adding that “current trends suggest that Bitcoin could not only hold its ground above $80,000 but also set the stage for even greater gains soon”.\nAs the market gains momentum, it’s important for investors to stay vigilant and informed about factors that could influence price stability, he added.\nIs Bitcoin Legal in India?\nYes, cryptocurrencies are legal in India in terms of holding and trading. While the Indian government has not banned cryptocurrencies outright, the regulatory framework is still evolving.\nIn the Union Budget 2022, India introduced a 30 per cent tax on income from the transfer of cryptocurrencies and other virtual digital assets (VDAs). Additionally, a 1 per cent TDS is applied on on the sale of crypto assets more than Rs 50,000 (Rs 10,000 in certain cases) within a single financial year.\nIndia has yet to implement a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, although draft bills have been discussed in Parliament in the past.\nInterestingly, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2022 launched a regulated Digital Rupee as a form of digital currency. The Digital Rupee is expected to provide a government-backed alternative to private cryptocurrencies.\nHow Can You Buy Cryptocurrency?\nInvestors can buy cryptocurrencies on popular crypto exchanges in India include WazirX, CoinSwitch Kuber, CoinDCX, and ZebPay. International platforms like Binance and Kraken also allow Indian users to trade, though they may have different onboarding processes.\nAll exchanges require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to comply with regulations.\n(With Inputs from Agencies)","summary":"Bitcoin has surged 80 per cent this year and 30 per cent since Trump's victory, surpassing equities and bullion gains.","url":"https://www.news18.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-crosses-80000-why-are-cryptos-rising-is-it-legal-in-india-how-to-invest-9115754.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/10/untitled-design-2024-10-10t123411.276-2024-10-04aa4a42f64fb667eb099341d37c9537-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 01:05:35","author":"Mohammad Haris,News18","authors":["Mohammad Haris","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.09},{"id":263968128,"title":"Trump says new Senate Republican leader must change appointment rules","text":"Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.\n\nRepublican Senators John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election on Wednesday to lead the conference and replace longtime leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades.\n\nAll three have courted Mr Trump’s support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.\n\nMr Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly.\n\nIn a statement on X and Truth Social, Mr Trump said that the next leader “must agree” to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.\n\nHe said: “Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,” Mr Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled “IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nThe Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president’s power to do so.\n\nSince then, the Senate has held brief “pro forma” sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.\n\nBut with Mr Trump’s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice.

The viewers aren’t dumb - they can sniff out manufactured drama. \n\nFROM: Dumfries\nOCCUPATION: Pork Salesman and King Charles' former butler\nWHAT ARE YOU MOST LIKELY TO GET NOMINATED FOR? Accidentally offending someone – someone taking something I’ve said the wrong way. Not a terrible offence, but if someone takes something I said the wrong way.\n\nFROM: Watford\nOCCUPATION: Charity Videographer\nWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BRING TO THE HOUSE? I think I’ll bring energy, comedic energy, vitality and a lot of entertainment and being uplifting.\n\nFROM: London\nOCCUPATION: Climate Activist\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE MONEY IF YOU WON? It’s been a difficult financial period for me – climate activism is quite often something you do in debt. It would be nice to have money to do the work \n\nFROM: Manchester\nOCCUPATION: Sales Manager\nWHY DID YOU APPLY TO BE ON THIS NEW SERIES OF BIG BROTHER? I didn’t actually know what Big Brother was. I thought it’s a new opportunity in life. I have no interest in being famous.\n\nFROM: Scarborough, originally from Margate\nOCCUPATION: NHS Administrator\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST ABOUT BEING A HOUSEMATE? Definitely sitting on the Diary Room chair. That is a bucket list ticked off. Also just experiencing that isolation. I’m going to really enjoy not having my phone. I just love not having that responsibility. \n\nFROM: Warrington\nOCCUPATION: Chinese Takeaway Server\n WHAT ARE YOU MOST LIKELY TO GET NOMINATED FOR? Probably that I’m annoying but I don’t care. \n\nFROM: London\nOCCUPATION: Forensic Psychologist\nWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST ABOUT BEING A HOUSEMATE? Just being away and thrown into a totally new environment, completely different to anything I’ve done before, completely different to anything I’ll ever do in the future. \n\nFROM: Carlisle\nOCCUPATION: Amputee Footballer\nWHAT ARE YOU MOST LIKELY TO GET NOMINATED FOR? One of my bad traits is that I speak a lot. I do a lot of talking without thinking. In myself I never get offended, you can say anything about me - I’ve already heard it before. \n\nFROM: Stockport \nOCCUPATION: Marketing and Events\nWHY DID YOU APPLY TO BE ON THIS NEW SERIES OF BIG BROTHER? I’ve always been a fan of the show - it’s been a bit of a childhood dream to go on it. \n\nFROM: West London\nOCCUPATION: HR Consultant\nWHAT ARE YOU MOST LIKELY TO GET NOMINATED FOR? I feel like whoever nominates is just a hater, babes! I think it might be my opinions that people nominate me for. \n\nFROM: London, originally Swansea\nOCCUPATION: Sales Consultant\nWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BRING TO THE HOUSE? I’ll bring a lot of happiness and kindness. I reckon I’ll be there for a lot of people. I’m not the type of person to fall out with anyone and if I did, I’d make up for it. \n\nFROM: Shrewsbury\nOCCUPATION: Spa Account Manager\nWHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH THE MONEY IF YOU WON? A few different things. One, I’d have my dream wedding. Two, go on a nice holiday. And three, maybe start my own business. \n\nFROM: East London\nOCCUPATION: Youth Mentor\nDO YOU HAVE A STRATEGY FOR MAKING IT TO THE FINAL? Not at all. I’m going to show love, I’m going to be myself and that’s all I can do. \n\nFROM: East London\nOCCUPATION: Barber\nWHY DID YOU APPLY TO BE ON THIS NEW SERIES OF BIG BROTHER? I’ve been a fan for the longest time. I’ve wanted to do it from the age of 11 and never had the confidence to do it. As I got older, I was still obsessed with the show and as soon as it came back it was ‘this is my time to apply’. \n\nPalestineBig Brother Topic\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBig Brother viewers SLAM show's 'totally unfair' final twist just days ahead of grand finale: 'Sack whoever came up with this idea!'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nRita Ora breaks down in tears as she pays moving tribute to close friend Liam Payne at the MTV EMAs\n\nEmotional moment \n\nRita Ora leads the red carpet glamour in a pink feathered gown as she joins glamorous Maya Jama, Vick Hope and Raye at the MTV EMAs\n\nJoker 2 star says it is the 'worst film ever made' and that he and his co-stars knew it was 'going to bomb' while filming\n\nAs Philip Schofield lays his 'extraordinary loyal' mother Pat to rest, friends tell how she became his rock after his TV downfall, reveals KATIE HIND\n\nMichelle Keegan and Mark Wright show off VERY lavish Christmas lights and decorations at £3.5m Essex mansion\n\nLaundry legend or sock-shrinking disaster?

Donald Trump won a majority of white women and remarkable numbers of black and Latino voters and young men.\n\nDemocratic insiders thought people would vote for Kamala Harris, even if they didn’t like her, to get rid of Trump. But more people ended up voting for Trump, even though many didn’t like him, because they liked the Democratic Party less.\n\nI have often talked about how my dad stayed up all night on the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. And my brother stayed up all night the first time Trump was elected because he was so excited. And I felt that Democrats would never recover that kind of excitement until they could figure out why they had turned off so many working-class voters over the decades, and why they had developed such disdain toward their once loyal base.\n\nDemocratic candidates have often been avatars of elitism – Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and second-term Barack Obama. The party embraced a world view of hyper-political correctness, condescension and cancellation, and it supported diversity statements for job applicants and faculty lounge terminology like “Latinx,” and “BIPOC” (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour).

a request Ukraine has made for months.\n\nIt comes after the US president prevented Ukraine from using the British Storm Shadows at targets inside Russia over fears of retaliatory attacks on Western military bases.\n\nUS intelligence long believed that Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to such attacks by ordering counter-assaults on US and European military bases, while also stepping up sabotage efforts on Western soil.\n\nIn September, Starmer vowed he would press Biden to grant Ukraine permission to use the missiles when the pair met at the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister said he firmly believed the US and UK should move as a coalition on the issue.\n\nAt the upcoming talks in Paris between Starmer and Macron, the impact of the incoming Trump presidency on the conflict in the Middle East and the potential of a trade war with Europe are also expected to be discussed.\n\nWorld leaders around the globe are anticipating how drastically Trump intends to change US policy on Ukraine following his presidential victory last week.\n\nTrump issued a stern warning to Putin on Thursday in their first phone call since the Republican won the presidency.\n\nTrump advised Putin not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of 'Washington's sizeable military presence in Europe', according to the Washington Post.\n\nSources also told the newspaper that Trump expressed an interest in follow-up conversations to discuss 'the resolution of Ukraine's war soon'.\n\nStarmer has pledged to work closely with Trump, despite cabinet ministers including David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, and Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, criticising the president-elect in the past.\n\nBut since Trump's victory, Biden has still attempted to secure US support for Ukraine. \n\nOn Thursday, the White House said the president will continue 'surging' humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine using funds already authorised by Congress. \n\nHowever, a recent report claimed Trump's transition office is considering a proposal that would seek to freeze the conflict in Ukraine with an '800-mile demilitarised zone'. \n\nThat is unlikely to be welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his European partners who are adamant that Kyiv should not surrender territory to the Kremlin, and remains unsubstantiated by US officials.\n\nTrump has famously said that the Russia-Ukraine war would never have started had he been president and claimed he could bring the conflict to an abrupt halt - without ever revealing his plans for doing so.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal report citing three sources 'close to the president-elect' claimed that Trump's transition office is considering one proposal that would prevent Kyiv from joining NATO for at least 20 years in exchange for lucrative arms deals.\n\nIn the meantime, the conflict would be halted by the implementation of a large demilitarised zone (DMZ) that would effectively freeze the fighting in place and force Kyiv to relinquish up to 20 per cent of its territory as part of an '800-mile DMZ'.\n\nBut the sources offered no insight into how such a buffer zone between Russia's border and unoccupied Ukraine would be monitored or managed, other than to say it would not be staffed by American peacekeepers.\n\n'We can do training and other support but the barrel of the gun is going to be European... and we are not paying for it,' one source is quoted as saying.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have already vowed to support Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' and Zelensky is adamantly against relinquishing territory to Vladimir Putin.\n\nHowever, many analysts have warned that Trump is indeed likely to reduce US' military aid to Ukraine and force Kyiv's European partners to shoulder a huge burden to maintain an adequate supply of arms.\n\nOn Monday, Starmer will also meet with Michel Barnier, the new French prime minister, who was the European Union’s Brexit negotiator.\n\nThe UK PM hopes to negotiate a defence and security pact with the EU in the new year, another topic that is expected to be discussed with Macron.","summary":"The leaders will speak on Monday in Paris to discuss whether US President Joe Biden can be convinced to give the war-torn country permission to use Storm Shadow missiles.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14066653/Starmer-travels-France-Armistice-Day-ahead-talks-support-Ukraine-against-Russia-following-Donald-Trumps-election-win.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/11/00/91918645-0-image-a-14_1731286064395.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:48:20","author":"Editor,Taryn Pedler","authors":["Editor","Taryn Pedler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.203},{"id":263967566,"title":"Democrats’ political lies are now literally breeding mental illness","text":"Most Democrats seem to be getting over last week’s thumping well enough, but a horrific fraction seem to have bought into their leaders’ irresponsible, apocalyptic rhetoric — and so are damaging themselves, their families and even their children.\n\nThe most obvious case is Anthony Nephew, the Minnesota man who apparently killed his wife, ex-partner and his two sons before taking his own life in reaction to Donald Trump’s victory.\n\nYes, he evidently had longstanding mental-health issues; we’ll never know how much of his final crisis came from marinating for years in the extremist, hateful rhetoric now common on the left.\n\nBut there’s some connection: Why else did Democrats from President Biden on down call for a lowering of the temperature after the first attempt to assassinate Donald Trump?\n\nToo bad the whole party quickly turned back to “fascist” and “end of democracy,” not to mention “Nazi” and “garbage.”\n\nAnd pushing outright lies about abortion, their other main issue this year.\n\nFor the record, no state bans aborting an ectopic pregnancy. None of them criminalizes having a miscarriage, nor surgery to save the mother’s life. Every hospital in America is legally obliged to treat a woman suffering complications after taking abortion pills.\n\nAll the folks spreading misinformation to the contrary (including, obscenely, health professionals and so-called journalists) are, sickly, endangering the lives of vulnerable women. \n\nYet rank, hateful distortion is now routine for Democrats: Back in 2021, recall, Biden was raging about “Jim Crow 2.0,” the Georgia voting law that . . . has now seen two straight elections (2022 and 2024) with record turnout. (Major League Baseball still owes Atlanta an apology for pulling the All-Star Game over that.)\n\nAnd the mainstream media’s loss of basic fact-checking standards puts fuel on the fire: Remember, CBS Evening News led a nightly newscast the other week with the outright lie that Trump had threatened Liz Cheney’s life.\n\nPanel after panel on CNN (not MSNBC) features contributors foaming at the mouth at how people voted for a “convicted felon” who “says he’ll be a dictator and use the armed forces against his domestic opponents” — all bogus talking points about Trump.\n\nThe general public tunes it all out — that’s why Trump still won the national popular vote.\n\nBut some still believe it, and now are emoting on social media about how they’ve now cut off all ties with their “MAGA” parents, children or whatever.\n\nYou’re family, and you can’t find something agreeable to talk about?\n\nAdd in, too, the liberal moms that Bethany Mandel rightly scourged in Saturday’s Post: “real people, and unfortunately, real parents, who have decided to inflict severe emotional distress upon their children as some kind of political virtual signal” by needlessly inflicting Trump-is-Hitler propaganda on their kids. \n\nThe unhinged hate takes all manner of forms: On “The View” last week, Whoopi Goldberg seriously announced, “Your grocery bills are what they are because the folks that own the groceries are pigs.”\n\nKamala Harris and Joe Biden know better: That’s why they’re moving on as leaders do after any lost election — Biden, even with a big smile.\n\nAnd all the Democratic operatives who went along with the campaign of hate, fear and lies know it too: They made their bucks doing their best to try to win despite having no real issues, using tactics that have become routine for their party — and confident that most of the press would play along. \n\nIndeed, most Democrats still believe that Trump colluded with Russia to win in 2016 — even though the entire Russiagate fable in the end rested entirely on stories made up under an “opposition research” contract from the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post split a Pulitzer Prize for amplifying that disinformation.\n\nUnlike the so-called “disinformation experts” who demand a vast censorship apparatus to supposedly purify our “information spaces,” we believe in free speech, including the freedom to tell outright lies (subject, of course, to libel laws and related penalties).\n\nThe best answer, the only practical answer, to untrue speech is true speech.\n\nBut that true speech can and must include calling “Shame.”\n\nSo shame on Biden, Harris, the Obamas, CBS, the Times and all the rest: For nothing but short-term partisan ends, you’ve been sickening the minds of good people whose only mistake is to trust you.\n\nIt’s a sad thing indeed that so many of our leaders think nothing of poisoning the American mind.","summary":"Most Democrats seem to be getting over last week’s thumping well enough, but a horrific fraction seem to have bought into their leaders’ irresponsible, apocalyptic rhetoric — and so are damaging themselves.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/10/opinion/democrats-political-lies-are-now-literally-breeding-mental-illness/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/pro-choice-demonstrators-protest-outside-93344127-e1731285541987.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:44:26","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":263966738,"title":"Cop29: Key questions about the UN climate conference","text":"As Cop29 gets under way in Azerbaijan, here are answers to some of the key questions about the climate conference.\n\n– What is Cop29?\n\nCop29 is the 29th “Conference of Parties”. It is the latest set of UN climate negotiations, which take place every year.\n\nGovernments, business leaders, scientists and campaigners will gather this year in Baku, Azerbaijan, for two weeks of talks from November 11-22.\n\nThe meeting kicks off against a backdrop of deadly weather events, extreme conditions and record temperatures in recent months.\n\nThese include the floods in Valencia and Hurricane Helene that hit parts of the US in October – both of which scientific analysis showed were made more frequent and more intense by rising temperatures.\n\nAnd this year is on course to break temperature records once again.\n\n– What will be discussed?\n\nDubbed the “finance Cop”, one of the central issues at the conference will be agreeing new commitments on finance for poor countries to cope with climate change impacts and green their economies.\n\nWealthier countries have previously pledged 100 billion US dollars a year in private and public finance to help poorer nations, but experts have warned that figure needs to rise to one trillion dollars a year by 2030.\n\nReaching a consensus on money will be difficult, with nations so far disagreeing on almost all elements of the goal, like the amount of money needed, which countries should contribute, the types of finance and what it should fund.\n\nBut without a successful agreement on funding, the world will not be able to meet the scale of the challenge posed by climate change.\n\nThe talks will also focus again on boosting efforts to cut emissions amid increasingly dire warnings over the planet’s future.\n\nDuring the summit, many countries are expected to publish their new national action plans to cut emissions – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – including the UK.\n\nThese outline how each nation plans to help meet the goals of the 2015 global Paris Agreement, which aims to prevent the worst impacts of warming.\n\nThe latest NDCs, which will cover 2025 to 2035, are due ahead of Cop20 in Brazil next December.\n\nSo the spotlight will be on the level of ambition seen in these NDCs, including how they incorporate last year’s landmark deal to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems – agreed at Cop28 in Dubai.In recent months, some oil rich-nations have sought to pushback and frustrate progress to deliver on this agreement.\n\nSo the world will also be watching how Azerbaijan, as the host country and an oil-rich nation itself, will handle discussions around fossil fuel phaseout discussions.\n\n– How is the world doing on climate action and finance?\n\nSince the Paris Agreement, where countries pledged to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world has seen some landmark agreements, the green transition has truly crossed the starting line and almost 200 countries have put forward plans to cut emissions.\n\nGreenhouse gases continue to rise and reached record levels of concentration in the world’s atmosphere in 2023, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said.\n\nThe UN has warned that existing policies are falling so far short and the world is on track for a “catastrophic” 3.1C of global warming.\n\nIn its annual report on the gap between the emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to 1.5C and what countries are doing and have pledged to do, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said the goal would “soon be dead” without a global mobilisation on a scale and pace never seen before.\n\nUNEP also highlighted an “enormous gap” in financing for adapting to climate change with authors saying adequate financing for prevention is much cheaper than compensating for losses and damage.\n\n– How Donald Trump’s election win could affect global climate action?\n\nWorld leaders will be grappling with the fallout of the US presidential election, which is returning Donald Trump to the White House in what analysts say is a trend of climate scepticism in elections this year.\n\nThe president-elect said he plans to roll back green incentives domestically and take America – the world’s second largest emitter after China – out of the Paris Agreement again.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration will be involved in the talks, Mr Trump’s victory could nonetheless overshadow the negotiations and dampen ambition from other nations.\n\n– What is the UK’s position?\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is heading to the opening summit of Cop29, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will also play a key role for the UK during the talks.\n\nIt comes as Labour seeks to reposition Britain at the centre of global climate and nature diplomacy, marking a contrast from the previous Conservative government, which rowed back on green policies and axed the climate envoy position.\n\nUK officials plan to send a strong message with its plans for climate action as it releases its NDC for 2035 at the summit, coming the hopes of galvanising ambitious commitments from other countries.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has recommended the Government commit to cutting emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels by 2035 in its new NDC. The then-Tory Government followed the CCC’s advice on the target the last time around in 2020.\n\nThe UK is also expected to take a strong position on cementing the Cop28 agreement to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, including being clear on how the world will take forward and track progress on this commitment.\n\nAwareness of the talks remains low among the UK public, according to PA Mediapoint’s opinion tracker, which found that two thirds of Britons are unfamiliar with the Cop29 conference\n\nThe Ipsos survey, conducted exclusively for PA’s non-media wire, questioned 1,088 British adults between September 25-26 on the upcoming conference.\n\nJust 19% of respondents said it was likely that commitments agreed at Cop29 would result in action while more than half lack confidence that commitments agreed at the summit will make a real difference to tackling climate change.","summary":"The meeting kicks off against a backdrop of deadly weather events, extreme conditions and record temperatures in recent months.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/environment/governments-keir-starmer-ed-miliband-azerbaijan-valencia-b1193193.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/11/11/00/f7eadeafbc9db2f02cdb6f8c35175038Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzMxMTYxMDky-2.77956134.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:41:34","author":"Rebecca Speare-Cole","authors":["Rebecca Speare-Cole"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.133},{"id":263966416,"title":"Trump's win puts migrants on edge","text":"Nogales, Mexico — Ivan Castro Santos, his wife and their four children, including 1-year-old triplets, have been living in a crowded room over the past four months, waiting for an opportunity to enter the U.S.The young family traveled from southern Mexico to the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter in the northern Mexican border city of Nogales, joining other migrants from across Latin America. Half of them are children. All of them have one objective: finding work and safety in the U.S.Castro Santos, 22, said he and his wife, Fatima Gonzalez Hernandez, 19, decided to leave Guerrero, Mexico, because of \"the crime and the risk to the children\" there. \"To protect them,\" he added in Spanish, looking at his young children.Tens of thousands of migrants are estimated to be in Mexico, hoping to enter America, including through a program that allows them to use a smartphone app to request a time to be vetted, processed and admitted by American border officials. The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.Castro Santos said he's worried about Trump \"canceling the appointments\" offered by the U.S. government app, known as CBP One. \"We don't want to run that risk of going back and putting them at risk,\" he said, referring to his children. If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.Trump made tackling illegal immigration a central theme of his campaign, running on a platform of mass deportations, harsher asylum rules and a reversal of the Biden administration's border policies, including the app-powered entry system used by migrants in Mexico. His immigration promises appealed to many American voters, polls show, including those living near the southern border.Anna Parada, who was born and raised in Nogales, Arizona, just miles away from the border with Mexico, said the \"main\" reason she voted for Trump was because of his stance on immigration. \"I really saw the Biden administration being a little bit too lax on immigration,\" Parada said. \"And having Trump back in office, I believe it's going to be a difference again.\"On the Mexican side of the border, the reaction to Trump winning was dramatically different.Luz Angela, a migrant from Bolivia, said she felt \"scared\" when she learned American voters had elected Trump.\"I felt scared because he promised in his speeches that they would deport all the migrants,\" Angela said in Spanish. \"And that he would close the CBP One application.\"A doctor by trade, Angela said she and her 9-year-old son, Matias, fled political persecution in Bolivia. She said she was targeted by the government there after complaining about corruption in the hospital where she worked.Angela and her son have been waiting for a CBP One appointment for nearly 7 months since arriving in Nogales, Mexico. During her wait, she has volunteered as a doctor at the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter, treating fellow migrants.\"What we're looking for is for an opportunity to improve our lives but also perhaps improve the health care system over there,\" she said. \"I really like helping people who don't have easy access to healthcare.\"U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.Alba Jaramillo, a Tucson-based immigration attorney, said Trump's win and the potential end to the CBP One system, could prompt more migrants to cross the southern border without authorization, including along dangerous parts of the Arizona desert where some perish trying to make it into the U.S.\"They're desperate,\" said Jaramillo, the co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network, a pro-immigrant organization. \"I mean they have given up everything to come to the north.\"Anjali Patil contributed reporting.","summary":"Trump's promises of mass deportation and tougher border policies appealed to many American voters.

We are ourselves an example of the shift… If you look at our economic weight, you look at our economic ranking, you look at even Indian corporates, their reach, their presence, Indian professionals, which I spoke about. So no question there is a rebalancing,” Jaishankar said in response to a question on the reset in the global power dynamic that was playing out amid the shift in the balance of power from the west to the east.\n\n“And to my mind, it was inevitable,” he said, adding, “because once these countries after the colonial period got their independence, they started making their own policy choices, then they were bound to grow.”\n\n“The part which is not inevitable is that some grew faster, some grew slower, some grew better, and there the quality of governance and the quality of leadership came in. So, there is, in a sense, therefore, the constant and the variable.\n\n“There is a trend towards a more diverse, multipolar world. But there is also, you know, a period when countries really surge ahead. I mean, it’s like what happened in the corporate world as well.”\n\nHe, however, said the industrialised economies in the west cannot be ignored and remain prime investment targets.\n\n“But do remember one thing, the older, the western economies, the older industrialised economies, they have not gone away. They still count, they are still prime investment targets. They are big markets, strong technology centres, hubs for innovation. So let’s recognise the shift, but let’s not get carried away and kind of overstate it and distort our own understanding of the world,” the minister said.\n\nSpeaking on the India-US relationship and Trump’s win, he said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first three calls, I think, that President (elect) Trump took.”\n\nIndia and Prime Minister Modi have built rapport with multiple presidents, he said.\n\n“For him (Modi) there’s something natural in terms of how he forges those relationships. So that’s helped hugely. And I think the changes in India have helped as well,” he said, when asked how he sees the US presidential election outcome impacting India-US ties, especially given Modi’s strong personal rapport with the US President-elect.\n\n“I know today a lot of countries are nervous about the US, let’s be honest about it. We are not one of them,” Jaishankar said.\n\nEarlier, Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said investment in talent is what shapes the future, and emphasised that with the scholarship programme, “we were driven by the ambition to create a cadre of handpicked leaders who would excel in India and also represent our country abroad”.\n\n“The Aditya Birla Scholarship is a tribute to my father’s legacy and an ode to the spirit of ambition and extraordinary determination that defines India. With this scholarship programme, we were driven by the ambition to create a cadre of handpicked leaders who would excel in India and also represent our country abroad,” he said.\n\nTerming the scholarship a microcosm of India’s immense talent — abundant and outstanding — Birla said, “The extraordinary success of the programme, as measured by the achievements of our scholars over the years, only indicates that ultimately investment in talent is what shapes the future.”\n\nEstablished in 1999 in memory of late industrialist Aditya Vikram Birla, the programme has emerged as one of India’s most-coveted merit-based scholarships, according to the group.\n\nThe programme partners with 22 premier institutions, including select IITS, BITS Pilani, leading IIMS, XLRI, and national law schools.\n\nOver its 25-year journey, over 10,000 applications have been evaluated by a team of experts, maintaining a steadfast commitment to excellence and diversity.

Corales' vote boiled down, in part, to the economy. He wasn't alone.\"A lot of the Latinos are working-class people,\" he said. \"They have families. You know, they help their families, even outside the country as well.\"Did Democrats take the Latino vote for granted?Northampton County, where Corales lives and works, went for former President Barack Obama in 2012 and then to Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Biden flipped it back in 2020 and then Trump won it again in 2024. Latinos are the fastest-growing community in the county. Nationwide, Trump's Election Day support jumped 14 points among Latinos. Corales' immigrant father was so thrilled to be in America that he named his son after President Ronald Reagan. Today, Corales said he finds some common ground with Mr. Trump, even on immigration.\"And hopefully President Trump will bring some kind of legalization to those immigrants because there's still a lot of good people out there,\" he said. \"That they're willing to work and continue dreaming with the American dream.\"Second and third-generation Latino families in the working and middle class are very sensitive to inflation, prices and the situation at the border, according to Leslie Sanchez, a Republican political analyst and contributor to CBS News. \"Those two pressures together created a community which wanted change,\" Sanchez said. \"And they fundamentally felt, if you talk to them, that the Democratic Party had left them.\"Fed up with the economy, Americans turn to Trump, giving him election sweep of swing statesThe Democratic party \"absolutely\" took the Latino vote for granted, Sanchez said.\"I would think the party of my parents, the party of my grandparents, just assumed that Latinos, as the community grew, and our population grew, that we would just naturally fall in line with the Democratic Party,\" Sanchez said. \"And in the last 10 years about 10 percent more Hispanic Americans have moved into the middle class, they are much more sensitive to these economic issues. We live on the margins still so small ripples in inflation really have a dramatic impact.\"\"Egg-flation\" helps Trump winDespite a generally healthy economy, many Americans, frustrated with high prices, voted for Mr. Trump in 2024. According to the CBS MoneyWatch price tracker, since 2019, the average price of a dozen eggs has risen 176%, the price of a loaf of bread jumped 52%, and a pound of chicken breast is up 36%. Overall, prices in the U.S. jumped 22% between January 2020 and September of this year.Pennsylvania pollster Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College, said many voters are focused on housing and grocery prices. \"I can't tell you how many times when I talk to people about elections this year, they referenced eggs and the price of eggs,\" he said. At the Nazareth Diner near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the average tab is now $38, up from $24 in 2020. Manager Roz Werkheiser grew up in a Democratic household.\"My mother used to always say, got to vote Democrat. You know, they're for the poor people,'\" she said. Inflation, and interest rates are falling while wages are going up, but Werkheiser said she isn't feeling it. \"Everybody I talk to, nobody's wages went up,\" she said. \"But we had four years of this. I mean, four years. Gas was super high. Yes, it just went down now, but what, the past four, three and a half years, it was up.\"Trump voters trust economic conditions will improve under the president-elect, Anthony Salvanto, CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, said. They use the COVID-19 pandemic as an economic benchmark. \"The party in power is going to get blamed by a certain portion of the electorate for economic conditions that they don't like,\" Salvanto said. \"And sometimes it's just as simple as that.\"Lack of enthusiasm among Democratic voters, focus on the wrong issuesThe count is ongoing, but Vice President Kamala Harris is on pace to be several million votes short of where Mr. Biden was in 2020.\"The Harris campaign lost the turnout game in many respects. We all knew going in that one of the keys here were people who don't always vote, new voters, people who skipped the election in 2020,\" Salvanto said. \"The Trump campaign did a better job than the Harris campaign at turning them out. Those 2020 non-voters broke for Donald Trump.\"Her turnout failed even among women voters who the campaign hoped would turn out because of issues like abortion.\"They thought they would do better with women. They did not,\" Salvanto said. \"They thought that the abortion issue would drive more people to the Harris side. It did not.\"Democrat Susan Wild, Northampton County's representative in Congress, has served since 2018 and, on Tuesday, lost by 1.2% to Republican Ryan Mackenzie, a Trump disciple who questioned the 2020 election. She's been thinking about what's behind Democratic losses.\"If you are struggling to pay your rent or feed your kids, you don't have the privilege of thinking about things like LGBTQ rights. Unless you've got somebody in your own family that's personally affected, you don't have the luxury of thinking about reproductive rights,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, I think our party needs to figure out that not everybody is just thinking about these very important social issues.\"Wild says the party should spend more time in places like Pennsylvania's Northampton County and Lehigh Valley, and speak to people like her constituents. She also acknowledged a lack of enthusiasm for the top of the Democratic ticket. \"That part I think a lot of us didn't gauge,\" she said. \"And just thinking that people were going to turn out to vote against Donald Trump was a miscalculation.\"Looking to the futureWith Arizona called on Saturday night, Mr. Trump swept all seven battleground states. Six of them had voted for Mr. Biden in the 2020 election. So far President-elect Trump has won just over 50 percent of the popular vote and made gains in key demographics, including young voters, Latinos, and women. Republicans took control of the Senate and are on track to win the House. As of now, more than 80% of counties shifted right on Election Day, a move that could be lasting.\"I think it's a shift but it's an important one,\" Salvanto said. \"And not just in the battleground states, but in places like counties in New York, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania.\"Sanchez thinks there's an opportunity for this to be a lasting change beyond this year's election. \"The question becomes, if Trump can really meet those promises, bring inflation down, make things more affordable, and make these families feel more financially secure, he's going to have an ally for probably several election cycles going forward,\" she said.A new economy and new politics are at the forefront of change, Borick, the Pennsylvania pollster, said. \"It was such a Democratic place for such a long time, and that Democratic Party doesn't exist. Those Democratic voters don't exist the way they long did in Northampton County. They have to re-vision what it's going to look like,\" Borick said. \"Does that center on candidates? Does it center on issues? The answer is all of those things.\"Produced by Maria Gavrilovic, Henry Schuster and Nicole Young.

Six of them flipped from Joe Biden's column in 2020. So far, the president-elect has won just over 50% of the popular vote and he made gains in key demographics, including the young, Latinos and women. Republicans took the Senate and are on track to control the House. Tuesday, more than 80% of all the nation's countries moved toward the right. The shift is decisive and leaves Democrats arguing over how they misread the people. To understand what just happened, we went to Pennsylvania, one of the places that made all the difference.Political pilgrims, seeking a vision of the future, travel to Bethlehem.Chris Borick: We're in Bethlehem which is the heart of Northampton County in eastern Pennsylvania, a county along the Delaware River. Midsize, couple hundred thousand people, mix of urban, suburban, rural areas all in a pretty centered location here in eastern Pennsylvania.And pretty perfect for picking presidents. For 25 years, Chris Borick has been conducting one of the leading polls of Pennsylvania voters. He's a professor of political science at Muhlenberg College, next to Northampton County.Chris Borick: It was an Obama county. Then it was a Trump county. And then it was a Biden county, and in 2024 it once again is a Trump county.Scott Pelley: How did Trump win? Chris Borick: It's a great question. You know first of all I think he had the winds on his side here, from talking to voters. They're, they're not in a great mood. They're not in the good place. There's lots of good things happening in Northampton County. The economy's good. But they're feeling things in their lives that really troubled them. Housing prices here. Grocery prices. I can't tell you how many times when I talk to people about elections this year, they referenced eggs and the price of eggs.Egg prices doubled and featured on the menu of discontent. At the Nazareth Diner near Bethlehem, no one sees a sunnyside to inflation, high interest rates and housing prices. The average tab here in 2020 was $24. Now it's 38. And that's the election in an eggshell.Roz Werkheiser: The prices have went up, obviously because the food cost. And for a family of, like, four people, five people, I have them come in and say, \"Oh my God, I spent $100 with the tip for breakfast? That's crazy.\" Which it is.Roz Werkheiser: Yeah, 7:30 we open, 7:30 to 10.Roz Werkheiser was a waitress 25 years ago. Now she runs the place. Roz Werkheiser: My mother used to always say, \"Gotta vote Democrat. You know, they're for the poor people.\"Scott Pelley: You grew up in a Democratic household…Roz Werkheiser: Yes.Scott Pelley: But you just voted for Donald Trump.Roz Werkheiser: Yes.Scott Pelley: Inflation is down by more than half, interest rates are falling, mortgage rates are falling, wages are going up. Are you not feeling that?Roz Werkheiser: I don't feel it. No, I don't feel it. I don't feel it at all. Everybody I talk to, nobody's wages went up. But we had four years of this. I mean, four years. Gas was super high. Yes, it just went down now, but what-- the past four-- three and a half years it was up. Anthony Salvanto: The party in power is going to get blamed by a certain portion of the electorate for economic conditions that they don't like. And sometimes it's just as simple as that.Anthony Salvanto is CBS News executive director of elections and surveys.Scott Pelley: Who were the Trump voters?Anthony Salvanto: People who believed that things would be better them being better financially under Donald Trump in large measure because they recalled a time before the pandemic when they said the economy was good. And that's how they were benchmarking their financial comparison. Number two, don't forget about the MAGA base. There's the Republican base and then there's the MAGA base within the Republican party. These folks have a very personal connection to Donald Trump. Many of them turn out to vote just because he is on the ticket. Trump swept the swing states but, narrowly-- about 1% in Michigan, about 2% in Georgia and Pennsylvania.Scott Pelley: Does this election represent a major realignment of the American electorate? Or is it just an election with its own issues?Anthony Salvanto: I think it's a shift but it's an important one. And not just in the battleground states but in places like counties in New York, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania. And I think it also speaks to the kinds of changes in constituencies that we saw. Democrats didn't do as well, Republicans did better, among young voters, among Latino voters. Leslie Sanchez: The historic support that Donald Trump got from the Latino community has been building over a series of election cycles. Leslie Sanchez is a Republican political analyst and contributor to CBS News. Scott Pelley: What did you see on election night, in terms of Latino support for Republicans all across the country?Leslie Sanchez: You have second and third generation Latino families who are living now in the middle-class, working-class families, very sensitive to inflation and prices and very sensitive in their communities to an open border. Those two pressures together created a community which wanted change. And they fundamentally felt if you talk to them that the Democratic Party had left them.Donald Trump's election day support among Latinos jumped 14 points.Scott Pelley: You voted for whom?Ronald Corales: I voted for Donald Trump.Trump's Pennsylvania win fueled by economic concerns among Latino, working-class votersLatinos are 20% of the U.S. population now and the fastest growing community in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. Ronald Corales opened a barbershop 12 years ago. Then a second, now a third. Some of his 20 employees changed their minds about Republicans for the first time.Scott Pelley: Democrats would've expected to do really well with Latino voters. Ronald Corales: Yes.Scott Pelley: Donald Trump made a lot of inroads --Ronald Corales: Yes.Scott Pelley: -- in this election, and I wonder why you think that is.Ronald Corales: The economy. The economy. I've been talking over the past couple of years to, like, people at one point, they were, like, so against him because of the comments or whatever the media was saying. But-- you know, a lotta-- lot-- a lotta the Latinos are working-class people. They have families. You know, they help their families, even outside the country as well. Corales' late father immigrated from Peru in 1985 and was so thrilled to be in America he named his son for the president. Today, Ronald finds some common ground with Trump, even on immigration. Ronald Corales: We still need immigration, but if we could do it-- the legal way, and hopefully President Trump will bring some kind of legalization to those-- to those immigrants, because there's still a lotta good people out there. That they're willing to work and continue dreaming with the American dream.Leslie Sanchez: Speaking to families that live along the U.S.-Mexico border, this has been a cultural and economic relationship on the frontera, like, right there in the border area for over 100 years. But it no longer is balanced. This flood of migrants coming across, they feel that its lawlessness is putting tremendous pressure on border patrol, first responders, and their families and their municipalities.Scott Pelley: Did Democrats take Latinos for granted?Leslie Sanchez: Absolutely. I would think the party of my parents, the party of my grandparents, just assumed that Latinos, as the community grew, and our population grew that we would just naturally fall in line with the Democratic Party. And in the last 10 years about 10 percent more Hispanic Americans have moved into the middle class, they are much more sensitive to these economic issues. We live on the margins still so small ripples in inflation really have a dramatic impact.Scott Pelley: Do you think this is a lasting change beyond this election?Leslie Sanchez: I would argue absolutely. So, the question becomes, if Trump can really meet those promises, bring inflation down, make things more affordable, and make these families feel more financially secure, he's going to have an ally for probably several election cycles going forward.Scott Pelley: When all the votes are counted, Vice President Harris is going to be several million votes short of where Joe Biden was in 2020. Why?Anthony Salvanto: The Harris campaign lost the turnout game in many respects. We all knew going in that one of the keys here were people who don't always vote, new voters, people who skipped the election in 2020. The Trump campaign did a better job than the Harris campaign at turning them out. Those 2020 non-voters broke for Donald Trump. And Harris' turnout failed even on an issue Democrats were sure would be compelling—one that helped them in the 2022 midterms.Anthony Salvanto: They thought they would do better with women. They did not. They thought that the abortion issue would drive more people to the Harris side. It did not. Another part of Harris' shortfall came after an advertising blitz targeting her support for transgender rights. Republicans spent $143 million on the transgender campaign to cast Democrats as out of touch. Susan Wild: The party as a whole spends too much time in places like Washington, and New York, and Chicago and doesn't really spend time listening to people like my constituents.Democrat Susan Wild is Northampton County's representative in Congress— and she's thinking about the Democratic losses.Susan Wild: If you are struggling to pay your rent or feed your kids-- you don't have the privilege of thinking about things like LGBTQ rights. Unless you've got somebody in your own family that's personally affected, you don't have the luxury of thinking about reproductive rights. Unfortunately, I think our party needs to figure out that not everybody is just thinking about these very important social issues.Wild has served since 2018 and Tuesday, she ran for a fourth term against Republican Ryan Mackenzie. She lost by 1.2% to a Trump disciple who had insisted that the 2020 election was stolen.Scott Pelley: We have a picture of you from 2021, lying in the floor of the House Chamber as Donald Trump supporters were trying to smash their way in. And I'm curious, did you imagine in this election that January 6th or Trump's felony convictions would have been disqualifying in the minds of most voters?Susan Wild: Did I think it would change some people's minds? Yes. And I think it did. But I didn't think that was going to be the pivotal thing that would cost him this election.Scott Pelley: Why not?Susan Wild: Back in 2021, I would've said, \"There's no way he could ever run for president again.\" But over the last three years, I kind of assessed that it just wasn't going to be a disqualifier.Scott Pelley: Why would Democrats not turn out in the numbers they had before?Susan Wild: I do think that there was a lack of enthusiasm about the top of the ticket. That part I think a lot of us didn't gauge. And just thinking that people were gonna turn out to vote against Donald Trump was a miscalculation.Many Trump supporters told us they cringe at the things he says and the things he's done but the economy, to them, is more urgent. And there's something more-- a connection—an emotion really—they find hard to put into words. Scott Pelley: Did you feel like he was someone you knew?Roz Werkheiser: Yes. Scott Pelley: Did you feel that he knew you?Roz Werkheiser: I feel he knows the American people and the working class, yes.The working class of the 20th century built Bethlehem into the second largest steel maker in the world. But today, the old mills are silent. Pennsylvania pollster Chris Borick told us a new economy and new politics are on the forefront of change. Chris Borick: It was such a Democratic place for such a long time, and that Democratic Party doesn't exist. Those Democratic voters don't exist the way they long did in Northampton County. They have to re-vision what it's going to look like. Does that center on candidates? Does it center on issues?

In an interview that ignited immediate controversy, Eric questioned why Crooks’ body was cremated so quickly. He said, \"I'm going to get hit for saying this, but this guy got cremated faster than most household pets that pass away. Why haven't they figured out who this guy was? Why haven't they gotten into his phones?\" His pointed remark reflects his ongoing skepticism about the FBI’s investigation into the failed assassination attempt, expressing concerns that critical details about Crooks’ identity and background remain under wraps.\n\nAs per Latin Times, the speed at which Crooks’ remains were handled has fueled speculation among Trump supporters, including Eric, who finds the FBI’s actions puzzling. Eric’s comments reflect the deeper mistrust the Trump family harbors toward federal agencies, which they believe have not done enough to uncover the true motives and potential connections behind the attack. He emphasized, \"This isn't just something that the American people want to know…They tried to kill the commander-in-chief. Had they been successful in doing that… America would have looked like a Third World country. And they can't figure out, the greatest law enforcement agencies in the world, can't figure out who this guy was?\"\n\nEric’s concerns also extend beyond the shooting itself. He has suggested that the incident may be tied to larger, more shadowy forces, possibly including foreign entities or the ‘Deep State.’ While he is quick to dismiss conspiracy theories, he remarked, “I hate to say that because I'm as far away from a conspiracy theorist as humanly possible. But they've done everything they can to try to take my father out over the last 10 years.” Amid these intense concerns, Eric has also offered a glimpse into his father’s priorities should he win a second term. \n\nSpeaking with Daily Mail, Eric outlined a vision for a Trump presidency exclaiming, \"He would want nothing to do with prosecuting Hunter Biden or Hillary Clinton, he doesn't give a damn… He wants a safe, prosperous world and a fruitful society. He wants to get back to a country that is actually functional that wins on everything we do...\" Eric’s vision for a second Trump term is one of national renewal, where the country’s leaders focus on a pragmatic solution rather than jumping into petty battles.\n\nWhile Eric stated that his father would not seek retribution against his past adversaries, he made it clear that Trump would be eager to pursue the truth behind the assassination attempts against him. Eric said, “I said, my biggest fear is that they try and inflict bodily harm, and I got a little bit of criticism when I said that… every other way that you could try and destroy somebody - their friends, their family, everything that they had ever built, their reputation, I'd seen every lie and I'd seen so much of this come from our own government.”","summary":"Eric said, &#34;They tried to kill the commander-in-chief... the greatest law enforcement agencies in the world, can&#39;t figure out who this guy was?&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/eric-trump-asks-why-trump-shooter-thomas-crooks-was-cremated-faster-than-most-household-pets","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/723698/uploads/7ecef8f0-9dcb-11ef-b247-fbac923c6cd3_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":263965784,"title":"Jim Jordan denies Trump will carry out threats to go after his political rivals","text":"House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan tamped down on worries that Donald Trump would weaponize the federal government against his political enemies on Sunday, even as Trump himself has publicly promised to do so.\n\nJordan was on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday and was presented a list of Democrats whom Trump has said he would press the Justice Department to prosecute at various points during his campaign. Notably, the president has never had the power to launch such politically-motivated criminal investigations or unwarranted prosecutions of their enemies.\n\nSince leaving office in 2021 on the back of a failed attempt to change the election results, Trump has made repeated threats to use the Justice Department to prosecute Joe Biden and his son Hunter for various nefarious activities and influence-trading which Republicans have long alleged (without evidence) that the incumbent president’s family partook in.\n\nBut the Ohio congressman brushed away concerns, stating that Trump “didn’t do that in his first term” and pointed out that despite pledging of his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, to “lock her up”, did not actually direct the DoJ to do so at any point in his first presidency. \n\n“I know, but I’m talking about Donald Trump’s second term. Going forward,” Bash pressed.\n\n\"I don't think any of that's going to happen, because we’re the party that’s against political prosecutions,” Jordan replied.\n\nOthers are not so sure. Maggie Haberman, the Trumpworld-whisperer with The New York Times, noted that the former president had turned to recriminations against his neoconservative former allies, Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo, in his first announcement regarding who would join his administration in 2025.\n\n“He's been talking about retribution or revenge pretty consistently over the last two years,” Haberman told CNN’s Manu Raju on Sunday. “So yes, I expect that will be a thing.”\n\nHaberman would go on to note that the president-elect largely only cared about a few specific Cabinet positions, including attorney general. Trump’s pick to run the Justice Department will be the clearest sign as to whether he will be pursuing political prosecutions of various Democratic opponents throughout his second presidency.\n\nTrump’s victory in the Electoral College and popular vote this past week came after months of warnings from Democrats about the threat Trump posed to American democracy and specifically about plans outlined by his allies working for the “Project 2025” effort to craft what critics call a blueprint for undermining the traditional independence of the Justice Department from the president’s personal oversight.\n\nOne of the most important roadblocks Trump faced in his bid to overturn the 2020 election on false pretense of fraud was Bill Barr, then attorney general, who refuted his boss’s claims that federal authorities had seen evidence of widespread election fraud.","summary":"Ohio lawmaker joins other Republicans in explaining away Trump’s more outlandish threats","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jim-jordan-trump-revenge-justice-department-b2644681.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/10/23/jimjordan_nov2024.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/73CCc37o-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:29:03","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":263965850,"title":"Rita Ora breaks down in tears as she pays moving tribute to close friend Liam Payne at the MTV EMAs and credits him for 'bringing so much joy to every room' following his tragic death in Buenos Aires","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Nov 11th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRita Ora leads the red carpet glamour in a pink feathered gown as she joins glamorous Maya Jama, Vick Hope and Raye at MTV EMAs in Manchester ahead of her history-making THIRD hosting gig\n\nTen-year-old boy left with horrific facial injuries after being hit by e-bike - as mother blasts 'heartless' rider for leaving without checking he was ok\n\nTrump issues stern warning to Putin in phone call after election victory\n\nHow Boris Johnson and King Charles clashed over slavery reparations: Former PM told aide 'I went in pretty hard'\n\nThe warning all parents must read before helping their adult child buy a home, as told by a mother who lost everything to her selfish son - and how you can protect yourself TODAY\n\nWhy I love young men's rock-hard enthusiasm, reveals VANESSA FELTZ.

R.I.P [dove emoji] (sic)'\nRita recently paid tribute to Liam during a concert in Osaka, Japan. The singer became visibly emotional as she performed a rendition of their hit single.\nLiam fell 45ft from the third floor into the courtyard of the Casa Sur Hotel in Buenos Aires last month. \n\nShe added: 'We lost him recently and he was a big part of the MTV world and my world and I think a lot of yours at home and everybody in here tonight'\n\nRita continued: 'Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew. He had the biggest heart and was always the first person to offer help in any way that he could'\n\nBreaking down she added: 'So let's just take a moment to remember our friend Liam...'\n\nRita previously admitted to being 'devastated' by Liam's passing. The singer took to social media in October to pay tribute to Liam, observing that he had 'the kindest soul' \n\nThe pair are seen performing together in 2018\nBuenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentina's capital, resulting in 'extremely serious injuries.' \nPayne was in Buenos Aires to attend the concert of his former One Direction bandmate Niall Horan.\n\n Liam Payne tributes pour in as his X Factor co-stars and collaborator Rita Ora share emotional posts after One Direction star dies in tragic hotel fall \nPayne was one of five band members of One Direction, which formed in 2010 when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series The X Factor. \nAfter each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Horan, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands.\nThe band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like What Makes You Beautiful. \nThey had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016. They had a loyal fan base, many of whom were teen girls, who became known as 'Directioners.'\nPayne had a seven-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. \nShe was an The X Factor judge during One Direction's season. \nHe is also survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. \n\nFollowing news of his death Rita said: 'He had the kindest soul, I will never forget. I loved working with him so much - he was just such a joy to be around on and off stage'\n\nRita hosted the ceremony and was seen arriving on the red carpet earlier in the night in a light pink feathered gown\n\nThose watching at home were moved to tears by Rita's tribute\nOn Friday a hotel worker and a drug dealer were revealed as two of the three mystery men arrested over the death of Liam in Buenos Aires.\nPolice in Argentina believe they have uncovered drug dealing at the CasaSur Palermo Hotel where the star fell to his death from his suite's third-floor balcony on October 16.\nA 21-year-old and a 24-year-old have been named by respected Argentine news website Infobae as two of the three arrested suspects. They are accused of supplying Liam with drugs while a third suspect is under investigation for abandoning a person who subsequently died.\nThe publication described the 21-year-old, from Ingeniero Budge on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, as an employee of the CasaSur Palermo hotel accused of having supplied cocaine to Payne on at least two occasions.\nThe 24-year-old drug dealer is from Berazategui, a suburb south-east of the city centre. He allegedly supplied narcotics to the former member of One Direction in the days before his death.\nThe singer's close friend Rogelio 'Roger' Nores has denied that he is the third suspect and told MailOnline that he would never have abandoned the star.\nProsecutors have made it clear that any idea that Liam had committed suicide had been ruled out and said he was in a state of 'semi or total unconsciousness' as he fell to his death when he 'didn't know what he was doing.' \nTests have shown the 31-year-old binged on alcohol and cocaine before he died and also had traces of an antidepressant in his system. \n\nShe changed into a sleek black suit for the tribute section \n\nShe shared this sweet image of them together as she paid tribute last month \n\nFans have been paying their respects to the popstar at the hotel since his tragic death\n\nOne Direction (from left to right) Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik in 2011\nAfter releasing five albums with one of the biggest boybands of all time, Liam released his first solo album titled LP1 in 2019.\nHis singles Strip That Down co-written with Ed Sheeran climbed its way to number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that same year. \nOver the course of his music career, the popstar collaborated with the likes of J Balvin, French Montana, Dixie D'Amelio and A Boogie Wit da Hoodie.\nRita hosted the MTV EMAs on Sunday night where Taylor Swift, Tyla and Raye were the big winners.\nThe red carpet was a sea of glamour with stars such as Maya Jama, Vick Hope and Jodie Turner-Smith dazzling. \n\nAerial view of the hotel where British singer Liam died in Buenos Aires\n\nHe had been on holiday in South America with girlfriend Kate Cassidy (left) \n\nMTV EMAs 2024: The WINNERS\n\nAriana Grande – we can't be friends (wait for your love)\nBenson Boone – Beautiful Things\nBeyoncé – TEXAS HOLD 'EM\nBillie Eilish – BIRDS OF A FEATHER\nChappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!\nSabrina Carpenter – Espresso - WINNER\n\nAriana Grande – we can't be friends (wait for your love)\nCharli xcx - 360\nEminem - Houdini\nKendrick Lamar – Not Like Us\nLISA ft.

They asked for it,” the text reads before she flips open her poison ring and gives the camera a sinister smile.\n\nIn a plea for common sense, a woman posted a TikTok video urging people participating in “MATGA” to think long and hard about what they were doing.\n\n“You do know those videos can be used against you, right? It’s giving off premeditated vibes. The internet is FOREVER. Also.. the 1600s were A LOT different than 2024 advancements in detecting POISON,” reads the text positioned over a video of her scrunching her face in disbelief.\n\nLiberal women have been registering their dismay at the outcome of the election through the “MATGA” movement and a number of other ways, meticulously documenting everything online.\n\nSome have started shaving their heads, while others are engaging in sex strikes against men or committing to not getting pregnant or giving birth for the duration of Trump’s second term, to protest what they see as potential draconian abortion measures to come under him.\n\nTrump helped pave the way in his first term for the conservative US Supreme Court that in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision ensuring abortion rights at the federal level. States now have the power to determine their own abortion laws instead.\n\nThe incoming president has stated repeatedly that he would veto a federal abortion ban. The number of abortions in America also has actually increased since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, according to the New York Times, even in states that have enacted new restrictions on the procedure.","summary":"Women online have taken to filming ghoulish murder-fantasy videos in which they romanticize lacing men’s beverages with deadly poison as a justifiable response to fears about abortion rights under a second Trump presidency.

The world’s biggest raw materials buyer is struggling to break free of deflationary pressures that have sunk prices at the factory gate for 25 straight months and delivered only anemic growth in consumption. Demand for old economy items like oil and steel has fallen this year and those markets are probably now in structural decline.\n\nThe restraint may be in part about keeping government powder dry, given the challenges to trade and the wider economy threatened by Donald Trump’s return to the White House next year. The finance ministry has certainly promised bolder fiscal policy. \n\nFor now, economists and analysts left to read the tea leaves. Base metals such as copper and aluminum are likely to have an advantage over construction materials like steel and its feedstock iron ore, key beneficiaries back in 2008, when China unrolled an unprecedented stimulus plan to counter a global financial crisis. Foodstuffs and fuels should see a net benefit from faster economic growth, although there are risks that decarbonization could stymie the gains for oil.","summary":"Global commodities markets are stuck in a holding pattern after China’s latest effort to revive its economy focused on the much-needed restructuring of local government debt, but stopped short of stimulus measures that would directly boost domestic demand.","url":"https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-economic-rescue-plan-leaves-commodities-stuck-on-pause","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/775869418-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:21:10","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","source_country":"CA","sentiment":0.065},{"id":263965896,"title":"How President-elect Donald Trump won Pennsylvania − and what voters say about the flip","text":"How President-elect Donald Trump won Pennsylvania − and what voters say about the flip\n President-elect Donald Trump won Pennsylvania after losing the state in 2020.

She received her biggest portion of votes in New Jersey. Overall, Stein won .8% of the vote in the state with 44,671 of the ballots cast.\n\nDonald Trump beat Kamala Harris by about 83,000 votes, 49.7% to 48.3%, to win Michigan, so her candidacy is not seen as having affected the outcome there, but did raise issues important to third-party candidates, such as Israel's war with Hamas, concern over climate change, social justice and campaign finance reform.\n\nIn an unusual move, Stein held a victory party in Dearborn on election night citing her success in the city, and said that it wasn't numbers that mattered but the sentiment that some voters had expressed against the traditional two party system in favor of her Green Party candidacy.\n\nNationally, Stein and her running mate, Rudolph \"Butch\" T. Ware III, were on the ballot in 39 states but failed to score even one half of one percent of the total vote nationally, collecting 628,129 votes, or 0.4%.","summary":"This year's Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, has blamed Democrats for their election loss, and has said the two-party political system in the U.S. is broken.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/11/10/greens-blame-dems-for-disastrous-trump-win/1031731283447/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1031731283447/2024/upi_com/bea0660c6979c48bbe0ea8d841f9a93f/v1.2/Green-partys-Stein-blames-Democrats-for-disastrous-Trump-win.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:15:41","author":"Mark Moran","authors":["Mark Moran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":263966630,"title":"Bitcoin hits $80,000 for first time on Trump optimism","text":"Bitcoin rallied past $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.

They asked for it,” the text reads before she flips open her poison ring and gives the camera a sinister smile.\n\nIn a plea for common sense, a woman posted a TikTok video urging people participating in “MATGA” to think long and hard about what they were doing.\n\n“You do know those videos can be used against you, right? It’s giving off premeditated vibes. The internet is FOREVER. Also.. the 1600s were A LOT different than 2024 advancements in detecting POISON,” reads the text positioned over a video of her scrunching her face in disbelief.\n\nLiberal women have been registering their dismay at the outcome of the election through the “MATGA” movement and a number of other ways, meticulously documenting everything online.\n\nSome have started shaving their heads, while others are engaging in sex strikes against men or committing to not getting pregnant or giving birth for the duration of Trump’s second term, to protest what they see as potential draconian abortion measures to come under him.\n\nTrump helped pave the way in his first term for the conservative US Supreme Court that in 2022 overturned the Roe v. Wade decision ensuring abortion rights at the federal level. States now have the power to determine their own abortion laws instead.\n\nThe incoming president has stated repeatedly that he would veto a federal abortion ban. The number of abortions in America also has actually increased since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, according to the New York Times, even in states that have enacted new restrictions on the procedure.","summary":"Women online have taken to filming ghoulish murder-fantasy videos in which they romanticize lacing men's beverages with deadly poison as a justifiable response to fears about abortion rights under a second Trump presidency.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/10/us-news/women-furious-about-trumps-win-start-matga-movement-which-glorifies-poisoning-men/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-lvbqmi3dn-1731280540668.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1731262638&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/O5VzHYmV-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:12:40","author":"Chris Nesi","authors":["Chris Nesi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":263964004,"title":"PETER VAN ONSELEN: It's official - Albo the 'houso class traitor' is dragging Labor down with him. Today's Newspoll confirms it","text":"It's official: Anthony Albanese is now a definite drag on the Labor vote.\n\nThe government trails the Coalition 49 to 51 percent on the two party vote according to today's Newspoll.\n\nLabor's primary vote is a meagre 33 percent compared with the Coalition's 40 percent.\n\nWere it not for the preferences the Greens deliver to the Labor Party, the government's two party deficit would be greater than it currently is.\n\nThat Greens preference flow to Labor is a portent for why the government continues to pander to its left flank, and a sure sign of the looming dependence a re-elected minority Labor government will have on Adam Bandt and his party\n\nThat's assuming Albo finds a way to win the next election. Because the current numbers suggest that's up in the air, even though no first term government has failed to win re-election since 1931.\n\nBut none have been saddled with the sort of unpopular leader this government now is.\n\nAlbo's personal satisfaction rating is in the toilet. A whooping 55 percent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance compared to just 40 percent who are satisfied.\n\nThat results in a net satisfaction rating of minus 15, disastrous for a first term incumbent.\n\nJoe Biden was suffering similar terrible polling results before he pulled out of the Presidential race.\n\nWe are used to opposition leaders being unpopular. Their job is to tear down governments, which while often effective also results in personal unpopularity.\n\nBut Albo is a PM who has only been in the job for two and a half years, still in his first term.\n\nYet he's already on the nose, acting as a sea anchor for his government.\n\nIf Labor MPs thought they could orchestrate his removal they would. But the timing, the leadership rules and the lack of an obvious alternative are now Albo's best friend.\n\nSo why is the PM so unpopular?\n\nThis is the first Newspoll since news of his $4.3m waterfront holiday property purchase came to light.\n\nThat might not have registered with voters had the PM not subsequently become embroiled in a business class upgrades scandal with Qantas.\n\nAn airline - with its former CEO Alan Joyce - that backed his unsuccessful bid to install an Indigenous Voice to parliament, voted down by 60 percent of Aussies in every single state.\n\nThe erosion of Albo's connection with mainstream Australians didn't end there. News of his musical chairs with family members accessing the Chairman's Lounge has also bobbed around the media.\n\nDid anyone know Albo grew up in housing commission? He never mentions it, so maybe not.\n\nThe word amongst some of his senior colleagues is they worry he's now a drag on the Labor vote because Albo 'comes across as a class traitor now', as one MP told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nWhile Albo once declared that he loves fighting Tories, it seems to a growing number of Australians that he's now more interested in emulating their privilege.\n\nWhich is perhaps why Albo's popularity continues to sink, and Labor's electoral fortunes continue to fade.\n\nThrow in last week's election result in the United States, where a returning Donald Trump Presidency and Republican majorities in the House and the Senate dealt a body blow to the incumbent Democrats.\n\nCould we be about to witness history being made when Australians head to the polls before the end of May next year? Bearing witness to a first term government losing a re-election bid for the first time in nearly 100 years?\n\nI still say no. The more likely scenario is Labor eking out an ugly win, relying on the Greens and other crossbenchers to govern in minority in a second term. \n\nEven if interest rates don't come down in February next year, because domestic inflation remains too high.\n\nBut with unpopular Albo leading Labor's re-election campaign - remembering he's a terrible campaigner at the best of times - anything's possible.","summary":"It's official: Anthony Albanese is now a definite drag on the Labor vote.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14066469/Anthony-Albanese-class-traitor-Newspoll.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/10/23/91917419-0-image-m-12_1731282959875.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:10:21","author":"Editor,Peter van Onselen","authors":["Editor","Peter van Onselen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":263966638,"title":"India to back Brazil for consensus at G20 meet amid geopolitical tensions","text":"NEW DELHI: India will throw its weight behind Brazil to forge a consensus at the G20 leaders meeting next week against the backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions and New Delhi will press for progress on issues linked to debt, climate and gender, a top official said on Sunday.“We will do our best to assist and support Brazil much like Brazil had supported us. We will do our best to bring the emerging markets on board,” Amitabh Kant, India’s G20 sherpa, told TOI in an interview.Leaders from the G20 group of developed and emerging economies will meet in Rio de Janeiro on Nov 18-19 along with the African Union and European Union amid the tense geopolitical situation with the Russia-Ukraine war and the situation in West Asia expected to cast a shadow on the success of the summit.

Deep divisions among some emerging economies and the G7 on the issue of the situation in West Asia have also emerged as a stumbling block to forge a consensus.“The three priorities of the Brazilian presidency are fight against hunger and poverty, sustainable development and energy transition and global governance reform,” said Kant, adding that it will also witness the launch of the global alliance against hunger and poverty, which India has strongly backed along with other members of the group.“India is pushing the voice of the Global South and India is emerging as a leader which is carrying all the concerns of the Global South.

It is also pushing for low-cost concessional financing for developing countries but officials say that the discussions on climate at the summit would be “contentious.”While India has strongly backed progress on issues linked to gender as outlined in the New Delhi Leader’s declaration, some countries have taken a “conservative approach” and so far have adopted a tough stance on the issue. The G7 is also pushing for what it calls “forward looking language” on the topic.Kant said India will also call for “bold reforms” of the multilateral trading system, including the World Trade Organisation, which can help push sustainable economic growth and trigger economic resurgence and lead to a “more inclusive, prosperous and interconnected world.”Trump victory casts shadow on summitThe US election results and Donald Trump’s victory have cast a shadow on the G20 meeting.

So, for six months we had to listen to Downtown.

Is that how long Starmer expects to limp on as PM? I think we should be told. \n\nObscure Tory MP Nigel Huddleston has been made joint party chairman in Kemi Badenoch’s reshuffle.

Ireland’s Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin also won’t be attending, staying home instead for the general election campaign. \n\nMeanwhile, the Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea is boycotting the conference, saying that it is tired of other countries making empty promises on climate action that they don’t follow through on. \n\nSomeone who is expected to attend is UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose visit will be his first since Labour’s victory in their general election earlier this year.\n\nPrime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, who has become known for her powerful testimony as a leader of a country already experiencing the impacts of climate change, is also due to attend this year.\n\nThe real leg work at the COPs happens in negotiating rooms, where government delegations try to hammer out agreements about collective climate action.\n\nLast year, for instance, at COP28, the negotiations saw countries formally agree to ‘transition away’ from fossil fuels and to a new Loss and Damage fund to support nations that are being hit badly by the impacts of climate change.\n\nBefore the debates around the negotiating tables really heat up, there’s a two-day segment at the start of the conference for heads of state or government to deliver a national statement on behalf of their country, detailing their progress on climate action and often making calls to the rest of the world to step up.\n\nA prime minister of president of a country doesn’t necessarily mean that country isn’t still contributing to the negotiations, but it can send a signal that international climate action isn’t currently a top priority for that leader – despite the scale of the crisis.\n\nMany of the world’s leaders are due to attend and speak at the COP, but others, like Ireland, have a muted presence this year. Some non-attendees are continuing a pattern of no-shows while others made a specific decision not to attend this COP – here’s a look which leaders aren’t coming.\n\nThen-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar delivered a speech at the summit in the UAE last year, preceded by then-Taoiseach Micheál Martin the year before in Egypt.\n\nCurrent Taoiseach Simon Harris would have been in line to present this time around, but with the looming general election, neither he nor Micheál Martin (now the Tánaiste) will be attending.\n\nGreen Party leader Roderic O’Gorman described their decision to stay home as “disappointing”, saying: “We need our leaders to do what it takes to protect this country from more destruction in the years ahead.”\n\nMinister for Climate Eamon Ryan is the only senior member of Government due to attend and is expected to deliver Ireland’s national statement. He is also as working as a co-facilitator on climate adaptation negotiations, a role appointed by the COP presidency.\n\nRyan said he wouldn’t criticise the Taoiseach and Tánaiste’s decision not to attend but was quick to add that he would be critical if they didn’t use the time at home to debate climate issues and to answer “serious questions” about how they intend to deliver climate action. \n\nMinister for Climate Eamon Ryan, Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin in May 2024Alamy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS President Joe Biden is not due to make a speech this year, though the US will still have an official delegation at the negotiations – and it’s generally one that holds a lot of influence over the finer details of the deals that are struck.\n\nThere’ll be a lot of eyes on the US at the COP this year in the wake of Donald Trump’s election win. The last time Trump was president, he withdrew the US from the important Paris Agreement on climate action – and it’s expected that he’ll do the same again once he’s sworn back into office in January.\n\nRussia, China, India\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi won’t be making the journey to Azerbaijan. Putin and Jinping have regularly not attended the COPs. Modi did make an appearance at COP28 last year.\n\nLike the US, these countries will still have delegations at the negotiations. China in particular has quite a strong voice, bolstered by its role in the negotiating group known as the G77 plus China.\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPapua New Guinea’s Prime Minister James Marape is boycotting the conference, saying that recent COPs have not made nearly enough progress, pointing in particular to a lack of commitment to rainforest conservation.\n\nThe island nation is on the frontline of extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change. Its Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tckatchenko said last month that it was holding back from this COP because previous have been a “total waste of time” in recent years.\n\nHe said the last three COP meetings have “gone around in circles” and produced “no tangible results for small island states”, saying that Papua New Guinea would “no longer tolerate empty promises”.\n\nIts Minister for Environment Simo Kilepa is expected to attend with a “streamlined” delegation to advocate for Papua New Guinea’s bid to host a meeting of the Green Climate Fund Board next year.\n\nFrance, Germany, and the EU Commission President\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are all expected to skip out on the conference, each for various political reasons.\n\nMacron’s non-attendance is understood to be linked to tense relations between France and Azerbaijan since the host country’s military offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh last year, which saw it seize control of the Armenian separatist region. Azerbaijan is also a supporter of French overseas territories that want independence from Paris.\n\nScholz had originally been due to deliver a national statement for Germany but has switched his attention after the breakdown of his government’s coalition, prompting a last minute change in plans.\n\nDutch leader Schoof is also no longer attending after violent clashes in Amsterdam last week between Dutch and Israeli football fans. School wrote on social media that he will be staying in the Netherlands “due to the major social impact” of the incident.\n\nAnd von der Leyen, the figurehead who has represented the EU at previous blocs, will not attend this year either. A new Commission is currently being put together and is due to take office on 1 December, when von der Leyen is set to begin her second term as Commission President. European Council President Charles Michel, EU Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra and EU Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson will be there instead.\n\nAn entrance to the COP29 venue in Baku, AzerbaijanLauren Boland / The Journal\n\nLauren Boland / The Journal / The Journal\n\nBrazil, Australia\n\nBrazil is set to take up the COP presidency in 2025 and host the 30th annual conference in the city of Belem on the fringes of the Amazon rainforest. The host for the 31st conference has not yet been decided but Australia has an eager bid on the table.\n\nHowever, neither of their leaders are travelling to COP29 in Azerbaijan. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cancelled plans to attend after sustaining a head injury last month. Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is also not expected to attend.\n\nSpecial mention: Greta Thunberg\n\nSwedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is not the head of any government but is worth a mention on this list.

John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump’s support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.\n\nTrump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader “must agree” to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.\n\n“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,” Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled “IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nThe Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president’s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief “pro-forma” sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.\n\nBut with Trump’s approval paramount in the race, all three candidates quickly suggested that they might be willing to reconsider the practice. Scott replied to Trump, “100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible.” And Thune said in a statement that they must “quickly and decisively” act to get nominees in place and that “all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.”\n\nCornyn said that “It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump ’s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent.” He noted that recess appointments are allowed under the Constitution.\n\nThe social media exchange on Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.\n\nTrump’s relationship with Congress — especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations — was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.\n\nTrump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year — a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that “Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.”\n\nWith days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.\n\nThune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott — a longtime friend of Trump’s and fierce ally — has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump’s endorsement.\n\nSenators who are close to Trump, such as Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, have endorsed Scott, as have tech mogul Elon Musk and other people who have Trump’s ear.\n\n“We have to be the change,” Scott said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “That’s what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.”\n\nAll three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a “despicable human being” behind closed doors.\n\nAs the Senate haggles over how to fill Trump’s Cabinet, many of his allies are campaigning for the nominations. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC’s “This Week” that there are “a couple of great options on the table.” Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Republican from Tennessee who served as U.S. ambassador to Japan between 2017 and 2019, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that one of his greatest honors was to represent the Trump administration overseas. He said he would advance “the positions that President Trump has articulated.”\n\n“I’ll do that in whatever role necessary,” said Hagerty, who has endorsed Scott in the leadership race.\n\nWhile Trump has made only one personnel move public so far, naming Susie Wiles his chief of staff, he has already ruled out two names for top positions.\n\nTrump said Saturday that he would not be inviting Mike Pompeo, his former U.S. Secretary of State and CIA chief, and Nikki Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as his U.N. ambassador and challenged him for the GOP nomination. Pompeo rallied with Trump on the night before Election Day.\n\n“I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to thank them for their service to our Country,” Trump posted on his network Truth Social.\n\nTrump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., reposted on X a message by podcaster Dave Smith suggesting to put pressure to “keep all neocons and war hawks out of the Trump administration.”\n\n“The ‘stop Pompeo’ movement is great, but it’s not enough,” Smith posted on X. “America First: screw the war machine!”\n\nGomez Licon reported from Miami.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/trump-pressures-candidates-for-senate-gop-leader-to-fill-his-cabinet-right-away/article_728428d5-1eba-5cee-9bac-0f8332b8bd2b.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/4b/64b216c3-21bf-510c-a573-ecc97deedc5b/67314a2e33d2f.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C91&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:03:35","author":"Mary Clare Jalonick And Adriana Gomez Licon The Associated Press,Wire Content","authors":["Mary Clare Jalonick And Adriana Gomez Licon The Associated Press","Wire Content"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":0.072},{"id":263963076,"title":"George Will: Trump’s victory continues GOP’s 'eight years of self-degradation'","text":"Conservative Washington Post columnist George Will has been a scathing critic of President-Elect Donald Trump and the MAGA movement's influence on the Republican Party.\n\n In his November 6 column, Will argues that Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election continues the \"eight years of self-degradation\" the GOP has suffered thanks to Trump.\n\n\"Conducting a thorough autopsy on the cadaver of Kamala Harris' campaign will require the scalpel of voting data not yet sharpened,\" Will argues. \"Two things, however, are obvious.

That is why leaders have begun the process of developing stronger relationships with the 45th and 47th president because he represents global peace and stability.”\n\nTrump had also spoken to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, according to media reports.\n\nBiden has invited Trump to come to the Oval Office on Wednesday, and on Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that Biden’s top message will be his commitment to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. He will also talk to Trump about what’s happening in Europe, in Asia and the Middle East.\n\n“President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,” Sullivan told CBS.\n\nWashington has provided tens of billions of dollars worth of US military and economic aid to Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February 2022, funding that Trump has repeatedly criticised and rallied against with other Republican lawmakers.\n\nUkraine’s foreign ministry disputed a claim in the Washington Post article that Kyiv was informed of the call and did not object to the conversation taking place. “Reports that the Ukrainian side was informed in advance of the alleged call are false. Subsequently, Ukraine could not have endorsed or opposed the call,” foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters.\n\nOn Friday, the Kremlin said Putin was ready to discuss Ukraine with Trump but that it did not mean that he was willing to alter Moscow’s demands.\n\nOn 14 June, Putin set out his terms for an end to the war: Ukraine would have to drop its Nato ambitions and withdraw all its troops from all the territory of four regions claimed by Russia.\n\nUkraine rejected that, saying it would be tantamount to capitulation, and that Zelenskyy has put forward a “victory plan” that includes requests for additional military support from the west.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Trump spoke to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “The chancellor emphasised the German government’s willingness to continue the decades of successful cooperation between the two countries’ governments. They also agreed to work together towards a return to peace in Europe,” a German government spokesperson said.\n\nIn a call last week with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, Trump said the US was interested in working with Seoul in the shipbuilding industry, particularly in naval shipbuilding, as well as “promoting genuine peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region,”, the South Korean leader said.\n\nTrump’s call with Putin comes just a day after Bryan Lanza, a senior political adviser to Trump, told the BBC that Ukraine should focus on achieving peace instead of “a vision for winning”.\n\n“When Zelenskyy says we will only stop this fighting, there will only be peace, once Crimea is returned, we’ve got news for President Zelenskyy: Crimea is gone,” Lanza told the BBC.\n\nAfter his comments, a Trump spokesperson said Lanza “was a contractor for the campaign” and that he “does not work for President Trump and does not speak for him”.","summary":"In phone call, Trump reminds Putin of US’s ‘sizeable military presence in Europe’, Washington Post reports\n\nDonald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Thursday and discussed the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe US president-elect advised the Russian president not to escalate the war in Ukraine and reminded him of “Washington’s sizeable military presence in Europe”, the Post reported.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/10/trump-putin-ukraine-war","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5e6c1c84a29db53135fb9bf41e7ce46ab4caf4/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:01:45","author":"Maya Yang","authors":["Maya Yang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":263963388,"title":"Bloody Russian Assaults In Kursk Leave Behind At Least Three Graveyards For BTR-82 Vehicles—And Their Passengers","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nUkrainian defense ministry capture\n\nIn western Russia’s Kursk Oblast, a trio of Ukraine’s heaviest brigades is in a close fight with Russian marines and North Korean soldiers attacking from two directions. It’s an apocalyptic fight that’s costing the Russians—and possibly the North Koreans, as well—potentially dozens of vehicles and hundreds of lives.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the Russians won’t win. The Kremlin has built a manpower machine to pump replacement troops into the fight. The machine can’t function forever, of course. But there’s no sign it’ll run out of raw material any time soon. “On the Kursk direction, the enemy has regrouped,” the Ukrainian Center for Defense Strategies concluded.\n\nOn August 6, a powerful Ukrainian force—perhaps a dozen 400-person battalions from half a dozen brigades—burst through Russian defenses along the border in Kursk and quickly contested 400 square miles of the oblast.\n\nKyiv’s aim, it seems, was to grab a chunk of Russia in order to improve its position in any future armistice negotiations. Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to recapture Kursk by Oct. 1—a deadline they obviously missed. But Russian counterattacks did chip away at the salient, gradually reducing Ukrainian control to around 270 square miles.\n\nNow Putin wants the rest of Kursk back, and he’s clearly willing to trade thousands of Russian lives for it. His renewed sense of urgency may be related to Republican Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine before his January inauguration.\n\nTrump’s long-shot proposal, which currently lacks a realistic enforcement mechanism, would freeze the front line at its current position. For Ukraine, that would mean losing 45,000 square miles of occupied territory.\n\nFor Russia, it would mean losing 270 square miles of Kursk. Unless, of course, those Russian marines—and their thousands North Korean allies—can retake Kursk before a possible ceasefire.\n\nThe Russian effort is rushed and sloppy. Barreling toward Ukrainian positions in factory-fresh BTR-82 wheeled armored personnel carriers starting Nov. 7, Russians and allies from the 810th Naval Infantry Brigades have attacked the northern edge of the salient at the same time the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade—a unit that’s notorious for its war crimes—is attacking farther to the west.\n\nThree heavily-armed Ukrainian formations—the 95th Air Assault Brigade, the 47th Mechanized Brigade with its American-made M-1 tanks and M-2 fighting vehicles and the recently reorganized 17th Heavy Mechanized Brigade—are blowing up infantry-laden BTRs nearly as fast as the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade can send them.\n\nAfter a cursory survey of drone videos, open-source intelligence analysts have identified at least three BTR graveyards in and around the village of Pogrebki. Graphic footage depicts heaps of dead Russians.\n\nBut a few BTRs have managed to run the gauntlet of Ukrainian mines, drones, artillery and missiles to push back the front line more than a mile from its October position. And more Russians and allies are coming.\n\nThe allies aren’t just North Koreans. According to the Center for Defense Strategies, a Russian training facility in occupied Crimea is also funneling “mercenaries from African countries and Cuba” into the 810th Naval Infantry Brigade.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

The SDLP’s South Belfast MP and party leader, Claire Hanna, briefly forgot that she was not the Democratic Congresswoman for South Carolina. She tweeted that she planned to “mourn a bit, then organise,” and urged her followers to “look after (themselves) today,” as if the Proud Boys were likely at any moment to ransack the Lisburn Road. Ms Hanna is supposedly a committed europhile, but it is unlikely that she indulged in such histrionics when France and Germany went to the polls. Unfortunately, though, this kind of overwrought reaction to what was, after all, a foreign election was by no means unique. Indeed, it seemed to be expected from a certain type of “progressive”, who takes their cue from American identity politics. The former Green Party leader, Caroline Lucas, lives in Brighton on the south coast of England, but she declared herself terrified and “sick” after Trump’s win. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, reminded Londoners that the city is “for everyone”, as if the President might urge the Met Police to sweep minorities into the back of paddy wagons. And the former Conservative MP, Rory Stewart, now a podcaster appealing to so-called “centrist dads”, thought he’d endured a “devastating body blow”. Perhaps that had more to do with his prediction on election night that Kamala Harris would win convincingly, despite mounting evidence to the contrary. It was tempting to laugh at all this ridiculousness, but it had a serious side too. Firstly, we should be concerned that people, across the political spectrum, feel so unhealthily invested in politics across the Atlantic. It is not a new phenomenon, but we are currently importing particularly damaging trends from the US, including a new and divisive kind of identitarianism that is obsessed with categorising people through things like race and gender. Secondly, when the language around politics is always so heightened, our society becomes angrier and it is more difficult to recognise real crises, when they occur. If it feels like the wailing and shrieking never stops, how can we tell whether the latest scare is serious, or if the usual suspects are just having another meltdown? That brings me back to the Conservative Party leadership contest. When Kemi Badenoch was announced as the new Tory leader, liberal social media rage was, for a time, directed at her. The left-wing Labour MP Zarah Sultana, called her “one of the most nasty and divisive figures in British politics”. The Guardian columnist, Frances Ryan, used unerringly similar language, but also claimed the new leader would govern (if elected) “from the gutter”. Another Labour MP, Dawn Butler, shared a post on Twitter that described Badenoch as, “part of white supremacy’s collaborator class” and “white supremacy in blackface”. Keir Starmer criticised this offensive remark and, fortunately, the intensity of abuse soon waned, as Donald Trump formed a new focus for liberal hysteria. It showed, though, that overstatement and lack of restraint is not reserved for one target of so-called “progressives”. Whether the Tory leader really can turn around her party, or articulate the concerns of the Conservative grassroots, remains to be seen. Labour’s difficult start certainly provides Mrs Badenoch with an opportunity to win back voters more quickly than commentators would have envisaged before the election. If approval ratings are accurate, Keir Starmer is already a more unpopular premier than Rishi Sunak. And the recent budget saw a range of independent economic experts reject the government’s contention that its policies would be good for prosperity and growth. In Northern Ireland, unionists will simply hope that Mrs Badenoch is a more reliable ally than the last few Conservative leaders. She claimed earlier this year to have a special insight into this province’s problems, because her husband once stood for election in the Foyle constituency. Last week, as well, Badenoch appointed Priti Patel as shadow defence secretary, which is a key member of her team, charged with, among other things, setting Conservative policy toward the EU. The former home secretary previously wrote that the Windsor Framework “posed a risk to the integrity of our United Kingdom”. The Conservatives under Mrs Badenoch could signal a change of direction on Northern Ireland by supporting Jim Allister’s private member’s bill on mutual enforcement, which is backed by every Ulster unionist MP at Westminster. The Tories could acknowledge that, even if it were fully implemented, the Safeguarding the Union deal that Rishi Sunak negotiated with the DUP would not solve the biggest problems with the Irish Sea border. And, with a new leader in place, there is a chance to say they got it wrong on Northern Ireland in the last parliament. After all, Mrs Badenoch campaigned on a platform of restoring conservative principles to the party; including cherishing Britain’s institutions, valuing its history and traditions, and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom. We will soon see whether she can put that programme into practice, while mending divisions among Conservatives and bringing her colleagues with her. For unionists, a new Tory leader means a fresh chance to forge better relationships with that party, after a fractious few years, and find more effective ways to influence its thinking.","summary":"​Last week, the Conservative Party’s choice of leader was quickly pushed off the front pages by the US election result.

It is the latest set of UN climate negotiations, which take place every year.\n\nGovernments, business leaders, scientists and campaigners will gather this year in Baku, Azerbaijan, for two weeks of talks from November 11-22.\n\nThe meeting kicks off against a backdrop of deadly weather events, extreme conditions and record temperatures in recent months.\n\nThese include the floods in Valencia and Hurricane Helene that hit parts of the US in October – both of which scientific analysis showed were made more frequent and more intense by rising temperatures.\n\nAnd this year is on course to break temperature records once again.\n\n– What will be discussed?\n\nDubbed the “finance Cop”, one of the central issues at the conference will be agreeing new commitments on finance for poor countries to cope with climate change impacts and green their economies.\n\nWealthier countries have previously pledged 100 billion US dollars a year in private and public finance to help poorer nations, but experts have warned that figure needs to rise to one trillion dollars a year by 2030.\n\nReaching a consensus on money will be difficult, with nations so far disagreeing on almost all elements of the goal, like the amount of money needed, which countries should contribute, the types of finance and what it should fund.\n\nBut without a successful agreement on funding, the world will not be able to meet the scale of the challenge posed by climate change.\n\nThe talks will also focus again on boosting efforts to cut emissions amid increasingly dire warnings over the planet’s future.\n\nDuring the summit, many countries are expected to publish their new national action plans to cut emissions – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – including the UK.\n\nThese outline how each nation plans to help meet the goals of the 2015 global Paris Agreement, which aims to prevent the worst impacts of warming.\n\nThe latest NDCs, which will cover 2025 to 2035, are due ahead of Cop20 in Brazil next December.\n\nSo the spotlight will be on the level of ambition seen in these NDCs, including how they incorporate last year’s landmark deal to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems – agreed at Cop28 in Dubai.\n\nIn recent months, some oil rich-nations have sought to pushback and frustrate progress to deliver on this agreement.\n\nSo the world will also be watching how Azerbaijan, as the host country and an oil-rich nation itself, will handle discussions around fossil fuel phaseout discussions.\n\n– How is the world doing on climate action and finance?\n\nSince the Paris Agreement, where countries pledged to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the world has seen some landmark agreements, the green transition has truly crossed the starting line and almost 200 countries have put forward plans to cut emissions.\n\nGreenhouse gases continue to rise and reached record levels of concentration in the world’s atmosphere in 2023, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said.\n\nThe UN has warned that existing policies are falling so far short and the world is on track for a “catastrophic” 3.1C of global warming.\n\nIn its annual report on the gap between the emissions cuts needed to limit global warming to 1.5C and what countries are doing and have pledged to do, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said the goal would “soon be dead” without a global mobilisation on a scale and pace never seen before.\n\nUNEP also highlighted an “enormous gap” in financing for adapting to climate change with authors saying adequate financing for prevention is much cheaper than compensating for losses and damage.\n\n– How Donald Trump’s election win could affect global climate action?\n\nWorld leaders will be grappling with the fallout of the US presidential election, which is returning Donald Trump to the White House in what analysts say is a trend of climate scepticism in elections this year.\n\nThe president-elect said he plans to roll back green incentives domestically and take America – the world’s second largest emitter after China – out of the Paris Agreement again.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration will be involved in the talks, Mr Trump’s victory could nonetheless overshadow the negotiations and dampen ambition from other nations.\n\n– What is the UK’s position?\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is heading to the opening summit of Cop29, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will also play a key role for the UK during the talks.\n\nIt comes as Labour seeks to reposition Britain at the centre of global climate and nature diplomacy, marking a contrast from the previous Conservative government, which rowed back on green policies and axed the climate envoy position.\n\nUK officials plan to send a strong message with its plans for climate action as it releases its NDC for 2035 at the summit, coming the hopes of galvanising ambitious commitments from other countries.\n\nThe Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has recommended the Government commit to cutting emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels by 2035 in its new NDC. The then-Tory Government followed the CCC’s advice on the target the last time around in 2020.\n\nThe UK is also expected to take a strong position on cementing the Cop28 agreement to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, including being clear on how the world will take forward and track progress on this commitment.\n\nAwareness of the talks remains low among the UK public, according to PA Mediapoint’s opinion tracker, which found that two thirds of Britons are unfamiliar with the Cop29 conference\n\nThe Ipsos survey, conducted exclusively for PA’s non-media wire, questioned 1,088 British adults between September 25-26 on the upcoming conference.\n\nJust 19% of respondents said it was likely that commitments agreed at Cop29 would result in action while more than half lack confidence that commitments agreed at the summit will make a real difference to tackling climate change.","summary":"The meeting kicks off against a backdrop of deadly weather events,

re-election as US President.\n\nWorld leaders including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are heading to the opening summit of Cop29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, where they face pressure over delivering finance for poor countries to cope with climate change, and increasing their ambitions on emissions cuts.\n\nThe meeting is being held in the wake of the latest deadly weather events including floods in Valencia and Hurricane Helene in the US, which scientific analyses show were made more likely and intense by rising temperatures.\n\nThis year is on course to break temperature records once again and, as countries prepare to submit new plans for climate action by early next year, the UN has warned that existing policies are falling so far short the world is on track for a “catastrophic” 3.1C of warming.\n\nCountries will also be grappling with Mr Trump’s return to the White House, in what analysts say is a trend of climate scepticism in elections this year.\n\nThe next President of the US, the world’s second biggest polluter, is expected to boost fossil fuels, roll back green incentives domestically and take America out – again – of the global Paris Agreement on tackling climate change, which commits countries to pursue efforts to curb warming to 1.5C.\n\nIn the wake of Mr Trump’s win, Helen Meech, from the Climate Coalition of environmental and society organisations, urged: “International climate action is needed more than ever to limit global warming to 1.5C and urgently deliver the finance needed to those most impacted and vulnerable to climate change.\n\n“Ahead of Cop29, the Climate Coalition is calling on Keir Starmer to make a clear statement that the UK will commit to greater leadership on climate and nature, both at home and on the world stage, and deliver on his electoral mandate.”\n\nGareth Redmond-King, head of international programme at think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said UK ministers attending the talks need to set out an ambitious national climate plan for up to 2035, with independent advisers recommending an 81% emissions cut by then.\n\nAnd ministers should tell other countries about the concrete actions backing it up, including clean energy by 2030, phasing out fossil fuel cars and delivering green farming subsidies, he said.\n\nA key part of the negotiations in Baku will be agreeing new finance commitments for the cash that developing countries need to green their economies and cope with the already inevitable impacts of climate change.\n\nWealthier countries previously pledged 100 billion US dollars a year in private and public finance to help poorer nations, as part of efforts to secure the Paris treaty.\n\nBut they must now iron out a new finance agreement that meets Paris commitments for sufficient cash flows for cutting emissions and adapting to climate change, with experts saying one trillion US dollars needs to be flowing into developing countries each year by 2030.\n\nProfessor Nick Stern of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change said this is “what’s necessary to deliver on Paris”.\n\nChampa Patel, from the Climate Group, which works with governments and businesses on global warming action, said delivering a new finance goal was “not easy as countries bicker over what is meant by climate finance, who pays into the funds, and who can access them”.\n\nBut without funding, and provision for “loss and damage” from climate impacts, the world could not meet the scale of the challenge posed by climate change, she said.\n\nMs Patel added: “As the recent floods in Valencia show, this isn’t a future problem, it’s the reality we live in today.”\n\nHowever, she said, the task is made more difficult by a Trump presidency which “will likely walk back on existing financial commitments, and whose actions may embolden those seeking to weaken climate action”.\n\nBut Mr Redmond-King said the US had not been particularly helpful so far in finance negotiations, and it was not clear negotiators would necessarily have taken a victory for Kamala Harris as a signal to change that stance.\n\n“So Mr Trump’s election, given his administration is unlikely to offer any finance, may simply mean the US becomes less relevant to these negotiations. That could leave space for others to step in and find a route to agreement at Cop29,” he said.\n\nWhile money is key to what has been dubbed the “finance Cop” there is also a need – in the light of the US election – for countries to reaffirm their commitment to global cooperation, according to think tank E3G’s Harry Camilleri.\n\n“The economic forces underpinning the global transition are unstoppable,” he said.\n\n“Now is the time for forward-looking countries, from the EU to the UK and beyond, to step up and lead the global fight against climate change.”","summary":"Cop29 is set to focus on finance, but will be overshadowed by the outcome of the US election.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/environment/baku-keir-starmer-trump-president-azerbaijan-b1193190.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/11/11/00/09-4ade3423638c476d9466c9714d1aafc4.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:01:00","author":"Emily Beament","authors":["Emily Beament"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.14},{"id":263965054,"title":"GOP Edges Closer to House Win as Congress Returns for Lame Duck","text":"There are 19 races still in play, with Democrats holding 203 seats.

Addressing Trump's victory for the first time on his show \"GPS\" Sunday, Zakaria said the Democrats' collosal losses couldn't be attributed to one error or a singular oversight, blaming instead a wider ignorance by the left on key issues that put them at odds and out of touch with American voters. \"At first glance, it would seem easy to explain last Tuesday‘s election as part of a 2024 global wave against incumbents beset by post-Covid turmoil and inflation…so, it might have been preordained that Kamala Harris representing the incumbent administration lost decisively as well. But Harris could have bucked the trend,\" he began. DEPRESSED MEDIA REACT TO TRUMP VICTORY: HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED? \"Employment is strong. Wages are up. Inflation is down. Activity is soaring. More importantly, Donald Trump has many strengths as a political figure, but he also has many weaknesses,\" the host continued. Zakaria said Democrats had an opportunity to reclaim political power from Trump after the January 6 Capitol riots when his approval ratings took a hit, \"But they blew it.\" \"The New York Times estimates that Harris will lose the national popular vote by about a point and a half, a first for Democrats since 2004,\" he told viewers. DEMOCRATS LOOKING TO POINT FINGERS AFTER ‘HUMILIATING’ ELECTION DEFEAT SHOULD START WITH MEDIA: WSJ COLUMNIST The CNN host proceeded to spell out three areas where he believes Democrats got it wrong, thereby costing Harris the election. \"The first big error was the Biden administration’s blindness to the collapse of the immigration system and the chaos at the border\" Zakaria said. \"An asylum system that was meant for a small number of persecuted individuals was being used by millions to gain legal entry. Instead of shutting it down, liberals branded anyone protesting as heartless and racist. They missed a massive shift in American public opinion in just a few years.\" \"In 2020, the percentage of Americans who wanted to decrease immigration was just 28%. By this year, it was 55%.\" If Democrats were in touch with this reality, Harris would have taken a different position when asked in an appearance on \"The View\" how she would have strayed from President Biden on matters of border security, he said. KAMALA HARRIS' BUNGLED ANSWER ON ‘THE VIEW’ ABOUT BIDEN SEEN AS TURNING POINT IN CAMPAIGN \"Instead of basically saying nothing different, she should have said, ‘I would have shut down the border early and hard,’\" the CNN host went on. The Democrats' second error, according to Zakaria, was their \"overzealous misuse of law to punish Trump. \"The most egregious of the cases pursued was Alvin Bragg’s one in New York, one that even he was once skeptical of, but was reportedly pressured by some on the left into pursuing,\" he said. The CNN host argued that while some of the charges brought against Trump were \"legitimate,\" the host of them piled on in rapid succession, gave the impression that the legal system was being weaponized to get Trump. It confirmed to his base what it had always believed – that over-educated urban liberals were hypocrites, happy to bend rules and norms when it suited their purposes,\" he said. \"Lawfare turned Trump from being a loser into a victor,\" he told Democrats pointedly. Their third mistake, Zakaria continued, was the party's fixation on identity politics, \"that largely came out of the urban academic bubble, but alienated many mainstream voters.\" For example, the term \"Latinx\" was not well received among the Latino community, he said, but divisive identity politics had morphed into an \"obsession\" on the left. \"There is an irony in claiming to be pro-Latino by insisting that people use the term Latinx only to discover that Latinos themselves think the word is weird,\" Zakaria argued. \"This kind of obsession made Democrats view people too much through their ethnic or racial or gender identity and made them miss, for example, that working-class Latinos were moving toward Trump, perhaps, because they were socially conservative or liked his macho rhetoric or even agreed with his hard-line stance on immigration,\" he continued. \"The problem is deeper than one about nouns and pronouns. The entire focus on identity has morphed into something deeply illiberal. Judging people by the color of their skin rather than the content of their character.\" The CNN host proceeded to lecture Democrats for embracing university \"speech codes\" and cancel culture, which have \"become ways the left censors or restricts that most cherished of liberal ideas, freedom of speech. \"One simple way to think about the lessons of the election is that liberals cannot achieve liberal goals, however virtuous, by illiberal means,\" he concluded.

Democrats have spent the days following Trump's resounding victory last week finger pointing and casting blame at different factions of the party for Harris' stunning loss. Some have blamed Biden for failing to suspend his presidential campaign sooner, while others said Harris was to blame for covering up Biden's mental decline.","summary":"CNN host Fareed Zakaria did not mince words in a seven-minutes opening monologue on his show Sunday where he lectured Democrats for being out of touch with American voters.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-host-scathingly-rebukes-democrats-citing-ignorance-put-them-out-touch-voters-they-blew-it","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/08/931/523/Fareed-Zakaria-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:00:54","author":"Yael Halon","authors":["Yael Halon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.546},{"id":263965330,"title":"Many Killed In Strikes On Gaza, Lebanon As Israel Faces US' Aid Deadline","text":"Israeli air strikes killed dozens of people in Lebanon and Gaza Sunday, rescuers and authorities said, ahead of a US deadline for improved aid delivery to the Palestinian territory.\n\nAnother strike south of the Syrian capital Damascus killed nine people including a Hezbollah commander, a war monitor said.\n\nRescuers in the Gaza Strip said 13 children were among 30 people killed by Israeli strikes in the territory's north.\n\nThe first hit a house in Jabalia, killing at least 25 people including 13 children and injuring more than 30, Gaza's civil defence agency said.\n\nAt around 6:00 am, \"there was a very huge explosion\" at the Alloush family home, said relative Abdullah al-Najjar.\n\n\"When we arrived here, all the bodies were torn apart.\"\n\nVowing to stop Hamas militants from regrouping in already ravaged north Gaza, Israel on October 6 began a major air and ground assault.\n\nThe United Nations has described the area as \"under siege\", and Washington set a deadline of this coming week for Israel to get more aid in or face possible cuts to military assistance.\n\nAfter the Jabalia strike, Israel's military said it hit \"infrastructure\" in which militants were operating and \"posed a threat\" to troops.\n\nAnother strike on Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood killed five people, the civil defence agency said.\n\n- Israel claims pager blasts -\n\nIn Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli strike on Almat village north of Beirut killed 23 people including seven children.\n\n\"Under the rubble, there are only children, elderly men and women,\" Hezbollah lawmaker Raed Berro said, denying Israeli allegations that Hezbollah and weapons were embedded among civilians.\n\nThe ministry reported at least another 15 dead in strikes in the east as well as three Hezbollah-affiliated rescuers killed in the south, both areas where the Iran-backed group has a strong presence.\n\nWar monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that an Israeli strike on an apartment belonging to Hezbollah south of Damascus killed nine people, including a Hezbollah commander.\n\nIran's foreign ministry condemned the strike, calling for \"an arms embargo\" on Israel and its \"expulsion from the United Nations\".\n\nSince late September Israel has been engaged in a two-front war after turning its focus north towards Lebanon.\n\nIsrael admitted for the first time Sunday it was behind a wave of deadly attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in September.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"greenlighted the pager operation in Lebanon\" in which hundreds of devices exploded, killing nearly 40 people and wounding around 3,000, his spokesman said.\n\nThe operation preceded Israel's ongoing air and ground campaign in Lebanon, after almost a year of tit-for-tat exchanges of fire with Hezbollah, which said it was acting in support of Hamas.\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel which resulted in 1,206 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory campaign has killed 43,603 people in Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the UN considers reliable.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel's military said it intercepted two drones approaching from the east.

She is legally blind and her life is about to go through some further upheaval.When asked what worries her most, Simon paused for a moment, then took a deep breath. Simon answered, \"I will do whatever I can so that my eighth grader finishes her science homework. And, God bless, try to help her pass that French class too.\"Simon, 48, arrives in Washington Monday for orientation sessions near Capitol Hill having been elected as the new U.S. Congresswoman representing California's 12th District, which includes Oakland and Berkley. Simon, who counts Vice President Kamala Harris as a close mentor, served as a civil rights attorney and helped the victims of sex trafficking, will be sworn into office with the 119th Congress on Jan. 3, 2025. Simon is arriving in a Washington that is transfixed by the return of President-elect Donald Trump, his outsized personality and his pledges to overhaul the government and secure retribution against political enemies. But Simon and some of her new colleagues do not intend to go unnoticed — no matter which party controls the Congress or the White House.With her vision impaired, Simon has relied on public transportation and has a history of advocating to make mass transit more accessible to low-income people. She is embracing the opportunity to succeed Rep. Barbara Lee, a longtime progressive fixture in Washington who left office to pursue an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic party's nomination for U.S. Senate in California in 2024. Speaking to CBS News by phone while preparing for her first trip to Washington as an elected Congresswoman, Simon said she first must rebound from Harris's defeat in the Presidential race. \"I'm devastated. My mentor was the President we deserved. But Kamala would always say: 'Head up, roll up your sleeves, get to work.' So that's what I intend to do.\"Simon said she'll pursue roles with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, considering her background championing issues of mass transportation, and will seek out early leadership roles. Simon told CBS News it is important that there is diversity among the members of key panels. \"We must defend the values of not just our party, but the people of the United States, particularly me, as disabled people,\" she said. \"Also the elders, the folks who are seeking health care, queer kids. I have work to do.\"Simon and the dozens of others elected who were newly-elected to Congress on Tuesday face a more immediate hurdle: A tidal wave of life changes. For Simon, that includes moving her daughter to a new community midyear.\"As long as my seat is on the floor.. I won't complain\"For Tom Barrett, a military veteran who won a competitive race for a vacated seat in the Michigan 7th Congressional District, it has been impossible to simply open all of the text messages. Barrett told CBS News, \"I can't even tell you how many phone calls I've received in the last couple of days. I probably received 1,000 text messages just on election night. I haven't read them all.\"Barrett, a Michigan state senator from the Lansing area, bested a Democratic challenger in one of the most heated and expensive House races in the Midwest. Barrett said he is hesitant to make any demands of his new colleagues. \"I joked to House Speaker Mike Johnson that as long as my seat is on the floor — and not in the upper Gallery — I won't complain,\" Barrett said. \"I recognize that it is a significant job that has a lot of responsibility,\" Barrett said. But he appears poised to work comfortably in a Trump-dominated Washington. When asked for his top legislative and leadership priorities, Barrett uncorked a response that name-checked Trump six times. Barrett spoke of \"extending a lot of the provisions of the Trump tax cuts\", \"Helping the Trump Administration stem the flow of people over the border\" and restoring prior \"Trump policies.\"Barrett served as a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army in the Iraq War and said he'd be interested in a seat on the House Committee on Armed Services. But in the meantime, the Eaton County, Michigan, resident must find a different flight plan. He is spending time seeking the best weekly plan to trek by air to Washington, D.C. from either Lansing, Grand Rapids or Detroit.\"He's getting an apple juice; I'm getting a beer\"After an exhausting campaign in which he and his campaign volunteers touted that they knocked on 200,000 doors, Democrat Josh Riley said he was looking forward to one quiet, post-election night with his 4-year-old son. \"He's getting an apple juice, I'm getting a beer and we're going to watch a Cornell hockey game,\" Riley said. Riley won one of the most expensive House races in the nation, defeating first-term Republican Marc Molinaro in an 11-county swath of upstate New York, spanning from Cooperstown to Binghamton and the distant New York City exurbs.Arriving at a tumultuous moment in Washington, Riley said he will not try to compete with Trump or his powerful colleagues for a spotlight. Riley told CBS News, \"I'm not searching for a way to stand out. If I do this job successfully, people in upstate New York will have more job opportunities and good wages.\"Riley said he will take office with a high priority issue: Housing prices. \"One of the things I'd like to do,\" Riley said, \"Is stop the predatory practice of Wall Street entities running around upstate New York, gobbling up our single family homes and using them to extract profits. Housing should be looked at as a civil right, not as a driver of profits.\" Riley, an attorney and former Congressional aide, acknowledged his two-year term is expected to be spent in the minority party in the House. But with narrow margins, Riley talked of exploring joining a New York Republican's proposal for housing affordability.Eight FirehosesRob Bresnahan laughed a bit when he said, \"I'm drinking out of nothing less than eight firehoses right now.\" Bresnahan is getting his first taste of elected office, but beginning in the big leagues. \"It's starting to feel slightly more real,\" Bresnahan told CBS News, \"I never thought a kid from Butler Street in Wyoming, Pennsylvania would now be a member of Congress. I mean, it's, it's incredible.\"Bresnahan edged a veteran House Democrat to secure the seat representing the Scranton-area of Pennsylvania. He leads an electrical and construction business, while also working in real estate development. His introduction to politics included an unexpected stress: Bresnahan said his fiancée, a local television news anchor, worked as the same broadcast outlet on which his opponent aired attack ads against him. \"I give her so much credit for being able to, you know, watch the horrible things that were being said about me,\" Breshnahan said. Bresnahan was one of two Republicans to oust Democratic House incumbents in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Those victories gave Republicans an edge in securing a majority control of the House, which could turbocharge Trump's legislative agenda in 2025.Bresnahan told CBS News he'd seek a seat on the House's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \"I understand the significance of infrastructure and transportation, outside of traditional roads and bridges,\" he said. \"Airports, levies, ports, freight rail and power distribution systems and sewer systems, that is the foundation and the hierarchy of needs of a society. I really think I can make a tangible difference with just my history of what I've done.\"\"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time.\"Rob Mackenzie will arrive in Washington with a 7-month-old son, who was born just days before Mackenzie won the primary to secure the Republican nomination in Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District, in the Allentown-area. And Mackenzie will be bringing a rescue dog too. Mackenzie told CBS News that he and his wife \"are going to be loading up the SUV and going down and trying to find an apartment.\"But the new work begins quickly. Mackenzie said it is vital for Congress to move swiftly on the issues of inflation and border security championed by candidates, including Trump.After toppling incumbent Democrat Susan Wild in a heated battleground race that captured the attention of both parties, Mackenzie argued that bipartisan efforts hold the most promise of big change. \"If you want lasting change, you have to do it in a bipartisan fashion,\" he said. \"If you change something and it's unpalatable to the other side, they're just going to come and kick it out next time. And then the pendulum swings back and forth.\" Mackenzie, 42, is one of dozens of Members of Congress-elect who will represent politically-purple Congressional districts, in which the opposing party is likely to muster a well-funded challenger in 2026. He will begin his new job, with an immediate potential political target on his back. Mackenzie said his successful challenge to Wild was an expensive and grueling battle. \"In a close and competitive district, it was never going to be a blowout,\" he said. \"That's not the reality of this district. So we always knew it was going to be close, always competitive.\" Mackenzie has served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, focusing on financial services and banking issues, and would seek similar committee work next year in the House. The House Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are expected to play outsized roles, as Trump pursues new tax cuts, tariffs and campaign pledges to tackle inflation.\"National conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that\"Kristen McDonald Rivet capped her victorious election week with a Friday trek to a cellphone store. Her 15-year-old son needed a cellphone repair, which was joking referred to as a \"national emergency.\" The mother of six already repaired some of the damage her party suffered Tuesday. McDonald Rivet, a state legislator in Michigan, won a competitive race for Michigan's 8th Congressional District in the Flint-area. Trump prevailed in the 8th Congressional District and Democrats worried about their prospects there, because of the retirement of longtime Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, the latest in a family dynasty that's held the seat for decades.\"Here's the thing: My district voted for Donald Trump,\" McDonald Pivet told CBS News by phone, after returning from the cellphone store repair mission. \"There is a lot of national conversation about Trump-this and Trump-that. When we're working on things like prescription drugs, the cost of housing and lowering the cost of groceries, then I'm on board.I'm not going to get involved in the yelling and screaming and the stuff that makes politics awful.\"She paused a moment, relating to CBS News that it really is striking just how many groceries a 15-year-old son can consume. (She correctly fact-checked that the CBS News reporter's 14-year-old son was also prodigious at eating high volumes of food)McDonald Pivet arrives in Washington with years of experience in Michigan's state legislature in Lansing. \"I've spent my life working on issues, like creating economic security for families, particularly for kids. I started my career in Head Start. These issues are top of mind, including expansion of the child tax credit.\"119th CongressThe group of newly-elected US House members arrives at a generally unstable moment in Washington, but amid a rare spec of stability in the lower chamber. Leadership of House Republicans and House Democrats is expected to remain unscathed, after an expensive and heated election in which the margins in the House could emerge unchanged.Orientation sessions for new members of the House begin this week near Capitol Hill, with some of the newly-elected seeking living quarters and training sessions for their unique new jobs. Several of those who spoke with CBS News said they have spent their first days as an elected federal official working to find staff and constituent service experts.Bresnahan, the incoming freshman Representative from northeast Pennsylvania, is among those who must wind down — or find contingency plans – for private businesses back home. \"I'm also a real estate developer and am trying to figure out, y'know, who is going to assume my role here,\" he said. Bresnahan also has a post on the local SPCA board in Pennsylvania to navigate, as he simultaneously tries to learn to navigate the winding hallways and tunnels of Capitol Hill.As for Simon, who says she is shifting her daughter to a new school in advance of beginning a term in Congress, the juggling of her new career is already well underway. As a single mom, she's bearing an additional burden.Simon paused a few moments in silence, then told CBS News, \"Here's the deal: It's going to be a tough job. But there are single mothers who are barely making minimum wage. And they are making ends meet barely. I will figure it out.\"","summary":"There are a few new members-elect of Congress who do not intend to go unnoticed in the 119th Congress.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/119-congress-new-members/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/10/2fa2146c-d1ea-4d0f-9a60-d07bb4c32a23/thumbnail/1200x630/4e1b0ca235d84eafa0f3b6742bad21a3/image005.jpg?v=c1d30b1df13c40bf65c6c1e6d9ac4ad7","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3322776_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-11 00:00:01","author":"Scott Macfarlane","authors":["Scott Macfarlane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.084}]}
