Despite remarkable advances in language models and communication, human political dialogue remains inefficient, largely governed by power’s enduring romance with imperial trivialities of interest and identity.\n\nAs a result, two geopolitical flashpoints with memories of conflict—the Asia-Pacific and Eastern Europe— are strategically hyperactive. Until the turn of the twentieth century, both regions stood at the crossroads of empires: Imperial Japan and China in the East, and the Russian Tsars, Habsburgs, Ottomans, and Prussians across Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nIn September 2025, China’s 80th World War II anniversary parade at Tiananmen Square—10,000 troops backed by a $244.99 billion defense budget, two million PLA soldiers, three aircraft carriers, and a projected 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030—was read in Washington as a declaration of a new China-led trade and security architecture in the Indo-Pacific. The choreography and camaraderie among leaders from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea marked the beginning of a new declaratory phase in Beijing’s vision of Eurasian integration and a multipolar order.\n\nTwo days earlier, President Xi presented alternative global statesmanship at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, calling for a “more just and equitable global governance system.” Addressing leaders representing 43 percent of the world’s population and 23 percent of global GDP, Xi chose a city heavy with symbolism: Tianjin—a vital crossing point on the Grand Canal connecting the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, and a gateway to the Bohai Sea. It was the same city where the humiliating Treaty of Tientsin was signed in 1858 after the Second Opium War, forcing China to grant trade concessions to Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia.\n\nThe Tianjin message was clear: achieving strategic balance in the South and East China Seas is China’s inescapable national goal, and Taiwan is integral to this goal. It also signaled that, unlike Deng Xiaoping’s cautious and collegial China, Xi’s China is capable of asserting its historical worldview and defending its strategic assets, particularly its gateway waters. Today, nearly 80 percent of global trade is maritime. China handles about 40 percent of global container shipments, according to Ocean Network Express CEO Jeremy Nixon. Only 14 percent of Chinese shipments now go to the U.S.; 86 percent dock elsewhere.\n\nDonald Trump dismissed these developments as a “conspiracy against the US,” while Japan called Xi’s speech a “distorted version of history.” U.S. arms sales to its eastern alliance network have surged. China warned that aiding “Taiwan independence” would “bring fire” upon Washington after an $11 billion U.S. arms package—the largest ever for Taiwan—was approved under President Lai Ching-te’s $40 billion plan for asymmetric warfare.\n\nU.S. naval strategy views America as an Asian maritime power, with the Indo-Pacific as the pivot of 21st century geopolitics. Historically—from Commodore Matthew Perry’s opening of Japan in 1853 to wars in the Philippines, the Pacific front in World War II, and the Korean War—the U.S. Navy has a profound strategic memory of the Pacific, stronger than any other front outside its own blue-water extensions. Today, no issue commands more seriousness in Washington than Taiwan.\n\nMoreover, both the U.S. and China are the largest consumers of advanced logic chips. Taiwan, home to TSMC, sits at the chokepoint of the global semiconductor supply chain. It produces over 90 percent of the world’s most advanced chips and controls about 67 percent of the market share for nodes below seven nanometers. These chips are used everywhere: by Apple, NVIDIA, Lockheed Martin, and in Chinese fifth generation war jets and nuclear submarines. Microchips add another layer of intensity to the conflict.\n\nOne could argue that an all-out war between the two powers is not possible. Economic interdependence, globally connected stock markets, and complex supply systems make conflicts manageable. Others might also view Russia’s attack as a tool for managing internal legitimacy and succession problems, or see the U.S. acting to extract economic benefits—such as pressuring Taiwan, Korea, and Japan to buy its weapons, or leveraging Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt oil against the Siberian one. All of these points hold. Yet, applying anxious foresight for a moment, four clear and proven facts remain.\n\nFirst, human stupidity has no limits, as proved by World War I and its devastating legacy on the world’s maps, cultures, and politics. Second, while the land and sea available for contestation remain unchanged from 2,000 years ago, warfare has transformed. Armies no longer advance on chariots or steamboats; cyber warfare, hypersonic missiles, laser weapons, and fifth-generation jets have compressed geography and made battlespace more claustrophobic. Third, inorganic systems such as artificial intelligence have taken over critical military functions—making war more precise, yet strategically inconclusive over time, as seen in Iraq and Afghanistan. The last and important factor is that the UN-based, rule-bound institutional arbitration system has in recent years been eclipsed by the Shakespearean instincts of modern Caesars—“enthroned” at the doors of Washington, Beijing, Moscow, the Gulf, and Pyongyang.\n\nAmid this power politics, Europe’s post–Marshall Plan strategic honeymoon is also over. While war rhetoric in Europe carries a domestic counter-populist element, it also indicates Europeans’ genuine anxiety over protecting their trade-centered and value-driven integration project, which emerged after centuries of conflict and is now sandwiched between Russia and China to the east and a shift in U.S. security doctrine to the west. NATO Chief Mark Rutte’s observations—“What is happening in the Indo Pacific and what is happening in the Euro-Atlantic area is getting more and more connected and intertwined,” and that “China is the key enabler of Russia”—appeared a few weeks before EU countries agreed to allocate $105.5 billion in aid to Ukraine for 2026 and 2027. The German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, summed up the U.S. part by stating, “The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe.”\n\nFrom antiquity to the medieval world, moments when a rising power challenged an established order were rarely peaceful. The psychology of power resists voluntary retreat. The Persian and Roman empires expanded by dismantling earlier orders rather than accommodating them, just as the Ottoman Empire rose through the destruction of Byzantine authority. In modern history, the British Empire displaced earlier European maritime powers through sustained conflict. The gradual transition from British dominance to U.S. leadership remains a rare exception—shaped by shared institutions and strategic alignment.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has called Taiwan a “crisis of survival,” while the Chinese Foreign Ministry urges Japan to maintain its “defeated nation status” from World War II. Russia’s foreign minister invoked Catherine the Great while emphasizing Odesa’s importance, and Vladimir Putin warned Europe that a future war would not be “surgical” like Ukraine (but bloody like Tannenberg or Stalingrad). Meanwhile, France, Germany, and the Netherlands are creating new military services, the U.S. asserts naval power in the Caribbean in a post–Spanish-American War style, and Donald Trump views Greenland as a matter of “U.S. national security.” Taken together, these developments show that under pressure, power psychology returns—imperial for some, protective for others—placing position above norms during moments of transition.\n\nThe central question, then, is whether the United States can manage an operational accommodation with a rising China. Unlike Britain’s gradual accommodation of American power, the United States and China carry deep civilizational differences in cognition and worldview, compounded by the existentially critical disputes discussed above. For this reason, it is imperative that Washington and Beijing preserve at least a post–Cuban Missile Crisis–style strategic stability, lest rivalry slide into an abyss—where miscalculation, rather than intent, drives catastrophe, and where the abyss, when stared into too long, stares back with even greater terror.","summary":"Imagine, on one side, solar-powered AI satellites operating in deep space, with orbital internet feeding into ground robotics, going to…","url":"https://pakobserver.net/return-of-caesars-chips-memory-and-the-pacific/","image":"https://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/homocentric-climate-action-siberian-cranes-my-coffee-pakobserver-662189-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 01:01:04","author":"Syed Wajahat Ali","authors":["Syed Wajahat Ali"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.238},{"id":390433000,"title":"Morning Digest: Centre pre-publishes draft Rules for four Labour Codes; Government refutes Chinese, U.S. claims of third party mediation during Operation Sindoor, and more","text":"Centre pre-publishes draft Rules for four Labour Codes\n\nThe Union Labour Ministry has pre-published the draft Rules for the four Labour Codes on the Ministry’s website and the public has been given 45 days’ time to respond to the rules.

Last year, at the same time, the fiscal deficit had stood at 52.5% of the budgeted amount. The reason for this widening of the fiscal deficit at this point of time is because capital expenditure has grown significantly in the April-November 2025 period, while tax revenues have lagged.\n\nKhaleda Zia’s funeral: Jaishankar meets Tarique Rahman in Dhaka, hands over PM Modi’s condolence letter\n\nThe passing of Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia leaves an “irreplaceable void” but her “vision and legacy” will continue to nurture India-Bangladesh relations, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a letter that was handed over by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)’s Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman in Dhaka.

Officials said 17 remote villages located in the hilly Bhalessa area of Doda district, at an altitude of around 7,705 feet, are being covered under the training programme. The villagers are being trained in the use of high-calibre and self-loading rifles. Scores of men and women have enrolled as VDGs in the district.\n\nGig workers’ strike reveals intolerable working conditions\n\nOn New Year’s eve, one of the most lucrative days for app-based platforms, tens of thousands of platform workers across India chose to log out. For workers who live off daily earnings, shoulder debt, and have invested heavily in vehicles, fuel, and phones, this decision is not merely symbolic. It is existential. When workers struggling to meet basic needs give up a peak-demand day, it signals two clear things: how intolerable working conditions in the platform economy have become, and how heroic their collective act of resistance is. The strike signals the arrival of a conscious and organised platform workforce with a new commitment to take the fight for platform regulation head-on and sustain it in pursuit of rights, safety and dignity.\n\n26/11 hero Sadanand Date appointed as new DGP of Maharashtra; to take charge on January 3\n\nSadanand Vasant Date, a soft-spoken yet tough taskmaster and a decorated officer of the 26/11 terror attacks, was on Wednesday (December 31, 2025) appointed as the new Director General of Maharashtra Police (DGP).

Kyiv says Moscow has produced no evidence to support its allegations and that Russia invented the alleged attack to block progress at talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Officials in several Western countries ​have cast doubt on Russia’s version of events ⁠and questioned whether there was any attack.\n\nLatest deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 gets underway\n\nA deep-sea search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 began in the Indian Ocean, reviving efforts to solve one of aviation’s greatest mysteries more than a decade after the jet vanished with 239 people on board.

From Poonam Yadav to Vaishnavi Sharma, there have been several spinners that donned blue over the last few years. But there has been one bright smile that has remained a constant. Deepti Sharma’s smile lit up the Greenfield Stadium on Tuesday night after getting Sri Lanka’s Nilakshika Silva lbw.

The sanctions are an extension of the United States previous efforts to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Sanctions announced on Wednesday imposed new restrictions on four companies as well as their associated oil tankers that have been accused of facilitating the transportation of Venezuelan oil.\nThese vessels some of which are part of the shadow fleet serving Venezuela continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s illegitimate narco-terrorist regime. Maduro’s regime increasingly depends on a shadow fleet of worldwide vessels to facilitate sanctionable activity including sanctions evasion and to generate revenue for its destabilizing operations reads the press release published by the United States Department of the Treasury.\n“President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The press release added “The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump’s campaign of pressure on Maduro’s regime.”\nAccording to Trump Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is the leader of a Narco-terrorist Regime whose objective is to destabilise the United States.

(Hint: It's Not Related to Artificial Intelligence.)","text":"Predicting the next stock market crash is nearly impossible, so I wouldn't recommend that retail investors attempt to time the market. However, that doesn't mean investors shouldn't, at the very least, try to understand the challenges that stocks face in the near future, in order to best position their portfolios and make informed near-term decisions.\n\nThe stock market has seemed invincible over the past three years, with nothing able to bring it down for more than a temporary amount of time. However, such a strong run has many investors on edge, despite no imminent signs of a market crash. Here's the most likely cause of a crash in 2026, in my opinion -- and no, it is not related to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nWorry about inflation and rising yields\n\nWhile there are numerous factors that could harm the market, including the implosion of AI stocks or a sudden recession, I believe the most likely cause of a market crash will be higher inflation, which leads to higher bond yields.\n\nSince inflation surged in 2022, briefly peaking around 9%, the Federal Reserve has not been able to fully rein in consumer prices, despite making significant progress. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for November showed that inflation came in at around 2.7%, still materially above the Fed's preferred target of 2%. Many economists also believe the true number is likely higher, due to an incomplete CPI report resulting from the government shutdown.\n\nIt's also still unclear whether President Donald Trump's tariffs have been fully passed through to consumers. If you were to ask most consumers, I suspect many would say that prices still feel expensive, from food to housing. If inflation were to rise, that would be a problem for the Federal Reserve, especially with unemployment on the rise, since it potentially creates stagflation.\n\nIn this scenario, the Fed is put into a bind because interest rate moves would have conflicting results in the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. If the Fed lowers rates, it may help the labor market, but risks increasing inflation. If it raises rates, it may put a lid on inflation but risks further harm by hurting the labor market and slowing the economy.\n\nHigher inflation could also lead to higher bond yields. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bill currently yields around 4.12%, but investors have seen just how fragile the market can get when that yield approaches 4.5% or 5%. It would be equally concerning if yields suddenly surge while the Fed has been cutting rates.\n\nHigher yields not only lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and the government, but they also increase return thresholds for stocks because the cost of capital is higher. And many stocks already trade at elevated levels. Higher borrowing costs for the government also tend to spook bondholders, who worry that the government is losing control of its finances, especially with the country's current debt levels.\n\nPrepare for some volatility in 2026\n\nSome prominent Wall Street banks are expecting inflation to tick up in 2026. For instance, economists at JPMorgan Chase see inflation surpassing 3% in 2026 before falling to 2.4% by year's end. Economists at Bank of America also see inflation peaking at 3.1% and then coming back down to 2.8% by the end of 2026.\n\nIf inflation peaks and then shows clear signs of deceleration, then the market should be OK. However, inflation can be difficult to eliminate once it becomes high, as investors have seen in recent years. Consumers begin to get accustomed to high prices, and higher inflation can, to some extent, become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nInvestors should also remember that when the rate of inflation slows, prices are still rising, and the cost of living can still feel insurmountable for most.\n\nNobody knows what inflation will do in 2026, so, again, don't try to time the market. However, I do think that if inflation rises and yields follow, and if the surge does not turn out to be transitory, that could be the straw that breaks the market's back in 2026.","summary":"After three fantastic years of market gains, many investors are wondering if the rally will come to an end in 2026.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/31/the-most-likely-cause-of-a-stock-market-crash-in-2/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F848738%2Fvigilante-photo.jpg&w=1200&op=resize","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:50:00","author":"Bram Berkowitz","authors":["Bram Berkowitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":390433668,"title":"In New Year’s address, Putin says Russia believes in victory in Ukraine war","text":"Moscow, Jan 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday told soldiers fighting on the front lines that Moscow remains confident of prevailing in Ukraine, even as the conflict stretches into yet another year with no clear end in sight.\n\nIn a brief New Year address aired first in the Kamchatka peninsula, the easternmost Russian region to usher in 2026, Putin praised the troops engaged in the war as “heroes” and sought to project resolve after nearly four years of fighting, according to The Moscow Times.\n\nAddressing what he described as Russia’s “fighters and commanders”, the president said, “We believe in you and our victory.”\n\nThe message was broadcast as Russia marked its main public holiday against the backdrop of a protracted and costly conflict.\n\nThe war has exacted a heavy human toll, with military casualties on both sides believed to be in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands, while millions of Ukrainians have been displaced as a result of the fighting.\n\nPutin devoted most of his New Year remarks to the war effort, steering clear of any reference to allegations that Ukraine had attempted a drone attack on one of his residences, a claim that Kyiv has categorically denied.\n\nDecember 31 also marked 26 years since Putin first rose to power in Russia.\n\nAt the same time, diplomatic activity led by the United States has gathered pace in recent weeks.

The court’s conservative majority has allowed Trump to move ahead for now with banning transgender people from the military, clawing back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, moving aggressively on immigration and firing the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.\n\nThe court also handed Trump a few defeats over the last year, including in his push to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities.\n\nOther pivotal issues are ahead for the high court in 2026, including arguments over Trump’s push to end birthright citizenship and a ruling on whether he can unilaterally impose tariffs on hundreds of countries.\n\nRoberts’ letter contained few references to those issues. It opened with a history of the seminal 1776 pamphlet “Common Sense,” written by Thomas Paine, a “recent immigrant to Britain’s North American colonies,” and closed with Coolidge’s encouragement to “turn for solace” to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence “amid all the welter of partisan politics.”","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/31/supreme-court-annual-report/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Supreme_Court_Executive_Power_48620_590ef9.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:24:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":390432906,"title":"End of a standoff?: Trump backs away from deploying National Guard in LA, Chicago & Portland","text":"In an ongoing standoff, US President Donald Trump has backed away from his attempt to impose federal troops in law enforcement roles on Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.

Interestingly, this followed a rare rebuke from the US Supreme Court that blocked the White House from deploying troops in Illinois.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In the Wednesday post on his social media platform TruthSocial, the American leader attempted to paint the climbdown as temporary.

While Trump insists that the move is temporary, there seems little doubt that the latest move amounted to a retreat. Earlier on Wednesday, California Governor Gavin Newsom hailed the Justice Department’s decision not to pursue the case further. The department announced its intentions in a filing with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, backing away from its argument that Trump had a right to put state National Guard troops under his authority indefinitely.\n“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” Newsom wrote, right after the news came out.

Here are the winners as we continue our celebration of The Remmys.\n\nDistinguished Explanatory Reporting\n\nDonie O’Sullivan - CNN: The network’s designated extremism correspondent considered it extreme when social media platforms stopped using fact-checkers. He literally went to the extent of comparing the decision to the tragedy in California, daring to liken it to the first-responder firefighters in the Los Angeles area, and that lies were spreading like wildfire as a result. This takes tone-deaf obliviousness to a new low.Chris Matthews - MSNBC: While guesting on his former network, he lamented that tariffs would affect our ability to import wood supplies from Canada. He basically stated that we would suffer because lumber doesn’t just grow on trees.Mary Beth Sheridan - Washington Post: She looked into the “mysterious” drop in fentanyl seizures coming into the country in May, and speculated on several reasons. The 90 percent drop in border crossings was not considered a major factor.Erin Burnett - CNN: The hostess, while commenting on the Iran bombing mission, detailed her past experiences reporting in that country. She stated that when citizens were chanting “Death To America,” there was a “friendliness” to their threats. \n\nLawrence O’Donnell - MSNBC\n\nAfter President Trump brought troops into D.C. to tamp down on crime in the nation’s capital, Larry provided definitive proof for why they were not needed: He played a clip from the 1939 film, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington; the fact that no National Guard troops were in that fictional scene meant Trump was out of line.\n\nDISTINGUISHED LOCAL REPORTING\n\nDavid K. Li and Janhvi Bhojwani - NBC News: A Seattle resident claimed that the Blue Angels flying over her area was causing distress to her cat. She ended up suing the squadron, not for their oppressive flyovers, but because after hitting their social media accounts with profane, crazy cat lady posts, they blocked her account.Jessica Hill, Ricardo Torres-Cortez - Las Vegas Review-Journal: The Vegas paper was upset about the recent decision to rescind protected status for hundreds in the area. Citing that Honduran and Nicaraguan residents were now at risk of being sent back because of a threat to their temporary protected immgration status – after being here for 25 years. Nick Viviani - WPEC Channel 12 News: Governor Ron DeSantis announced he was creating a Florida version of DOGE, and dubbed it the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight, or FAFO. The local station declared this was a racist acronym because, in the past, it had been used by the group The Proud Boys, and therefore anyone now using it can be accused of white supremacy, or something like that.CBS News - Tallahassee: Authorities converged on a business where credit card fraud had been tracked down. The perpetrator was brought into custody, and it was somewhat disturbing for patrons, as the police body cams show them arresting Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nMarc Brown - ABC 7 LosAngeles\n\nWith the anti-deportation riots breaking out this summer, the press was somewhat eager to recalibrate the violence in support of the opposition. Marc was trying to suggest that law enforcement quelling the violence would actually provoke more, and he was straining to do so while live images of a car fire played on their feed. He described a genteel scene of neighbors commiserating, and there was no need for police. “It’s just a bunch of people having fun watching cars burn.”\n\nDISTINGUISHED INTERNATIONAL REPORTING\n\nBabar Dogar - Associated Press: As the drama swirled around DOGE cuts, the AP came up with an argument that showed how those cuts were needed. The funding being pulled might affect members of the Pakistani transgender community who attend cooking schools.Associated Press: A Swiss politician came under fire or “negligent unlawful import of weapons into Swiss territory without a permit\". He purchased a pair of pink water pistols for his grandchildren from Temu.Radio New Zealand: A crowd gathered for an event in the city of Wellington staged by entertainer Dan Boerman. He was performing a public display of his ability to fold a fitted bedsheet.Justin Dealey - BBC: The British broadcaster felt it was newsworthy that a man in Essex has a wife who wants him to divest from his collection. You probably will take her side once you learn he has gathered two dozen, fully-operational metropolitan buses.\n\nKatie Westwood - The Brussels Times\n\nCountries have gone full throttle on wind turbine energy production in the North Sea, with hundreds of these aeronautic eyesores littering the coastal waters. The Netherlands has a legitimate gripe with Belgium, according to one Dutch meteorologist, because its wind farms are popping up in areas ahead of Holland’s windmills. This is leading to him lodging a complaint: Belgium is guilty of stealing wind from the Netherlands. \n\nDISTINGUISHED BREAKING NEWS\n\nTom Costello - CNN: The year began with the press intent on blaming any and all airline calamities on President Trump and Transportation Secretary (DOT) Sean Duffy. So Tom Costello was there to say a Delta flight crashing upon landing was another one to blame on the administration, despite the event taking place in Toronto, CANADA.ABC News: When President Trump was making waves by portraying a speech by Hakeem Jeffries, with the House Minority Leader portrayed with a sombrero, ABC was on the case, informing us with a graphic that the animated headwear was AI-generated.Juliette Kayyem - CNN: Ms. Kayyem was very outraged to learn ICE agents were at Dodger Stadium, getting ready to detain workers and fans. It was then shown that they were Border Patrol agents, and they were only staging in the parking lot before leaving together to operate elsewhere. Ms. Kayyem became upset that DHS had not provided those details early enough to prevent her from looking so ridiculous.Kaitlan Collins - CNN: The White House correspondent claimed President Trump was avoiding the press because of poor economic numbers. Not only had he been readily available to the media all week but, minutes after Collins made that report, Trump then held a presser.\n\nJacob Soboroff - MSNBC\n\nWhen the second No Kings protest was held, there was a common thread seen from the variety of locations across the country. People, for no discernible reason, were out in costumes of various creatures, from frogs to dinosaurs. Despite the perplexing idiocy of this display, Soboroff rushed up to one to conduct his interview, mashing his microphone into a plastic muzzle to conduct a live interview with an inflatable pink unicorn.\n\nDISTINGUISHED INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM\n\nDrew Harwell - Washington Post: In a scalding expose, Harwell suggested Elon Musk uses an alternate account to cheat at video games.Sara Peach - Yale Climate Connections: Ms. Peach found some information that could toss Jeffrey Epstein in a negative light: He was possibly a climate denier.Ian Lee - CBS News: Ian drew up a dire effect emerging from the DOGE cuts to the Park Service – an uptick of bear attacks on visitors!Chiara Eisner - National Public Radio: Ms. Eisner excitedly reported on “government papers” she came across during the Alaskan Summit between President Trump and Pres. Vladimir Putin. We see her exposing sensitive information, such as the seating arrangement at the dinner and the menu items. What she detailed was an action report that is given to the press and accidentally left behind on the printer in the common business area of the hotel lobby. \n\nDaniel Boguslaw - Rolling Stone\n\nDan was excited about one of the Epstein emails selectively leaked by Congressional Democrats. He proclaimed culpability with one message where a female was set to meet Jeffrey Epstein at a residence, but said she would come in if Trump was there. This proof was blown into confetti because the self-proclaimed investigative journalist was unable to glean that at the time Trump was president, his whereabouts were detailed in the media, and Epstein was on another continent, while the president was in the panhandle of Florida.\n\nDISTINGUISHED NATIONAL REPORTING\n\nElizabeth Weise - USA Today: With the L.A. Riots in full swing there was this helpful lecture: It is not environmentally positive to set Waymo self-driving cars on fire.Nikki McCann Ramirez - Rolling Stone: The reporter committed conspiracy inception when the release of the Russian Collusion documents came from Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard. Ramirez says this does not disprove Russian involvement because Russia planted these documents in 2016 to disprove they were complicit…somehow.David Schechter - CBS News: We learn a dire effect taking place because of the government shutdown: It will affect ferret populations.Matt Guttman - ABC News: In reporting from Utah after the Charlie Kirk assassination, Matt delivered a sniper’s love story, detailing the affection the killer had for his lover.\n\nScott MacFarlane - CBS News\n\nIn an extreme example of Main Character Syndrome, MacFarlane explained he had PTSD from the Donald Trump assassination attempt because he came close to dying that day. He was not imperiled by the sniper, however. No, he nearly died at the hands of the Trump supporters in attendance. Yes, he seriously said this: “You could see it in their eyes – they were coming for us! And if he didn’t jump up with his fist, they were coming to kill us!” What - the - heck?!\n\nDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC SERVICE\n\nTeen Vogue – Time To Leave The Nest\n\nPublisher Conde Nast announced it would be ending the run of Teen Vogue, cutting the staff and folding the basis into the parent magazine. The laid-off staffers gave a protest and basically justified that the decision to cut ties was a smart move. After the decision, some staffers from other publications complained to management about the closure, and their obnoxiousness got them fired as well.\n\nThe Daily Beast - The Papal Chase\n\nFor some reason, this outlet was especially focused on Vatican activity involving Vice President JD Vance, and for that same reason, they consistently got things wrong. The outlet claimed that JD Vance broke a Vatican rule by taking pictures inside the Sistine Chapel, except the pics were taken by the White House photographer while they were on an official guided tour. In April, it claimed that Pope Francis refused to meet with JD Vance, and then, one day later, was shamed into reporting the two had a private meeting — but tried to say the Pope was critical of the vice president. Then it repeated this lie with the new Pope Leo, with a similar disqualifying follow-up. It ended the same way for the outlet.\n\nThe BBC – The Credibility Gap\n\nIt was a bad year for the British outlet. Early on, it was hung by a Gaza-based documentary about the children in the region. It claimed full credit for the production, but soon, it was revealed that it had been made by Hamas sympathizers and was eventually taken down. There were a number of Gaza reports that had to be corrected or revised. Then an internal report detailed a lengthy list of journalism problems, the biggest being how it deceptively edited Trump’s January 6 speech. This led to executives stepping down, and a lawsuit has been brought by the president.\n\nCNN - The Spin Doctors\n\nWhile it has always been the case that the networks — especially the cable nets — are available to assist Democrats in image repair, CNN was especially active in helping party members spin their problems late in the year. In rapid succession, we saw the network bring on Stacey Plaskett, Hakeem Jeffries, Jasmine Crockett, Ilhan Omar, Keith Ellison, and Mark Kelly to try to repair the controversies swirling around them, and the compliant network allowed them to filibuster to beat back criticisms.\n\nThe Miami Herald\n\nAfter the announcement this summer that Alligator Alcatraz would be opening in South Florida, there was a furor in the media. Of particular note was the Miami Herald, which began reporting on the complex in the weeks ahead of operations, and continued as detainees were brought in. The conditions were reportedly inhumane.\n\nThe paper thought it newsworthy when Democrats complained about the facility. It claimed one detainee was hospitalized when they had a minor injury that was tended to, and they were returned the same day. It errantly declared that children were being held inside the complex.\n\nIn one obsessive stretch, the Herald had produced 200 reports on Alligator Alcatraz within a period of less than one month.\n\nHappy New Year, readers!\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives. \n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.\n\nGuardsmen were removed from the streets of LA by December 15 after a court ruling. But an appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nReacting to the president’s announcement on Wednesday, Newsom wrote: “And with that, we close year 2025.

Gen. Michael Onoja, said the military would make its findings public after the assessment was completed.\n\n“On the United States strikes in conjunction with Nigerian forces, there is a process of battle damage assessment. We are still in that process, and I can assure you that once that is completed, we will communicate to the public all our observations. In due course, we will give you all the information that you require from the U.S.–Nigeria strikes,” Onoja said.\n\nResponding to questions on whether terrorists were present at the bombed locations, Onoja said intelligence reports confirmed their presence in the area before the strikes.\n\n“You know, terrorists are ubiquitous, and we cannot confine them to one location. Of course, there is evidence to show that they are in the Sahel. So we can also take it further given the proximity of the Sahel to Sokoto. Intelligence reports have also confirmed their presence there before those strikes were conducted against them. So, yes, they were there, because those strikes were based on intelligence reports.\n\nThey have confirmed their presence in those areas. The fact that it was not publicised is sometimes for operational security reasons,” he said.\n\nHe also said the military was monitoring the movement of terrorists outside the targeted locations and coordinating with field commanders to prevent their infiltration into communities.\n\nAccording to him, the armed forces are also engaging civilians to support security agencies with timely information.\n\n“We are monitoring them, and we are doing the necessary things, communicating with all the force commanders in the areas that we have identified as threat areas, so that they will prevent them from assimilating into the community and causing further havoc. And as time goes on, you will hear about all the activities that we are doing. You know, it’s important that while we are acting, we keep it confidential. With time, I will call you here and brief you about all the things that we are doing.\n\n“Also, we are mobilising the civilian population so that they will be vigilant and give information to the military and other security agencies, so that any issue of insecurity or any movement of these terrorists can be acted on quickly.\n\n“The truth is that security or insecurity can only be addressed through the cooperation of every member of society. It’s called the whole-of-society approach,” he said.\n\nOnoja also appealed to persons who may have taken possession of ammunition or fragments from the operation to return them to security agencies for safe recovery.\n\n“We don’t expect anybody to take away those materials… they should return them to the military or security divisions so that we can disarm those things before they cause greater damage,” he said. \n\nCommenting on criticisms of the joint strikes, the defence spokesman said it was not the role of the Armed Forces to respond to every public statement and that relevant agencies were responsible for addressing such concerns.\n\n“Every agency has its functions. It is not for the Armed Forces to focus on what some people in society do not agree with in our activities. Ours is to focus on our kinetic operations and, as much as possible, conduct non-kinetic operations when necessary. I believe that there are relevant agencies who are tasked to consider such statements if they are against or for the country.

But fatigue, he made clear, would not translate into surrender..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}“What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No,” Zelenskyy said, dressed in a dark green embroidered Ukrainian shirt. “We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine.”UKRAINE RULES OUT SURRENDERSeated at his desk, Zelenskyy acknowledged the toll the war has taken on the country. “Are we tired? Very,” he said. “Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken.”Zelenskyy warned that any agreement lacking firm guarantees would only prolong the conflict. “Any signature placed on weak agreements only fuels the war,” he said. “My signature will be placed on a strong agreement.”He said current diplomatic efforts were focused on securing a lasting settlement. “That is exactly what every meeting, every phone call, every decision is about now,” Zelenskyy said. “To secure a strong peace — not for a day, a week or two months, but peace for years.”The Ukrainian leader said weeks of US-led diplomacy, including talks last weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida, had brought negotiations close to completion. “A peace agreement is 90 per cent ready,” he said. “That 10 per cent contains everything. It will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe.”The unresolved territory remains the key issue.Russia currently occupies about 19 per cent of Ukraine, mainly in the south and east. Moscow wants Kyiv to withdraw from parts of the eastern Donbas region that Russian forces have failed to fully capture.Ukraine, by contrast, wants front lines frozen where they are. Zelenskyy dismissed Russian demands for a full Ukrainian withdrawal from Donbas as “deception.”“Does anyone still believe them? Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “Because too often the truth is avoided and called diplomacy when in fact it is simply lies dressed up in business suits.”PUTIN VOWS RUSSIA WILL PREVAILMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also struck a familiar wartime note in his New Year address, telling soldiers on the front lines that Moscow still believes it will prevail in Ukraine -- even as the conflict drags into another year.\"We believe in you and our victory,\" he said, addressing Russia’s \"fighters and commanders\".Putin devoted most of his remarks to the war effort, avoiding any mention of Ukraine’s alleged drone attack on one of his residences -- a claim Kyiv has denied. December 31 also marked 26 years since Putin first came to power.Earlier, Russia released the video of a downed drone that it said was one of 91 Ukrainian drones involved in an alleged attack this week on a Putin residence in northwestern Russia, a claim Kyiv has denied as a “lie.”- EndsWith inputs from agenciesPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Jan 1, 2026Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/ukraine-peace-deal-zelenskyy-rejects-weak-agreements-putin-vows-victory-glbs-2844885-2026-01-01","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202601/zelenskyy-013221798-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=8HMtJ3R3u7zl62PCwyQdUVXKn5MWgLG_?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:17:53","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":390430682,"title":"Daily World Briefing, Jan. 1","text":"Xi says China ready to work with all countries to advance world peace, development\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday said China is ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development.\n\nIn his 2026 New Year message, Xi said over the past year China continued to embrace the world with open arms.\n\nTo better address climate change, China announced new Nationally Determined Contributions, Xi said, adding that after announcing the three global initiatives on development, security, and civilization, he put forward the Global Governance Initiative to promote a more just and equitable global governance system.\n\n\"China always stands on the right side of history,\" Xi said.\n\nBulgaria enters eurozone\n\nBulgaria joined the eurozone and adopted the euro as its currency on New Year's Day, becoming the 21st eurozone member.\n\nDuring the month of January, the Bulgarian lev (BGN) will continue to circulate.

We have no income, no money,” al-Masri told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Only a few medical points remain. This makes the situation extremely difficult and will lead to a catastrophe for the injured and the wounded. Even ordinary people who come seeking treatment will face severe hardship.”\n\nIsrael is moving to revoke the licences of 37 international NGOs, including Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF), as it pushes to demonise organisations that assist Palestinians, among them United Nations agencies, with unproven accusations of links to Hamas.\n\nIsrael said the ban, which starts on Thursday and also includes the Norwegian Refugee Council, CARE International, and the International Rescue Committee, among other groups, stems from new regulations that require aid organisations to reveal details about their staff and work.\n\n“Even with the presence of humanitarian organisations, the situation is already tragic,” Gaza resident Ramzi Abu al-Neel told Al Jazeera.\n\n“If their support and presence are removed, God knows what will happen. Many children will die, and lives will be destroyed, and many families will be devastated by this decision.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the foreign ministers of 10 countries – including Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom – released a joint statement urging Israel to ensure that international NGOs “are able to operate in Gaza in a sustained and predictable way”.\n\n“Any attempt to stem their ability to operate is unacceptable. Without them it will be impossible to meet all urgent needs at the scale required,” it said.\n\nDespite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to kill Palestinians in Gaza and impose restrictions on the entry of aid and basic goods to the enclave, including temporary housing.\n\nWith most of Gaza turned to rubble, more than one million people have faced harsh winter weather while living in makeshift tents. And in the absence of economic activity amid the destruction, Gaza’s population remains heavily dependent on international aid.\n\n“Most people rely entirely on the assistance that comes from international organisations,” Abdullah al-Hawajri, a displaced Palestinian in Khan Younis, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) also decried Israel’s move, saying it is “further compromising the humanitarian operation” in crisis-stricken Gaza.\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said the Israeli decision sets a “dangerous precedent”.\n\n“Failing to push back against attempts to control the work of aid organisations will further undermine the basic humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence, impartiality and humanity underpinning aid work across the world,” Lazzarini said in a statement.\n\nIn 2025, Israel approved several measures to ban UNRWA – a vital facilitator for aid and vital services in Gaza – and curtail its work.\n\nLazzarini said the latest decision against aid groups is “part of a troubling pattern of disregard for international humanitarian law and increasing impediments to aid operations”.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel killed about 500 aid workers and volunteers during its two-year genocidal war, as it imposed a suffocating blockade on the enclave, triggering a deadly famine.\n\nThe Israeli ban appears to violate the ceasefire agreement and US President Donald Trump’s “20-point peace plan”.\n\n“Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,” Trump’s plan says.\n\nMany of the groups facing the ban are part of the established, UN-backed mechanism for aid distribution.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/palestinians-in-gaza-say-lives-will-be-destroyed-by-israels-ngo-ban/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-12T074606Z_1609265020_RC2TEIA36LI7_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1767203208-Ukt0av.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:06:06","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":390431916,"title":"Trump says ‘removing’ National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland  - St. Vincent Tribune – Daily","text":"United States President Donald Trump announced he is ceasing his efforts to deploy federal troops to several Democratic-led cities in a major policy pivot.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday comes amid a series of legal setbacks to Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard members to Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said he’s “removing” the National Guard from those cities, although their deployment was already mostly limited by lower courts.\n\n“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” he said.\n\nDespite the claim, the National Guard has been barred from taking direct part in law enforcement, which remains illegal under US law. Trump had not invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows presidents to deploy troops domestically when “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” against the federal government make it “impracticable to enforce” US law “by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings”.\n\nBecause of that, troops deployed in or around Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago had been largely tasked with guarding federal buildings and offering support services to immigration enforcement.\n\nAbout 300 National Guard members remained under federal control in both Los Angeles and Chicago at the time of Trump’s announcement, with 200 more in Portland.\n\nSince first deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles to respond to protests against mass immigration enforcement sweeps, Trump has repeatedly claimed major cities across the US have been plagued by overlapping crime and immigration crises.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of taking part in dangerous political theatre to target opponents.\n\nThe president’s move comes amid a series of legal setbacks, topped last week by a Supreme Court order keeping in place a lower court’s ruling barring the president from deploying the National Guard to Chicago.\n\nWhile members of the federal military, National Guard troops are typically deployed at the request of state governors. Presidents can unilaterally deploy the National Guard, but only in instances when other federal agents can no longer execute the law.\n\nThe majority of Supreme Court justices ruled Trump has not yet met that threshold, dealing a major blow to the administration’s justification for similar deployments across the country.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Department of Justice lawyers in California withdrew a request to keep troops in the state under federal control as they appealed a lower court’s ruling. That ruling by US District Judge Charles Breyer said the troops must be returned to state control.\n\nIn a post on X, the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and top Trump critic, said the “admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end”.\n\nNewsom and his staff “look forward” to a more lasting court ruling on the issue.\n\nFor his part, Trump, in his Truth Social post, said he would not hesitate to redeploy troops.\n\n“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!” he said.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/trump-says-removing-national-guard-from-chicago-los-angeles-and-portland/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/reuters_69559a76-1767217782-kuiCml.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:06:04","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":0.014},{"id":390435836,"title":"US imposes sanctions on 4 Venezuelan oil firms and 4 more tankers in Maduro crackdown","text":"By FATIMA HUSSEIN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four firms operating in Venezuela’s oil sector and designated four additional oil tankers, which the U.S. accuses of being part of a shadow fleet serving Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s government, as blocked property.\n\nThe action is part of the Trump administration’s monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro.

With the Kremlin issuing stark cautions and Kyiv pushing security guarantees, Washington’s silence now fuels uncertainty as regional tensions mount and diplomatic stakes rise sharply worldwide.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/us-troops-in-ukraine-will-zelenskys-bombshell-claim-as-putin-roars/videoshow/126280883.cms","image":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-126280883/126280883.jpg?resizemode=4","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-01 00:00:00","author":"Timesofindia.com","authors":["Timesofindia.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":390433210,"title":"US imposes new sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector","text":"Washington, DC [US], January 1 (ANI): The United States Department of the Treasury on Wednesday (local time) imposed sanctions on four companies operating in Venezuela's oil sector and identified four oil tankers as blocked property, according to an official release. \n\nThe move is part of President Donald Trump's renewed efforts to increase pressure on the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. \n\nThe sanctions announced on Wednesday are aimed at four companies and their linked oil tankers, which are accused of being involved in the transport of Venezuelan oil.\n\n'President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs,' Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said in a release.\n\n'The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump's campaign of pressure on Maduro's regime,' the release read. \n\nTrump has alleged that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro heads what he describes as a 'narco-terrorist' regime aimed at destabilising the United States, a claim that was reiterated in the latest sanctions announcement.\n\nAs per the official notice, these vessels, some of which are part of the shadow fleet serving Venezuela, continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro's illegitimate narco-terrorist regime.\n\n'Maduro's regime increasingly depends on a shadow fleet of worldwide vessels to facilitate sanctionable activity, including sanctions evasion, and to generate revenue for its destabilising operations.

I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.” \n\n “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f*** yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney added. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nClooney and Trump have long traded criticisms and commentary in public.\n\nThis summer, Clooney whose stage adaptation this year of his film Good Night, And Good Luck made pointed commentary about contemporary media and politics, said “everybody” worries about being targeted by Trump’s administration.\n\n“But you know, if you spend your life worrying about things, then you won’t do things,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. \n\n“I want to be able to look at my kids in the eye and say where we stood and what we did at certain times in history, and I have no problem with that,” he added.\n\nTrump, for his part, regularly trashes his old friend Clooney.\n\nThe president fumed after Clooney gave a 60 Minutes interview earlier this year, claiming that the “failed political pundit” dumped former President Joe Biden “like a dog.”\n\nLast year, after the Biden incident, Trump accused Clooney of being a “very disloyal backstabber” and a “third-rate movie actor.”\n\nClooney is among the highest-grossing movie stars in the country, and his films have raked in over $2 billion over the course of his career.\n\nHe has won three Golden Globes and two Academy Awards.","summary":"The president has long criticized Clooney, an outspoken liberal activist and supporter of the Democratic Party","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-george-clooney-france-cbs-b2892967.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/05/13/31/George-Clooney.jpeg?crop=2788.5,1859,x102.8,y0&trim=0,103,0,102&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WwoB6jPp-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:55:58","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.243},{"id":390428402,"title":"Met Office issues snow warning for London as New Year brings Arctic freeze that has sent temperatures plummeting to -10C","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nDonald Trump\n\nPolitics Newsletter\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Dec 31st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtist murdered at $2m home on millionaires' island 'by son, 45,' during bloodbath that saw her younger disabled son and second woman killed at nearby $1m house\n\nBibi, Laura Loomer and a pair of Netflix stars top the glitzy guest list at Donald Trump's MAGA New Year's Eve\n\nUS military conducts strikes on THREE more narco-terror boats in waters off South America\n\n'Super' virus spreading uncontrollably... as New York sees most flu cases ever and experts warn 'we don't know when it will stop'\n\nShe wore the ultimate revenge dress after their brutal break up.

Widespread and locally severe frosts are expected, along with the first snow of the winter for many.\n'A yellow warning for snow and ice has been issued for northern Scotland on New Year's Day and beyond, where frequent and heavy snow showers may lead to some travel disruption.\n\nView gallery\n\nFishermen by the RSC Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire yesterday \n\nView gallery\n\nRowers on the river Avon in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire on Tuesday \n\nView gallery\n\nPeople walk across a bridge by flying seagulls in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire\n'These colder conditions and wintry hazards - snow, ice and strong winds - will develop more widely as we enter the new year, with more warnings for snow and ice likely.\n'It looks like this cold spell will last through at least the first week of January, so it's important people keep up to date with the latest forecast and warnings.'\nThe UKHSA said the UK may also see 'impacts on younger people' and there will likely be an 'increase in demand for health services' across the regions.\nOther impacts include 'temperatures inside places like hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks', and 'challenges keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C leading to more risk to vulnerable people', the UKHSA said.\nEdinburghLondonMet Office\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMet Office issues snow warning for London as New Year brings Arctic freeze that has sent temperatures plummeting to -10C\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nArtist murdered at $2m home on millionaires' island 'by son, 45,' during bloodbath that saw her younger disabled son and second woman killed at nearby $1m house\n\nBibi, Laura Loomer and a pair of Netflix stars top the glitzy guest list at Donald Trump's MAGA New Year's Eve\n\nThe 'sucker punch to the gut' Britney Spears dealt her family over Christmas: Insiders reveal why there's still 'hope of reconciliation' after THAT Instagram post\n\nDaily Mail graphic reveals the bottled waters with the most cancer-causing 'forever chemicals'\n\nBehind-the-scenes snaps from Kimberly Guilfoyle's glamorous magazine cover shoot look VERY different than the published photos\n\nWhy we are crushing on retro!

Anyone who ⁠thinks so is deeply mistaken.”\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said any signature “placed on weak agreements only fuel the war.”\n\n“My signature will be placed on a strong agreement. And that is exactly what every meeting, every ‌phone call, every decision is about now,” he said. “To secure ‌a strong peace for everyone, not for a day, a week or two months, but peace for ‍years.”\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said weeks of U.S.-led diplomacy, including his talks last weekend with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida, had produced a peace ‍deal that was nearly ready.\n\n“A peace agreement is 90% ready, 10% remains,” he said. “That 10% contains everything, it is the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe and how people will live.”\n\nThe main stumbling block to completing a deal is the issue of who will control what parts of Ukraine’s territory.\n\nRussia holds about 19% of Ukraine’s territory ⁠in the south and east, but Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from parts of the eastern ​Donbas region that Moscow’s forces have failed to capture.\n\nKyiv wants the map ⁠frozen at the current battle lines, and Mr. Zelenskyy dismissed as “deception” Russian demands for a complete withdrawal from Donbas.\n\n“Does anyone still believe them? Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “Because too often the truth is avoided and called diplomacy when in fact it is ⁠simply lies dressed up in business suits.”","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zelenskyy-says-he-wont-sign-weak-deal-that-will-only-prolong-war/article70458589.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ue1mce/article70459230.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Ukraine_00545.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:43:58","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":390429194,"title":"U.S. carries out more strikes on alleged drug boats, killing 3","text":"WASHINGTON — The U.S. military said Wednesday that it had carried out \"lethal\" strikes against three suspected drug boats, killing three people. \"On Dec. 30, at the direction of @SecWar Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted kinetic strikes against three narco-trafficking vessels traveling as a convoy,\" U.S. Southern Command said on X, alleging that narcotics were transferred between the vessels before the strikes. \"Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement,\" Southern Command said. \"The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels.\" The exact location of the strikes was not specified, nor was it clear from the statement how many people were aboard the two other vessels before they were struck. The statement added that the U.S. Coast Guard was notified after the strikes to activate its search-and-rescue operations. NBC News has reached out to the Pentagon for more details. The U.S. has carried out at least 30 known strikes since September on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, killing more than 100 people. President Donald Trump in recent months has ramped up U.S. military presence in the region, as well as his rhetoric toward countries like Venezuela and Colombia. In the past week, Trump said, the U.S. \"knocked out\" a facility tied to Venezuela. “We just knocked out — I don’t know if you read or you saw — they have a big plant or big facility where they send the, you know, where the ships come from,” Trump told WABC radio of New York City in an interview Friday. Trump has argued that the strikes on vessels are helping prevent the trafficking of narcotics into the U.S. and that the Venezuelan government is using oil revenue to finance \"drug terrorism.\" In a Dec. 18 phone interview with NBC News, Trump declined to rule out a war with Venezuela. Earlier in the month, he ordered a blockade of “sanctioned oil tankers” to and from the country. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department sanctioned four companies over operations in Venezuela’s oil sector.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-carries-strikes-alleged-drug-boats-killing-3-rcna251754","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251231-pete-hegseth-ew-503p-07103a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:39:43","author":"Mosheh Gains","authors":["Mosheh Gains"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":390423904,"title":"‘Explosive’ prediction for world’s A-list","text":"An international intuitive astrologer and numerologist with two decades of experience, Tameera has made a career forecasting the futures of famous and non-famous folk alike. \n\nNow, she’s turned her celestial talents to the world of film, music, and politics to reveal who’s destined for love, loss, and career-defining moments in the year ahead.\n\nDonald Trump: bolder and bigger than ever\n\nBorn June 14, 1946, Queens New York – Sun in Gemini, Moon in Sagittarius (born on a full moon), Mercury in Cancer, Leo Rising\n\nNever far from the headlines, US President Donald Trump concluded 2025 amid intense political and legal battles, continuing to assert his influence through bold public statements on everything from the military to AI regulation. \n\nThe current president’s career remains as volatile as ever, and according to the stars, 2026 will be defined by an unexpected and shocking reinvention.\n\n“Donald Trump enters 2026 under one of the most volatile and defining cycles of his lifetime, with Uranus activating the peak of his chart,” Tameera cautioned. \n\nShe believes this celestial alignment will push his public image and career into unexpected territory. \n\n“This is the kind of influence that rewrites headlines overnight, forcing him into new territory – be it through a major legal twist, a repositioning of power, or a dramatic shift in alliances. His Gemini stellium thrives on disruption, so he’s likely to use any shake-up to his advantage.”\n\nTameera emphasises the intensity of the mid-year astrological movements and their impact on Trump. “From August 2026 Jupiter meets Pluto in Leo. For Trump, this will supercharge his drive and amplify his influence.\n\n“Expect bold moves, louder statements, and a renewed push for leadership. However, the same force that elevates the President can also magnify conflict if handled forcefully. As Jupiter aligns with Saturn into mid-2026, Trump may lean into discipline, structure, and strategic comebacks.\n\n“Overall, 2026 marks a reinvention year — surprising, polarising, and undeniably impactful on a global scale.”\n\nTaylor Swift & Travis Kelce: commitment under pressure\n\nTaylor Swift: Born Dec 13, 1989, Pennsylvania — Sun in Sagittarius, Moon in Cancer, Mercury in Capricorn, Scorpio Rising Travis Kelce: Born October 5, 1989, Westlake Ohio — Sun in Libra, Moon in Sagittarius, Mercury Conjunct Rising in Virgo.\n\nThe world’s most-watched couple, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, closed out 2025 celebrating their engagement, with reports swirling that their planned intimate wedding had suddenly shifted to a much larger, celebrity-filled event in early 2026.\n\nAfter a whirlwind couple of years dominated by the Eras Tour and NFL milestones, Tameera’s reading suggests 2026 is where they move into their most serious, permanent chapter yet.\n\nTameera reveals that 2026 is a defining year for Swift, with the South Node (past influences) crossing her Midheaven (career) from February to June. \n\n“Taylor steps into a major life transition that blends career success with a deeply personal turning point. This is a period of release, renewal and rebalancing — often linked with a shift in public direction so she can prioritise home, family or a destined private milestone.”\n\nFor the couple, the biggest surprises will be in their relationship, with Tameera noting a major shift: “Uranus shaking Taylor’s 7th house of relationships brings surprise developments, but not necessarily instability. This is Taylor choosing authenticity over image, which could also involve a surprise pregnancy.”\n\nFor Kelce, Tameera sees a serious commitment: “Saturn moving through his 7th house signals commitment, responsibility, and long-term decision-making. It is a transit often seen during engagements, marriages, or when redefining relationship foundations.\n\n“Together, 2026 is a year of ‘next level’ choices — and a relationship that grows stronger under pressure for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.”\n\nKate Middleton: a return to purpose and power\n\nBorn Jan 9, 1982, Reading UK — Sun in Capricorn, Moon in Cancer, Mercury and Venus in Aquarius, Leo Rising\n\nThe Princess of Wales continues to make global headlines, first with the shock of her cancer diagnosis in 2024, followed by her inspiring return to public duties in 2025, which saw her deliver her first major public speech in two years. This return has signalled a slow, deliberate, and powerful recalibration of her public image.\n\nAccording to Tameera, 2026 marks the true launch of this new, revitalised era. \n\n“Kate enters 2026 in a One Personal Year in numerology, which is a powerful cycle of new beginnings following a necessary period of release and healing,” Tameera explained. \n\nShe notes that the expansive planet Jupiter is crossing the Princess’s Cancer Moon until May: “This is a restorative influence, highlighting healing, renewed stability and a more visible return to her charitable passions. It may also signal joyful family news or a shift in her home environment as comfort becomes a priority.”\n\nThe Princess is also heading for a huge astrological turning point, with Tameera predicting a rare, once-in-a-lifetime transit: “Pluto, the planet of transformation, is set to conjunct her Mercury, the planet of communication. This will sharpen her voice and perspective, ensuring the Princess emerges more empowered, articulate, and influential than before. This period marks the beginning of a transformative era for how she communicates and leads.”\n\nElon Musk: empire builder turns philosopher\n\nBorn June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa — Sun & Mercury in Cancer, Moon in Virgo, Aries Rising\n\nElon Musk spent 2025 maintaining his position as the ultimate disrupter, pushing his AI company xAI to a massive valuation and making further bold predictions about a future where work becomes “optional” due to advanced robotics.\n\nHowever, behind the public spectacle, Tameera revealed his chart shows a profound internal shift coming in the year ahead.\n\n“2026 is a landmark year for Elon Musk with three rare life cycles converging at once,” she said. “The most significant is from late March, when Saturn crosses his Aries Ascendant. This mirrors his pivotal age 26–27 turning point when he took the risk that made him a multi-millionaire. Once again, he’s entering a period that demands discipline, strategic decisions and a reshaping of his public identity.\n\n“Moves made now have long-term consequences.”\n\nTameera also highlights a major financial shake-up: “From April to July 2026, Uranus (change) conjunct Saturn (structure) shakes Elon’s financial foundations, propelling him toward innovation but also sudden shifts in security, business structures and resources. It’s disruptive — but ultimately liberating.” The true story, Tameera concluded, is the internal one: “Behind the headlines, 2026 transforms Elon from the inside out.”\n\nLady Gaga: a once-in-a-lifetime surge\n\nBorn 28 March 1986, Manhattan — Sun & Venus in Aries, Moon in Scorpio, Mercury in Pisces, Gemini Ascendant\n\nLady Gaga spent 2025 continuing her reign as a cultural innovator and releasing new music that saw her score a Grammy win. She has consistently balanced blockbuster pop success with mature, screen work, and Tameera predicts 2026 is set to bring her biggest career moment since her breakthrough.\n\n“Lady Gaga enters one of the most powerful career years of her life,” predicted Tameera. “Chiron conjunct Venus brings emotional healing and deeper connection in her personal life. Old relationship wounds soften, and a meaningful partnership or reconnection becomes possible.”\n\nThe massive career shift, however, is driven by a once-in-18-years surge of opportunity: “The North Node aligning with Jupiter to May, echoes the cycle that launched The Fame at age 22,” Tameera said. “This is a surge of opportunity: awards, global acclaim, career expansion and headline-making achievements.”\n\nThe professional evolution is cemented as the North Node crosses her Midheaven from May to July, signalling a project that will define her next era. This year, Gaga steps into her most mature and influential chapter yet!”\n\nNicole Kidman & Keith Urban: reclaiming independence\n\nNicole Kidman: Born 20 June 1967, Hawaii — Sun conjunct Ascendant in Gemini, Moon in Sagittarius, Mercury in Cancer, Venus in Leo\n\nKeith Urban: Born 26 October 1967, New Zealand — Sun & Mercury in Scorpio, Moon in Leo, Venus in Virgo\n\nAfter nearly 20 years as one of Hollywood’s most admired couples, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban shocked fans in late 2025 when news broke that Kidman had filed for divorce following a quiet separation. \n\nThe split, reportedly marked by feelings of betrayal and a new romance for Urban, ends a two-decade love story, and Tameera confirms that 2026 is a difficult, but necessary, year of restructuring for both stars.\n\n“Nicole and Keith re-enter their Saturn Return in Aries from February, a once-every-29-years cycle that restructures life from the ground up,” Tameera explained.\n\n“Saturn Returns force major decisions about identity and long-term purpose. For both, 2026 is a year of redefining who they are on their own terms.”\n\nDespite the personal turmoil, Kidman’s career is set for a boost, said Tameera. \n\n“Her Jupiter–Mercury transit in Cancer through May 2026 boosts her visibility, brings favourable press, and elevates her voice professionally. Expect new roles, brand success, and strong public support.”\n\nFor Urban, Tameera sees a similar path of rebuilding: “Keith moves into a one personal numerology year, beginning a brand-new cycle after a major year of endings. This is a time of rebuilding, fresh direction, and reclaiming independence.\n\nBut for both, 2026 marks the beginning of their next chapters — separate, stronger and more aligned with who they are becoming.”\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham: purpose and legacy\n\nDavid Beckham: Born 2 May 1975, London — Sun & Mercury in Taurus, Moon in Capricorn, Taurus Rising\n\nVictoria Beckham: Born 17 April 1974, Harlow — Sun & Mercury in Aries, Moon in Aquarius, Cancer Rising\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham continue to operate as a unified global brand, with the Spice Girl’s fashion and beauty empire seeing remarkable revenue growth through 2025, even as the couple make headlines with reports of family feuds.\n\n“The Beckhams head into 2026 with powerful, once-in-a-lifetime shifts unfolding behind their polished public image,” predicted Tameera. “For David, the year is quietly profound — his Chiron Return and Uranus over his Taurus Ascendant shake him out of old patterns, prompting emotional honesty, reinvention, and a freer way of living. As Uranus hits his South Node and Saturn joins Jupiter from mid-2026 into 2027, he lets go of the past and focuses on legacy, purpose and what truly matters.”\n\nFor Victoria, the first half of 2026 is a major turning point in her brand’s narrative: “The North Node in Pisces activates her Venus and Midheaven,” she explained. “A clear signature for new collections, awards, influential partnerships, and global recognition\n\n“With Saturn on her Sun, she becomes more authentic and strategic, making serious long-term decisions about her brand and public voice. Together, they evolve – not just as a power couple, but as two individuals entering a more purposeful, mature chapter.”\n\nSabrina Carpenter: the metamorphosis transit\n\nBorn 11 May 1999, Pennsylvania — Sun & Mercury in Taurus, Moon conjunct Ascendant in Pisces\n\nPop sensation Sabrina Carpenter is coming off a massive period of creative output, including two chart-topping albums and multiple number-one singles.\n\nTameera suggested her career momentum is far from peaking, with 2026 set to cement her status as a global pop powerhouse.\n\n“Sabrina Carpenter enters 2026 in full ascent,” Tameera stated, pointing out that her natal Taurus chart gives her lifelong staying power and commercial magnetism. “When Sabrina speaks or sings, her words land with grounded confidence and emotional weight.”\n\nThe key to this evolution, according to the numerologist, is an intense inner-shift due to a Pluto conjunction with Neptune, igniting a “metamorphosis transit.”\n\n“She may question old beliefs or feel pulled toward more meaningful, introspective creative work,” she said. “This transit is intense, transformative and ultimately liberating leading to richer artistry and a stronger sense of self.”\n\nThe financial stars also align perfectly on her birthday: “On May 11, 2026, Sabrina enters an 8 Personal Year, activating her 8 Life Path. This brings abundance, power moves, and major career elevation. Expect bolder projects and a strategic expansion of her brand. 2026 is not just successful — it’s the year Sabrina Carpenter steps into her full artistic identity.”\n\nFor more information about Tameera or to arrange a reading, visit www.tameera.com.","summary":"The future of the world’s biggest names could be about to be rewritten and it involves babies, billions and bombshell splits.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/astrologer-reveals-explosive-predictions-for-worlds-alisters-in-2026/news-story/be450ad142bb8e4f13aa2d5b0dc7a5c7?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/cb871fc359088175e1bf4ff6ca0b2e6a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:37:46","author":"Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp","authors":["Copy Link Share Via Email Share On X Share On Facebook Share On Whatsapp"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.434},{"id":390435694,"title":"Trump backs off National Guard deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland","text":"Driving the news: \"We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!\" Trump said on Truth Social. \n\nHe added that the three cities would be \"GONE\" if his administration hadn't intervened.\"It is hard to believe that these Democrat Mayors and Governors, all of whom are greatly incompetent, would want us to leave, especially considering the great progress that has been made???\"The White House referred Axios to Trump's post when asked for further comment.\n\nWhat they're saying: California Gov.

U.S. forces also have seized two oil tankers off Venezuela's coast, are pursuing another and have conducted a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nA set of strikes announced Wednesday increased the death toll from the attacks to at least 110 people since early September. And in a new escalation marking the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil, the CIA carried out a drone strike last week at a docking area believed to have been used by drug cartels.\n\nThe latest sanctions from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control target ships called Nord Star, Lunar Tide, Rosalind and Della, and their registered ownership companies.\n\n“Today's sanctions continue President Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro and his cronies,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement. “The Trump Administration is committed to disrupting the network that props up Maduro and his illegitimate regime.” The sanctions are meant to deny the firms and tankers access to any property or financial assets held in the U.S. People, banks and financial institutions that violate that restriction expose themselves to sanctions or enforcement actions.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the United States \"will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs.” President Donald Trump has announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of the South American country.

Marjorie Taylor Greene shared her straightforward opinion on Donald Trump’s faith in an interview with The New York Times. She questioned whether the president truly embraces Christianity and suggested his words do not align with the values he claims to uphold. \n\nIn the interview, Greene expressed her belief that Trump does not have a genuine Christian faith. She explained that her view developed over time as she observed how he discusses his enemies and handles situations that require restraint or forgiveness. Greene feels the president’s actions are contrary to a man of faith and don’t represent his true belief, but rather it is a political strategy. \n\nGreene mentioned the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a moment that stuck with her. In the interview, she contrasted Trump’s tone with remarks made by Kirk’s widow, Erika. She noted that Erika spoke about grace and forgiveness, and the difference between them caught her attention. “That was absolutely the worst statement,” Greene told the New York Times. “It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her [Erika] having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”\n\nTrump was raised Presbyterian but has since identified himself as a non-denominational Christian. Throughout his political career, the president has courted support from evangelical Christians. After the attempt on his life during his presidential campaign last year, Trump has said that he’s become “more of a believer” and feels that he was “saved by God.”\n\nHe has also referenced religion in his attempts to end wars around the world and he has also spoken about going to heaven. \n\nHer comments show how much she has distanced herself from a man she once supported without question. For years, Greene was one of Trump’s loudest supporters in Congress, repeating his attacks and endorsing his way of politics. In the Times interview, she admitted that she had overlooked issues she now sees differently, referring to her past loyalty as misguided. \n\nGreene also discussed what she views as a moral gap within Trump’s social circle, particularly at Mar-a-Lago. She criticized the sexualized atmosphere among Trump’s inner circle, stating that the focus on appearance and status contradicts the values she believes conservative leaders should embody, not just speak about. \n\nGreene is expected to leave Congress early next year after she announced her resignation, which has given her more freedom to openly discuss her break from Trump and the MAGA movement he leads. Without the pressure of an upcoming election, Greene seems less willing to soften her stance and has only ramped up her attacks on her former mentor. \n\nShe has also linked her fallout with Trump to disagreements over transparency regarding the Epstein files. In the interview, she suggested that Trump was hesitant to release everything due to the possible impact on people close to him. This claim added another layer to what has become a very public unraveling.\n\nGreene was one of Trump’s biggest supporters before their bitter split. She supported his attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election and has promoted his false claims of a stolen election. During his current second term, she began to question if the man she once backed on almost everything is truly America First and became more critical of Israel. However, it appears Epstein was the final straw for Trump, who went on the attack, leading to their inevitable split.","summary":"The Georgia Republican questioned Donald Trump’s religious sincerity in an interview that highlights a widening MAGA rift.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-does-not-have-sincere-christian-faith-says-majorie-taylor-greene","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Majorie-Taylor-Greene-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:30:27","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":390428396,"title":"The last hostage: After over 800 days, elite Israeli police officer who ran towards danger in October 7 attack is the last remaining in Gaza…as his mother clings to fragile hope he is still alive","text":"After over 800 days of unimaginable suffering the future of Gaza comes down largely to the fate of a single hostage.\n\nIt is in many ways a remarkable testament to the will of the Israeli people that of the 251 taken captive by Hamas on October 7, 2023, only one now remains.\n\nBut that is of little comfort to Talik Gvili, 55, the mother of the last hostage held in the Strip.\n\n'It is a feeling of helplessness,' she told the Daily Mail from her home in Meitar, southern Israel. 'There’s a lot of fear, but also anticipation… It is all the bad feelings.'\n\nThis week Ms Gvili and her husband Itzik, 61, travelled to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida and met with the US President and Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nWhile the two leaders spoke publicly about more potential strikes on Iran and 'wiping out' Hamas if they don't disarm, Ran's parents reminded them that - as per the peace plan - their son's return must be the top priority in Gaza.\n\nIn response, President Trump vowed to 'bring Ran home'.\n\nThe 24-year-old was an elite police officer who ran from their house towards danger when Hamas launched its atrocity and Israeli officials believe he is dead.\n\nUnder the terms of the first stage of Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan that came into force on October 10, all 48 hostages should have been immediately returned.\n\nBut while the 20 living were freed, the terrorists dragged their feet on the 28 dead and claimed many could not be found in the rubble.\n\nNow Israel - and the Gvili family - are agonisingly close.\n\n'We can’t move on to phase two of the deal until he’s brought home,' Ms Gvili said resolutely.\n\nFor her, this is the most important point - as the fear of the world moving on without Ran coming home is too awful to bear.\n\nThe fragile ceasefire sits on a knife edge, with Mr Trump this week threatening 'hell to pay' if Hamas do not agree to disarm - another key sticking point preventing a move beyond 'phase one'.\n\nYet if Ran is not returned, an Israeli official told the Mail in no uncertain terms that 'there will be no second phase.'\n\nMs Gvili still clings to the hope of a miracle that her 'amazing, unique boy' who cared for children with learning difficulties and was a talented guitarist has somehow survived.\n\n'We want to believe that there is even a 0.0001 per cent chance - a hope that maybe just maybe he is still alive,' she said.\n\n'We hope that he received medical treatment but we also have our feet on the ground and understand that there is a problem. We just really hope they will find him and bring him back.'\n\nIf Ran is returned, it would be the first time in over 10 years there are no Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nBut he is held not by Hamas but by another terror group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who chillingly have declared: 'The issue of the hostages has been closed.'\n\n'I think they know exactly where he is,' said Ms Gvili. 'It’s very clear to me.\n\n'They are playing with us to buy time or they have some other trick they are trying to pull. I don’t believe them.'\n\nFor over 800 days Israelis have rallied daily to pressure both their own government and the world which has seen 250 of the 251 taken on October 7 returned as well as four others held for 10 years.\n\n'After more than two years, we have gone from 255 hostages to just one: the brave hero Ran Gvili,' said a spokesman for the Hostages and Missing Person Forum which has led the efforts.\n\n'We will not leave Ran behind. We will exert every possible effort to ensure his return.'\n\nRan is believed to be held in Zeithoun, south east of Gaza City, after being shot in the hand and foot and kidnapped into Gaza unconscious on a motorbike on October 7.\n\nSince then his parents and siblings Omri, 29, and Shira, 24, have not stopped fighting for him.\n\nMs Gvili still receives love and support from fellow hostage families who 'are the only people in the world that can understand'.\n\nNow she hopes that finally, as with them, her torment will soon be over.\n\nUntil then though, she pleads: 'Please, keep saying his name.","summary":"It is in many ways a remarkable testament to the will of the Israeli people that of the 251 taken captive by Hamas on October 7, 2023, only one now remains.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15424623/The-hostage-800-days-elite-Israeli-police-officer-ran-danger-October-7-attack-remaining-Gaza-mother-clings-fragile-hope-alive.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/31/11/105130961-0-image-m-33_1767181279338.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:27:07","author":"Editor,Natalie Lisbona","authors":["Editor","Natalie Lisbona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":390425338,"title":"Trump says he's dropping push for National Guard in Chicago, LA and Portland, Oregon, for now","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said he’s dropping — for now — his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, a move that comes after legal roadblocks hung up the effort.\n\nMr. Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that he’s removing the Guard troops for now. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he wrote.\n\nTroops had already left Los Angeles after the President deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.\n\nThe President has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term — and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans.\n\nHe has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nIn November, U.S. Northern Command had said it was ” shifting and/or rightsizing \" operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but there would be a “constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city.”\n\nMr. Trump’s push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.\n\nThe Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president’s efforts.\n\nIn the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nHundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.\n\nCalifornia National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by Dec. 15 after a court ruling. But an appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order. That paves the way for the California National Guard troops to fully return to state control after Trump federalized the Guard in June.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a “major litigation victory” in a press release Wednesday.\n\n“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a President desperate to be king,” Bonta said. “There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.”\n\nMr. Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-hes-dropping-push-for-national-guard-in-chicago-la-and-portland-oregon-for-now/article70458584.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9h4qur/article70458588.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_National_Guard_89616.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:23:14","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":390431818,"title":"Bitcoin set for first yearly loss since 2022 as macro trends weigh on crypto","text":"Dec 31 (Reuters) - Bitcoin is on ‌track to post its first annual loss since 2022, as macroeconomic pressures and fading momentum weighed on the ‌world's largest cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite reaching a fresh record high this year, bitcoin has struggled to regain its footing ‌since October, and last month experienced its biggest monthly drop since mid-2021. Now, it is on track to end the year more than 6% lower, after posting yearly gains the previous two years. It was last trading at $87,474.2.\n\nAfter soaring earlier this year with the election of crypto-friendly U.S. President ‍Donald Trump, cryptocurrencies - along with stocks - plummeted in April on his tariff announcements. ‍They quickly rebounded, with bitcoin hitting an all-time ‌peak above $126,000 in early October.\n\nBut just days later, on October 10, the market plunged again when Trump announced a ‍new ​tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software. That sparked more than $19 billion worth of liquidations across leveraged crypto market positions, the largest liquidation in crypto history.\n\nThe world's main stock benchmarks have also had a ⁠turbulent year, repeatedly hitting record peaks and then pulling back as worries ‌over tariffs, interest rates and a possible AI bubble whipsawed markets.\n\n\"In 2025, the market showed that bitcoin increasingly exhibits the characteristics of a risk ⁠asset within the global ‍financial system, with a notable correlation to the U.S. equity market during multiple periods,\" said Linh Tran, a senior market analyst at XS.com.\n\nAnalysts say bitcoin's gyrations in 2025 increasingly tracked stock market sentiment as traditional retail and institutional investors jumped into cryptocurrencies, which next year ‍may be even more closely tethered to factors driving stocks and ‌other risk assets, such as monetary policy shifts and nervousness over the lofty valuations of AI-related stocks.\n\nHistorically, bitcoin and stocks did not move in tandem because crypto was seen as an alternative investment. But with broader crypto adoption by traditional retail investors and some institutions, the correlation looks to be strengthening, analysts said.\n\nWINS IN WASHINGTON\n\nThe crypto industry notched major regulatory wins in the U.S. under the first year of the Trump administration, including the Securities and Exchange Commission's swift move to dismiss Biden-era lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance and others, as well as the passage of a landmark law creating federal rules for dollar-pegged crypto ‌tokens.\n\nBut crypto market structure legislation and carve-outs from SEC rules that should fix core, longstanding problems for the industry are yet to come, threatening to sap the industry's celebratory mood, according to multiple industry executives.\n\nTrump courted industry cash pledging to be a \"crypto president,\" and his family's own crypto ​ventures have helped to propel the sector into the mainstream, say executives.\n\nCrypto companies and executives donated more than $245 million in the 2024 election cycle to promote pro-crypto candidates including Trump, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\n (Reporting by Hannah Lang in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2026/01/01/bitcoin-set-for-first-yearly-loss-since-2022-as-macro-trends-weigh-on-crypto","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/01/3699560.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:22:00","author":"Hannah Lang","authors":["Hannah Lang"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":390435814,"title":"Farmers can now learn how much aid they will get from the Trump administration","text":"By JOSH FUNK and DIDI TANG\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year’s crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.\n\nSoybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump’s trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world’s largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump’s massive budget bill take effect later this year.\n\nSoybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.\n\nFarmers say they need more buyers for their crops\n\nBut farmers say the aid won’t solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.\n\nKentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is “a Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.”\n\nThe President of the National Corn Growers Association Jed Bower also urged the Trump administration to focus on cultivating additional uses for their crops. Farmers will benefit from having more buyers whether it is for ethanol and animal feed at home or for international markets.\n\n“Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,” Bower said. “While this financial assistance is helpful and welcomed, we urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.”\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that is the goal and promised to continue working to open new markets while strengthening the safety net for farmers.\n\nMinnesota Soybean Growers Association President Darin Johnson said the aid number for soybeans fell short of what farmers had been hoping for, so more help could be needed, though this package will help.\n\nMost farmers remain steadfast supporters of Trump even after the disruptions caused by the trade war. They generally support many of his other policies and believe they will get a better trade deal in the end.\n\nWhite House and farmers encouraged by China’s purchases\n\nThese aid payments will add up to $11 billion for row crop farmers who raise corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and other crops. Another $1 billion has been set aside for specialty crops and sugar, but the administration hasn’t released any details of aid for those crops.\n\nAfter Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February.\n\nAs of Dec. 18, China had bought about 6 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA’s weekly report. Separately, the federal agency reported that China since then bought at least three more batches totaling 600,000 metric tons.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that “agricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.”\n\nHowever, the recent increase in international purchases is encouraging to farmers, said Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, who has seen more than 1 million metric tons of sorghum purchased in just the past few weeks. Like soybeans, more than half of the sorghum crop is exported each year with China traditionally being the biggest buyer.\n\nThe aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.\n\nThe USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.","url":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/12/31/trump-farm-aid/","image":"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_Farm_Aid_33388_dc2214.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:16:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":390425286,"title":"Farmers can now learn how much aid they will get from the Trump administration","text":"By JOSH FUNK and DIDI TANG\n\nOMAHA, Neb.

This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump’s massive budget bill take effect later this year.\n\nSoybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.\n\nFarmers say they need more buyers for their crops\n\nBut farmers say the aid won’t solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.\n\nKentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is “a Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.”\n\nThe President of the National Corn Growers Association Jed Bower also urged the Trump administration to focus on cultivating additional uses for their crops. Farmers will benefit from having more buyers whether it is for ethanol and animal feed at home or for international markets.\n\n“Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,” Bower said. “While this financial assistance is helpful and welcomed, we urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.”\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that is the goal and promised to continue working to open new markets while strengthening the safety net for farmers.\n\nMinnesota Soybean Growers Association President Darin Johnson said the aid number for soybeans fell short of what farmers had been hoping for, so more help could be needed, though this package will help.\n\nMost farmers remain steadfast supporters of Trump even after the disruptions caused by the trade war. They generally support many of his other policies and believe they will get a better trade deal in the end.\n\nWhite House and farmers encouraged by China’s purchases\n\nThese aid payments will add up to $11 billion for row crop farmers who raise corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and other crops. Another $1 billion has been set aside for specialty crops and sugar, but the administration hasn’t released any details of aid for those crops.\n\nAfter Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February.\n\nAs of Dec. 18, China had bought about 6 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA’s weekly report. Separately, the federal agency reported that China since then bought at least three more batches totaling 600,000 metric tons.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that “agricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.”\n\nHowever, the recent increase in international purchases is encouraging to farmers, said Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, who has seen more than 1 million metric tons of sorghum purchased in just the past few weeks. Like soybeans, more than half of the sorghum crop is exported each year with China traditionally being the biggest buyer.\n\nThe aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.\n\nThe USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.","url":"https://www.courant.com/2025/12/31/trump-farm-aid/","image":"https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_Farm_Aid_33388_dc2214.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:16:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":390427518,"title":"Top 5 Elections To Watch Out For Across The World In 2026, From Netanyahu's Fate In Israel To Trump's Future In US","text":"As the year comes to an end, people around the world are preparing for a wave of elections that could have far-reaching consequences. From the United States and France to India, Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom, voters in some of the world’s most powerful nations will soon head to the polls. While some elections will mainly affect domestic politics, others could reshape alliances, economies, and the broader global balance of power.,Here are five key elections to watch in 2026:,5. Brazil, ,Incumbent: President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,Date: October 4 (first round) and October 25 (potential runoff),President Lula da Silva, an influential figure in Brazilian politics for more than 30 years, is seeking a fourth term in office. The Workers’ Party leader narrowly defeated Jair Bolsonaro four years ago, blocking the former president from winning a second term. Bolsonaro will not be on the ballot this time, but his son, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro of Rio de Janeiro, has entered the race.,At 80, Lula’s long political journey, from metalworker and union organizer to president, remains central to his appeal, though recent health concerns have raised questions about his stamina. Current opinion polls show Lula leading, but the race is still open. Brazilian voters will likely focus on the pace of economic growth, rising crime, and the country’s foreign relations, especially with the United States amid tariff tensions.,4. Bangladesh, ,Main Contenders: Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami,Date: February 12, 2026,Bangladesh is heading toward a pivotal election in February, its first in 15 years to choose a new leader. The vote follows the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after mass protests last August. Since then, the country has been run by a caretaker administration led by Muhammad Yunus in his role as Chief Adviser.,The political climate remains tense after Hasina fled the country. Her Awami League has been banned from contesting the election, while repeated protests, largely calling for her return from India, have continued to grip the nation. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, long the main rival to the Awami League, is widely seen as the frontrunner, with its leader Tarique Rahman expected to emerge as the next prime minister.,At the same time, the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami has gained momentum, adding another layer of uncertainty. The outcome of the election is expected to shape Bangladesh’s political direction and its relations with regional powers, including India, China, and Pakistan.,3. Hungary, ,Incumbent: Prime Minister Viktor Orbán,Date: April 2026,For Viktor Orbán, 2026 may bring the toughest challenge of his long political career. After more than two decades in power, the Fidesz leader is facing an unexpected threat from Peter Magyar, a former party insider who broke away in early 2024 to launch the Tisza Party.,Magyar’s party has positioned itself as anti-corruption, economically pragmatic, and in favor of improving ties with the European Union. He positions himself as a center-right alternative, sharing some conservative views while criticizing the government’s economic performance and alleged corruption. Polls late in 2025 point to a close contest, with neither side holding a decisive advantage.,2. United States Of America, ,Date: November 3, 2025,US President Donald Trump has managed to reshape the American political landscape in his first year in office and will seek a vote of confidence from voters in the November 2026 midterm elections. While Trump will not be on the ballot, Republicans will hope to maintain control of the House and the Senate. ,However, the road looks tough for Trump, as Democrats have maintained a significant lead in all polls so far and appear poised to flip control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority, with an outside chance of flipping Senate control as well. ,If that happens, Trump will likely face many more roadblocks to his domestic agenda and struggle to pass any bill of his choosing through Congress. ,1. Israel, ,Incumbent: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,Date: October 2026,Israel’s 2026 election could be one of the most decisive moments in Benjamin Netanyahu’s long career. Voters will choose all 120 members of the Knesset, effectively deciding whether the country’s longest-serving prime minister remains in office.,Netanyahu faces continued legal troubles and criticism over Israel’s actions during the Gaza war, which have weighed on his international image. Despite struggling in polls earlier in his term, recent surveys show his Likud party leading, and in the absence of a single opposition figure able to unite his critics, Netanyahu remains well-positioned to hold on to power.","summary":"In 2026, pivotal elections in Israel, the USA, Hungary, Bangladesh, and Brazil could reshape domestic politics and global alliances. Key contests include Netanyahu’s Knesset race, US midterms, Orbán’s challenge, Bangladesh’s first post-Hasina vote, and Lula’s bid for a fourth term in Brazil.","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/top-5-elections-to-watch-out-for-across-the-world-in-2026-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-donald-trump-us-hungary-bangladesh-brazil-article-153378547","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153378585,thumbsize-874546,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153378585.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31

over his military deployments in US cities.\n\nThe Republican had sent troops into several cities run by Democrats during his first year back in power, in what he called a crackdown on illegal immigration and crime.\n\nLocal leaders slammed the moves as authoritarian overreach and launched a string of successful legal challenges, with the US Supreme Court last week blocking the Chicago deployment.\n\n“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.\n\nIn the message on New Year’s Eve, Trump said the three cities “were GONE if it weren’t for the Federal Government stepping in.”\n\n“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again — Only a question of time!” Trump added.\n\nTrump’s deployments of National Guard troops have been a centerpiece of his hardline policies on immigration and crime since returning to the White House in January.\n\nThe 79-year-old billionaire and former reality star has also sent the National Guard into the capital Washington and to Memphis, Tennessee, and threatened to send them to San Francisco.\n\nBut the Trump administration had already begun to pull some troops from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland in recent weeks as court judgments went against it.\n\n– ‘Illegal intimidation tactic’ –\n\nLos Angeles became the first city to have troops on the streets in June when Trump went over the heads of local Democratic leaders to order 4,000 National Guard reservists to put down protests over immigration raids. \n\nThose local leaders said the relatively minor protests, which affected only a few blocks in America’s second largest metropolis, could easily be handled by city, county and state law enforcement.\n\nOn December 10, a federal judge ordered Trump’s administration to end the Los Angeles deployment and return control of the soldiers to California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nMost had already been demobilized, with the US military saying 100 Guard troops remained deployed at the time.\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement, Newsom said the administration had formally stopped opposing the federal court’s ruling on the troops.\n\n“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” Newsom, who is widely seen as a likely Democratic contender for the presidency in 2028, said on X.\n\nTrump meanwhile ordered military forces from Texas and California to Chicago and Portland in early October.\n\nAs of last week, some 300 National Guard troops remained activated in the Chicago area but were not engaged in operations.\n\nA judge in November ruled the Portland deployment unlawful and ordered it permanently blocked.","summary":"President Trump announces the National Guard withdrawal from

says Constitution remains ‘firm and unshaken’ with major Supreme Court rulings ahead","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Chief Justice John Roberts said Wednesday that the Constitution remains a sturdy pillar for the country, a message that comes after a tumultuous year in the nation’s judicial system with pivotal Supreme Court decisions on the horizon.\n\nRoberts said the nation’s founding documents remain “firm and unshaken,” a reference to a century-old quote from President Calvin Coolidge. “True then; true now,” Roberts wrote in his annual letter to the judiciary.\n\nThe letter comes after a year in which legal scholars and Democrats raised fears of a possible constitutional crisis as Republican President Donald Trump’s supporters pushed back against rulings that slowed his far-reaching conservative agenda.\n\nRoberts weighed in at one point, issuing a rare rebuke after Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who had ruled against him in a case over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members.\n\nThe chief justice’s Wednesday letter was largely focused on the nation’s history, including an early 19th-century case establishing the principle that Congress shouldn’t remove judges over contentious rulings.\n\nWhile the Trump administration faced pushback in the lower courts, it has scored a series of some two dozen wins on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. The court’s conservative majority has allowed Trump to move ahead for now with banning transgender people from the military, clawing back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, moving aggressively on immigration and firing the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.\n\nThe court also handed Trump a few defeats over the last year, including in his push to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities.\n\nOther pivotal issues are ahead for the high court in 2026, including arguments over Trump’s push to end birthright citizenship and a ruling on whether he can unilaterally impose tariffs on hundreds of countries.\n\nRoberts’ letter contained few references to those issues. It opened with a history of the seminal 1776 pamphlet “Common Sense,” written by Thomas Paine, a “recent immigrant to Britain’s North American colonies,” and closed with Coolidge’s encouragement to “turn for solace” to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence “amid all the welter of partisan politics.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

We have no income, no money,” al-Masri told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Only a few medical points remain. This makes the situation extremely difficult and will lead to a catastrophe for the injured and the wounded. Even ordinary people who come seeking treatment will face severe hardship.”\n\nIsrael is moving to revoke the licences of 37 international NGOs, including Doctors Without Borders (known by its French initials MSF), as it pushes to demonise organisations that assist Palestinians, among them United Nations agencies, with unproven accusations of links to Hamas.\n\nIsrael said the ban, which starts on Thursday and also includes the Norwegian Refugee Council, CARE International, and the International Rescue Committee, among other groups, stems from new regulations that require aid organisations to reveal details about their staff and work.\n\n“Even with the presence of humanitarian organisations, the situation is already tragic,” Gaza resident Ramzi Abu al-Neel told Al Jazeera.\n\n“If their support and presence are removed, God knows what will happen. Many children will die, and lives will be destroyed, and many families will be devastated by this decision.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the foreign ministers of 10 countries – including Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom – released a joint statement urging Israel to ensure that international NGOs “are able to operate in Gaza in a sustained and predictable way”.\n\n“Any attempt to stem their ability to operate is unacceptable. Without them it will be impossible to meet all urgent needs at the scale required,” it said.\n\nDespite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to kill Palestinians in Gaza and impose restrictions on the entry of aid and basic goods to the enclave, including temporary housing.\n\nWith most of Gaza turned to rubble, more than one million people have faced harsh winter weather while living in makeshift tents. And in the absence of economic activity amid the destruction, Gaza’s population remains heavily dependent on international aid.\n\n“Most people rely entirely on the assistance that comes from international organisations,” Abdullah al-Hawajri, a displaced Palestinian in Khan Younis, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) also decried Israel’s move, saying it is “further compromising the humanitarian operation” in crisis-stricken Gaza.\n\nUNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said the Israeli decision sets a “dangerous precedent”.\n\n“Failing to push back against attempts to control the work of aid organisations will further undermine the basic humanitarian principles of neutrality, independence, impartiality and humanity underpinning aid work across the world,” Lazzarini said in a statement.\n\nIn 2025, Israel approved several measures to ban UNRWA – a vital facilitator for aid and vital services in Gaza – and curtail its work.\n\nLazzarini said the latest decision against aid groups is “part of a troubling pattern of disregard for international humanitarian law and increasing impediments to aid operations”.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Government Media Office, Israel killed about 500 aid workers and volunteers during its two-year genocidal war, as it imposed a suffocating blockade on the enclave, triggering a deadly famine.\n\nThe Israeli ban appears to violate the ceasefire agreement and US President Donald Trump’s “20-point peace plan”.\n\n“Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,” Trump’s plan says.\n\nMany of the groups facing the ban are part of the established, UN-backed mechanism for aid distribution.","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/palestinians-in-gaza-say-lives-will-be-destroyed-by-israels-ngo-ban/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-12T074606Z_1609265020_RC2TEIA36LI7_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1767203208-ZypjiJ.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31

transporting Venezuelan oil  - Antigua Tribune – Daily Antigua &amp;","text":"The United States Department of the Treasury has issued a new round of sanctions aimed at isolating Venezuela’s oil industry, as part of President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign against the South American country.\n\nThe sanctions announced on Wednesday target four companies and their associated oil tankers, which are allegedly involved in transporting Venezuelan oil.\n\nTrump has claimed that Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro leads a so-called “narco-terrorist” government that seeks to destabilise the US, a charge repeated in the latest sanctions announcements.\n\n“Maduro’s regime increasingly depends on a shadow fleet of worldwide vessels to facilitate sanctionable activity, including sanctions evasion, and to generate revenue for its destabilizing operations,” the Treasury said on Wednesday.\n\nPetroleum is Venezuela’s primary export, but the Trump administration has sought to cut the country off from its international markets.\n\nWednesday’s notice accuses four tankers – the Nord Star, the Rosalind, the Valiant and the Della – of helping Venezuela’s oil sector to circumvent existing sanctions, thereby providing the “financial resources that fuel Maduro’s illegitimate narco-terrorist regime”.\n\n“President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\n“The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump’s campaign of pressure on Maduro’s regime.”\n\nClaims on Venezuelan oil\n\nThe sanctions come a day after Washington imposed sanctions on a separate Venezuelan company it says assembled drones designed by Iran.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has cited several motives for ratcheting up pressure against Venezuela, ranging from immigration to Maduro’s contested election in 2024.\n\nTrump, for instance, has framed the pressure campaign as a means of stemming the trade of illegal drugs, despite Venezuela exporting virtually none of the administration’s main target, fentanyl.\n\nCritics have also accused Washington of seeking to topple Maduro’s government to take control of the country’s vast oil reserves.\n\nTrump officials have fuelled those suspicions with remarks seeming to assert ownership over Venezuela’s oil.\n\nOn December 17, a day after Trump announced a “total and complete blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, his top adviser, Stephen Miller, claimed that the US “created the oil industry in Venezuela”.\n\nHe suggested that the oil was stolen from the US when Venezuela nationalised its petroleum industry, starting in 1976.\n\nThat process accelerated after the 1998 election of socialist President Hugo Chavez, who reasserted state control over Venezuela’s oil sector, ultimately leading to the seizure of foreign assets in 2007.\n\nThat “tyrannical expropriation” scheme, Miller alleged, “was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property”.\n\nStill, one major US oil company, Chevron, continues to operate in the country.\n\nTrump has echoed Miller’s claims, writing online that the US “will not allow a Hostile Regime to take our Oil, Land, or any other Assets”.\n\nHe added that all of those assets “must be returned to the United States, IMMEDIATELY”.\n\nMilitary build-up in the Caribbean\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration has tightened its focus on Venezuela’s oil industry, taking a series of military actions against tankers.\n\nOn December 10, the administration seized its first tanker, the Skipper, followed by a second seizure 10 days later.\n\nThe US military has reportedly been pursuing a third tanker as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe attacks on the oil tankers come several months after the US began surging aircraft, warships and other military assets to the Caribbean region along Venezuela’s coast.\n\nSince September 2, the US military has conducted dozens of bombing campaigns against alleged drug-smuggling boats in international waters in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, in what rights groups call extrajudicial killings.\n\nMore than 100 people have been killed, and the administration has offered scant legal justification for the attacks.\n\nOn Monday, Trump told reporters that the US had struck a “dock area” in Venezuela he claimed was used to load the alleged drug boats.\n\nThe dock bombing is believed to be the first of its kind on Venezuelan soil, though Trump has long threatened to begin attacking land-based targets.\n\nWhile the administration has not officially revealed which agency was behind the dock strike, US media has widely reported it was conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/us-imposes-more-sanctions-on-tankers-transporting-venezuelan-oil/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/getty_6955860136-1767212545-uAo9h2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31

Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland  - Antigua Tribune – Daily","text":"United States President Donald Trump announced he is ceasing his efforts to deploy federal troops to several Democratic-led cities in a major policy pivot.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday comes amid a series of legal setbacks to Trump’s efforts to deploy National Guard members to Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said he’s “removing” the National Guard from those cities, although their deployment was already mostly limited by lower courts.\n\n“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” he said.\n\nDespite the claim, the National Guard has been barred from taking direct part in law enforcement, which remains illegal under US law. Trump had not invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, which allows presidents to deploy troops domestically when “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion” against the federal government make it “impracticable to enforce” US law “by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings”.\n\nBecause of that, troops deployed in or around Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago had been largely tasked with guarding federal buildings and offering support services to immigration enforcement.\n\nAbout 300 National Guard members remained under federal control in both Los Angeles and Chicago at the time of Trump’s announcement, with 200 more in Portland.\n\nSince first deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles to respond to protests against mass immigration enforcement sweeps, Trump has repeatedly claimed major cities across the US have been plagued by overlapping crime and immigration crises.\n\nCritics have accused Trump of taking part in dangerous political theatre to target opponents.\n\nThe president’s move comes amid a series of legal setbacks, topped last week by a Supreme Court order keeping in place a lower court’s ruling barring the president from deploying the National Guard to Chicago.\n\nWhile members of the federal military, National Guard troops are typically deployed at the request of state governors. Presidents can unilaterally deploy the National Guard, but only in instances when other federal agents can no longer execute the law.\n\nThe majority of Supreme Court justices ruled Trump has not yet met that threshold, dealing a major blow to the administration’s justification for similar deployments across the country.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Department of Justice lawyers in California withdrew a request to keep troops in the state under federal control as they appealed a lower court’s ruling. That ruling by US District Judge Charles Breyer said the troops must be returned to state control.\n\nIn a post on X, the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and top Trump critic, said the “admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end”.\n\nNewsom and his staff “look forward” to a more lasting court ruling on the issue.\n\nFor his part, Trump, in his Truth Social post, said he would not hesitate to redeploy troops.\n\n“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!” he said.","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/trump-says-removing-national-guard-from-chicago-los-angeles-and-portland/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/12/reuters_69559a76-1767217782-GUGZpG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:09:36","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":0.014},{"id":390432470,"title":"Trump announces National Guard to be removed from Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland","text":"SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump said he's dropping - for now - his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, a move that comes after legal roadblocks hung up the effort.\n\nTrump said in a social media post Wednesday that he's removing the Guard troops for now. \"We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!\" he wrote.\n\nTroops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.\n\nThe president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term - and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans.\n\nHe has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n\nIn November, U.S. Northern Command had said it was \" shifting and/or rightsizing operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but there would be a \"constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city.\"\n\nTrump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.\n\nThe Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president's efforts.\n\nIn the nation's capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.\n\nHundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.\n\nCalifornia National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by Dec. 15 after a court ruling. But an appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order. That paves the way for the California National Guard troops to fully return to state control after Trump federalized the Guard in June.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a \"major litigation victory\" in a press release Wednesday.\n\n\"For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a President desperate to be king,\" Bonta said. \"There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.\"\n\nTrump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jaimie Ding in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/trump-administration-backs-off-efforts-maintain-control-california-national-guard-la/18336423/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17503297_081125-kgo-ap-national-guard-2-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 23:09:04","author":"Michelle L.

However, Minnesota will have to provide even more verification for child care centers that are suspected of fraud, such as attendance and licensing records, past enforcement actions and inspection reports.\n\nIn his social media post on Tuesday, O’Neill said all Administration for Children and Families payments nationwide would require “justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before money is sent, but the HHS spokesperson said Wednesday that the additional verifications only apply to CCDF payments.\n\nWalz says Trump is politicizing the issue\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, said in a social media post that fraudsters are a serious issue that the state has spent years cracking down on but that this is a political move that is part of “Trump’s long game.”\n\nState Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy condemned the move in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“Republicans are playing sick games and winning devastating prizes,” Murphy said. “And now, tens of thousands of Minnesota families will pay the price as Donald’s Trump’s agents strip away crucial funding.”\n\nFraud investigations could stretch to other programs, states\n\nThe administration launched efforts in recent weeks to track down fraud in other programs in Minnesota and is looking at fraud in blue states such as California and New York, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Wednesday.\n\nThe administration will continue to send officers to investigate “potential fraud sites” in Minnesota and deport undocumented immigrants, Leavitt said, adding that the Department of Homeland Security is considering plans to denaturalize citizens.\n\nThe Department of Labor is also investigating the state’s unemployment insurance program, Leavitt said. The administration this month threatened to withhold SNAP food aid funding from Democratic-controlled states, including Minnesota, unless they provide information about people receiving assistance.\n\nAttention focused on Minnesota\n\nThe announcement came a day after U.S. Homeland Security officials conducted a fraud investigation in Minneapolis, questioning workers at unidentified businesses. Trump has criticized Walz’s administration over the cases, capitalizing on them to target the Somali diaspora in the state, which has the largest Somali population in the U.S.\n\nIn his post Tuesday, O’Neill, who is serving as acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, referenced a right-wing influencer who posted a video last week claiming he found that day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis had committed up to $100 million in fraud.\n\nMeanwhile, there are concerns about harassment that home-based day care providers and members of the Somali community nationwide might face amid the vitriol, including Trump’s comments earlier this month referring to Somali immigrants as “garbage.” Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown released a statement saying, “Showing up on someone’s porch, threatening, or harassing them isn’t an investigation. Neither is filming minors who may be in the home.”\n\nMinnesota child care centers are alarmed\n\nMaria Snider, director of the Rainbow Child Development Center and vice president of advocacy group Minnesota Child Care Association, said fear is rising among both families — many of which are living paycheck to paycheck — and child care centers that rely on the federal funding. Without child care system tuition, centers may have to lay off teachers and shut down classrooms, she said.\n\nIn Minnesota, the application process for the funding is complex and multilayered, Snider said. Her own child care center has been subjected to random audits, she said, and all centers are required to submit to licensing visits by officials.\n\n“I don’t know what else I would provide,” she said.\n\nAhmed Hasan, director of the ABC Learning Center that was one of those featured in the video by the right-wing influencer, said on Wednesday that there were 56 children enrolled at the center. Since the video was posted, Hasan, who is Somali, said his center has received harassing phone calls making staff members and parents feel unsafe.\n\nHe said the center is routinely subject to checks by state regulators to ensure they remain in compliance with their license.\n\n“There’s no fraud happening here,” Hasan told The Associated Press. “We are open every day, and we have our records to show that this place is open.”\n\nKramon reported from Atlanta and Brumfield reported from Cockeysville, Maryland.
