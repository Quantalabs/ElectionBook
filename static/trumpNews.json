Earlier, Bessent said that the US trade team was “frustrated” over trade negotiations with India, while pointing to India-Russia energy ties.\nIt all started after President Donald Trump took to social media to attack the Delhi-Moscow energy and defence ties, while also dubbing the economies of both countries as “dead”, as he announced 25% tariffs on India and additional “penalties” for its relationship with the Vladimir Putin-led country. “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together,” Trump said on Truth Social on Thursday.\nMarco Rubio Comments On India-Russia Ties\nBacking Trump’s remarks against India, Rubio said that New Delhi’s relationship with Moscow is a “point of irritation” in the US’ ties with India.\n“India is an ally and a strategic partner. Like anything in foreign policy, you are not gonna align 100% of the time on everything. India has huge energy needs, which include the ability to buy oil and coal, and gas and things they need to power its economy like every country does. And it buys it from Russia because Russian oil is cheap. That is helping them sustain the Russian war efforts. So it is a point of irritation in our relationship with India,” Marco Rubio told Fox News.\n“President Trump expressed his very clear frustration that so many other oil vendors are available, India continues to buy so much from Russia,” he added.\nEarlier, in an interview with CNBC, Bessent remarked that Trump and the entire trade negotiation team have been frustrated with India.\nHe also said that “India has also been a big buyer of Russian oil, which they then resell as refined products”, adding that “they have not been a great global actor”.\nHowever, New Delhi has maintained that the negotiations with the US are underway and will be finalised, keeping India’s national interest in mind.\nTrump’s announcement of 25% tariffs, plus “penalties” on India came shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi clarified in the Lok Sabha in no uncertain terms that “no world leader asked India to stop Operation Sindoor”, therefore, busting Donald Trump’s repeated claims without taking his name that he mediated a “ceasefire” between India and Pakistan.","summary":"Donald Trump earlier attacked the India-Russia ties, dubbing the economies of both countries \"dead\".

According to a White House fact sheet, goods rerouted through other countries to bypass the new tariffs will face a transhipment levy of 40%.\nThe White House linked the latest tariff hike in part to what it called Canada’s “continued inaction and retaliation,” particularly its alleged failure to curb fentanyl smuggling into the United States and also recognising Palestine as a separate state. While Canadian officials maintain that only a small fraction of fentanyl entering the US originates in Canada, and that border enforcement has already been strengthened, Trump has continued to press for more aggressive action.\nThe announcement came despite Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s reported outreach ahead of the August 1 deadline, with Trump claiming no conversation had taken place. Carney, who previously stated that talks were constructive but unlikely to meet the deadline, must now weigh options as provincial leaders are divided on strategy. Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for a 50% counter-tariff on U.S. steel and aluminium, stating, “Canada shouldn’t settle for anything less than the right deal… We need to stand our ground.”\nTrump, while noting he “loves Canada,” accused the country of treating the U.S. “very badly for years.” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added that the tariffs could be reconsidered “if Carney starts turning on the charm and if he takes off his retaliation.”\nMeanwhile, Trump has offered Mexico a 90-day reprieve to reach a trade deal, but non-USMCA-compliant exports will still be hit with a 25% duty. With 75% of Canadian exports heading to the U.S., the tariff hike, impacting sectors like steel, aluminium, and auto manufacturing, adds significant pressure on Ottawa. Still, Canadian officials noted that USMCA compliance has risen sharply, and export diversification efforts have helped mitigate the damage. Government data shows the U.S. share of Canadian exports fell from 78% to 68% between May 2024 and May 2025.","summary":"The announcement came despite Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s reported outreach ahead of the August 1 deadline,","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-hikes-canadian-tariffs-to-35-links-move-to-ottawas-stance-on-palestine-9476868.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/03/Untitled-design-2025-03-28T201453.056-2025-03-f170ffad51f53eac9ae18003abeec31d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-01 01:29:14","author":"Abhro Banerjee,News18","authors":["Abhro Banerjee","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":347107700,"title":"Trump rejigs tariff rates ahead of deadline, levies 40% duties on all transshipped goods","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that modified \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with updated duties ranging from 10% to 41%.\n\nAll goods that are considered to have been transshipped to avoid applicable duties will be subject to an additional 40% tariff, according to the White House.\n\nAmong countries facing the steepest \"reciprocal\" tariffs, Syria has the highest rate at 41%. Exports from Laos and Myanmar to the U.S. will be subject to a 40% duty. Switzerland and South Africa will be hit with tariffs of 39% and 30%, respectively.\n\nFor some Asian nations that have not confirmed a trade pact with the U.S., the latest executive order offered some relief with lower duties. The new tariff rates on imports from Thailand will be lowered to 19% from 36%, and those from Malaysia will be reduced to 19% from the 24% rate set earlier.\n\nShipments from Taiwan will face a 20% tariff, lower than the 32% rate set earlier.\n\nCountries that are not listed in the latest order will face an additional duty of 10%, the order said.

While claiming that he had no plan to extend that deadline, Trump signed an executive order delaying the date to Aug. 1, days before the new tariff rates were set to kick in.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Aug. 1 deadline, Trump dispatched letters to more than two dozen world leaders outlining new tariff rates on their exports to the U.S.\n\nMost of those new tariff rates were close to the April 2 levels that Trump had initially set using a formula that economists had criticized.\n\nOn Monday, Trump had floated the idea that he would raise the baseline tariff rate to around 15% or 20% on imports from countries that have not negotiated separate trade agreements with the U.S.\n\nAsian markets largely fell following the latest announcement, with South Korea's Kospi index shedding over 3%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.66%.

The US President today stressed his trade agenda will maintain the global economy and sturdiness of alliances his nation has built up over decades. The White House announced agreements with various nations and blocs ahead of the president's self-imposed Friday deadline. The tariffs are being implemented at a later date in order for the rates schedule to be harmonised. Speaking last night, Mr Trump said: \"We have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country.\" However, the world leader did not go into any detail on these, such as the nations involved and his senior administration officials also declined to offer more information when asked by reporters. It comes after Mr Trump recently reignited his feud with Sadiq Khan in front of Keir Starmer, with a savage jibe at the London Mayor . The Mirror understands some tariffs have been lowered, and it is thought these include the original 50% threat to Lesotho. It is believed the African nation's goods will now be taxed at 15%. Our understanding is Taiwan will have tariffs set at 20%, and Pakistan at 19%. Israel , Iceland, Norway, Fiji, Ghana, Guyana and Ecuador are among the countries with imported goods taxed at 15%. Switzerland would be tariffed at 39%, it is thought. However, Mr Trump, the former businessman, would not be drawn on commenting on exact arrangements for specific nations. But he did confess: \"We haven’t spoken to Canada today,\" in a pertinent reference following a fresh jibe at Mark Carney's nation earlier this week . The US leader had said it would be \"very hard\" to make a trade deal with Canada after the country became the latest nation to recognise a Palestinian state. He had posted on social media: \"Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh’ Canada!!!\" Yet, Mr Trump had announced a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil, but the order was only 10% as the other 40% were part of a separate measure approved by Mr Trump on Wednesday. One of his first significant moves as president was to impose tariffs on goods from both Mexico and Canada earlier this year.

That is the same level that President Donald Trump set during his \"Liberation Day\" even in early April when he first announced the tariffs.\n\nHowever, that 10 percent rate will only apply to countries with a trade surplus — in other words, countries to which the U.S. exports more than it imports.\n\nA senior administration official told the Associated Press that most countries have trade surpluses with the U.S.\n\nCountries with a trade deficit with the U.S. will be subject to an at least 15 percent tariff under the new policy. Approximately 40 countries' goods will be subject to that rate. For most of the countries that were subjected to Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs levied in April, that rate will be lower than what they were previously paying, though it will be higher for a small group of nations.\n\nMore than a dozen countries will be tariffed at more than a 15 percent rate. According to an administration official, those nations have the highest trade deficits with the U.S.\n\n“President Trump is using tariffs as a necessary and powerful tool to put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits that threaten our economy and national security,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe new tariff policy will not go into effect on Friday. Trump has delayed the tariffs for another week, until August 7, reportedly to give U.S. Customs and Border Protection time to make changes in how it policies incoming goods and to collect the new duties from imports.\n\nSome of the changes appear to be retaliatory in nature. For example. Trump has raised the tariff on Canadian goods to 35 percent, where it was previously 25 percent.

In 2024, India-US trade reached $129.2 billion, making the US one of India’s most important trading partners.While final tariff rates by sector remain unclear, analysts say some industries are particularly vulnerable. Here's a simplified breakdown of the sectors most at risk:Gems, jewellery: First in line of fireThe US is the largest market for India’s gems and jewellery, buying over $10 billion worth annually. A 25% tariff could inflate prices, delay shipments, and hit every link in the supply chain—from small artisans to major manufacturers. The industry, already under pressure from global conflicts and slowing demand, may now face job losses and reduced competitiveness.Pharma: US patients to feel it tooIndia supplies around 40% of all generic prescriptions filled in the US, amounting to $8 billion annually. The new tariff threatens to disrupt this flow and raise costs for US healthcare providers. While Indian drugmakers hope for a lower rate—possibly 10%—analysts warn that any added cost could strain a critical part of the US pharma supply chain..US tariff accords: Countries that have struck tariff deals with the US.Textiles, apparel: Supply at riskIndia exports large volumes of clothing, home textiles, and footwear to US retail giants like Walmart, Gap, and Costco. The sector was already seeking tariff relief to stay competitive with countries like Vietnam. Now, analysts say a 25% duty could erode profit margins, reduce order volumes, and put pressure on exporters already dealing with shrinking global demand.Electronics: iPhones to be at riskIndia recently became a major exporter of smartphones—especially iPhones assembled locally. However, the new tariff could undercut this progress. While phones are currently exempt from the latest levies, analysts say future moves under national security laws may change that, forcing Apple and others to rethink sourcing strategies.Oil refiners: Russian crude uncertaintyIndia imports about 37% of its oil from Russia at discounted prices. But with Trump's criticism of India’s Russia ties, refiners now face uncertainty over whether future US actions will target these energy deals. If those flows are disrupted, it could push up costs and hurt profits at major Indian oil companies.Broader impact: What’s next?Export-oriented sectors are expected to feel the pinch first. Around 20% of India’s goods exports go to the US, which accounts for about 2.5% of the country’s GDP. While the overall economic hit may seem small, the sector-specific damage could be significant.Investor confidence may also take a hit, especially in mid-cap and export-heavy sectors like auto parts, tiles, industrials, and pharma. Some analysts expect capital outflows and volatility in markets.Notably, the IT sector is not directly affected by these tariffs, but rising global uncertainty could lead US firms to cut back on tech spending. A weaker rupee, however, might cushion IT exporters, who benefit when the currency depreciates.For now, all eyes are on the sixth round of India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement talks, scheduled for late August, which may offer more clarity, analysts say. Until then, Indian exporters will likely brace for a challenging quarter ahead.- with inputs from Bloomberg","summary":"","url":"https://gulfnews.com/business/tax-news/us-tariffs-on-indian-goods-start-today-but-wholl-pay-the-biggest-price-1.500218323","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2024-11-30/9vokmoe1/Prime_Minister_Narendra_Modi_and_President_Donald_Trump_0121_16d5c581ad8_original_ratio.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-01 01:05:00","author":"Justin Varghese","authors":["Justin Varghese"],"language":"en","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":347102792,"title":"White House Reveals New Tariff Plan: What We Know","text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday imposing tariffs from 10 percent to 41 percent on U.S. imports from dozens of countries and foreign economies.The tariffs, which will take effect in seven days, include 25 percent on Indian goods entering the U.S., 20 percent on Taiwan's goods and 30 percent for South Africa's.Two of Asia's poorest counties, Myanmar and Laos, face 40 percent tariffs on their exports to the U.S., while Syria faces the highest rate of 41 percent.Canada faces tariffs of 35 percent on its exports to the U.S.In his order, Trump said that some trading partners had agreed or on the verge of agreeing to trade deals \"to permanently remedy the trade barriers … and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.\"\"Other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters,\" he said.\"There are also some trading partners that have failed to engage in negotiations with the United States or to take adequate steps to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters,\" Trump said in the order.Trump set the August 1 deadline after his previous \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announced in April triggered global market panic fueled by fears of recession. He then imposed a 90-day period for negotiation and further extended the timeline while sending letters that listed rates to world leaders.That prompted a blizzard of hasty negotiations by numerous countries hoping to reach an agreement before the deadline.Shortly before the Friday deadline, Trump said he would enter a 90-day negotiating period with Mexico, one of America's largest trading partners, with the current 25 percent tariff rates staying in place, down from the 30 percent he had threatened earlier.","summary":"Trump signs an order announcing tariffs near his deadline.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/us-trump-tariffs-deadline-2107334","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2664351/breaking-us-bombs-iran.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a92a38ec485bbb3a89f571b861e5bb33","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-01 00:58:33","author":"Robert Birsel","authors":["Robert Birsel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":347104938,"title":"'Influence peddling': Top MAGA activist accuses Trump DOJ of 'grift' in now-deleted posts","text":"In an article for NBC published Thursday, journalist Ken Dilanian noted that senior Justice Department (DOJ) officials' greenlighting of a major corporate merger has created rifts within the MAGA movement.\n\nThe involved companies hired operatives aligned with President Donald Trump to lobby the Justice Department to reverse a longstanding internal antitrust position, setting off firestorms about what MAGA activist Laura Loomer — also an informal personnel advisor to President Donald Trump — described as \"influence peddling\" in a series of deleted tweets.\n\nLast month, the DOJ abruptly reversed its opposition to Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s proposed $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks.

Although Ottawa maintains that only a tiny fraction of the drug entering the U.S. originates from Canadian territory, officials say they’ve already taken steps to tighten border security.Trump, however, sees it differently. “Well, they have to pay a fair rate – that’s all. It’s very simple. They have been charging very, very high tariffs to our farmers, some over 200% and they’ve been treating our farmers very badly,” he said when asked about the new measures.Live EventsCarney reached out but no talks happenedCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reportedly reached out before the tariff hike took effect, but no conversation took place.“We haven’t spoken to Canada today. He’s (Carney) called and we’ll, we’ll see,” Trump told reporters at the White House just hours before the new rates were made public.Carney’s office did not respond to media requests. On Wednesday, he said that while trade talks with Washington had been “constructive,” a final deal by the deadline was unlikely.He added that a complete rollback of U.S. tariffs was not on the table.Canada’s response remains dividedWith no clear agreement in place, pressure is mounting inside Canada. Carney must coordinate with ten provinces, each pulling in different directions. Some want a strong counter-response, others a more measured approach.Premier Doug Ford of Ontario, Canada’s industrial powerhouse and the province most exposed to U.S. trade disruption, pushed hard for retaliation. “Canada shouldn't settle for anything less than the right deal. Now is not the time to roll over. We need to stand our ground,” he said in a post on X.Ford has called for a 50% counter-tariff on U.S. steel and aluminium imports.Carney, speaking in June, warned that if no deal was reached by the August 1 deadline, Canada would likely impose new levies on American steel and aluminium.A vulnerable trading partnerCanada ships around three-quarters of its exports to the U.S. The country’s manufacturing-heavy export sector, including cars, steel, and aluminium, stands to be hit hardest.Roughly 90% of Canadian exports to the U.S. in May qualified under the USMCA, according to government data. But those that don’t comply now face steep new tariffs.The figures also show a significant shift: the share of Canadian exports heading to the U.S. dropped by 10 percentage points over the last year, falling to 68%. Analysts say the shift reflects a push to diversify, as some companies seek new markets to avoid the uncertainty of U.S. policy.Despite the tension, economists believe the Canadian economy will avoid a recession, citing unexpected resilience and trade adaptation.Wider Global Impact: 68 Countries AffectedTrump’s order didn’t just target Canada. New tariffs were imposed on 68 nations and the European Union, with a baseline rate of 10% for unlisted countries.Taiwan will now face a 20% tariff, Pakistan 19%, and Lesotho — initially threatened with a 50% levy — will now see a 15% rate. The same 15% tariff applies to imports from Israel, Iceland, Ghana, Ecuador, Fiji and Guyana.A senior U.S. official, speaking anonymously, said the rates were based on each country’s trade imbalance with the U.S. and their regional economic weight.Mexico Granted a 90-Day BreatherEarlier Thursday, Trump held a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. Following the conversation, he agreed to a 90-day negotiation window, averting a planned tariff increase to 30%.During this period, Mexico will continue to pay the existing 25% duty on non-USMCA goods.“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow and we got 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue,” Sheinbaum wrote on X.Trump described the call as “very successful,” saying the leaders had “got to know each other better.” He said that under the arrangement, U.S.-bound Mexican imports of copper, aluminium and steel will face tariffs of up to 50%. Cars will be taxed at 25%.He also claimed Mexico had agreed to eliminate its “non-tariff trade barriers” without offering details.USMCA Under Strain as Trump Signals ShiftSome goods continue to be protected under the USMCA, the three-way deal Trump negotiated during his first term. But he now appears to have cooled on the agreement.The deal is up for renegotiation next year. Trump, in recent comments, indicated frustration with both Mexico and Canada, accusing them of taking advantage of the U.S. on trade.U.S. Census Bureau data shows the trade imbalance with Mexico reached $171.5 billion last year, up sharply from $63.3 billion in 2016, the year before Trump took office.Multiple Deals in MotionThe flurry of tariff activity on Thursday capped days of deal-making. Trump said, “We have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country,” though he declined to name the nations involved.New agreements have reportedly been reached with the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Cambodia and Thailand. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News that the deals with Cambodia and Thailand came after both countries agreed to halt a border conflict.European Union officials were still working on the framework for taxing imported vehicles. Meanwhile, Switzerland and Norway were said to still be awaiting clarity on their own rates.A Policy That Keeps ShiftingTrump’s current tariff strategy has evolved quickly. Back in April, a previous round of tariff announcements triggered a stock market slide and recession fears. To contain the fallout, Trump introduced a 90-day negotiating period, but as deadlines passed without enough deals, the White House ramped up pressure again.The unpredictability has rattled markets and governments. While Trump sees tariffs as leverage, economists warn that the costs will eventually filter down to U.S. consumers and businesses. For now, the pressure has shifted to America’s biggest trading partners — and they’ll need to decide how to respond.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump increases tariff on CanadaCanada US trade relationsfentanyl smuggling Canadasteel aluminum tariffsCanada counter tariffs on US importstrade talks Canada USOntario Premier Doug FordUSMCA compliancetransshipment levy Canada\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

In an executive order, the president made official his agreements with prominent trading partners such as the European Union, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. Trump's order, which came hours before a self-imposed deadline for trade deals, also unilaterally sets rates for countries that did not reach agreements with him. For example, Israel, Switzerland and Taiwan. Switzerland's rate will be set higher than previously threatened at 39%, while Taiwan's will be set lower at 20%. It’s effectively a reset of the world’s trade relations, one that is ostensibly designed to benefit the United States with expensive tariff rates not seen in nearly a century. Trump has touted the $125 billion in revenue his already-existent import taxes have brought in, with hundreds of billions more pledged by a handful of nations in the form of investments. Yet it’s come at the cost of slower economic growth and the prospect of already stubborn inflation reheating. Trump's order Thursday says that the new duties will not take effect until Aug. 7. Goods shipped by vessel will not be affected by the new tariff rates until Oct. 5. Those items account for more than half of U.S. imports, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. This week, Trump and top administration officials had insisted there would be no further delays after the 12:01 a.m. ET Friday deadline. In fact, just hours before the White House released Thursday’s executive order Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick shouted to reporters outside the White House that there would be “no extension” to the deadline. But earlier Thursday, Trump did agree to a 90-day extension on talks with with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum. Mexico is the United States' largest individual trading partner. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told CNBC Thursday morning that he would be discussing with the president an extension of China’s tariff deadline, which is coming up on Aug. 12. With the newly signed tariffs not taking effect for some time, uncertainty will likely linger for consumers and businesses trying to plan for the rest of the year and beyond. “Some will argue higher tariffs will be compensated by lower uncertainty,” analysts with Bank of America wrote in a note to clients this week upon the announcement of an agreement with the European Union. “And yes, uncertainty could come down in the near term, but we doubt it will go away.” One unnamed manufacturer in a Dallas Federal Reserve survey released this week put it bluntly: “Tariffs.

Brown will adopt the government's definition of \"male\" and \"female,\" for example, and must remove any consideration of race from the admissions process.\n\nBrown President Christina H. Paxson said the deal preserves Brown's academic independence. The terms include a clause saying the government cannot dictate curriculum or the content of academic speech at Brown.\n\n\"The University's foremost priority throughout discussions with the government was remaining true to our academic mission, our core values and who we are as a community at Brown,\" Paxson wrote.\n\nIt is the latest deal between an Ivy League school and the Trump administration, which has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at colleges Trump decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.\n\nThe Brown deal has similarities with one signed last week by Columbia University, which the government called a roadmap for other universities. Unlike that agreement, however, Brown's does not include an outside monitor.\n\nThe three-year agreement with Brown restores dozens of suspended grants and contracts. It also calls for the federal government to reimburse Brown for $50 million in unpaid federal grant costs.\n\nThe settlement puts an end to three federal investigations involving allegations of antisemitism and racial bias in Brown admissions, with no finding of wrongdoing. In a campus letter, Paxson anticipated questions about why the university would settle if it didn't violate the law. She noted Brown has faced financial pressure from federal agencies along with \"a growing push for government intrusion\" in academics.\n\nSigning the agreement resolves the government's concerns without sacrificing university values, she said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Northwestern University faculty members urge 'no deal' with Trump administration\n\n\"We stand solidly behind commitments we repeatedly have affirmed to protect all members of our community from harassment and discrimination, and we protect the ability of our faculty and students to study and learn academic subjects of their choosing, free from censorship,\" she wrote.\n\nBrown agreed to several measures aimed at addressing allegations of antisemitism on its campus in Providence, Rhode Island. The school said it will renew partnerships with Israeli academics and encourage Jewish day school students to apply to Brown. By the end of this year, Brown must hire an outside organization - to be chosen jointly by Brown and the government - to conduct a campus survey on the climate for Jewish students.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said Brown's deal ensures students will be judged \"solely on their merits, not their race or sex.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" McMahon said in a statement.\n\nThe settlement requires Brown to disclose a wealth of data on students who apply to and are admitted to the university, with information about their race, grades and standardized test scores. The data will be subject to a \"comprehensive audit\" by the government.\n\nIt bars Brown from giving preference to applicants because of their race. A 2023 Supreme Court decision already forbids such consideration, but the deal appears to go further, stopping Brown from using any \"proxy for racial admission,\" including personal statements or \"diversity narratives.\"\n\nThe $50 million in payments to local workforce development organizations agreed to by Brown are to be paid over 10 years.\n\nThat's \"a step forward\" from paying a fine to the government, as Columbia agreed to do, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, an organization of major universities. Still, Mitchell said, it remains unclear whether Brown and other universities are clear of governmental pressure.\n\n\"Let's remember, these are deals. These are not policies,\" Mitchell said. \"I had hoped that the Trump administration, when it came in, was going to be interested in having serious policy discussions about the future of higher education. They've yet to do that.\"\n\nColumbia last week agreed to pay $200 million to the government as part of its settlement. In negotiations with Harvard, the Trump administration has been pressing for the Cambridge, Massachusetts, school to pay far more.\n\nIn another agreement, the University of Pennsylvania pledged to modify school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a deal that included no fine.\n\nAssociated Press writer Cheyanne Mumphrey contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

\n\nNada, nothing, zilch. \n\nA big fat nothing. \n\nAnd then, having spent four years lying and exaggerating and slandering and plotting, they got away with it.\n\nThe people who had insisted that Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had colluded to steal an American election just moved on and hoped that nothing would happen, or that no one had noticed.\n\nAdam Schiff moved seamlessly into the Senate.\n\nMaddow and the hosts of the asylum-outbreak that is “The View” kept pretending that they had been right all along. \n\nAt present the mainstream media seems to have decided to pretend that they never pushed the Russia hoax and that they don’t know what Trump and his supporters are even talking about.\n\nFortunately not everybody has their Biden-esque short-term memory problems.\n\nSpeaking to my colleague Miranda Devine this week, President Trump said that he had resisted calls to go after Hillary Clinton during his first term in office, despite all the rally chants against her.\n\nAs he told the Pod Force One, he felt that it would be “inappropriate” to go after his political opponent in that way, and to pursue his former rival in the courts. \n\nAnd there was a time when that might have been the case. \n\nTo have pursued a former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State and Presidential candidate would undoubtedly have been divisive.\n\nUnfortunately for Trump the Democrats had a different set of standards. \n\nThey had no problem going after him even after he had won an election fair and square. \n\nThey had no problem toxifying the political landscape and undermining the sanctity of the voting booth.\n\nNow they say that Trump is being merely vindictive, or trying to distract attention, by going back to these issues. \n\nBut they are important issues.\n\nIf elected officials and parts of the media spend years pushing conspiracy theories that have absolutely no evidence to back them up then there should be a price to pay. \n\nAnd there should, at the very least, be some kind of investigation.\n\nAfter the disaster that was January 6, 2021 the House had no problem at all with setting up a Committee to look into what happened that day.\n\nIf there can be a House Committee on January 6th why shouldn’t there be one on the Russia collusion hoax? \n\nWhy shouldn’t we find out which parts of the intelligence community knowingly worked on promoting lies about a sitting US President? \n\nAnd why shouldn’t we learn just how wide, deep and high-up that conspiracy really went?\n\nPresident Trump can easily focus on moving this country forward. \n\nAnother week of trade deal successes shows that. \n\nBut as a country we can´t just move beyond an era in which powerful people tried to undermine the Presidency and then just got away with it.\n\nThe Time’s lie about Gaza makes peace harder\n\nTalking of pushing lies, the New York Times has had to about-turn this week after lying to their readers on the front-page.\n\nA terrible photo of a sickly child in Gaza was given to Times readers as evidence of a “famine” in Gaza.\n\nIn fact the poor child has been sick since birth, having been born with cerebral palsy. \n\nThe Times quietly changed its headline to acknowledge that the child in question had “pre-existing health problems.”\n\nBy then the Times had pushed its lie around the world.\n\nThis week Hamas hardened its negotiating position, making a peace deal harder. \n\nOne of their calculations seems to be that international pressure on Israel will force Israel — not Hamas — to a compromise.\n\nSeems its OK to embolden terrorists if you’re the lying Gray Lady.","summary":"“Deflection,” “Distraction” and “Dishonest” are just some of the accusations leveled at President Trump recently for saying he’d like to look into past Democrat conspiracies against him.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/its-important-to-get-answers-on-hillary-clintons-russiagate-plot/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-t875ecevj-1754006351983.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1753991997&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jpGUCYFo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-01 00:29:46","author":"Douglas Murray","authors":["Douglas Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.682},{"id":347105510,"title":"Trump raises tariff on Canadian goods to 35%, escalating US-Canada trade tensions","text":"Trump raises tariff on Canadian goods to 35%\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order increasing tariffs on Canadian imports from 25% to 35% on all products not covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, effective August 1, 2025, according to a White House announcement early Thursday. Goods that are routed through a third country to avoid the new tariffs will face a transshipment levy of 40%, as specified in a White House fact sheetThe White House justified the tariff hike by citing what it called Canada’s “continued inaction and retaliation” in bilateral disputes. In response, President Trump asserted, “We have no choice but to ensure fairness and the protection of American industries,” signaling possible further escalation if Canada retaliates.This marks the highest broad-based tariff the U.S. has levied on Canadian goods in modern history. A previous rate of 25% had already been in effect across a range of products, with sector-specific tariffs as high as 50% on aluminum and steel. The 35% duty now applies broadly to Canadian exports—affecting industries from automobiles and agriculture to metals—which collectively account for about 75% of Canada’s export market.The announcement also coincides with contentious diplomatic developments. On the eve of the deadline, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared Canada’s intent to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state, pending elections and specific criteria. Live EventsPresident Trump publicly linked this decision to the trade dispute, writing on his Truth Social account, “That make it hard for [us] to make trade deal with them,” and firmly establishing an August 1 deadline for new tariffs if no agreement was reached.In 2024, Canada was the second-largest U.S. trading partner, with $761.8 billion in two-way trade. Economists caution that the new tariffs could destabilize supply chains already strained by previous rounds of duties and post-pandemic disruptions, triggering inflationary pressures and threatening jobs on both sides of the border.As of Friday morning, Canada has not announced countermeasures but government officials are reportedly considering a range of responses. The Trudeau administration, ousted from office in 2024, had previously favored strategic retaliatory tariffs and appeals through the World Trade Organization. With little immediate prospect for resolution, economists and trade attorneys expect a turbulent period for U.S.-Canada commerce and ongoing uncertainty for multinational businesses.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump raises tariffsExportDonald TrumpTariffCanadatransshipment levytruth socialWhite House\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The postponement by 90 days came after talks with his counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\nThe 79-year-old Republican has made tariffs core to his protectionist brand of hard-right politics. On Thursday, he claimed that the US economy had \"no chance of survival or success\" without tariffs.\n\nBut the latest salvo came amid legal challenges against Trump's use of emergency economic powers. On Thursday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in cases brought against Trump's blanket tariffs targeting different countries.\n\nAnd questions linger over the effectiveness of Trump's grand plans, or even whether he will hold firm on his most drastic threats.\n\nWhile Trump has touted a surge in customs revenues since the start of the year, economists warn the duties could fuel inflation.\n\nProponents of his policy argue that their impact will be one-off, but analysts are awaiting further economic data to gauge for more persistent effects.\n\n China question mark \n\nAmong those who managed to strike deals with Washington were Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and the European Union.\n\nBritain also reached a pact with the United States, although it was not originally targeted by higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\n\nWashington did not finalize a deal with neighboring Canada, but Trump reached agreement with Mexico to maintain an existing 25 percent duty on its products.\n\nCanada, however, was slapped with duties of 35 percent in the Trump executive order.\n\nAn exemption for goods entering the country under a North American trade pact remained in place, according to the White House. But transshipped goods to evade the 35 percent duty would face even higher levels.\n\nCanada's trade relations with the United States came under renewed threat after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nNotably excluded from the latest drama was China, which faces an August 12 deadline instead, when duties could bounce back to higher levels.\n\nWashington and Beijing had slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods, bringing them to triple-digit levels before both countries reached agreement in May to temporarily lower these duties.\n\nThe superpowers are now working towards extending their truce.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"President Donald Trump ordered the reimposition of tariffs on dozens of trading partners Thursday -- his cornerstone strategy for reshaping global trade to benefit the US economy.

Both are believed to apply to Hoffa’s situation.\n\nDuring his 14-year tenure as president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Hoffa had strong ties to American mobsters and was even implicated in their criminal activities. In 1967, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison after being convicted of jury tampering, fraud, and using pension funds to pay mobsters in exchange for kickbacks. His sentence was then commuted by former President Richard Nixon in 1971, but he was unable to return to the labor union he had led.\n\nHoffa tried to regain control of the Teamsters until his disappearance on July 30, 1975, when he was last seen standing outside a Detroit restaurant. Hoffa was supposed to meet two mobsters at the establishment, but he reportedly called his wife to say they never showed up before he went missing.\n\nSeven years later, he was legally declared dead by a local Michigan judge despite his body never being found.

The company's cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew by 17.5% from the previous year.Even so, Wall Street expected Amazon's forecast for operating income to be higher than it was. The company's earnings forecast of $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion was lower than the average estimate of $19.4 billion. The company's short-term profitability was in doubt because of this less-than-ideal guidance, which caused its stock to drop 3% in after-hours trading, as per a report by The Guardian.Live EventsALSO READ: New Jersey under state of emergency as flash flood warning hits Mid-Atlantic and NortheastPeople were very interested in Amazon's earnings, especially since the company had a rough start to the year. The market liked the revenue numbers, but it was still unsure if Amazon could keep its high margins in the face of international challenges and rising costs.What do Trump's tariffs mean for Amazon's future?Donald Trump's harsh trade policies, especially his plan to put big tariffs on a lot of goods, have hurt Amazon's online business. The company depends a lot on sellers from other countries and goods that are brought in, as per a report by The Guardian.There was talk earlier this year that Amazon would include itemized pricing for items that were subject to tariffs, but that didn't happen. Political uncertainty about US trade relations has made investors worried again about Amazon's future costs and pricing strategy.Before the earnings report on Thursday, Amazon's stock had only slightly recovered from a drop in the first quarter, when worries about tariffs and problems with the supply chain shook the tech sector.

Amazon is likely to spend a huge $100 billion by 2025, with most of that going toward AI infrastructure.The company has already spent billions of dollars on huge data centers, such as a $20 billion investment in Pennsylvania, which is the largest private sector investment in the state's history, and a huge 1,200-acre facility in Indiana. Amazon has also made a strong partnership with AI startup Anthropic, putting in $8 billion and promising more to come, as per a report by The Guardian.Amazon also signed a licensing deal with the New York Times, which says it will pay up to $25 million a year to use its content to train AI and make summaries through products like Alexa. It's all part of Amazon's plan to stay ahead in the AI race, where it competes with Google, Meta, and Microsoft.As Amazon moves into the future of AI, it still has to deal with old problems like trade politics and keeping costs down. Investors are still wondering if the tech giant can find a way to balance new ideas with financial stability.FAQsWhy did Amazon's stock fall despite strong revenue?Investors are concerned about lower-than-expected operating income and ongoing tariff uncertainties under Trump's proposed policies.How is Amazon investing in artificial intelligence?Amazon intends to spend $100 billion by 2025, primarily on AI, including significant investments in data centers and a partnership with AI startup Anthropic.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onAmazon stock dipearnings reportoperating income guidanceTrump tariffsAWS revenue growthartificial intelligence investmentcloud divisionAmazon\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

If you’re saying international law could eventually impose obligations or criminal proceedings against nations responsible for emissions and resulting climate impacts... sure, in theory. But for that to materialise, we would need clear impacts — driven not just by climate variability but by climate change. You would have to detect trends in underlying physical phenomena and attribute those specifically to climate change. But with global warming around 1-1.5°C, we don’t yet have strong anthropogenic signals in most events. Yes, the planet has warmed, but it is amplifying existing phenomena, not creating entirely new ones.\n\n Then there is the question of consequences — how many people are in harm’s way? Populations are moving into coastal zones for economic opportunity, not away from them. All this makes adjudicating these cases difficult. I’m sceptical that this will result in compelling or actionable international legal findings.\n\nAnand Grover: The ICJ opinion is a legal statement, not an enforceable judgment. It doesn’t allow states or individuals to easily show causality between a state’s inaction and specific harm. That linkage is hard to prove. Say you want to show that a state failed to act and that caused a temperature rise of 1.5°C — how do you prove that link? And as Ted mentioned, these events would likely have occurred regardless, though climate change may exacerbate them.\n\n Also, the structural problems in the international legal system remain. The U.S., a major emitter, backed out of the Paris Agreement and continues to subsidise fossil fuels. If you can’t hold such states accountable, how will you hold anyone else? Even if the ICJ issued an enforceable order — unlikely — the UN Security Council could block enforcement. As we have seen in other cases such as Gaza, enforcement is political. That said, there is a positive: the ruling provides legal grounding for domestic courts. Countries that have ratified and incorporated treaties can now use this to hold their own governments accountable. That is useful, particularly for vulnerable island nations. But attributing harm to specific countries remains difficult.\n\n Anand, the court reaffirmed the 1.5°C threshold from the Paris Agreement, but we are likely to cross that soon. Should the court have gone further in addressing that?\n\nAnand Grover: I don’t think so. The court can’t invent scientific facts. It must rely on established findings from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) or other expert bodies. It can only say that there is a duty to reduce emissions to stay below 1.5°C, based on those findings. But it cannot prescribe emission limits or action plans. That is not its mandate. Also, as we know, targets have never really been met. The U.S. has withdrawn (from the Paris Agreement); others aren’t cooperating.\n\n Ted, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a rollback of Obama-era regulations meant to curb carbon emissions that were undergirded by the Endangerment Finding. How do you see the ICJ’s references to historical responsibility in this context?\n\nTed Nordhaus: This all comes back to sovereignty. No sovereign nation will dismantle its energy system because a court tells them to — not the U.S., not India, not China. That is the reality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ‘endangerment finding’ never really had teeth. The Biden administration tried to use it to phase out combustion engines by 2032, but it became a political liability.\n\n There is this idea that international courts or legal mechanisms will force painful transitions onto reluctant countries. That is just not going to happen. The ICJ ruling doesn’t change that. The politics aren’t there. You won’t get international legal action to translate into significant domestic shifts in major economies.\n\n Would the Loss and Damage Fund may be more effective than the ICJ ruling?\n\nTed Nordhaus: That is a false choice. Neither the ICJ ruling nor the fund is likely to push wealthy nations to provide substantial compensation. History shows they have not been serious about it. What little has come through is mostly rebranded development aid. If developing nations are waiting for climate reparations to finance development, they will be waiting a long time. Worse, the idea of reparations and legal redress has kept many of these countries tethered to frameworks that often restrict their access to energy. That is a poor trade-off.\n\n These mechanisms were created by Western environmentalists. Trying to co-opt them to advance equity has failed. Developing countries should focus on their own development using whatever resources they can muster.\n\nAnand Grover: I agree in part. Many international conventions were created to hold developing countries accountable. They were not applied equally to the West. For instance, human rights standards were used against countries in the Global South, but the West ignores them at home — take U.S. immigration policy, for example. Now, the West is in economic decline. Mr. Trump wants manufacturing back in the U.S. because wages are high and companies moved to China. To do that, he is relaxing environmental regulations. Yet he won’t be held accountable. If the U.S. can ignore global norms, how can we expect compliance from others?\n\n Still, I believe domestic courts can use the ICJ ruling effectively. Environmental groups can argue that governments failed to act. That is more feasible locally. But even this is getting harder. Courts in India, like in the U.S., are increasingly weak and politicised. Ten years ago, we couldn’t imagine the Indian Supreme Court functioning as it does now. Just as in the U.S., we would not have expected the Supreme Court to undo affirmative action 10 years ago.\n\n Would you agree with Ted that developing nations should not rely on reparations?\n\nAnand Grover: Yes, we shouldn’t. But that doesn’t mean we abdicate responsibility. India’s emissions impact Indians. Look at Delhi’s air — every winter the city becomes unlivable. We must reduce emissions for our own sake. Technology can help, and if we develop it, we can even lead globally. But governments are beholden to corporate interests. During COVID-19, pharmaceutical companies dictated policy. The same is happening with energy. They resist upgrades because it cuts into profits. So we must act on our own, not wait for compensation.\n\n Ted, your advocacy of ecomodernism hinges on technological solutions. But if these technologies don’t reach developing countries, won’t that hinder decarbonisation?\n\nTed Nordhaus: The idea that the West develops tech and hands it off is outdated. China now leads in clean tech and exports to both the West and developing countries. India may follow. Technology flows aren’t unidirectional any more. The 1990s framework of common but differentiated responsibilities and tech transfer is no longer valid. Yet the ICJ ruling still operates on that model. It doesn’t reflect today’s reality where clean tech flows in many directions. If we were crafting a framework today, we wouldn’t do it the way the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) did in 1990.\n\n Ted, do you see any positives in this ruling?\n\nTed Nordhaus: Honestly, no. It feels like a zombie ruling — left over from a framework that has lost relevance. With the collapse of the post-Cold War order, this is just another effort to keep old institutions looking relevant.\n\nAnand Grover: It still has value domestically. Activists and lawyers can use it to push their governments to act. But internationally, prospects are bleak.\n\n The U.K.’s Shadow Energy Secretary claims that the ruling will trigger a wave of litigation against developed nations. Do you agree?\n\nAnand Grover: No, that is alarmist. The ruling is vague on obligations and proof standards. Internationally, it won’t result in litigation. Domestically, it can be used to argue that governments have failed to act. That is where the real potential lies.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/can-the-icj-ruling-force-rich-nations-to-pay-for-historical-emissions/article69879148.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/c3f3un/article69880115.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/APTOPIX_Climate_World_Court_64943.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-01 00:17:00","author":"Kunal Shankar.

The Ukrainian president said he believed Russia could be “pushed” to stop the war. “But if the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia, that means even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise neighbouring countries,” he said on Thursday, speaking virtually to a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the cold war-era Helsinki accords. Russia’s overnight strikes wounded at least 150 people, authorities said.\n\nRussia fired more than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles at Ukraine – with Kyiv the main target – from late Wednesday to early Thursday, the Ukrainian air force said. One missile tore through a nine-storey residential building in the capital’s west, ripping off its facade, authorities said. Zelenskyy said the injured including 16 children and six police officers. It was the largest number of children hurt in a single attack on Kyiv during the war, the rescue service said.\n\nDonald Trump criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine, suggesting new sanctions against Moscow were coming. “Russia – I think it’s disgusting what they’re doing,” the US president said on Thursday. “We’re going to put sanctions,” he said, before adding: “I don’t know that sanctions bother him,” referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s attack came just days after Trump issued a 10-to-12-day ultimatum for Moscow to halt its invasion or face sanctions.\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament has passed a law restoring independence to two anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling another law adopted last week that prompted the biggest street protests since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago, reports Shaun Walker. Several hundred protesters outside the parliament building in Kyiv erupted into chants of “the people are the power” as the bill passed on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hope the new law will put an end to what had threatened to become a political crisis domestically and had worried European allies. He signed the law into force swiftly after the vote.\n\nRussia claimed on Thursday that it had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar, a strategically important military hub in the eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy called Moscow’s claim “Russian disinformation”, saying: “Ukrainian units are defending our positions.” Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko said Russian forces “have full control over the entire northern and eastern part” of Chasiv Yar, including districts that had been hardest to get. But he said fighting for the western side was ongoing, with the situation “very difficult”.

But he definitely wasn’t ready to actually answer direct questions about his friendship with the infamous sex trafficking billionaire!\n\nHe was asked on Monday about why they really fell out, something Trump had never really been forthcoming about before. He said it was because Epstein was poaching his employees. Huh. But during an Air Force One gaggle on Tuesday, the President was asked if the employees Epstein took were “young women” — and he ultimately said, “the answer is yes, they were.”\n\nNaturally, the journalists thought — as we did — of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. After all, her longstanding claim was that Ghislaine Maxwell found her working a summer job at the Mar-a-Lago spa and recruited her to come *work for* Epstein. Her *job* was as an on-call masseuse, who would travel the world on Epstein’s jet and give him massages whenever he wanted. Even though she was only 16 years old and had zero massage training.\n\nSurprisingly, Trump confirmed this was exactly what he was talking about. He told the reporters:\n\n“I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her.”\n\nSo… Trump is admitting here to knowing Epstein was taking young girls from his clubs? Knowing Epstein was using Mar-a-Lago as a hunting ground for his sex trafficking? Knowing in particular that he took this 16-year-old girl?? But he did nothing about it? Just ended the friendship, if we even believe that. Seems pretty dubious, considering he was still publicly declaring Jeff “a terrific guy” in print two years later. And allegedly sending him that “we have certain things in common, Jeffrey” note for his birthday after that.\n\nBut importantly… he didn’t contact the authorities? He didn’t try to protect this young girl? If he knew, like he now says he did, he let his pal get away with horrific behavior.\n\nIf he didn’t know? If he thought it was totally fine for a 16-year-old to be his billionaire pal’s personal massage girl? And he was only annoyed at the personal slight of poaching his girls? That says something else…\n\nEither way, it looks terrible for Trump. Like we said, pretty clear he isn’t ready to answer these questions.\n\nSadly, we feel like MAGA is getting quieter on this — or even turning back to Trump’s side. Are they buying into the denials? Just willing to turn a blind eye because they don’t want to admit to themselves their hero is culpable? We don’t know… We hope we’re wrong…\n\nBut one group who won’t let it go? Virginia’s family. They’d still like answers following her suspicious death. And now, after Trump’s accidental (??) admission, the Giuffres have something to say:\n\n“We would like to clarify that it was convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell who targeted and preyed upon our then 16-year-old sister, Virginia, from Mar-a-Lago, where she was working in 2000, several years before Epstein and President Trump had their falling out.”\n\nThey’re right. Epstein didn’t actually lose his Mar-a-Lago membership until 2007. And the falling out was reported in like 2004 — with local Palm Beach outlets claiming it was over Trump stabbing Epstein in the back over some real estate.\n\nHer family said Trump admitting to knowing about Virginia being taken from Mar-a-Lago — even characterizing it by saying “he stole her” — was “shocking.” Her family now wants the President to reveal exactly what he knew and when, writing in their statement, per ABC News:\n\n“It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal actions, especially given his statement two years later that his good friend Jeffrey ‘likes women on the younger side . . . no doubt about it.'”\n\nYeah, that quote always coming back to bite Trump. He really was caught in a lie here, wasn’t he? If he wants everyone to think now that he was being virtuous, cutting ties with a pedo… That would mean he knew about the pedo thing! And did nothing! In any case, he didn’t end his friendship then if he gave that quote to New York magazine in 2002! The family ended their statement by demanding:\n\n“We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this.”\n\nDamn straight. If only everyone was still demanding answers.\n\n[Image via Fox News/YouTube/DOJ/BBC/MEGA/WENN.]","summary":"Donald Trump really screwed up this time.

During an appearance on “The Evening Edit,” Jarrett said the actions of key figures such as Clinton, the DNC, and George Soros officials may have inadvertently extended the statute of limitations for potential criminal prosecution.\n\n“The cover-up, Liz, has been ongoing for years, which extends the statute of limitations in any criminal conspiracy case. The clock actually starts ticking when deliberately concealed evidence is discovered, which is recently,” Jarrett told host Elizabeth MacDonald.\n\nJarrett said that if the FBI were to discover incriminating documents hidden by former FBI Director James Comey, such attempts to conceal or destroy evidence would constitute obstruction of justice and reset the statute of limitations.\n\n“So, for example, the new FBI under Kash Patel just discovered incriminating documents in burn bags hidden at the FBI. They found hard drives squirreled away under lock and key by Comey. And attempting to conceal or destroy evidence relevant to investigations, that is obstruction. And the last overt act in the conspiracy starts the clock anew,” Jarrett said.\n\nRussiagate, he added, could constitute a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy. (RELATED: ‘The Real Russian Conspiracy’: Turley Explains How Media And Clinton Campaign ‘Derailed’ Trump’s First Term)\n\n“And, you know, I think it constitutes a broad criminal conspiracy by a great many corrupt actors, including the ones I named. And I would look at defrauding the government, deprivation of rights under color of law, and, most importantly, obstruction of justice,” Jarrett said.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released “overwhelming evidence,” saying that former President Barack Obama and his national security team “manufactured and politicized intelligence” following Trump’s 2016 victory, citing the Steele Dossier, a fabricated and unverified report alleging Trump-Russia ties, as a key example.\n\nThe Clinton campaign and the DNC funded the Steele Dossier, a collection of reports compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele in 2016, containing unverified allegations about President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. The dossier was later discredited, with FBI analyst Brian Auten saying in October 2022 that the FBI offered Steele $1 million to verify the dossier, but Steele failed to do so.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

House.","url":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-us-announces-construction-of-usd-200-million-white-house-state-ballroom-7036373.html","image":"https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ANI-20250731193038.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-01

House has announced plans to build a $200m (£151m) new ballroom, fulfilling an often-repeated desire of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe new ballroom will be built alongside a \"modernised\" East Wing of the White House, which currently houses the offices of First Lady Melania Trump and other key White House posts.\n\nThe money will be donated directly by Trump and other so-far anonymous donors, with work beginning in September, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised to build a \"beautiful\" ballroom at the White House, and in 2016 offered to pay $100m during Barack Obama's administration, which the then-President rejected.\n\nIn a briefing for reporters at the White House on Thursday, Leavitt said that the \"much needed and exquisite addition\" to the White House will be approximately 90,000 (8,360 sq m) with a seating capacity of about 650.\n\nCurrently, many formal White House functions are held in the White House's East Room, which can seat approximately 200 people.\n\nThe new ballroom, Leavitt added, would also eliminate the need for a \"large and unsightly tent\" to be installed for state dinners and other large events, which sometimes include world leaders.\n\nAccording to Leavitt, construction is expected to be completed \"long before\" the end of Trump's term in office in January 2029.\n\n\"The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organisations to preserving the special history of the White House, while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future administrations and generations of Americans to come,\" Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said in a statement.\n\nRenderings provided by the White House show that the ballroom will be similar architecturally to the rest of the White House, with a lavish interior including chandeliers and ornate columns.\n\nOffices currently housed in the East Wing of the White House, adjacent to the construction, including that of First Lady Melania Trump, will be temporarily relocated.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly voiced his wishes for a new ballroom as part of renovations to the White House, which has already seen the installation of two large flagpoles, new gold decorations in the Oval Office and the bulldozing and paving over of the famed Rose Garden.\n\n\"There's never been a President that's good at ballrooms,\" Trump said at an event at the White House on Thursday. \"I'm good at building things.\"\n\nTrump added that \"they've always had to get tents\" for large events at the White House, which he described as a disaster. \"It's not a pretty sight.\"\n\nEarlier this week during a Scotland meeting with European Council President Ursula Van der Leyen, Trump told her that \"we're building a great ballroom at the White House.\"\n\n\"No president knew how to build a ballroom,\" Trump said while sitting in another ballroom at his Turnberry golf resort. \"I could take this one, drop it right down there, and it would be beautiful.\"\n\nIn 2016, when on the campaign trail during the administration of Barack Obama, Trump famously offered to contribute $100m for the construction of a new ballroom for the White House to use to host events.\n\nAt the time, then-Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that the suggestion was \"not something that was at all seriously considered\".\n\n\"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to have a shiny gold Trump sign…on any part of the White House,\" Earnest told reporters.","summary":"The White House has announced plans

Beast pulls story alleging Melania-Epstein connection after lawyers dispute framing","text":"The Daily Beast has pulled an article detailing allegations by journalist Michael Wolff that Melania Trump was introduced to her husband Donald Trump via a modeling agent connected to Jeffrey Epstein, after a challenge from the first lady’s lawyers. \"Editor’s Note. After this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump’s attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding,\" The Daily Beast posted in place of the article. The hyperlink to the article appears to have been amended to : https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-this-story-has-been-removed/. Wolff initially made the scandalous allegations in an interview with Daily Beast chief content officer Joanna Coles for The Daily Beast Podcast, Saturday. The two were discussing Trump’s alleged connections with the disgraced New York financier. The two were friends for many years, but ultimately had a falling out. The president claimed Tuesday that Epstein had been stealing staff from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan prison while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking of minors charges. Wolff claimed Melania was \"very involved in this Epstein relationship.\" JEFFREY EPSTEIN THROWN OUT OF MAR-A-LAGO FOR HIRING THE HELP: TRUMP \"[Melania] was very involved in this Epstein relationship. There is this model thing, and she’s introduced by a model agent, both of whom Trump and Epstein are involved with. She’s introduced to Trump that way, Epstein knows her well,\" Wolff alleged. President Trump has been dogged by demands by his MAGA base to release the so-called \"Epstein files\" after a series of missteps by his Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Bondi had distributed binders labeled \"Epstein Files: Phase One\" to a handful of conservative influencers in February. The binders failed to include any heretofore unknown details surrounding the case – which has been a magnet for unfounded conspiracy theories alleging that Epstein was an intelligence agent sexually blackmailing America’s most powerful figures whose death wasn’t actually a suicide – which caused an outcry among the president’s most online supporters. Bondi subsequently made comments that some interpreted to mean an Epstein client list was \"sitting\" on her desk, though she later clarified in June that she was referring to the Epstein file, not a \"client list.\" The DOJ ultimately released a two-page memo that denied a \"client list\" existed and claimed there was no \"credible evidence\" Epstein had blackmailed other individuals via his sex trafficking activities. The DOJ memo failed to quell the furor in Trump’s base for greater transparency in the Epstein case, prompting Trump’s ire. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Trump has disavowed his supporters who remain fixated on the Epstein scandal, labeling them \"weaklings\" who are buying into a \"hoax\" orchestrated by the Democrats. \"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bullshit,’ hook, line, and sinker, they haven’t learned their lesson, and probably never will, even after being conned by the Lunatic Left for 8 long years,\" Trump wrote on TruthSocial. Wolff’s credibility in the journalism industry has faced scrutiny. In 2018, the journalist told Bill Maher he had evidence that President Trump was having an affair and claimed that a clue to his mistress’ identity could be found at the end of his White House tell-all \"Fire and Fury.\" Readers identified passages that seemed to implicate then-UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Haley called the insinuation \"disgusting\" and \"highly offensive.\" In a subsequent interview on \"Morning Joe,\" Wolff denied that he ever insinuated Haley was having an affair with Trump, but then said he \"found it puzzling that she would deny something she was not accused of,\" prompting co-host Mika Brzezinski to accuse him of \"having fun… slurring a woman\" and end the interview abruptly. Multiple figures in Trump’s orbit also denied having made quotes attributed to them in \"Fire and Fury.\" \"The scenes in his columns aren’t recreated so much as created — springing from Wolff’s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events,\" Michell Cottle wrote of Wolff’s reporting style in a profile in the New Republic. Michael Wolff told Fox News Digital that he had nothing to do with the article. The Daily Beast and the White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hutchison, a major Hong Kong operator that is one of China’s “big three” port giants — and the only one not owned outright by the Chinese government.\n\nPrying these ports from China’s oversight is a critical move for both US national security and the global economy.\n\nNow the Chinese Communist Party is trying to block the deal, unless its state-owned COSCO joins the buyers’ group and gains veto rights over port operations.\n\nAlarmingly, all three main parties are reportedly open to letting that happen, apparently thinking that a compromised deal is better than no deal at all. \n\nBut with all that’s at stake, President Donald Trump should use every tool available — starting with the ongoing US-China trade talks — to push the original deal through and keep COSCO out.\n\nThe 43 ports that Hutchison seeks to sell would launch a global liberation from oppressive Chinese surveillance and control. \n\nIf the plan falls through — or if it’s altered to add COSCO to the ownership group — China could tighten its grip on the global shipping system, by replacing a Beijing-influenced company with a Beijing-controlled one.\n\nWhile the media has dubbed this the “Panama Canal deal,” it’s actually much bigger.\n\nThe canal, a vital artery that runs through the center of the western hemisphere, is certainly critical — but many of the other ports involved in the deal are equally so.\n\nFor example, this deal would include a port inside the Malacca Strait, the only direct maritime pathway between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. \n\nIt sees 90,000 ships and $3.5 trillion worth of global trade every year.\n\nHutchison is also looking to sell five ports that it owns on both sides of the Suez Canal, the preferred maritime commercial route between the Asian and European markets. \n\nAbout 12% of global trade, $1 trillion a year, passes through Suez.\n\nAs China’s purchases of sanctioned Iranian oil draw greater US scrutiny, Hutchison’s four ports on the southern side of the Strait of Hormuz are also critical.\n\nNearly all Iranian oil must pass through the strait, along with oil and gas from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar.\n\nIn Europe, Hutchison controls 13 ports that act as a key entry point for Chinese goods into the European Union. \n\nThe original deal would reduce China’s port foothold on the continent — and the geopolitical influence that comes with it.\n\nLike all major commercial deals, this one is complicated.\n\nApart from the two Panama Canal ports, BlackRock would retain 20% ownership of the remaining facilities; its partner, Europe-based Mediterranean Shipping Corp., would control 70%, with Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund owning the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s power in global shipping is massive.\n\nChina produces 95% of world shipping containers and all of the refrigerated ones. \n\nPorts around the world are plugged into China’s logistical software platform, LOGINK, which tracks sensitive trade, market, maritime and passenger data.\n\nHuawei’s “Smart Port” 5G telecommunication towers provide Wi-Fi — and ready surveillance capacity — at ports worldwide. \n\nA Chinese state-owned company makes more than 70% of the world’s ship-to-shore cranes (and 80% of the cranes used in America) — a major risk, according to the House Homeland Security Committee, which has alleged those cranes may be engaging in covert surveillance on behalf of the CCP.\n\nAdding state-owned COSCO to ports deal would give the CCP the power to veto any attempts to replace Huawei towers, LOGINK systems, Chinese cranes or other tools that may already be spying on behalf of the state.\n\nWith BlackRock’s minority interest in the vast bulk of these ports, replacing a private Chinese company with a state-owned one is even worse for the United States than the status quo.\n\nBreaking China’s maritime monopoly is urgent. \n\nAt the same time, America’s economic leverage has never been higher.\n\nAs Beijing trumps up patently absurd anti-monopoly investigations to stall or scuttle the BlackRock-MSC deal, the United States should Trump right back.\n\nHe must make the choice clear: Access to American markets cannot continue unless Beijing releases its maritime monopoly.\n\nElaine Dezenski heads the Center on Economic and Financial Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where Susan Soh is a research associate.","summary":"A US company and its partners are vying for 43 critical shipping ports, including the two on the Panama Canal — but Beijing is blocking the way.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/31/opinion/sos-trump-must-break-chinas-global-shipping-chokehold/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/map-story-shipping-ports-109033486.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-31 23:59:58","author":"Elaine Dezenski,Susan Soh","authors":["Elaine Dezenski","Susan Soh"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.28},{"id":347106070,"title":"Trump raises tariffs on Canada to 35% with no trade deal in sight","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that will raise his tariffs on Canada to 35 per cent starting midnight Friday, a deadline he set for a new trade deal that has failed to materialize.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order that will have new tariffs on a wide swath of U.S. trading partners to go into effect in seven days. The order keeps his “reciprocal” 10 per cent baseline tariff rate in place with higher rates for other countries that have yet to sign a new trade deal with the U.S.\n\nThe White House said Trump was raising the tariff rate because Canada “has failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl and other illicit drugs” into the U.S., as well as Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on American goods.\n\n“In response to Canada’s continued inaction and retaliation, President Trump has found it necessary to increase the tariff on Canada from 25 per cent to 35 per cent to effectively address the existing emergency,” the White House said in a statement.\n\nGoods traded under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on free trade (CUSMA) will continue to be exempted from the higher tariff, the White House confirmed. It added goods that are transshipped through other countries to avoid the 35 per cent rate will instead be charged a tariff of 40 per cent.\n\nTrump had earlier Thursday suggested many of the grievances he has repeatedly voiced about Canada, including its supply management system for the dairy industry and military spending, remain.\n\n“They have to pay a fair rate,” he told reporters at the White House. “They’ve been very, very poorly led, and all we want is fairness for our country.\n\n“We haven’t spoken to Canada today. He’s called, and we’ll see,” he added, without specifying who he was referring to.\n\nCanada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc is in Washington this week for ongoing negotiations toward a deal. His office declined to share an update on those talks when asked by Global News on Thursday.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Office also declined to comment when asked if Prime Minister Mark Carney had reached out to Trump or the White House this week.\n\nIn July, Trump delayed his slew of global “reciprocal” tariffs, including those on Canada and Mexico, to Aug. 1 with the intention of signing individual trade deals with hundreds of countries.\n\nLater that month, in a letter to Carney posted to Truth Social, Trump threatened a 35 per cent tariff on “Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs.”\n\n“If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 35 per cent that we charge,” the letter adds.\n\nThe original 25 per cent tariff was introduced under an emergency provision related to the fentanyl epidemic that has fueled overdose deaths in North America.\n\nThat order has been subject to court challenges, which led to the U.S. Court of International Trade briefly suspending them earlier this year, ruling Trump overstepped his presidential authority. A U.S. appeals court heard arguments in the case Thursday.\n\nTrump has long contended Canada has failed to combat the flow of fentanyl across the Canada-U.S. border. Canada has boosted border security and hired a fentanyl czar to oversee its federal strategy against the deadly opioid, and police forces have stepped up drug busts in recent months.\n\nAnnual drug seizure statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency show fentanyl from Canada accounts for around one per cent of all fentanyl seized at U.S. borders, with the vast majority coming from Mexico.\n\nHowever, seizures at the northern border shot up to 11 and 14 kilograms in April and May, respectively, before dropping again to one kilogram last month.\n\n“Fentanyl seizures at the northern border this fiscal year, with two months remaining, have surpassed total seizures of the past three years combined, underscoring Canada’s escalating role in this crisis,” the White House said.\n\n“The amount of fentanyl seized at the northern border to date this fiscal year could have killed more than 16 million Americans due to the drug’s potency.”\n\nThe statement added Canada’s retaliatory tariffs “further complicate bilateral efforts to address this escalating drug crisis.”\n\nCanadian officials had been tempering expectations that a trade deal would materialize ahead of Trump’s deadline.\n\n“We’re seeking the best deal for Canadians. We have not yet reached that deal. Negotiations will continue until we do,” Carney told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s possible that they (trade talks) may not conclude by the 1st of August,” Carney said at a press conference where he announced Canada’s intent to recognize a Palestinian state by September, “predicated” on several key democratic reforms.\n\nTrump escalated the situation on Thursday morning, saying Canada’s decision to recognize a Palestinian state would make it “very hard” to reach a trade deal.\n\nHe later said on Thursday the statement is “not a dealbreaker” but added when asked about the talks, “We’ll see.”\n\n—with files from Global’s Uday Rana","summary":"The White House said Trump was raising the tariff rate because Canada \"has failed to cooperate in curbing the ongoing flood of fentanyl\" and imposed retaliatory tariffs.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11314241/donald-trump-tariffs-canada-35-per-cent-order/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/da8973e43f0fedf332e30af23962981bef359109280fd4c6e640531887037df9_85ea8a.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-31 23:57:02","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":347096956,"title":"Donald Trump tariff news: Australia escapes higher tariffs under latest announcement, 10 percent base remains","text":"Australia will escape a tariff higher than 10 per cent on exports to the United States after US President Donald Trump announced his latest position on tariffs.\n\nIn an executive order issued on Friday morning, Australia time, Mr Trump changed the “reciprocal tariff” rates for countries that had faced higher than 10 per cent but had managed to strike deals with his administration.\n\nAll countries, including Australia, will be slapped with a 10 per cent tariff and many have been hit with higher rates.\n\n“President Trump’s bold trade strategy has yielded historic agreements with major trading partners, unlocking unprecedented investments in the United States and expanding market access for American goods,” a White House statement said.\n\nAt the start of the week, Mr Trump told reporters while in Scotland that he was contemplating making the base tariff rate for all countries 15-20 per cent.\n\nThe Australian Government’s message has consistently been that it sees the US tariffs as an act of “economic self-harm” and points out that the US sells vastly more into Australia than vice versa.\n\n“We’ll all see the announcement shortly, that’ll be a sovereign decision taken by the United States.

deadline for higher duties looms","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump gave Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs to negotiate a broader trade deal but was expected to issue higher final duty rates for most other countries as the clock wound down on his Friday (August 1, 2025) deal deadline.\n\nThe extension, which avoids a 30% tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade, came after a Thursday morning call between Mr. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\n\"We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,\" Sheinbaum wrote in an X social media post, adding that the Mr. Trump call was \"very good.\"\n\nApproximately 85% of Mexican exports comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25% tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico's economy ministry.\n\nMr. Trump said that the U.S. would continue to levy a 50% tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25% tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the U.S. fentanyl crisis.\n\n\"Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post without providing details.\n\nTough questions from judges\n\nMr. Trump hit Brazil on Wednesday with a steep 50% tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America's largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former President Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.\n\nThe run-up to Mr. Trump's tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Mr. Trump's use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50% on nearly all trading partners.\n\nMr. Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing U.S. trade deficit and impose his \"reciprocal\" tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.\n\nThe Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further skepticism.\n\n\"IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them,\" Judge Jimmie Reyna said at one point during the hearing.\n\nChina deal not done\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the United States believes it has the makings of a trade deal with China, but it is \"not 100% done,\" and still needs Mr. Trump's approval.\n\nU.S. negotiators \"pushed back quite a bit\" over two days of trade talks with the Chinese in Stockholm this week, Bessent said in an interview with CNBC.\n\nChina is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Mr. Trump's administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.","summary":"Trump said that the U.S. would continue to levy a 50% tariff on

statehood","text":"President Donald Trump has ramped up his trade war with Canada a day early in response to Canada's vow to support Palestinian statehood.\n\nTrump is set to impose a 35 percent tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement if he and Carney cannot make a deal by his August 1 deadline.\n\nBut Trump warned in a late night Truth Social post it would be 'very hard' to make a deal with Canada if Carney proceeds with his intention to recognize Palestine. \n\n'Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them,' Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's 35 percent tariff was announced amidst a string of surprise modifications to his reciprocal tariffs on Thursday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney previously said tariff negotiations with Washington had been constructive, but the talks may not conclude by the deadline.\n\nTalks between the two countries were at an intense phase, he added, but a deal that would remove all US tariffs was unlikely.\n\nCanada is the second largest US trading partner after Mexico, and the largest buyer of U.S. exports. \n\nIt bought $349.4 billion of US goods last year and exported $412.7 billion to the US, according to US Census Bureau data.\n\nCanada is also the top supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, and faces tariffs on both metals as well as on vehicle exports.\n\nLast month, Carney's government scrapped a planned digital services tax targeting US technology firms after Trump abruptly called off trade talks saying the tax was a 'blatant attack.'\n\nCarney followed France and Britain on Wednesday when he said his country was planning to recognize the State of Palestine at a meeting of the United Nations in September.\n\nIn announcing the decision, Carney spoke of the reality on the ground, including starvation in Gaza.\n\n'Canada condemns the fact that the Israeli government has allowed a catastrophe to unfold in Gaza,' he said.\n\nIsrael and the United States, Israel's closest ally, both rejected Carney's comments.\n\nHe convened a Cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in the battered Palestinian territory. \n\nCarney was inspired to make a change after discussing the crisis with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who announced a similar move on Tuesday.\n\nScenes of hunger and starvation have trickled out of Gaza amid a longstanding Israeli blockade which is preventing supplies from entering the territory en masse.\n\n'The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable,' Carney said.\n\n'Canada intends to recognize the State of Palestine at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025.'\n\nCarney said the intention is predicated on the Palestinian Authority 'holding general elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part, and to demilitarize the Palestinian state.'\n\nPressure to formally recognize Palestinian statehood has mounted since French President Emmanuel Macron announced that his country will become the first major Western power to do so in September.\n\nAs with France and the U.K., Canadian recognition would be largely symbolic, but it's part of a broader global shift against Israel and could increase diplomatic pressure for an end to the conflict.\n\nMore than 140 countries recognize a Palestinian state, including a dozen in Europe. \n\nMacron's announcement last week made France the first Group of Seven country - and the largest in Europe - to take that step.\n\nCanada has long supported the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel, but has said recognition should come as part of a negotiated two–state solution to the conflict.","summary":"Trump is set to impose a 35 percent tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14961013/Trump-raises-tariffs-Canada-35-percent-palestine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/01/00/100828595-0-image-a-23_1754004988844.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-31 23:47:17","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":347095580,"title":"Longtime Biden aide testifies he stood to earn up to $8M had president won re-election","text":"A longtime ally of former President Joe Biden told House Oversight Committee investigators that he could have been paid a total of $8 million if the former president won his 2024 re-election bid, a source familiar with the conversation told Fox News Digital. Michael Donilon served as senior advisor to the president for the entirety of Biden's four-year term. Their relationship goes back decades, however; Donilon first worked for Biden in 1981 when he was a U.S. senator from Delaware. He is the latest ex-Biden administration official to sit down with the committee behind closed doors as it investigates whether the former president's inner circle covered up evidence of his alleged mental decline, and if executive actions were signed via autopen without Biden's full awareness. Donilon said he did not know what the autopen was used for and did not recall having any knowledge of the autopen, the source told Fox News Digital. COMER DISMISSES BIDEN DOCTOR'S BID FOR PAUSE IN COVER-UP PROBE: 'THROWING OUT EVERY EXCUSE' But Donilon, who was the top strategist for both Biden's 2020 and 2024 campaigns, would have apparently earned some $8 million total if Biden won. Donilon told investigators that he was paid $4 million to work on Biden's 2024 campaign, the source said, information that was reported by Axios reporter Alex Thompson and CNN host Jake Tapper in their book \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\" The $4 million he would have gained in addition would have come if Biden won. Biden infamously dropped out of the 2024 race after his disastrous debate against now-President Donald Trump in June of that year, following weeks of mounting pressure by fellow Democrats – both in public and in private. Donilon told investigators he \"believes the punditry and Democrats in Congress overreacted after Joe Biden’s disastrous debate,\" the source said. Donilon also argued Biden's communications skills \"got stronger\" during his time as president, the source said. \"During his interview, Mr. Donilon admitted that Joe Biden’s presence wasn’t as commanding and he could stumble over more words. Mr. Donilon stated he was frustrated and knew it was difficult to get past the visuals of President Biden that people were seeing,\" the source said. In his opening statement, obtained by Fox News Digital, Donilon emphasized his 40-year relationship with Biden and touted the Democratic administration's accomplishments through the COVID-19 pandemic, the rebound in job growth in its wake, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act and other legislative wins.

I believed that President Biden was the best person to lead the country on the day he took the oath of office and I continued to believe that was true every day he served as President.\" Donilon is the eighth ex-Biden White House official to appear for the probe, being led by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky.
