In fact, Trump this year became only the second Republican to win the popular vote since 1988.\n\nThe vast majority of counties saw their margins shift in Trump’s direction, both in places where Republicans historically do well and places where Democrats generally have an edge.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s margins – both in raw votes and percentages – were small by historical standards, even for the past quarter century, when close elections have been the rule, including the 2000 Florida recount election and Trump’s previous two races in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump’s victory came without a big boost for down-ballot Republicans. The current narrow margin in the House of Representatives is poised to remain, and Democrats won four Senate races in key battleground states even as Vice President Kamala Harris lost those states to Trump.\n\nDuring his election night victory party, Trump declared that “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\n\nBut Wayne Steger, a DePaul University political scientist, said the election delivered mixed signals.\n\n“Inflation, immigration, some evidence of backlash against Democrats on identity politics, crime, education, and a public mood moving in a conservative direction all suggested a Republican win,” he said.\n\nStill, “I’m inclined to view it as a close election in which there was enough anti-Democratic sentiment to carry the day.”\n\nHere’s how Trump’s victory sizes up against other recent presidential elections:\n\nReasons for Trump to call it a big victory\n\nTrump won all seven of this year’s battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris, by contrast, fared worse in these states than President Joe Biden did four years earlier.\n\nTrump’s margins of victory in those seven states were wider – easily – than the margins of the seven closest states in the 2020 Trump-Biden election, and every close presidential contest this century.\n\nIncluding votes counted through November 19, Trump’s collective margin in this year’s seven battleground states was about 760,000. By comparison, the 2000 election between George W Bush and Al Gore – which the Supreme Court decided after a weeklong Florida recount – produced collective margins of about 46,000 in the seven closest states, or about one-sixteenth as much as in 2024.\n\nTrump also performed well by historical standards for someone running against the White House-occupying party. Going back to 1932, only six other candidates from the out-of-power party have taken as large a share of the vote as Trump’s near 50 percent. The others notching a higher percentage were Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980, Barack Obama in 2008 and Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump’s margin of victory in the Electoral College – 312 out of 538 – was nowhere near the landslide wins of Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1972 or Reagan in 1984. But it was bigger than four of the seven elections this century, including Biden’s four years earlier.\n\nWhere Trump’s victory looks historically small\n\nOther metrics, however, show Trump’s victory was narrow.\n\nMeasured both by vote percentages and raw votes, Trump’s margin of victory is modest, even compared with this century’s other close elections.\n\nFor votes counted through November 20, Trump’s margin over Harris was 1.62 percent. That’s smaller than any winner since Bush in 2000, when the margin was 0.51 percent. Going back further, only John F Kennedy in 1960 and Nixon in 1968 won the popular vote by smaller margins, 0.17 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.\n\nUsing raw votes, Trump’s margin was also smaller than in any election going back to 2000. At about 2.5 million, it was the fifth-smallest popular vote margin since 1960.\n\nIn both percentage and raw votes, Trump’s margin is on pace to be less than half of what Biden achieved four years earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, there is ample evidence that Trump’s strong performance at the top of the ticket did not boost down-ballot candidates much.\n\nOf the seven battleground states, five also held Senate races and one had a gubernatorial contest. The Republican candidate won Pennsylvania’s Senate race, but the Democrat won the Senate races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, and the gubernatorial contest in North Carolina. In North Carolina, Democrats also won the races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and superintendent of public instruction and were narrowly leading in a state Supreme Court race.\n\nAs the final handful of races are called, the US House is poised to end up at or near its margin from the previous two years, producing a Republican margin that is narrow by historical standards. In the state legislatures, Republicans gained only modestly in chamber control, while Democrats made inroads in other legislatures.\n\n“Trump’s victory was solid and convincing,” said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. Still, “the 2024 elections were not a general endorsement of the Republican Party. Many Republicans down ballot did not perform as well as Trump.”\n\nSo far this century, elections have been not only close, but have flipped back and forth between the parties. Since 2000, control of the presidency, the Senate or the House has flipped 16 times in 13 election cycles.\n\nIf this pattern holds, the Democrats could be well-positioned for the 2026 midterms and perhaps the 2028 presidential race.\n\n“Voters have been unhappy with the state of the country,” said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. “Unless Trump creates an abrupt change in the national mood, Democrats have a good chance at a successful 2026 midterm.”","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/how-big-was-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22T195129Z_1380474177_RC2VPAACMINX_RTRMADP_3_RUSSIA-BRICS-ARRIVALS-VENEZUELA-1730313342-HC2JeH.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:15:40","author":"Investment Program","authors":["Investment Program"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":267003182,"title":"Optical Illusion Key Takeaways From Cop29","text":"Rich countries have pledged to contribute $300bn a year by 2035 to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change after two weeks of intense negotiations at the United Nations climate summit (COP29) in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku.\n\nWhile this marks a significant increase from the previous $100bn pledge, the deal has been sharply criticised by developing nations as woefully insufficient to address the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nThis year’s summit, hosted by the oil and gas-rich former Soviet republic, unfolded against the backdrop of a looming political shift in the United States as a climate-sceptic Donald Trump administration takes office in January. Faced with this uncertainty, many countries deemed the failure to secure a new financial agreement in Baku an unacceptable risk.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from this year’s summit:\n\n‘No real money on the table’: $300bn climate finance fund slammed\n\nWhile a broader target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 was adopted, only $300bn annually was designated for grants and low-interest loans from developed nations to aid the developing world in transitioning to low-carbon economies and preparing for climate change effects.\n\nUnder the deal, the majority of the funding is expected to come from private investment and alternative sources, such as proposed levies on fossil fuels and frequent flyers – which remain under discussion.\n\n“The rich world staged a great escape in Baku,” said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.\n\n“With no real money on the table, and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations,” he added, explaining that “poor countries needed to see clear, grant-based, climate finance” which “was sorely lacking”.\n\nThe deal states that developed nations would be “taking the lead” in providing the $300bn – implying that others could join.\n\nThe US and the European Union want newly wealthy emerging economies like China – currently the world’s largest emitter – to chip in. But the deal only “encourages” emerging economies to make voluntary contributions.\n\nFailure to explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels\n\nA call to “transition away” from coal, oil, and gas made during last year’s COP28 summit in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, was touted as groundbreaking – the first time that 200 countries, including top oil and gas producers like Saudi Arabia and the US, acknowledged the need to phase down fossil fuels. But the latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, without explicitly repeating the call for a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev referred to fossil fuel resources as a “gift from God” during his keynote opening speech.\n\nNew carbon credit trading rules approved\n\nNew rules allowing wealthy, high-emission countries to buy carbon-cutting “offsets” from developing nations were approved this week.\n\nThe initiative, known as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, establishes frameworks for both direct country-to-country carbon trading and a UN-regulated marketplace.\n\nProponents believe this could channel vital investment into developing nations, where many carbon credits are generated through activities like reforestation, protecting carbon sinks, and transitioning to clean energy.\n\nHowever, critics warn that without strict safeguards, these systems could be exploited to greenwash climate targets, allowing leading polluters to delay meaningful emissions reductions. The unregulated carbon market has previously faced scandals, raising concerns about the effectiveness and integrity of these credits.\n\nDisagreements within the developing world\n\nThe negotiations were also the scene of disagreements within the developing world.\n\nThe Least Developed Countries (LDCs) bloc had asked that it receive $220bn per year, while the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) wanted $39bn – demands that were opposed by other developing nations.\n\nThe figures did not appear in the final deal. Instead, it calls for tripling other public funds they receive by 2030.\n\nThe next COP, in Brazil in 2025, is expected to issue a report on how to boost climate finance for these countries.\n\nWho said what?\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the deal in Baku as marking “a new era for climate cooperation and finance”.\n\nShe said the $300bn agreement after marathon talks “will drive investments in the clean transition, bringing down emissions and building resilience to climate change”.\n\nUS President Joe Biden cast the agreement reached in Baku as a “historic outcome”, while EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said it would be remembered as “the start of a new era for climate finance”.\n\nBut others fully disagreed. India, a vociferous critic of rich countries’ stance in climate negotiations, called it “a paltry sum”.\n\n“This document is little more than an optical illusion,” India’s delegate Chandni Raina said.\n\nSierra Leone’s Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai said the deal showed a “lack of goodwill” from rich countries to stand by the world’s poorest as they confront rising seas and harsher droughts. Nigeria’s envoy Nkiruka Maduekwe called it “an insult”.\n\nIs the COP process in doubt?\n\nDespite years of celebrated climate agreements, greenhouse gas emissions and global temperatures continue to rise, with 2024 on track to be the hottest year recorded. The intensifying effects of extreme weather highlight the insufficient pace of action to avert a full-blown climate crisis.\n\nThe COP29 finance deal has drawn criticism as inadequate.\n\nAdding to the unease, Trump’s presidential election victory loomed over the talks, with his pledges to withdraw the US from global climate efforts and appoint a climate sceptic as energy secretary further dampening optimism.\n\n‘No longer fit for purpose’\n\nThe Kick the Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the summit, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests attended.\n\nA group of leading climate activists and scientists, including former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, warned earlier this month that the COP process was “no longer fit for purpose”.\n\nThey urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/optical-illusion-key-takeaways-from-cop29/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AFP__20241026__36KU4RD__v1__HighRes__SudanConflictDisplaced-1730204527-h8AUPq.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:15:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"dn","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":267003170,"title":"Elon Musk Now Has His Eyes On Guyana","text":"News Americas, New York, NY, November 21, 2024: Elon Musk is now reportedly eyeing the oil rich CARICOM, South American nation of Guyana even as he positions himself to become one of the most powerful men in the Donald Trump administration.\n\nStartlink, SpaceX, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk raises his hands as he takes the stage during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in November 2024. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nThe SpaceX and satellite Internet service, Starlink founder, is eyeing a license to operate in Guyana, Vice President Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo announced Thursday. The move could bring new connectivity opportunities to the country, particularly for remote hinterland regions.\n\nStarlink, a satellite Internet constellation operated by SpaceX and founded by the billionaire entrepreneur, X owner, Trump campaign backer and newly appointed co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, an entity Trump indicated will operate outside the confines of government, is currently under review by the Guyanese government. \n\nSpeaking at his weekly press conference today, Dr. Jagdeo said the proposal is “actively being considered” and highlighted the potential benefits of granting Starlink an official license, including tax revenue for the government.\n\nPresident Dr Mohamed Irfaan Ali and Musk were recently in talks and Musk expressed his intentions to invest in Guyana technological sector, as it provides a gateway to economic enhancement through digitization and modernization.\n\nCurrently, Starlink services are informally accessed in Guyana, with private individuals importing the equipment to provide internet access to underserved areas. Dr. Jagdeo noted that this arrangement is inequitable for other companies offering similar services, as they are required to pay taxes. An approved license for Starlink would ensure the company adheres to the same regulatory standards.\n\nDiscussions about Starlink’s potential entry into Guyana were first revealed after a meeting in July between President Dr. Irfaan Ali and Elon Musk. The Office of the President described the talks as focusing on economic innovation, technological advancements, and opportunities within various sectors of Guyana’s rapidly growing economy.\n\nIf approved, Starlink’s presence could significantly boost Internet connectivity across Guyana, particularly in regions where traditional infrastructure has struggled to meet demand.\n\nJagdeo emphasized the importance of the company being fully licensed and adhering to all tax laws. He further noted that some people are illegally bypassing tax requirements by personally importing equipment and providing Internet. He also stated that “currently, many people are bringing in the dishes themselves, installing them, and avoiding taxes, which is unfair to the other companies providing similar services.”\n\nAccording to Section 5 subsection 2 of Guyana’s Corporation Tax Act, if a non-resident company conducts trade or business in Guyana, all profits made in Guyana are chargeable to corporation tax.\n\nStarlink is a satellite internet service operated by Starlink Services, LLC, a subsidiary of SpaceX, the American aerospace company founded by Musk. With coverage extending to over 100 countries and territories, Starlink aims to provide high-speed global mobile broadband, playing a pivotal role in SpaceX’s growth trajectory.\n\nSince launching its first satellites in 2019, SpaceX has deployed over 7,000 small satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) as of September 2024. This figure is expected to grow, with plans for up to 34,400 satellites in the future. The network achieved a milestone of 1 million subscribers in December 2022 and reached 4 million by September 2024.\n\nStarlink satellites are developed and controlled at SpaceX’s Redmond, Washington facility, where research, manufacturing, and orbit management take place. The ambitious project, estimated in 2018 to cost $10 billion, reported $1.4 billion in revenue in 2022. By 2024, that figure is projected to rise to $6.6 billion.\n\nStarlink has also found critical applications in government operations, including its use in the Russo-Ukrainian War under a U.S. Department of Defense contract. SpaceX has introduced “Starshield,” a version of Starlink tailored for military and government use.\n\nWhile Starlink has transformed internet access globally, it has faced criticism from astronomers over potential disruptions to ground-based astronomy and concerns about orbital congestion. SpaceX has implemented measures to reduce satellite brightness and equipped satellites with collision-avoidance technology and Hall-effect thrusters for safe de-orbiting.\n\nStarlink continues to advance global connectivity, bridging digital divides and expanding its impact across industries and regions.","url":"https://dominicagazette.com/elon-musk-now-has-his-eyes-on-guyana/","image":"https://dominicagazette.com/app/uploads/2024/11/elon-musk-eyeing-guyana-xgqnjg.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:15:40","author":"Michael M.

It’s not unheard of for rates on multiyear loans, such as 30-year mortgages, to move modestly against the direction of the Fed’s short-term targets, analysts say.\n\nBut the recent gap, with Fed and bank rates moving in opposite directions, “is actually quite different” from the usual result after a Fed hike, said Lara Rhame, chief economist at FS Investments in South Philadelphia.\n\nIt’s “abnormal” for rates to fall when the economy is doing well, she said — a sign money market players are worried about inflation under one-party government when politicians “can spend with fewer guardrails,” likely leading to faster growth and more price inflation.\n\nRhame said her research on past Fed performance suggests long-term mortgage rates could stay at or above 5% into next year.\n\n“It’s a huge frustration for all the folks that were excited to jump in and buy homes, once the Feds started cutting interest rates,” she added.\n\nEric Merlis, cohead of global markets for Citizens Financial Group, which runs the largest bank-branch network in the Philadelphia area, said long-term rates reflect the economy’s growth prospects.\n\nWhen mortgage and business-loan rates rise despite Fed cuts, it suggests lenders are concerned inflation; economic growth; and property, stock and other asset prices will get worse.\n\nMortgage inquiries rose post-election\n\nMortgage inquiries slowed during the recent presidential campaign, as if buyers were waiting to see who won, but calls from would-be buyers have surged since Donald Trump’s election, said Michael A. Kent, veteran mortgage banker at First National Bank of Pennsylvania’s Berwyn office.\n\n“I received more calls since Thursday than in the last three weeks,” he said in an interview last week. But there still aren’t many houses for sale, locally or nationally, compared to the demand, Kent added.\n\nNationally, “house-hunting activity was much slower than expected” during the presidential campaign, the national real estate brokerage Redfin reported last week.\n\n“Buyers are returning” since Trump’s election, yet “we don’t expect rates to fall significantly anytime soon,” said Redfin economic researcher Chen Zhao.\n\nRhame, the FS analyst, said that even if the Trump administration wanted to increase U.S. housing construction, it would need to push local governments to speed project approvals — a challenge for national leaders.\n\nKent, the mortgage banker, noted that Fed rate cuts have more impact on credit cards, car loans and other short-term borrowing than on business and mortgage loans. If mortgage rates stay high, he expects more buyers will ask for adjustable-rate loans, as if betting rates will fall over the next few years.\n\nAnalysts say high mortgage rates reflect, in part, expectations that inflation would increase next year — for example, if the Trump administration makes good on promises to cut taxes without corresponding cuts to the major categories of U.S. government spending: medical, Social Security, military and debt service.\n\nKent added that any Trump administration moves that speed the economy more than expected — for example, by expanding fossil-fuel development and cutting gasoline prices — would come as a welcome deflationary surprise and maybe lead to lower interest rates.\n\nWhen might mortgage rates drop?\n\nStandard 30-year mortgages won’t likely drop until the long-term lending benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yields fall from their current levels, said Mike Reynolds, vice president for investment strategy at Glenmede Trust Co. in Philadelphia.\n\nAt a little under 7%, average 30-year home-loan rates “aren’t so egregiously high” that they would slow the economy, he said. “We do expect, as the Fed continues to go down this path of rate cuts, interest rates are likely to trend lower. It’s just not likely to be a straight-line process.”\n\nHe’s sanguine that Trump won’t force too-rapid change to the Fed, whose chairman, Jerome Powell, was appointed by Trump in his first term. “But the COVID period of just printing more money” without raising revenues “seems to be behind us.”\n\nReynolds is hopeful that less deficit spending will boost economic growth, and ease pressure on interest rates, and the borrowers who pay them.\n\n- Joseph N.

He was 83.\n\nMark Young, Woolery’s podcast co-host and friend, said in an email early Sunday that Woolery died at his home in Texas with his wife, Kristen, present.\n\n“Chuck was a dear friend and brother and a tremendous man of faith, life will not be the same without him,” Young wrote.\n\nWoolery, with his matinee idol looks, coiffed hair and ease with witty banter, was inducted into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in 2007 and earned a daytime Emmy nomination in 1978.\n\nIn 1983, Woolery began an 11-year run as host of TV’s “Love Connection,” for which he coined the phrase, “We’ll be back in two minutes and two seconds,” a two-fingered signature dubbed the “2 and 2.” In 1984, he hosted TV’s “Scrabble,” simultaneously hosting two game shows on TV until 1990.\n\n“Love Connection,” which aired long before the dawn of dating apps, had a premise that featured either a single man or single woman who would watch audition tapes of three potential mates and then pick one for a date.\n\nA couple of weeks after the date, the guest would sit with Woolery in front of a studio audience and tell everybody about the date. The audience would vote on the three contestants, and if the audience agreed with the guest’s choice, “Love Connection” would offer to pay for a second date.\n\nWoolery told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2003 that his favorite set of lovebirds was a man aged 91 and a woman aged 87. “She had so much eye makeup on, she looked like a stolen Corvette. He was so old he said, ‘I remember wagon trains.’ The poor guy. She took him on a balloon ride.”\n\nOther career highlights included hosting the shows “Lingo,” “Greed” and “The Chuck Woolery Show,” as well as hosting the short-lived syndicated revival of “The Dating Game” from 1998 to 2000 and an ill-fated 1991 talk show. In 1992, he played himself in two episodes of TV’s “Melrose Place.”\n\nWoolery became the subject of the Game Show Network’s first attempt at a reality show, “Chuck Woolery: Naturally Stoned,” which premiered in 2003. It shared the title of the pop song in 1968 by Woolery and his rock group, the Avant-Garde. It lasted six episode and was panned by critics.\n\nWoolery began his TV career at a show that has become a mainstay. Although most associated with Pat Sajak and Vanna White, “Wheel of Fortune” debuted Jan. 6, 1975, on NBC with Woolery welcoming contestants and the audience. Woolery, then 33, was trying to make it in Nashville as a singer.\n\n“Wheel of Fortune” started life as “Shopper’s Bazaar,” incorporating Hangman-style puzzles and a roulette wheel. After Woolery appeared on “The Merv Griffin Show” singing “Delta Dawn,” Merv Griffin asked him to host the new show with Susan Stafford.\n\n“I had an interview that stretched to 15, 20 minutes,” Woolery told The New York Times in 2003. “After the show, when Merv asked if I wanted to do a game show, I thought, ‘Great, a guy with a bad jacket and an equally bad mustache who doesn’t care what you have to say — that’s the guy I want to be.’”\n\nNBC initially passed, but they retooled it as “Wheel of Fortune” and got the green light. After a few years, Woolery demanded a raise to $500,000 a year, or what host Peter Marshall was making on “Hollywood Squares.” Griffin balked and replaced Woolery with weather reporter Pat Sajak.\n\n“Both Chuck and Susie did a fine job, and ‘Wheel’ did well enough on NBC, although it never approached the kind of ratings success that ‘Jeopardy!’ achieved in its heyday,” Griffin said in “Merv: Making the Good Life Last,” an autobiography from the 2000s co-written by David Bender. Woolery earned an Emmy nod as host.\n\nBorn in Ashland, Kentucky, Woolery served in the U.S. Navy before attending college. He played double bass in a folk trio, then formed the psychedelic rock duo The Avant-Garde in 1967 while working as a truck driver to support himself as a musician.\n\nThe Avant-Garde, which tourbed in a refitted Cadillac hearse, had the Top 40 hit “Naturally Stoned,” with Woolery singing, “When I put my mind on you alone/I can get a good sensation/Feel like I’m naturally stoned.”\n\nAfter The Avant-Garde broke up, Woolery released his debut solo single “I’ve Been Wrong” in 1969 and several more singles with Columbia before transitioning to country music by the 1970s. He released two solo singles, “Forgive My Heart” and “Love Me, Love Me.”\n\nWoolery wrote or co-wrote songs for himself and everyone from Pat Boone to Tammy Wynette. On Wynette’s 1971 album “We Sure Can Love Each Other,” Woolery wrote “The Joys of Being a Woman” with lyrics including “See our baby on the swing/Hear her laugh, hear her scream.”\n\nAfter his TV career ended, Woolery went into podcasting. In an interview with The New York Times, he called himself a gun-rights activist and described himself as a conservative libertarian and constitutionalist. He said he hadn’t revealed his politics in liberal Hollywood for fear of retribution.\n\nHe teamed up with Mark Young in 2014 for the podcast “Blunt Force Truth” and soon became a full supporter of Donald Trump while arguing minorities don’t need civil rights and causing a firestorm by tweeting an antisemitic comment linking Soviet Communists to Judaism.\n\n“President Obama’s popularity is a fantasy only held by him and his dwindling legion of juice-box-drinking, anxiety-dog-hugging, safe-space-hiding snowflakes,” he said.\n\nWoolery also was active online, retweeting articles from Conservative Brief, insisting Democrats were trying to install a system of Marxism and spreading headlines such as “Impeach him! Devastating photo of Joe Biden leaks.”\n\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic, Woolery initially accused medical professionals and Democrats of lying about the virus in an effort to hurt the economy and Trump’s chances for reelection to the presidency.\n\n“The most outrageous lies are the ones about COVID-19. Everyone is lying. The CDC, media, Democrats, our doctors, not all but most, that we are told to trust. I think it’s all about the election and keeping the economy from coming back, which is about the election. I’m sick of it,” Woolery wrote in July 2020.\n\nTrump retweeted that post to his 83 million followers. By the end of the month, nearly 4.5 million Americans had been infected with COVID-19 and more than 150,000 had died.\n\nJust days later, Woolery changed his stance, announcing his son had contracted COVID-19.\n\n“To further clarify and add perspective, COVID-19 is real and it is here. My son tested positive for the virus, and I feel for of those suffering and especially for those who have lost loved ones,” Woolery posted before his account was deleted.\n\nWoolery later explained on his podcast that he never called COVID-19 “a hoax” or said “it’s not real,” just that “we’ve been lied to.” Woolery also said it was “an honor to have your president retweet what your thoughts are and think it’s important enough to do that.”\n\nIn addition to his wife, Woolery is survived by his sons Michael and Sean and his daughter Melissa, Young said.\n\nBy MARK KENNEDY AP Entertainment Writer","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/arts-entertainment/tv/2024/11/24/chuck-woolery-game-show-host-of-love-connection-and-scrabble-dies-at-83/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/4V6A4KVSVFCZLKCFM2W3XJIRZI.png?auth=d698cd20592ed3b1019f3c8814b765eaa45e4143963f616233beefb77a80fc5f&height=630&width=1200&smart=true&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:15:31","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":267002842,"title":"North Texas Leaders React To Scott Turners Nomination For Hud Secretary","text":"President-elect Donald Trump announced Scott Turner as his nominee for U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary on Friday, and his selection quickly garnered lots of support online, including from North Texas leaders.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Jeff Leach, writing on X, said Trump “couldn’t have picked a better man and servant.” Leach represents House District 67, which includes a portion of Collin County.\n\nIn Friday’s statement, Trump credited Turner — the highest-ranking Black person Trump has selected for his administration — with “helping to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities”— referring to what he calls the success of Opportunity Zones during Trump’s first term.\n\nA Richardson native, Turner’s career has spanned from the NFL to the White House with several initiatives and roles in North Texas. The 52-year-old started his career as an NFL cornerback, but he didn’t stop there.\n\nAfter his nine-season run as a professional football player with Washington, San Diego and Denver, Turner went on to be elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2013 and served two terms.\n\nIn April 2019, Turner led the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, whose mission was to coordinate with various federal agencies to attract investment to the so-called “Opportunity Zones,” or economically depressed areas eligible for development with federal tax incentives.\n\n“I am thrilled to continue the outstanding work we began in your last administration at HUD with an incredible team,” Turner said in a post on X, in response to Trump’s nomination. “I would also like to express the sincerest of gratitude to my mentor, Secretary [Ben Carson]. Few people are as compassionate and gracious as he is, and I am aware that I have big shoes to fill.”\n\nCarson was Trump’s first-term pick for the agency, and one of the president-elect’s supporters. He wrote a post on X congratulating Turner, saying he “worked with [Carson] at HUD, playing a large part in the success of our Opportunity Zones program.”\n\nIn North Texas, Turner currently serves as an associate pastor at Prestonwood Baptist Church, a megachurch based out of Plano.\n\n“Scott Turner is a beloved pastor at Prestonwood and personal friend, whom I have known since he was a teenager. His integrity is impeccable and leadership skills are off the charts,” senior pastor Jack Graham said in a statement sent to The Dallas Morning News on Saturday. “Scott brings much experience to this role, given his position working under Dr. Ben Carson in President Trump’s last administration, and the work he’s done through his own foundation.”\n\nGraham also said on X Friday that Turner is a “glorious choice.”\n\nIn 2021, Turner and his wife, Robin, founded the Plano-based Community Engagement & Opportunity Council to “tackle the steady decline in reading proficiency” across the nation, according to its website.\n\nThe CEOC offers a learning lab, which offers Christian-based reading enhancement programs for kindergarten through 5th grade students, the website said. The organization also has a mentorship initiative that was “created to encourage high school athletes to use their love and talent for the game to go beyond the field of play.”\n\nAccording to the website, the CEOC is partnered with Prestonwood, Bentley Dallas and local real estate developer JPI. The organization did not immediately respond to The News’ request for comment.\n\nIn June 2023, JPI appointed Turner as its chief visionary officer, a new leadership role focused on the development and execution of a comprehensive strategic vision for the company’s growth and expansion, according to its website.\n\nJPI is a development and construction company, specializing in Class A multifamily housing. At JPI, Turner is responsible for “creating and implementing a comprehensive strategic vision to drive the company’s growth and expansion,” the website said.\n\nJay Parsons, a rental housing economist based in the D-FW area, said on X that Turner’s nomination for HUD is a “home run,” citing his background in multifamily housing development.\n\n“I am eternally grateful to my wonderful wife Robin, my son Solomon, and the many incredible friends who have supported me on this journey,” Turner said on X at 8:18 p.m. Friday night. “We have an important mission ahead. To God be the glory.

He served in the U.S. Army and as a state legislator. Zeldin and his wife, Diana, have identical twin daughters.\n\nCIA director: John Ratcliffe\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas was director of national intelligence for Trump in 2020 and was also briefly considered by political observers as a contender for U.S. attorney general.\n\nRatcliffe represented a North Texas district in Congress for five years and is a staunch supporter and friend of Trump.

A staunch conservative and critic of liberal social and environmental policies, Ramaswamy founded Roivant Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, in 2014.\n\nThe Ohio native is the son of Indian immigrants and has degrees from Harvard University and Yale University.\n\nAttorney general: Pam Bondi\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, to be U.S. attorney general just hours after his other choice, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nThe move follows scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation’s chief federal law enforcement officer.\n\nThe Florida Republican’s announcement came one day after meeting with senators in an effort to win their support for his confirmation to lead the Justice Department.\n\nThe move follows scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation’s chief federal law enforcement officer.\n\nTreasury secretary: Scott Bessent\n\nThe president-elect also nominated former George Soros money manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary.\n\nTrump said Bessent would “help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,” while Vought “knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.”\n\nBessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on and off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation’s first openly gay treasury secretary.\n\nHe told Bloomberg in August that he decided to join Trump’s campaign in part to attack the mounting U.S. national debt. That would include slashing government programs and other spending.\n\nHousing secretary: Scott Turner\n\nNFL player and White House aide Scott Turner is Trump’s nominee for the U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary.\n\nTurner is a former NFL player and White House aide. He ran the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump’s first term in office.\n\nTrump, in a statement, credited Turner, the highest-ranking Black person he’s yet selected for his administration, with “helping to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities.”\n\nSecretary of state: Marco Rubio\n\nTrump named Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to be secretary of state, making the critic-turned-ally his choice for top diplomat.\n\nRubio, 53, is a noted hawk on China, Cuba and Iran, and was a finalist to be Trump’s running mate on the Republican ticket last summer. Rubio is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nThe announcement punctuates the hard pivot Rubio has made with Trump, whom the senator once called a “con man” during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nLabor secretary: Lori Chavez-DeRemer\n\nOregon Republican Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been tapped as Trump’s labor secretary. Chavez-DeRemer, 56, narrowly lost her reelection bid earlier this month. She received strong backing from union members in her district.\n\nChavez-DeRemer is one of a few House Republicans to endorse the “Protecting the Right to Organize” or PRO Act that would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers’ rights.\n\nThe act would also weaken “right-to-work” laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment.\n\nTrump said in a statement that she would help “ensure that the Labor Department can unite Americans of all backgrounds behind our Agenda for unprecedented National Success.”\n\nTop budget official: Russel Vought\n\nRussel Vought has been tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a position Vought held during Trump’s first presidency.\n\nVought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term that he tried to distance himself from during the campaign.\n\nVought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump’s first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director.\n\nA graduate of Wheaton College and George Washington University Law School, he had a deep knowledge of government finances that has been paired with his own Christian faith.\n\nAfter Trump’s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as renewing “a consensus of America as a nation under God.”\n\nDirector of national intelligence: Tulsi Gabbard\n\nFormer Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been tapped by Trump to be director of national intelligence.\n\nGabbard, 43, was a Democratic House member who unsuccessfully sought the party’s 2020 presidential nomination before leaving the party in 2022. She endorsed Trump in August and campaigned often with him this fall.\n\nGabbard, who has served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, deploying to Iraq and Kuwait, would come to the role as an outsider compared with her predecessor. The current director, Avril Haines, was confirmed by the Senate in 2021 following several years in a number of top national security and intelligence positions.\n\nCommerce secretary: Howard Lutnick\n\nWall Street executive Howard Lutnick has been tapped to lead the Commerce Department. He heads up the brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and is a cryptocurrency enthusiast. He is co-chair of Trump’s transition operation, charged along with Linda McMahon, a former wrestling executive who previously led Trump’s Small Business Administration, with helping the president-elect build a Cabinet for his second administration.\n\nAs commerce secretary, Lutnick would play a key role in carrying out Trump’s plans to raise and enforce tariffs. He would oversee a sprawling Cabinet department whose oversight ranges from funding new computer chip factories and imposing trade restrictions to releasing economic data and monitoring the weather.\n\nHomeland security secretary: Kristi Noem\n\nTrump also said he would nominate South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run the Department of Homeland Security. Noem is a well-known conservative who used her two terms as South Dakota’s governor to vault to a prominent position in Republican politics.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Noem did not order restrictions that other states had issued and instead declared her state “open for business.” Trump held a fireworks rally at Mount Rushmore in July 2020 in one of the first large gatherings of the pandemic.\n\nMore recently, Noem faced sharp criticism for telling a story in her memoir about shooting and killing her dog.\n\nShe is set to lead a department crucial to the president-elect’s hardline immigration agenda as well as other missions. Homeland Security oversees natural disaster response, the U.S. Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration agents who work at airports.\n\nOther nominations\n\nIn addition, Trump rounded out his health team. He chose Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a general practitioner and Fox News contributor, to be surgeon general; Dr. Dave Weldon, a former Republican congressman from Florida, to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon, as head of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTrump previously said he would nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime spreader of conspiracy theories about vaccines, as health secretary.\n\nAlex Wong was named as principal deputy national security adviser, while Sebastian Gorka will serve as senior director for counterterrorism. Wong worked on issues involving Asia during Trump’s first term, and Gorka is a conservative commentator who spent less than a year in Trump’s White House.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2024/11/12/president-donald-trump-assembles-his-leadership-team/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/SOVUJGKR2VW5ARHPPFY7Z3ZSJU.jpg?auth=bc3d93e80f870fb248c994e705790595baa8e7f27993f799c00aa3802ea0639c&height=630&width=1200&smart=true&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:15:31","author":"Karen Brooks Harper,The Associated Press","authors":["Karen Brooks Harper","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.257},{"id":267001856,"title":"Tulsi Gabbard Donald Trump Cabinet","text":"Yep, the Hare Krishna chanting, Bhagavad Gita-loving, ex-Democrat Congresswoman is officially in Trump’s inner circle. And no, she’s not Indian, just putting that out there before your WhatsApp uncle gets excited.\n\nWait, Who’s Tulsi Gabbard Again?\n\nTulsi Gabbard is the first Hindu Congresswoman in the US, but let’s clear the air, she’s not of Indian origin. Born in Leloaloa, American Samoa, she grew up immersed in Hinduism thanks to her mom, Carol Porter Gabbard, who converted to the religion and named all her kids after Hindu concepts. Tulsi’s siblings? Bhakti, Vrindavan, Aryan, and Jai. She’s basically been vibing with the Bhagavad Gita since day one.\n\nHer political journey has been… eventful, to say the least. Tulsi made headlines back in 2022 when she left the Democratic Party amidst accusations of being a “Russian asset.” Now, fast forward to Trump’s second term, and she’s in charge of National Intelligence, which has some people raising their eyebrows and others furiously tweeting.\n\nWhy Is This Such A Big Deal?\n\nFor starters, Tulsi’s past ties with Russia have sparked concerns about her suitability for such a critical role. Critics are questioning if her history aligns with the responsibilities of safeguarding US intelligence. But hey, Trump’s cabinet picks are never boring. Joining Tulsi in the lineup are equally controversial names like Matt Gaetz as Attorney General (yes, that Matt Gaetz) and Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary.\n\nDespite the controversy, Indian politician Nirmala Sitharaman took to X (formerly Twitter) to congratulate Tulsi. She praised her for 21 years of service to the US Army, where she rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nA Peek Into Tulsi Gabbard’s Personal Life\n\nTulsi’s personal life is as intriguing as her political career. At just 21, she married her childhood friend Eduardo Tamayo, but her deployment to Iraq in 2004 strained their relationship, leading to their divorce in 2006. Years later, love found her again in Abraham Williams, a filmmaker who was her campaign photographer. In a quintessentially romantic gesture, Abraham proposed while they were surfing, and the two tied the knot in a traditional Vedic ceremony in 2015.\n\nThe Internet Is Divided (As Always)\n\nAs news of Tulsi’s appointment spread, so did debates online. Some are calling it a bold move, while others are side-eyeing Trump’s decision. Meanwhile, a throwback video of Tulsi chanting Hare Krishna is doing the rounds, reminding everyone of her spiritual roots.\n\nSo, what’s your take on Tulsi Gabbard’s new role in Trump’s cabinet? Is this a fresh start for her, or just another chapter in the never-ending saga of US politics?

Gaetz said it was clear he had become a \"distraction” amid pressure on the House to release an ethics report about allegations of his own sexual misconduct. An attorney for two women has said that his clients told House Ethics Committee investigators that Gaetz paid them for sex on multiple occasions beginning in 2017, when Gaetz was a Florida congressman.\n\nFresh questions over the two nominees’ pasts, and their treatment of women, arose with Republicans under pressure from Trump and his allies to quickly confirm his Cabinet. At the same time, his transition has so far balked at the vetting and background checks that have traditionally been required.\n\nWhile few Republican senators have publicly criticized any of Trump’s nominees, it became clear after Gaetz’s withdrawal that many had been harboring private concerns about him.

Teenagers were already asking the chatbot - released in late 2022 - to compose essays and answer take-home tests.\n\nAI large language models behind technology such as ChatGPT work by repeatedly guessing the next word in a sentence after having \"learned\" the patterns of a huge trove of human-written works. They often get facts wrong.

Here's an in-depth look at her age, net worth, family, and controversies.Born in Bloomington, Illinois, on November 27, 1970, Kelly Loeffler is 54 years old. She graduated with a degree in marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992 and later earned an MBA from DePaul University. Her early career saw her work with several financial firms, eventually leading to her rise in the corporate world.Net Worth and Business CareerLoeffler's net worth is estimated to be approximately $1 billion, making her one of the wealthiest individuals in American politics. Her substantial fortune stems from her association with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), a financial services company founded by her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher. She joined ICE in 2002, rising to become head of marketing and communications. Loeffler received a reported $9 million payout upon leaving the company to join the US Senate, according to reports from Celebrity Net Worth.Loeffler and Sprecher reside in a 15,000-square-foot Atlanta mansion worth $10.5 million, the most expensive residential purchase in the city's history at the time. The couple also owns properties in Florida, Chicago, and Georgia.READ MORE: Quick Facts About Matt Gaetz: Is He A Lawyer, Net Worth, Wife, And Scandal With A MinorFamily LifeKelly Loeffler married Jeffrey Sprecher in 2004. Sprecher, a businessman and billionaire, is the CEO of ICE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange. The couple has been a powerful force in the financial and political spheres, with Sprecher's role often complementing Loeffler's political ambitions. According to Times Now News, the duo met while Loeffler was working at ICE, and their partnership has been central to their financial and professional success.Political CareerLoeffler was appointed to the US Senate in December 2019 by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, following Senator Johnny Isakson's resignation due to health issues. During her tenure, Loeffler positioned herself as a staunch ally of Donald Trump. She faced a challenging election in 2020, losing to Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock in a runoff.Notably, Loeffler pledged loyalty to Trump's efforts to contest the 2020 presidential election results but withdrew her objections following the January 6 Capitol attack, calling the violence \"abhorrent,\" according to CNN. Despite her short tenure in the Senate, she played a prominent role in conservative politics and was considered a loyal supporter of Trump's agenda.Read More: Is Matt Gaetz Still Under Investigation? What To Know About His Sex Trafficking ScandalInsider Trading ScandalLoeffler's political career was marred by allegations of insider trading. Reports from Vox revealed that Loeffler and her husband sold approximately $20 million worth of stocks in early 2020 after receiving Senate briefings on the economic impact of COVID-19. These sales reportedly occurred before the stock market experienced significant downturns due to the pandemic.Although Loeffler denied any wrongdoing, the controversy raised questions about her integrity and use of privileged information for personal financial gain. The scandal became a focal point of her reelection campaign, damaging her reputation among voters.WNBA ControversyIn addition to her political and financial pursuits, Loeffler co-owned the WNBA team Atlanta Dream. Her ownership faced backlash in 2020 when she criticised the league's support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Many players called for her removal, leading to public scrutiny over her stance on social justice issues.Potential Role in the Trump AdministrationIn November 2024, reports from CNN indicated that President-elect Donald Trump is considering Loeffler for the position of Secretary of Agriculture. Her ties to Trump's campaign and her fundraising efforts have solidified her position as a key ally in his circle. However, as with all Cabinet appointments, nothing is final until formally announced.Kelly Loeffler's journey from a financial executive to a US Senator and a potential Cabinet member illustrates a career marked by ambition, controversy, and influence. While her wealth and business acumen have made her a significant figure in politics, allegations of insider trading and her stance on social justice issues have sparked widespread debate about her legacy.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/quick-facts-about-kelly-loeffler-age-net-worth-family-insider-trading-scandal-1728939","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1732423/kelly-loeffler.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:13:09","author":"Sarah Tan","authors":["Sarah Tan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":266999324,"title":"Barbara Corcoran Calls Donald Trump Best Salesman Ive Ever Met Reveals His Genius Tactic 1728618","text":"Barbara Corcoran, renowned investor and real estate mogul, has praised President-elect Donald Trump as \"the best salesman I've ever met,\" according to her 2018 interview with Business Insider. During the discussion, Corcoran delved into Trump's extraordinary ability to sell and influence, drawing from her long-standing professional relationship with him in the competitive New York real estate market.Corcoran remarked, \"He is a phenomenal salesman. He's not a great salesman. He's probably the best salesman I've ever been in the company of. I spent a lot of time with Donald because he was raising his company right parallel with me raising mine.\"Her insights into Trump's tactics align with sales expert Jeffrey Gitomer's philosophy, as described in his article \"To Become a Master Salesperson, Master Non-Selling Skills,\" which emphasises creating a buying atmosphere rather than hard selling. Gitomer asserts that mastering non-selling skills—such as understanding customer desires, creative problem-solving, and serving with sincerity—leads to sales success, principles Trump appears to exemplify.Turning Obstacles Into Opportunities: The Plaza Hotel StoryCorcoran highlighted Trump's ability to turn a dire situation into a lucrative opportunity. Facing potential bankruptcy, Trump negotiated with a group of wealthy Hong Kong investors interested in purchasing the Plaza Hotel. However, instead of directly pitching the hotel, he redirected their attention to undeveloped land along the Hudson River.\"I watched him walk into a situation selling the Plaza Hotel to the Chinese out of Hong Kong. They were there because they were interested in the Plaza Hotel. And Donald was near bankruptcy, really needed the money to bail out,\" Corcoran explained during her interview with Business Insider. \"I watched him totally not pitch the Plaza Hotel. [He] buried it and talked about the land masses on the Hudson River and the buildings that would be there.\"Initially sceptical, Corcoran witnessed the investors ultimately purchase the land, leading to the construction of Trump Place, a series of luxurious riverfront developments. \"They bought the land and built all those towers on the west river as we know it today,\" she said, marveling at his unorthodox but effective strategy.The Genius of Emotional IntelligenceCorcoran credits Trump's success not just to his charisma but to his unparalleled ability to read and exploit the vulnerabilities of others. \"He is a genius at picking out the vulnerability of someone's personality. He can smell it, sense it, and trust it,\" she explained.Trump's skill in understanding people's weaknesses enables him to tailor his approach, often subtly steering decisions in his favour. \"If you were to walk into a business meeting with Donald, he could see what your weakness is and play into it,\" Corcoran said. This same skill, she noted, was instrumental in his political success, as he tapped into voter vulnerabilities and anxieties during his 2016 presidential campaign. \"He knows how to touch it. Just so. And people go along for the ride.\"Lessons for Sales ProfessionalsTrump's sales mastery aligns with Jeffrey Gitomer's principles of excelling at non-selling skills. Gitomer, in his article, stresses that creating a buying atmosphere is far more effective than pushing a sale. Core strategies include understanding customer needs, being resourceful, and serving with sincerity.Corcoran's observation of Trump echoes these sentiments. She remarked, \"He is a phenomenal salesman. He could sell anything. And he did.\"For salespeople aiming to emulate this level of success, Gitomer advises honing life skills such as creative problem-solving, engaging communication, and giving without expecting immediate returns. As Gitomer puts it, \"The more you give, the more you get.\"","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barbara-corcoran-calls-donald-trump-best-salesman-ive-ever-met-reveals-his-genius-tactic-1728618","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1731748/barbara-corcoran-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:13:09","author":"Vinay Patel","authors":["Vinay Patel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.449},{"id":266999306,"title":"Sales Existing Us Homes Rise October 1728887","text":"Sales of previously owned homes in the United States picked up in October, industry data showed Thursday, fueling hopes that a slump in the sector may be ending.Existing home sales rose 3.4 percent last month from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported.Compared with a year ago, home sales jumped by 2.9 percent, marking the first year-on-year increase since July 2021.\"The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,\" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.He told reporters on a call that people could be accepting a \"new normal\" in mortgage rates, which stand markedly higher than they were in 2021.He expects housing demand to continue growing, given that \"additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured.\"The interest-sensitive housing sector has been reeling since the US Federal Reserve rapidly hiked interest rates to stamp out surging inflation in recent years.Mortgage rates, in turn, increased as well. But levels have eased somewhat since the central bank started cutting the benchmark lending rate in September.A key reason that home sales stalled in recent times is that homeowners have been reluctant to enter the market and sell their properties, as they had locked in lower mortgage rates previously.As of October 24, the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.5 percent, although this has since inched up in mid-November.\"While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize,\" Yun noted.The median price of existing homes was $407,200 last month, up 4.0 percent from a year ago, with all major US regions logging price increases.Yun said this uptick is largely in line with income gains, and expects that additional inventory and more home building will help to bring down the pace of price increases.Looking ahead, economist Nancy Vanden Houten at Oxford Economics warned that October's pace might not be sustained.\"Hurricanes Helene and Milton may also weigh on November home sales, which will reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier,\" she said.She cautioned that sales could also be hampered going forward given the risks of a slower pace of Fed interest rate cuts, alongside \"inflationary policies\" potentially adopted by President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sales-existing-us-homes-rise-october-1728887","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1732319/us-existing-home-sales-rose-29-percent-year-ago-first-year-year-increase-since-july-2021.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:13:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":266999296,"title":"More Us States Wont Tax Social Security Benefits 2025 Your State One Them 1728778","text":"Social Security makes up 40% of the monthly income for millions of Americans aged 65 and above, making the program a crucial aspect of retirement security. While your Social Security income levels depend on when you claim, earnings during working years, and service duration, the net amount you pocket every month also depends on where you live. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, the current law states that the Federal government could tax up to 85% of your Social Security checks. That's not all.Your Social Security income might also be subjected to state income taxes as each state has its own rules, which continue to change over time. Fortunately for Social Security beneficiaries, the number of states that tax Social Security is declining to only nine in 2025: Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia.Three States Halt Imposing Taxes On Social Security This YearMissouri and Nebraska stopped taxing Social Security benefits in 2024 alongside Kansas, which joined them in mid-2024 and won't tax benefits henceforth. Meanwhile, West Virginia plans to eliminate state taxes on Social Security in 2026. However, income taxes on Social Security checks are unique to each state as they have different tax provisions for deductions that people can avail of if they meet certain income or age thresholds.For instance, Colorado residents 65 and above can entirely deduct federally taxed Social Security income on their state income tax returns beginning in 2022. Meanwhile, people between ages 55 and 64 with an adjusted gross income of or below $75,000 can completely subtract their federally taxed Social Security income from state tax returns starting in 2025. Overall, it becomes crucial to understand the specific rules enforced by your state to ensure you save the most from your Social Security checks.Savings Estimate For Retirees In States That Won't Tax Benefits Next YearA total of 41 US states and Washington DC won't tax Social Security benefits in 2025. Wealth Enhancement Group's financial adviser, Brian Kuhn, explained that individuals in these states can estimate their tax savings on Social Security benefits by checking the effective tax rate at which they paid their respective states for all taxed income sources. Once they know the effective tax rate, the beneficiaries can apply that to their total Social Security income.\"So, for example, if your effective rate in your state was 5%, and you received $30,000 in Social Security benefits, that would be a savings of $1,500,\" Kuhn said. Overall, retirees whose benefits aren't taxed can save considerable money. \"In Missouri, for instance, retirees are looking at a collective annual saving of around $309 million,\" said Jeff Rose, CFP, founder of Good Financial Cents. \"Over in Nebraska, it's about $17 million. That's a lot of money that retirees get to keep in their pockets instead of it being drained away by state taxes.\"As US states work to eliminate benefits taxes, concerns loom around the Social Security program's insolvency projections. The Social Security Board of Trustees estimate that by 2035, Social Security trust funds will be depleted to the level where they will cover only 76% of scheduled benefits unless current payables are lowered by 13% or payroll tax rates are increased to 14.4%.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/more-us-states-wont-tax-social-security-benefits-2025-your-state-one-them-1728778","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1729348/social-security.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:13:09","author":"Niloy Chakrabarti","authors":["Niloy Chakrabarti"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":266999292,"title":"Did Donald Trump Bribe Pam Bondi 25k 2013 Not Sue Trump University Heres What We Know 1728866","text":"In 2013, a $25,000 donation from Donald Trump's charitable foundation to a political group supporting former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi raised significant questions about potential conflicts of interest. At the time, Bondi's office was considering joining a lawsuit against Trump University over allegations of fraudulent practices. The timing of the donation and Bondi's subsequent decision not to take action against Trump University have led to persistent allegations of impropriety.Trump University Under InvestigationTrump University, established in 2005, became embroiled in multiple lawsuits alleging deceptive practices and defrauding students. In August 2013, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump and Trump University of engaging in \"persistent fraudulent, illegal, and deceptive conduct.\"The lawsuit sought millions of dollars in restitution for consumers who claimed they had paid tens of thousands of dollars for courses that failed to deliver promised real estate education and mentorship. Meanwhile, Bondi's office in Florida had received at least 22 complaints against Trump University and related entities between 2008 and 2011, per Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.READ MORE: Quick Facts About Matt Gaetz: Is He A Lawyer, Net Worth, Wife, And Scandal With A MinorThe $25,000 DonationAs Bondi's office was considering joining New York's lawsuit, the Orlando Sentinel reported that her office was \"reviewing the allegations\" against Trump University. Shortly thereafter, Trump's charitable foundation donated $25,000 to \"And Justice for All,\" a political action committee supporting Bondi's re-election.The Trump Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable organisation, was prohibited by federal law from making political contributions. Despite this, the foundation issued the cheque to Bondi's PAC. The donation raised concerns because it came just days after Bondi's office announced it was considering whether to join New York's lawsuit against Trump University.Legal and Ethical ConcernsThe timing of the donation, combined with Bondi's decision not to pursue legal action against Trump University, raised allegations of a potential quid pro quo. In 2016, CNN reported that Bondi denied any connection between the donation and her office's decision, stating that her office had never opened an investigation into Trump University due to insufficient grounds.Trump's representatives later admitted the donation violated federal tax laws, calling it a \"clerical error.\" The Trump Foundation subsequently paid a $2,500 IRS fine for the improper contribution, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.Read More: Is Matt Gaetz Still Under Investigation?

Kiyosaki believes the central bank is in trouble, given that the US put on more debt in a year than it took \"in the first 200 years\" and that the country has been trying to solve this problem by printing more money and dropping interest rates. The multi-millionaire explained that the government \"can't keep getting into debt\" and pay for it with \"fake money.\"Kiyosaki has long advocated for assets like precious metals, including gold and silver, because of their high exchangeability, universal demand, limited supply, and negative correlation to stock markets. Gold has been a sign of wealth since ancient times. It remains a top investment pick as it doesn't face devaluation like fiat currencies and has historically surged in record prices during market upheavals in the last half-century.Gold's intrinsic store of value also fuels value appreciation, making it a relatively safer asset for hedging against inflation. While gold prices hit successive record levels this year to soar above $2,790 per ounce, the asset experienced a sudden pullback after President-elect Donald Trump's election win. However, experts believe the Trump Administration could also aid gold prices in the future, which was trading at $2,597 per ounce on November 18.Goldman Sachs Sees Gold Prices Reaching $3,000 Per OunceGoldman Sachs analysts believe gold will break more records next year on the back of the Fed's gold-buying spree and interest rate cuts. The Wall Street giant named gold among next year's top commodity trades with the potential to extend gains under Trump's rule. In a recent note, Goldman Sachs analyst Daan Struyven urged investors to \"go for gold\" and maintained a target price of $3,000 per ounce for December 2025.The banking analysts explained that their projections were founded on the rising demand for the metal from the Fed alongside a cyclical lift fueled by flows to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid rate cuts as the central bank plans to simplify policies. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs experts opined that potential trade tensions and looming risks around US fiscal sustainability could also aid gold prices.Geopolitics Is A Key Driver Of The Gold RallyInvestors have always viewed gold as a safe haven in times of global conflicts, threatening to derail crucial supply chains and economic progress. The Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have dangerously escalated this year to spark risks of a global war as more countries are getting pulled into these regional conflicts.While Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remarked that Trump's presidency could end its years-long war with Russia much sooner than expected, US President Joe Biden yesterday authorised the Ukrainian armed forces to use US-supplied long-range missiles, called the Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS), for strikes inside Russia as they defend their forces against Russian and North Korean troops in the Kursk region of Russia. With no end to these volatile wars, gold prices continue to face upward price pressures globally.Disclaimer: Our digital media content is for informational purposes only and not investment advice.

In most cases, Romanian interests coincide with partner interests.”\n\nEcaterina Nawadia, a 20-year-old architecture student, said she voted for the first time in a national election on Sunday and hopes young people turn out in high numbers.\n\n“Since the (1989) revolution, we didn’t have a really good president,” she said. “I hope most of the people my age went to vote … because the leading candidate is not the best option.”\n\nCristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says Sunday’s vote will be “a tight race” in which the diaspora will likely play a key role in which candidates make it to the runoff.\n\n“We are at a point where Romania can easily divert or slip toward a populist regime because (voter) dissatisfaction is pretty large among a lot of people from all social strata,” he told The Associated Press. “And the temptation for any regime, any leader — will be to go on a populist road.”\n\nHe added that Romania’s large budget deficit, high inflation, and an economic slowdown could push more mainstream candidates to shift toward populist stances amid widespread dissatisfaction.\n\nCiolacu told the AP that if he is elected, one of his biggest goals is “to convince Romanians that it is worth staying at home or returning” to Romania, which has a massive diaspora spread throughout EU countries.\n\n“Romania has a huge chance to become a developed economy in the next 10 years, where honest work is fairly rewarded and people have the security of a better life,” he said. “But for this, we need balance and responsibility … I am running for the Presidency of Romania because we need a change.”\n\nOther key candidates include Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR former NATO deputy general secretary Mircea Geoana, who is running independently and Nicolae Ciuca, a former army general and head of the center-right National Liberal Party, which is currently in a tense coalition with the PSD.\n\nGeoana, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, told the AP that he believes his international experience qualifies him above the other candidates. “I think I bring a lot of competence and experience and connections in this complicated world,” he said.\n\nLasconi, a former journalist and the leader of the USR said she sees corruption as one of the biggest problems Romania faces and that she supports increased defence spending and continued aid to Ukraine.\n\nRomania has been a staunch ally of war-torn Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. But Simion of the AUR party said he opposes Romania — which has sent a Patriot missile system to Ukraine — contributing further military aid and that he hopes Trump can “stop the war.”\n\nIn 2020, the AUR party went from relative obscurity to gaining 9% in a parliamentary vote, allowing it to enter parliament. Opponents have long accused Simion and AUR of being extremists, charges he denies.\n\n“We are sort of a Trumpist party in this new wave of patriotic political parties in Europe,” Simion said.","url":"https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/national-news/romanians-cast-ballots-in-presidential-race-that-could-pit-nationalist-against-leftist-in-a-runoff-7667408","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/11/web1_241128-cpw-eu-romania-elections-_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:11:39","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.074},{"id":267000518,"title":"Victims South Koreas Controversial Adoption System Search Answers And Birth Mothers 4758356","text":"CNA Correspondent\n\n CNA Correspondent - Victims of South Korea's controversial adoption system search for answers - and birth mothers\n\n 20 Nov 2024 07:16AM\n\n South Korea used to be the world's largest source of babies for adoption.

The dollar dipped 0.4 per cent on the Japanese yen to 154.18, and further away from its recent peak of 156.76.\n\nThe euro edged up 0.7 per cent to $1.0496 and away from Friday's two-year trough of $1.0332. Resistance is up at $1.0555 and $1.0610, with support around $1.0195 and the major $1.0000 level.\n\nThe single currency had taken a hit on Friday as European manufacturing surveys (PMI) showed broad weakness, while the U.S. surveys surprised on the high side.\n\nThe contrast saw European bond yields fall sharply, widening the gap with Treasury yields to the benefit of the dollar. Markets also priced in more aggressive easing from the European Central Bank, with the probability of a half-point rate cut in December rising to 59 per cent.\n\nAt the same time, futures scaled back the chance of a quarter-point rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December to 52 per cent, compared to 72 per cent a month ago. \n\nMarkets now imply 154 basis points of ECB easing by the end of next year, compared to just 65 basis points from the Fed.\n\nData on UK retail sales also disappointed, leading the market to price in more chance of a rate cut from the Bank of England, albeit in February rather than December.\n\nThat saw the pound touch a six-week low on Friday at $1.2484. Early Monday, sterling had bounced 0.4 per cent to $1.2591, but remained well short of last week's top of $1.2714. \n\nIn the crypto world, Bitcoin eased 1.2 per cent to $98,208 after running into profit-taking ahead of the symbolic $100,000 barrier.\n\nBitcoin has climbed more than 40 per cent since the U.S. election on expectations Trump will loosen the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/dollar-dips-treasury-yields-after-bessent-pick-4768276","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--sIGhvRmp--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-11-25t000042z_1_lynxnpekao000_rtroptp_3_svb-financial-grou","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:11:30","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":266996722,"title":"Gauging The Impact Of A Second Trump Presidency On U S China Relations In The Middle East","text":"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has already indicated that the Middle East is going to be a central focus of his second term’s foreign policy. He’s already named Elise Stefanik, a fiercely pro-Israel lawmaker, to be his ambassador at the United Nations and he’s been in regular contact since his election last week with both Arab and Israeli leaders.\n\nBut Trump is coming back to power at a time when the region is very different than when he left office in 2020. Back then, China was a marginal player in Mideast diplomacy which is no longer the case. China’s economic and diplomatic influence in the region has increased significantly over the past four years.\n\nIn this special edition, produced in partnership with The ChinaMed Project, Eric hosts six of the world’s leading China-Mideast scholars to discuss their forecast for how Donald Trump’s re-election will impact U.S.-China relations in the region.\n\nThe conversation is divided into two parts:\n\nPanel 1: How the arrival of a new U.S. President fits in the national strategies of regional actors and their relations with China\n\nAhmed Aboudouh is the head of the China studies unit at the Emirates Policy Center and an associate fellow at the Chatham House in London.\n\nGedaliah Afterman is the head of the Asia-Israel policy program at the Abba Eban Institute for Diplomacy and Foreign Relations and a lecturer at Reichman University and Tel Aviv University.\n\nJonathan Fulton is an assistant professor of political science at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi and a nonresident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs and the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.\n\nPanel 2: How a new US President will/might shape US-China relations in the Middle East\n\nDawn Murphy is an associate professor of national security strategy at the U.S. National War College.\n\nZhang Chuchu is an associate professor of international relations in the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai and she is the deputy director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University.\n\nMohammed Al Alsudairi is a lecturer in politics and international relations of the Arabic-speaking world at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nDiscussants: \n\nEnrico Fardella is the director of the ChinaMed Project and an associate professor at the Department of Human and Social Sciences at the University of Naples “L’Orientale.”\n\nAndrea Ghiselli is an assistant professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University.\n\nWatch the seminar on YouTube:\n\nTranscript:\n\nEric Olander: Hello everybody, and welcome to this special round table on the U.S. elections and China’s policies in the Middle East. My name is Eric Olander, Editor-in-Chief of the China Global South Project. We have a very special two-hour event coming up today for you, where we’ve brought together leading experts on U.S. and China Mideast affairs from around the world. And we’re going to divide today’s panel into two parts. And I’ll go through the mechanics of that a little bit later. But we’re going to have this very robust discussion about the first takes of what will happen in a second Trump administration as it comes into power next January. But before we get started into the conversation, I’d like to hand it over to the organizers, Andrea Ghiselli and Enrico Fardella, to say a few comments to welcome everybody to this special event. Enrico, let’s go to you first.\n\nEnrico Fardella: Thank you very much, Eric. Thank you for having us. My name is Enrico Fardella, I’m Director of the ChinaMed Project. The ChinaMed is a research platform supported by the Torino World Affairs Institute, and it’s a platform that looks at the evolving role of China in what we call the Greater Mediterranean Region, namely Southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. And we organize, as ChinaMed, every six month, a series of seminars that are basically trying to look at these growing role of China in this region from like an inside-out perspective. And here we are today with this great event that we put together, thanks to you, Eric, and China Global South. So thank you so much for having us, and I look so much forward to our conversation.\n\nEric: Andrea, if you few comments from you.\n\nAndrea Ghiselli: Yeah, I would just add thanks to you, Eric, and thanks to the speakers today for joining us with different time zones. It was great to see such a great response. And of course, I also look forward to the discussion later on with the audience, and I’m sure there will be a lot to talk about. But just as a preliminary thing, Trump has just been elected, so take everything that is said here as, let’s see what happens. Just informed speculation. Maybe in a couple of months everything will turn out to be true or not — let’s see. But in any case, I hope that everyone will enjoy the forthcoming discussion.\n\nEric: Andrea, I’m glad you brought that up. And that was a point that I was going to make. This is what we’re calling a first take. It’s a quick take. The events are moving so fast, and at the end of the day, we don’t know what’s going to happen. But what we wanted to do today with this two-part round table is to provide you with some ideas and some thoughts and some perspectives from people in the regions around the world as to what might happen. Sometimes these predictions don’t age very well, and especially in this era of clips sitting on YouTube forever. And so I want to put a disclaimer out there in order to encourage our speakers today to take the chances to kind of project and to think about things, knowing that these are very fluid dynamic situations. A couple housekeeping things before we get in.\n\nWe’re going to have two panels. Each panel will have three guests in it. Our first panel is going to be focused on how the arrival of a new U.S. president fits in the national strategies of regional actors and their relations with China. Then, in the second hour, we’re going to have a panel about how a new U.S. president will or might shape U.S.-China relations in the Middle East. So I encourage you to wait for both of the panels because we’re going to have very different perspectives, and we have different speakers from various parts of the world. Also I want to remind everybody that this is an on-the-record conversation. In fact, we’re streaming live on YouTube. And for all of our viewers on YouTube, please put your questions and comments in the chat, and we will then, or at least, you know, post them up and we will then take them to our guests.\n\nJust one final point on decorum. These are sensitive issues. These are difficult times that we’re living in. Not everybody’s obviously happy with how the results turned out in the U.S. The issues that are ongoing in the Middle East today provoke a lot of controversy and tension. And we are hoping today, and we will today have a very courteous and respectful conversation. So if comments coming from YouTube or elsewhere don’t meet that standard, they’re simply not going to get aired. And this is not the venue to air those out. So, let’s start with our first panel, and I’m going to bring three of our guests to the center of the stage. First, we’re joined by Ahmed Aboudouh, who is the Head of the China Studies unit at Emirates Policy Center and an associate fellow at the Chatham House in London.\n\nAhmed, thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. Also, we’re joined by Gedaliah Afterman, who is the head of the Asia Israel Policy Program at the Abba Eban Institute for Diplomacy and Foreign Relations, and a lecture at Reichman University and Tel Aviv University. Gedaliah, wonderful to see you again, and thank you for joining us. And then finally, for this first panel, we’re joined by Jonathan Fulton, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and a non-resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council’s Middle East program, and the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, and also host of the invaluable China-MENA Podcast and the newsletter. Ahmed, Gedaliah, Jonathan, thank you all for taking the time to join us today.\n\nJonathan Fulton: Thanks, Eric.\n\nAhmed Aboudouh: Thank you so much, Eric, for having us.\n\nEric: Well, wonderful. Ahmed, we’re going to start with you. This is the question of how a new U.S. president is going to fit in the national strategy of regional actors. The United Arab Emirates, where you are the Head of China studies at the Emirates Policy Center in many ways is a focal point in this region, both for the Americans and the Chinese. When the new administration comes back in, one of the things that they cite as their major foreign policy accomplishment from the first Trump administration is the Abraham Accords, where the United Arab Emirates was central to that. The Chinese themselves also put the UAE as a focal point of their foreign policy in the region. Let’s start with you to get your reflections on how this election will change or alter the national strategies for the UAE and then thinking more broadly around the Gulf.\n\nAhmed: Thank you, Eric. Again, this is a very important question. And it’ll be a pleasure for me to speak about the Gulf state, especially in their relations with China and the new president. And thank you also for putting forward the caveat in the beginning because our discussion today will be based on speculation. But we are fortunate because we have a new president, but not brand new. We tried him before and we know some of his policies that I expect to continue to be the same. It is clear to me that many governments in the region wanted Trump to win the elections. And this is not surprising because Trump’s mercantilism and transactionalism go very well with the wave of pragmatism that is dominating the region right now.\n\nI think also that a lot in the region think that Trump might be easier to sway compared to President Biden, especially on issues they deem very crucial for the national security. But I think the other caveat here is it’ll be premature to think that by winning the elections, Trump could alter the policies of these countries or their relationship with China. And this is because the Middle East now is completely different than the Middle East during Trump’s first term. The region now is in conflict. These countries think that there they’re more autonomous, they have more options, and that the United States need them more than before in the context of strategic competition with China and Russia. At the same time, China’s influence in the region now is deeper and more entrenched especially when it comes to trade and investment but also in China’s normative offerings, values under the GSI, GDI, and GCI and the local perception of China as an alternative, potential alternative mediator in the region regardless of these countries’ perception of China’s capabilities or abilities to turn its rhetoric into action.\n\nJudging from his first term, I think Trump will have massive loopholes in his Middle East policies. For example, during his first day, Trump didn’t show any interest in charting a meaningful trajectory towards peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. On the contrary, in fact, he adopted a lot of initiatives that supported Prime Minister Netanyahu’s preferences like recognizing Jerusalem at the capital of Israel, the annexation of Golan Heights, or kicking out the PLO representative office in Washington, D.C., and many other initiatives. There’s nothing to convince me this time that this administration, or until so far, they will have a different view on peace in the Middle East. Trump was not interested, and I suspect will not be interested in Palestinian governance or putting a workable plan for the day after in Gaza or push the two sides towards a two-state solution.\n\nAt the same time, this puts massive burden on countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, who are considering normalizing their relationship in Israel because in the absence of such a plan, I don’t think that normalization is viable anytime soon. This in turn means that a comprehensive defense treaty between Saudi Arabia and the United States is off the table, at least in the short term, especially after Republicans managed to get a majority in the Senate. Let’s also not forget that the perception in the Gulf States about the Trump administration after that [inaudible 0:11:26] and attack in 2019, that Trump was not there for them. And subsequently, the United States was not perceived as a reliable partner when it comes to defense and security commitments. At the same time, I don’t think anybody in the region is interested now in joining any future policy of maximum pressure against Iran or ditching their ongoing reproachment with Iran, or be a battlefield in any potential regional conflict between Iran and Israel.\n\nBut at the same time, I think Gulf States also recognize the risks that are emanating from the more assertive and bullish foreign policy that President Xi Jinping and the CCP are adopting now, again, towards the West and the United States and the risks that are coming out of China’s economic challenges from the economic restructuring now that is going on in China. And that will stay with us for some time to come. This will pose risks for their own economic visions and economic transformation policies. And they’re also aware of what’s coming, which is more protectionism, higher interest rates, more inflation, and more de-risking and decoupling, which also will pose a lot of risks for their own economies. So, I suspect Gulf countries will continue to diversify, will continue their multi-alignment policies. I also suspect that they would even increase or escalate their policy of using China as a bargaining chip with the United States in the future while trying to leverage the nearshoring and offshoring policies that come with de-risking on both sides on China and the Western side to localize the manufacturing industry in their own countries.\n\nTo sum up, and the main takeaway here is it is wrong to think that because Trump had a nice workable working relationship with these countries that his administration will be able to alter the relationship with China. On the contrary, I would go, actually, as far as thinking or suggesting that on the last day of this administration, I think China’s interest in the Middle East would be significantly higher compared to current age.\n\nEric: Ahmed, thank you so much for really setting the tone for our discussion today and providing such a great introduction in an overview on this. I just want to remind our attendees on Zoom today that the Q&A function is open. As soon as we get through our next two speakers and their presentations, we’re going to open it up to Q&A. So, I’m inviting everybody to submit their questions, also for you on YouTube, if you’re watching this, to put your questions there as well for our panelists. Jonathan, Ahmed has really teed it up nicely for you. He’s talked a lot about the changing dynamics of the Mid East and the Persian Gulf in particular since the Trumps were in the White House four years ago. China’s posture in the region has changed dramatically in that time. They’re more active in Israel-Palestinian Peace talks. They’ve increased their oil purchases considerably. They’ve deepened their engagement with Iran.\n\nCan you focus on looking at it from the Chinese point of view, which is something you do quite a bit in your own research in terms of how does this change their perception of how to engage the region?\n\nJonathan: Yeah, that’s a good one, Eric. So, thanks for having us on and thanks to the ChinaMed guys for putting this together. And, fortunately, in the next panel, you’ve got Zhang Chuchu, who will be able to really get into the Chinese side a whole lot better than I can. Just looking at it from kind of a macro level, I think, like Ahmed said, we’ve got the benefit, if we call it that, of… it’s pretty rare that an incoming president, we can look at past performance and understand what they’re going to do. So we can kind of make some assumptions about what a second Donald Trump administration’s going to mean for the Middle East and how Chinese decision makers are going to have to engage with that.\n\nI think one of the points I constantly make, China’s interests in the Middle East are primarily economic, and that means that the preference is stability and predictability, that wasn’t the feature of the last time Trump was president. It was a very unpredictable region. It was a very unstable time. It’s very strange for me, I say this not to be the annoying guy who’s not American, but I’m not. I’m from Canada. So, when I’m talking about this stuff, it’s not as somebody who’s angling for an administration position or anything. it’s weird for me walking around campus here in the UAE the past couple of days because my students would all come up to me and congratulate me. And I’d say, “You know I’m not from the States, right? Like, it’s not my election.” And they’d still say, “Well, it’s, it’s great news for everybody that Trump is president again.” My students were young during the last time, and I don’t think they really remember what it was like.\n\nI was just trying to refresh or jog my memory, when, when Donald Trump was president, he flip flopped on Qatar. He was overly generous towards Israel, as Ahmed mentioned, I’m sure Gedaliah can talk about in more depth than I can, but this created a lot of problems in the region. He was very ungenerous towards Palestine, which made things a lot worse eventually, as we’ve seen. And then towards Iran, which I think is the biggest X-factor, pulling out the JCPOA, implementing maximum pressure. I think at the beginning, you’d see a lot of folks here, initially thought that was great to see an American president really coming down hard on Iran. But what we saw was the implementation of maximum pressure resulted in the attack in Fujairah on tankers. We saw the attack on Saudi Aramco. We saw attacks in Iraq. And all this came to a head with the assassination of Soleimani.\n\nAnd that point, up until very recently, I thought was the most stressful period I’ve experienced since I came to the Gulf back in 2006. The day after Soleimani assassination, I thought we were going to actually have a hot war. What we saw around that time, I mean, talking to people in the Gulf, a lot of them, a lot of officials here were actually saying, “We’re going to try to distance ourself from American policy as much as possible.” I remember talking to an Emirati official who had been in Washington talking to American counterparts who said, “We want to speak with one voice. We’re going to send the messaging on Iran. We want you guys to support it.”\n\nAnd the Emirati saying, “No, that’s not reasonable. You can’t expect us to follow you blindly on an Iran policy. That’s very much threatening us.” And you saw the Emirates reach out quietly to Iran and start to change the way they talked about Iran, the way they engaged with it. And you saw that with Turkey and you saw that, I think, with Israel as well. I know we often think of the Abraham Accords as a triumph of Jared Kushner and Trump’s diplomacy. If you read Barak Ravid, I haven’t read his book, I listened to his podcast — you see a lot of agency for local actors and Israeli actors and making that happen. And I think that was because they found unpredictability very nerve-wracking for the region. Now for China, I mean, bringing it back to your question, this is a very long-winded way to get to it.\n\nI think for China, that same dynamic exists. You see a region where they have a lot of expatriate citizens, where they have a lot of economic interests, where they have a lot of assets. A place where there’s been a lot of tension, a lot of conflict that has the potential to spill over and what looks like a pretty reckless administration, at least for the Middle East. There’s a perception that Benjamin Netanyahu is going to have free rein to direct policy for the U.S. and a lot of the levant. That may be good for Netanyahu. I think for other actors in the region, it’s unsettling. Just this morning, the lead story in the Wall Street Journal was somebody from the Trump campaign saying there will be a return to the maximum pressure with Iran that they can see Iran’s on the ropes, and it gives them a chance to really come down hard on them.\n\nFor China. I think that’s distressing, right? They do a lot of business here. And to see this region get much less stable is going to be problematic. I don’t know what that’ll mean because like Ahmed said, it is a different region. China’s a different actor here. Local actors are different than they were four years ago as well. I still think the same restraints or limitations on China’s ability to really shift things here is still a pretty important factor. I don’t think China is the security or diplomatic actor that can move the needle on most things in this region. I don’t think many people here see it in that way. There might be moves to try to engage China more seriously or more meaningfully in security or diplomatic affairs in the region.\n\nI’m not sure that China really sees an interest in that. And then you just scale back and you think, there’s going to be so many other effects — thinking of the Russia-Ukraine war and what this means just more broadly. If this intensifies, then our commodity price is going to shoot up. Are there going to be more economic stresses in countries in the Middle East where there’s weak governance already? What’s that going to mean for political stability here? And what’s China going to do in that situation? So really, I think what we’re seeing is, again, I know what you’d like is a lot of big predictions to say this is what I think we’re going to see. I have no idea. And political scientists, frankly, are terrible at this anyway. But what I do see is just a lot of things that are really the unknown unknowns that we’re all going to be kind of fumbling through.\n\nAnd I think that’s different. The Biden administration wasn’t great by any stretch, but there was a degree of predictability that we were able to look at the playbook and make some assumptions. And I just don’t think any of us can say that right now.\n\nEric: No, I appreciate that. And again, I am just emphasizing over and over again throughout these discussions, what Jonathan’s saying is that we just don’t know. Again, this is a very dynamic situation, but Jonathan, thank you for giving us a forecast. It’s like the weather a little bit. We can’t guarantee for sure that it’s going to be sunny or rainy, but we at least have an indication.\n\nJonathan: Make sure you’ve got an umbrella all the time.\n\nEric: Make sure you have an umbrella. We know that’s for sure. Gedaliah, no one was more excited about Donald Trump’s victory than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I mean, he was openly advocating for Trump. He’s had a very contentious relationship with not only President Biden, but the Democratic Party in the United States. At the same time, the relationship that he has with China has soured considerably since October 7th. We cannot forget that in the time since the conflict began on October 7th, Benjamin Natanya was planning to go to China to meet with President Xi Jinping in October of 2023. And so to see the pace of how, and the speed of how events have changed between Israel and China, and now with the reelection of Donald Trump, help us understand the matrix of all of this from an Israeli point of view.\n\nGedaliah: Thank you, Eric. Again, happy to be here and thank you for the ChinaMed guys for setting this up. Absolutely, I mean, it’s been a very intense, very dramatic year from a Israeli perspective, and I agree with you, Netanyahu not only was happy, I think that was his strategic bet that eventually Trump will win the election, and that will position Israel and his administration specifically in a better position. I think that since in the war itself have changed quite considerably over the last month or five weeks or so, with the shift from Gaza to Lebanon and Hezbollah and Iran, and I think there’s a different mood and also a sense of opportunity within Israel that maybe more can be done on the Iran front. And in that sense, Trump’s election in particular could allow Israel a fair hand in doing more against Iran.\n\nI would say that in general, Trump in Israel is seen as a very, very good president. We mentioned some of the things that happened during his previous presidency — the Abraham Accords, the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. All of these things are seen as strategic, and there is a hope that under the Trump administration, Israel can do two things at once. So, one, go back to the Abraham Accords, expand them, push normalization with Saudi Arabia, and two, as I just mentioned, perhaps do even more to weaken the Iranian stance in the region. I think that after what has been a fairly rocky year or so between Netanyahu and Biden, the expectation is that under Trump, there’ll be much less pressure on Israel to, to do things, especially on the Palestinian front as Ahmed said.\n\nBut we should also keep in mind that there could be pressure to end the Gaza war quickly because that’s something that Trump has said pretty clearly that he wants to end or he wants to see come to an end as quickly as possible. There’s also a sense in Israel that under Trump, we could see a relatively quick return to cross-regional initiatives like IMEC and others, the Indian Middle East Economic Corridors. On the relationship with China itself, you mentioned the souring in the relationship between Israel and China following the sermons of October, and that indeed has been the case. Israel has shifted pretty quickly from considering playing between the superpowers and considering a reality where China could perhaps play a role, even in mediating between Israel and Saudi Arabia to seeing China not only not as a friend, but also as a supporter of Israel’s enemies.\n\nWe’ve seen interesting changes actually in the Chinese position in recent weeks as well. We’ve seen an attempt by China to kind of soften what was a very one-sided anti-Israel approach when the war was focused on Gaza. We’ve seen that shift a little bit with the Israeli successes against Hezbollah and strikes on Iran, where suddenly, for the first time, China mentioned or recognized Israel’s legitimate security concerns. And that was seen as a shift, as a attempt by China to reframe a little bit its relationship vis-à-vis Israel. I think that following what we’ve seen in the first Trump administration, there’ll be clear American pressure on Israel to limit even further its relationships with China, its trade relationship with China, cooperation on infrastructure and technology. I think we might see new areas where there would be perhaps limited or an expect an American expectation for Israeli loyalty.\n\nI think one area that could be relevant for that is electric vehicles. Israel is a small country but Chinese electric vehicles are a huge market here. There’s a huge market here for electric vehicles in that sense. I’ll just add it’s important also to consider that we have seen China trying to calibrate its view and its relationship with the region as things change. And in that sense, I think that I agree with both Ahmed and Jonathan and just say that China will probably take a wait-and-see approach initially, but they will be playing with their position a little bit. Generally speaking, I think the starting point is that China is feeling quite comfortable after a year in which its narrative on Gaza and the war in general has been well received in the region. I think it feels that they managed to discredit the U.S. or weaken, at least on the narrative level, weaken the U.S. position in the region. So it has a good starting point. It’s in a better position than it was before.\n\nBut it’s also aware that things can change pretty quickly, especially if things deteriorate or there’s a more direct, more substantial conflict with Iran.\n\nEric: Okay. That’s very interesting. Let’s now kind of step back a little bit and kind of reflect on these three presentations. I’d like to bring Andrea and Enrico back into the conversation for you to share some of your views on what you’ve heard from Gedaliah, Ahmed, and Jonathan. Enrico, let’s start with you first.\n\nEnrico: Thank you, Eric, and thank you everyone. Very stimulating as always. Let me start with Ahmed and the continuity or discontinuity of Trump administration. Yes, of course, I mean, we already seen Trump policy and their impact on the Middle East in the previous administration, but it’s also true that the outbreak of the Ukrainian war and the rising conflict in the Middle East also are creating a different regional contest and in particular different role for China. This conflict and China’s role in both this conflict have emphasized, in my opinion, the polarization between China-U.S. also at a regional level. And something that I am very interested in and maybe we haven’t discussed yet, maybe we can discuss in in the conversation, is in fact the importance that China has.\n\nI mean, if you read like the word emerging from the Trump administration, for the Trump administration, China is basically all about China, including the incoming economic measures. China’s being defined not as a rival, but as an enemy, basically. And so it would be interesting to understand how the incoming tariffs, the 10% tariffs, and I just came out actually today with a very interesting conversation with Michael Paris on this topic and the potential taxation of capital inflow in the U.S. may reverberate in the region. Because like the effect of this economic policy that actually are being taken are going to be taken by the U.S. administration as a protection towards the distortion, the export of economic distortion coming from Beijing. They may actually generate a more positive trend, I mean, a forced positive trend in terms of trade and investment from China into the region.\n\nAnd this this will increase the role of PRC, maybe also creating a sort of dependency. And then we go back to what Ahmed mentioned about the awareness of the emerging structural crisis of Chinese economy. So, I would like, maybe in the debate, if we can touch upon this relationship because what we are seeing is like a very interesting scenario in which someone, for example, Niu Xinchun in the past, which is a very famous analyst from China, used to say that U.S. and China have actually more interesting common in the region in terms of stability. But what we have seen in the last few months, at least, in my opinion, is actually how this notion of stability in the region is diverging more and more. I would be very curious to, to know what to think about it. And I think I can stop here for now.\n\nEric: Okay. Before we get onto our questions and some questions, some great ones are starting to come in into the question box. And again, I want to invite all of our attendees on Zoom and also on YouTube to submit their questions. We’re going to get to them very quickly. But Andrea, let’s hear from you very quickly first.\n\nAndrea: Yes, and I’ll be very quick. Actually, I have a question for anyone dependent really, it’s a open question. I was very interested in the point made especially by Jonathan and Ahmed about the fact, on the one hand, there’s a normative affinity with the Trump administration that definitely did not exist with the Democrats and Biden, while at the same time, the economic if not dependence reliance on China, is also extremely important for these, for countries in the Gulf. So how do you see this dynamic, contrasting dynamics playing out? Would imagine somewhat countries, especially like the UAE or Saudi Arabia and others to try to maybe nudge Trump policy vis-à-vis China to avoid a two-drastic weakening of the Chinese economy on which countries in the Gulf then rely so much?\n\nEric: Okay, Andrea-\n\nAndrea: And maybe the opposite-\n\nEric: Actually, can I just hold you there? Let’s put that question to Ahmed. Let’s see if Ahmed can take that question right there before we go on.\n\nAndrea: Yeah.\n\nAhmed: Well, it’s a very interesting question, and I think it’s very important to be asked at the moment. I would like to address the tariffs thing and then the balance between economic relations and security relations. Let’s start with Andrea’s question. I think it is well known and became cliche now even that the Gulf states are not interested in replacing the United States as a guarantor of security by China or any other player for that matter. So, this relationship will not go anywhere. But at the same time, we are going through turbulence now when it comes to trade and investment, and this is linking Andrea’s question to Enrico’s question about protectionism. And I think everybody in the region’s aware of what’s going on.\n\nThat is the Biden administration is not crazy about China, just for the sake of punishing China. He is expected to put up the tariffs to force the Chinese companies to invest into the American market. The same dynamic is going on between the EVs, the EU on the EVs with China. This can provide the Gulf States with both benefits and challenges. The benefit is these countries are well connected and they have free trade agreements with the west, not China yet, which will provide Chinese companies with strategic opportunity to relocate some of their operations into the Gulf states, especially with the flourishing of the free zones, industrial zones in the Gulf, and the infrastructure that comes to ports and roads, and so on and so forth. But at the same time, on a cost-benefit calculus on the part of the Chinese, they might think that this will not sort out the problem.\n\nAnd we could see how harsh the Biden administration and also the Trump administration are on Mexico as related to the nearshoring policy and also Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Singapore, and so on. So I think from a Gulf perspective, they will hope to have more investments coming from China and also coming from the EU and the U.S. But at the same time, they are aware that this will might be difficult because China will have to compromise by allowing some of its companies to localize their industrial bases in the West at the same time.\n\nEric: Thank you very much, Ahmed. Andrea, you had another question that looks like you were getting ready to ask. Let’s go back to you very quickly.\n\nAndrea: And just essentially the other side of the same question, whereas countries, some countries might find themself somewhat fighting different forces in a way, dependence on Chinese economy, while also this normative affinity with new American president, I was thinking maybe especially Gedaliah or also Jonathan, of course, could say something else maybe on actually the increasing dependence that will be, imagine from Iran on China and Israel and the U.S. that this new election will create essentially. There is no policy choice to be made. Probably they will love just to follow the trends maybe that the Trump election will create or not.\n\nAhmed: Can I say a couple thoughts on that?\n\nEric: Yeah, go ahead Ahmed. Very quickly.\n\nAhmed: Yeah. I think this is also an important question because it lines neatly with my prediction that we will see more diversification and more hedging. Why? Because these protectionist policies from the United States will force these countries to actually not double down on their relationships with China investment. On the contrary, I think they will be very careful in going all in into the Chinese market at the moment. And I could give you a number, the first nine months of this year, they invested only $9 billion into China out of $55 billion, the sovereign wealth funds invested over the world. So, I think they don’t see this binary competition between China and the United States. On the country, I think they will go around the world and double down on their relationships, trade relationships, investment relationships with other countries, and we could see that and the safer agreements that the UAE has now chartered.\n\nEric: Gedaliah and Jonathan, I’d like to get you both to weigh in. Jonathan, sit tight. Let’s go to Gedaliah first and then we’ll come to you, Jonathan.\n\nGedaliah: Sure. Thank you. Jonathan and I had a podcast early in the war, and one of the things that I said to him is I think the relationship with Israel will be affected politically, but not very much economically with China, between China and Israel. And I think for now that’s pretty much held true. I do expect we’ll see more American pressure and more emotional American pressure. And like I said, we’ll hear things like loyalty and Trump expectation to see visible signs that Israel is doing what America wants on China in the region. And I think there will be a greater willingness in Israel to comply given the situation. EVs, as I mentioned, are probably a hot topic.\n\nOn Iran, I think we’ll see a pretty interesting dynamic because Jonathan mentioned the article in the Wall Street Journal today, I think we will see more pressure on Iran and that we expect will create more dependency, economic dependency from Iran on China, which could bring benefits and could bring opportunities for China. And China has used it in the past. But it’s also important to remember that under the first Trump administration, China actually, in some ways, did less with Iran. For example, China’s oil trade with Iran came down to almost zero at the end of the Trump administration, and actually rose under Biden administration again. I could also imagine a scenario where China says, “This is becoming too complicated. We’re going to do much less with Iran and focus on Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the region and other actors.” So it’ll be interesting to see how that develops.\n\nEric: Jonathan, let’s get your take.\n\nJonathan: Yeah, there’s a lot in there. I mean the Iran side I think is interesting. I was just going to make the same point that Gedaliah did that the China-Iran Conference strategic partnership was initially signed in January, 2016. Trump came into office, he won that November. And as a result, you saw China really step back from Iran in a lot of ways. The economic relationship between the two really deteriorated during the first Trump administration. I don’t think that’s going to change. I think China is going to not want to risk getting sanctioned, secondary sanctioned. They’ll probably be pretty hesitant to do too much with Iran. And frankly, they don’t do a lot, like a lot of the stuff you’ve seen with Iran has been buying oil from second parties to refining these teapot refineries that aren’t connected to Swift.\n\nIt’s been a very cautious economic relationship. It’s been very one-sided. It’s been very opportunistic. For the Gulf economic side, I think one thing, when you talk about economic dependency from the Gulf on China, they do a lot of trade with China. Obviously, they sell a lot of energy products to China. They buy a lot of everything, which is a vulnerability. That’s a structural vulnerability in the economic relationship because China’s saying 2030 rather is going to be peak oil for them. They’re going to start reducing their consumption. The goal is to be done with it by 2060. Gulf countries are going to think, “Well, what else do we have to sell?” Right? “We still buy everything from China and China’s going to stop buying the one thing that we really sell to them in any meaningful way.” One thing on the investment side, I mean, it’s also very one-sided, China’s not investing much in this region despite the hype.\n\nAnd Gulf countries have been very reluctant to put their money into… they’re just as risk intolerant as everybody else. They look at the Chinese market and think — this is very unpredictable, right? We’ve seen a lot of Chinese companies, a lot of Chinese firms, a lot of Chinese officials coming here to try to get Gulf capital to go into Chinese real estate, into Chinese businesses. And it’s just not happening. There was an investment fair here in Abu Dhabi in May, and the Chinese ambassador to the UAE said, “Hey, the Gulf Sovereign Wealth Funds have like $2.3 billion in China right now.” And a lot of folks went, “Wow, that’s a lot of money.” Well, it is, but they managed $4.2 trillion worth of assets, so 2.3 is nothing. And when Mohammed bin Zayed, the President of the Emirates, was in Washington in September, one of the figures we kept seeing was that the Emirates has about a trillion dollars invested in the U.S. So, the idea that China’s the major economic actor in the Gulf and the U.S. is the major security actor, I think that’s a really clumsy narrative. Also just, I mean, and I know we’ve got to move on, but just dissecting trade, trading in good versus traded services — China does a lot of trade in goods, and that’s important. but when countries are trying to rebuild these kind of hydrocarbon-dependent economies into something more sustainable, it’s the trade in services they need. And that’s what countries like the U.S. and the Europeans and the UK, that’s what they have to offer. So, it’s a very different dynamic than just China handles the money and the U.S. handles the military.\n\nEric: Yeah. Enrico, over to you.\n\nEnrico: Well, yes, Jonathan, I totally agree with you. I have a question for you. So, how do you envision the impact of Trump economic policies in this regard? Do you think that because it’s evident that this may favor like a stronger trend of this dynamic that you correctly say, comparatively speaking between China and the U.S.? Of course, China is not such a dominant actor as sometimes it’s being portrayed. So do you think that U.S. economic policies that Trump economic policies, the tariffs, they may actually become like a boost in this direction and maybe change? How do you envision the impact of these policies on China’s and the Gulf relations?\n\nJonathan: Sorry, was that for me?\n\nJonathan: Well, I mean, I think we’re going to see… Actually, I don’t know. I mean, the way I look at it, the transactional of it, I think a lot of folks think that the Gulf is quite comfortable with that. One of the things I heard throughout the Biden administration when I talked to Gulf officials or Gulf strategic thinkers was they’d say, “Look, our relationship with the U.S. is strategic, our relationship with China’s transactional.” And they would say that as a way to say, look, the U.S. is much more meaningful to us. We do stuff with China that helps us, but it doesn’t cover everything. just watching the AI story here over the past year, I think has confirmed that. AI has seen, especially in the UAE, and increasingly in Saudi, as an existential opportunity.\n\nIf you’re so reliant on expatriate labor for so much of your workforce, and you can bring in digitization, you can use AI to resolve that. That takes a lot of the uncertainty off. So, when they’re working with us firms on AI, they’re thinking this is going to be a long-term important thing. I think the economic side will probably continue to flourish because I think the U.S. is going to lean on them to bundle trade with other things. We saw Trump, in his previous administration, would often reduce everything to deals, right? When Aramco was hit, it was like, if you want more protection, give us more money. So I think probably what these countries will do is say, “Let’s make sure more money’s going to the states,” whether it’s to the Trump Hotel in D.C. or whether it’s buying more whatever, food, agricultural products, whatever, because it just seems like a smart policy to keep your biggest strategic partner happy.\n\nEric: Ahmed, I’ll get to you very quickly, but I just want to remind everybody, we only have about 10 minutes left, and I do want to get a few questions in from the audience. In fact, Ahmed, I’m going to come to you with this first question. Since the Trumps were first in the White House, the BRICS has expanded considerably, and it’s become something much larger than just five countries. And in fact, the UAE and Egypt are now part of the BRICS+. Will that have any impact on the undercurrents of that body in terms of how the GCCs, the Gulf Cooperation Council’s balancing act with Washington? What role does the BRICS play in all of this, do you think, Ahmed?\n\nAhmed: Okay, that’s also an interesting question. I would just like to say very quickly a couple of points on Jonathan’s remarks, which I agree with. But I think the relationship of the Gulf States with both the U.S. and China will most likely, in my view, develop into high tech from the U.S. manufacturing from China. So, these countries are very, very interested in building their manufacturing bases. I don’t think there is yet a massive input from the United States companies and EU companies to help them do that. I think they recognize the importance of bringing Chinese engineers into the Gulf to help them to do that in the long term. And also, I think that we are seeing a specialized manufacturing input from both sides. When it comes to China. We are thinking about the renewable energy and technology, EVs, batteries, solar panels, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhen it comes to the U.S., it’s advanced technology, AI. Why? Not because only of their partnership with the United States, but also because the United States and the West are the best in this field. One example is South Korea. South Korea is very good at nuclear technology, the EU went to South Korea. So, if, for example, Europe was as big as the United States in AI and chips, advanced chips, the Gulf States will not have a problem to build a partnership in this field with Europeans or Asians or Indians or whoever. Going back to the BRICS, I think we are seeing a very fast development in the BRICS sphere and very increasing interest in the Middle East. In fact, some countries like Algeria are very frustrated of not being invited the last summit to be members.\n\nAnd they feel like they are being treated less than other countries who were invited. And this shows you how attractive the idea became given even with all the challenges, the internal divisions in the BRICS, the lack of structural, or structure, governance structure and all that, that we know. But still, countries seem to be interested. Why? And this is the important question. Because they just want an umbrella of protection from sanctions, from weaponizing the dollar, first and foremost. Second, they want financing opportunities, investment opportunities from these big nations that are the original members of BRICS. Trump coming in the Whitehouse, in my view, will likely accelerate this trajectory as countries look at how he uses the weaponization of tariff as a statecraft tool of coercion against other nations he doesn’t like or he doesn’t agree with their policies.\n\nTop of the list is China and Russia. When this happens, and even European countries, when this happens, I think the attraction of BRICS will increase not only in the Middle East, but across the global south. New ideas within BRICS will come up to make it more institutionalized like BRICS pay, and so on, and a lot of financial infrastructure, a lot of cooperation in this field. And I think what Trump will do as a service to China and Russia is to make BRICS a meaningful body unlike what it is now.\n\nEric: Okay. Thank you, Ahmed. Let’s go to another question. Gedaliah, you brought up this question of Chinese EVs. One of our attendees says the total exports of Chinese EVs are estimated at around 700,000 to 750,000 in 2023. Israel shares roughly about 10,000, a mere 1%. Would that really be a needle mover for loyalty for U.S. in containing Chinese EVs? That comes from one of our questions. Gedaliah, what’s your take on that?\n\nGedaliah: I would say yes. I think it’s a lot about the symbolism and Israel being seen to act again, it’s about loyalty, it’s about symbolism, it’s about Israel showing Trump that it’s listening to him on these things. And this is in contrast to at least the perception in the U.S. in the past that Israel has been quite wishy-washy in its relationship with China, and not very attentive to U.S. concern. So in that sense, I think it’s an area where Israel could fairly easily show that kind of move. As we’ve discussed earlier, the relationship between China and Israel anyway has been shrinking in most areas and is also limited by definition. I think that’s just something that we should keep in mind. Is it a game changer? Will it change the strategic [inaudible 0:52:05] between China and the U.S. and the Middle East?\n\nI’m not sure. But I just wanted to add something to what Ahmed said about BRICS and BRICS+ plus. I mean, I think we should keep in mind that part of the reason that China is seen as some kind of alternative to the U.S., if you want to call it, on the economic front, on the strategic front. It’s because there’s a trust gap between the region and the United States. And the question is, under Trump, would that be better or worse? Would the region trust the United States longer term more or less? And I tend to agree with Ahmed that the trends will actually accelerate in the other direction where there’s a lot of benefits in the region for having a Trump as a president for a while. But longer term, I think the foundations of the relationship with the U.S. might actually become weaker and push trends more towards other actors, including China.\n\nEric: Okay. We just have five minutes left, and we’ve covered a lot of ground. It’s very dense everything that you’ve given us to think about, we have to kind of pour through. So I’d like each one of you, in really 60 seconds to just a minute or two, to help our audience on what to look for on these topics going forward. What’s your best suggestion on how to think about this issue of us China and the Mideast with the incoming Trump administration? So Ahmed, let’s start with you, and then Jonathan, and then Gedaliah, we’ll come to you. Ahmed, just a very quick food for thought for our audience to take forward in the next six to 12 months.\n\nAhmed: Two points. First, let’s understand that from a Chinese perspective China’s influence in the Middle East and the level of aggressiveness of China’s approach to the Middle East depends on the bilateral relations with the U.S. China started its aggressive approach to the Middle East under Trump after the trade war in 2017, and started to tout some normative ideas in the Middle East. If these two countries don’t chart a rapprochement, we will expect Chinese China to be more aggressive. The second one is the Middle East now is going through massive transformation that is depending on the United States and supporting Israel’s vision of reconstructing the regional order, with Israel first among equals or even the leader of the region. Why? Because the United States want to focus somewhere else.\n\nThis will not bother the Chinese. The Chinese don’t, in my view, care too much about the shape of the framework of security in the region. And in fact, they will continue to free ride in the region. But they will always have this issue with isolating Iran because what October 7 taught us is that no initiative, excluding Iran, can go forward in this country, in this region.\n\nEric: That’s great. Jonathan, what’s your key takeaway for people to follow in the next six to 12 months?\n\nJonathan: Yeah, that’s a good one. I mean, really, the way I look at it, I think we frame a lot of this, not today, but I think just in general, the way this often gets framed is U.S. and China are calling the shots. Like there’s this great power competition taking place in the region, and we’re all reacting to Washington or Beijing. I would watch more what actors in the region are doing and how they’re using this situation because they have a lot of agency and they’ve got game plans too. They’re watching this and trying to figure out how this is going to fit in with their own development agendas, their own security agendas. I think we often give too much credit to the Grand Wizards in Beijing and Washington and the strategic communities for shaping events. And I think that often misses what the really interesting stuff that’s happening on the ground. It’s great that Mohammed Alsudairi, who’s, to my thinking, one of the sharpest strategic thinkers that he’s on the next panel. He can give you some local ideas about this. But I would listen more to folks from the region on this stuff because they’re saying a lot of pretty interesting things.\n\nEric: Okay. Gedaliah, we’re going to give the last word to you for this panel.\n\nGedaliah: Thank you. I agree with both Johnson and Ahmed. I think that the Chinese policies would be mainly reactive, at least initially. I’m not expecting any big strategic initiatives from China, not to bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians and not to mediate between Israel and Iran or anything like that. I think that a war and a full-out war between Israel and Iran would have quite an impact on China in the region. But I also agree that in the end, one of the most important things that shape China’s position in the region is its relationship with the United States and how that plays out. I think as we see, on the one hand, as Jonathan said, what’s happening in the region itself, what the actors are doing, especially the war, and on the other hand, the dynamic between Beijing and Washington themselves. I think that could give us clues as to how we see things develop in the Middle East in the coming years.\n\nEric: Gedaliah, Ahmed, Jonathan, thank you so much for your time and your insights on this and for sharing what is, again, a very fluid issue and your forecast. And I just want to reiterate, again, these are quick takes. Please don’t hold anybody to these because the events are changing on the ground so fast. Just a reminder, Ahmed Aboudouh is the head of the China Studies unit at Emirates Policy Center and an associate fellow at the Chatham House in London. Gedaliah Afterman is the Head of the Asia Israel Policy Program at the Abba Eban Institute for Diplomacy and Foreign Relations, and a lecture at Reichman University and Tel Aviv University. And Jonathan Fulton is an assistant professor of political science at Zayed University and a non-resident senior fellow for Atlantic Council’s Middle East program. Thank you all so much.\n\nWe really appreciate it. We’re going to put links to all of your bios in the show notes when this program goes on our podcast and on YouTube later. And so we want to thank our first three panelists for their contributions. And now I’d like to welcome our next panelists who’s going to transition now into a different discussion, how a new U.S. president will/might — we don’t know, again, there’s a lot of conditionality in all of this — shape U.S.-China relations in the Middle East. And I’m very excited for this panel because we’re going to have perspectives from both China and the United States and again, as you heard from Mohammed Alsudairi, who is an expert in these affairs and more broadly. So, very excited to have with us Dawn Murphy, who’s an Associate Professor of National Security Strategy at the US National War College. Zhang Chuchu, who is an Associate Professor of International relations in the School of International Relations and Public Affairs at Fudan University in Shanghai and also the Deputy Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University. And of course, Mohammed Alsudairi, who is a lecturer in politics and international relations of the Arabic-speaking world at the Australian National University.\n\nDawn, Chuchu, and Mohammed, welcome, and very excited to have you join us today.\n\nDawn Murphy: Thank you for having me.\n\nMohammed Alsudairi: Thank you.\n\nEric: So, you’ve had a chance to, to kind of sit in the bullpen and listen and get warmed up for this conversation. Dawn, we’re going to start with you given the fact that the events that unfolded this week happened in the United States. You are a longtime follower of U.S. and Chinese engagement in the global south, particularly in the Middle East. Let’s talk about how Trump, too, is going to shape the Great Power competition in the Middle East.\n\nDawn: So the first thing that I should actually say is that I need to give a disclaimer that today the views that I expressed are my own and they don’t represent the U.S. government. With that said, I think the way that I look at, and as it’s already been framed, there’s a lot we don’t know, this is a fluid situation, this is speculation. But the way that I’m looking at this is, first, thinking about continuity and change between the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, and what that may tell us about an incoming Trump administration. So, the first change from Trump to Biden was that the first Trump administration had a very strong focus on trade, in particular the trade deficit with China and implementing various tariffs. And at this point, there’s been campaign promises of having across-the-board tariffs on all countries potentially importing goods into the U.S. in the 10% to 20% range, and particularly tariffs on China at 60% or higher on some goods.\n\nSo, if the Trump administration returns to that focus with a much more muscular approach to tariffs, I think you’ll see the Middle East becoming much more important for China, for its exports for its broader economic engagement, and potentially China becoming more important for the Middle East if trade with all countries ends up being at a higher tariff level. So, if you have more protectionism in the U.S., I think it could draw China and the Middle East economically closer together. Another change from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration was that the Biden administration focused on framing national security strategy in terms of a contest between autocracies and democracies. I would assume going into a new Trump administration, there will be less emphasis on that potentially. And that could have a couple of different effects. It could potentially just be that there’s less concern regarding the ways in which China’s interaction with countries in the Middle East could support or facilitate authoritarian regimes.\n\nThat could potentially be an impact. It also may be that countries in the Middle East are more comfortable with the U.S. if there’s not as much a focus on the democracy aspect or the human rights aspect, for example. But it very well, in a new Trump administration, could cut in a different direction because there are definitely elements within the Republican Party. And even if you look at the end of the first Trump administration, a focus on the CCP that the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese Communist Party influenced globally and worries regarding the authoritarian and communist aspects of China’s governance. So I think that could cut either way. Another change in focus between the first Trump administration and the Biden administration was that the Biden administration focused more on multilateralism. I’ll get back to this in a minute, but I would assume that the second Trump administration may not focus on that as much.\n\nFor example, with NATO, there may be less worry about Turkey joining the Shanghai Cooperation, for example, right? There are some different impacts of that. So at a high level, that’s what I’m looking at. Looking forward, thinking through what was said in the first panel, as well as some emerging dynamics that I think we could see, I’ve already spoken to the economic side, I think there could be closer ties across a broad range of issues. With the U.S. focusing less on multilateralism and China over the last four years, and even before that, obviously for decades in many ways, focusing on multilateralism in the region, I think you very much could see China emphasizing even more the ways in which it is building institutions in the Middle East as well as throughout the global south.\n\nWhether that’s the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council. The first panel talked about BRICS+. BRICS+ is already becoming more important. Middle Eastern countries are key to that expansion in many ways. So you could see more emphasis on that. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization continuing to expand to include the Middle East. The Gulf Cooperation Council, China FTA, Free Trade Agreement. The Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilizational Initiative, all of these things I would expect that China will continue to build for its own purposes, but that will be in stark contrast to how the U.S. potentially is dealing with the region. Another trend I would pay attention to would be that if the U.S. under a new Trump administration becomes more isolationist, that could result in less U.S. focus on the Middle East. And as a result, because the U.S. is the primary security provider in the region, perhaps China will need to step up and provide more security for its own citizens or for the [inaudible 1:05:41] of communication.\n\nAnother part that I’m thinking through right now that also was mentioned in the first panel was that if under a new Trump administration there are stronger support for Israel from the U.S., this will give China an opportunity to further differentiate itself from the U.S. in the region in regards to the Palestinian issue as well as its criticism of Israel. I’m not going to go into it in detail, but again, it was mentioned in the first panel, I think over the last year, China has actually been able to gain quite a bit of positive perceptions about its Palestinian leaning stance and about its broader approach to the region. And so that may become even more prominent as we go forward. Another element of this is if we have a more confrontational approach towards Iran coming from the U.S. government, I would expect that China will continue to stress its balanced approach between Arab Gulf states, Iran, other actors in the region.\n\nIt may offer to mediate more between Iran and Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. Another element of this is if the U.S. focuses more on Iran, you may all be looking at the fact that within the U.S., there’s this emerging kind of debate about whether there’s an axis that’s developed between China, Russia, and North Korea, and Iran. So, if you have an emphasis on Iran, that narrative may start to have a lot more traction. Another piece to think about, I would say, and this was mentioned in the first panel as well that if you have a more transactional approach, perhaps because the U.S. and China do share a lot of interest in the Middle East, maybe there will be cooperation on ending the war in Gaza or other issues. So, I don’t think we should count that out.\n\nI think it’s hard to know what a Trump administration, how that will be approached. If relations between the U.S. and China deteriorate under the new Trump administration, there may be more pressure on countries in the Middle East to take sides. That’s something that was discussed on the first panel quite a bit, but there’s a lot of strategic autonomy that’s being exercised. But the space for that strategic autonomy may become smaller if relations become much worse. Another thing I would pay attention to is the fact that President Trump won the Senate is moving towards Republican majority, and the House may also. So, when you combine that with this emerging bipartisan consensus regarding a China threat, it may result in a more adversarial relationship between China and the U.S. broadly under the next administration. And so concerns about China in the Middle East may rise as a result of that.\n\nAnd the final thing I would say because I know time is very limited is one really important thing to to watch is who Trump appoints in various roles in the cabinet and other advisory roles. Because it’s one thing to look at Trump’s approach to China, but in the first administration under Trump, a lot of the policy really the nuts and bolts were driven by specific advisors. And I think it’s way too early to tell what that looks like. So, overall, I think you’re going to see closer relations between China and the Middle East and the economic realm, closer political relations, and possibly this becoming more of an area where countries are asked to choose between the U.S. and China if thin","url":"https://chinaglobalsouth.com/podcasts/gauging-the-impact-of-a-second-trump-presidency-on-u-s-china-relations-in-the-middle-east/","image":"https://chinaglobalsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MIDEAST-PODCAST_WEBSITE-768x154.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:09:29","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.517},{"id":266996702,"title":"Xi Took Center Stage At G20 While African Union Kept A Low Profile","text":"This week’s G20 summit wrapped up much the same way previous G20 gatherings have in recent years, with a weak final communiqué and lots of discord among the group’s members. But this year’s summit in Rio de Janeiro was nonetheless notable as it marked the African Union’s debut as an official member of the body.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping was also a stand-out at the summit, where he took a number of veiled shots at the United States in his keynote address as he sought to bolster China’s self-appointed role as spokesperson for the Global South.\n\nThis week, Eric, Géraud, and Cobus discuss Xi’s speech and whether African representatives should have been more outspoken now that they have a seat at the G20 table.\n\nShow Notes:\n\nReuters: China’s Xi announces steps to support ‘Global South’ at G20 summit by Eduardo Baptista\n\nThe Conversation: Brazilian presidency of the G20 is likely to end with limited results by Vinícius Rodrigues Vieira\n\nChatham House: What the African Union’s G20 membership means for Africa\n\nTranscript:\n\nEric Olander: Hello, and welcome to another edition of the China in Africa Podcast, a proud member of the Sinica Podcast Network. I’m Eric Olander, and today on our week-in-review program, I’m thrilled to have back on the show, CGSP’s Africa Editor, Geraud Neema, joining us from the beautiful island of Mauritius, and our managing editor, Cobus van Staden, joining us from Cape Town, South Africa, where it’s extraordinarily windy today. So, you may hear a little bit of noise in the background. A good evening to both of you.\n\nCobus van Staden: Good evening.\n\nGeraud Neema: Good evening.\n\nEric: Okay, gentlemen, we’re at the end of the week. A very exciting week in international diplomacy, given the fact that the G20 met this week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. On Monday and Tuesday, Brazilian President Lula, Inácio Lula da Silva hosted leaders from 19 countries along with representatives of the European Union. And for the very first time, the African Union was there as well. Altogether, this group accounts for two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global GDP, and it’s one of the reasons that there’s a lot of hope that the G20 is going to be the body that can rally international consensus around some of the critical issues that we’re facing today.\n\nPeople don’t have a lot of faith in the G7. S. Jaishankar, the external affairs minister from India really blasted the G7 as this kind of exclusive club, and so everybody’s looking to the G20. Now, on the agenda this year was the eradication of hunger around the world and the launch of Brazil’s Global Alliance against Hunger. Lots of people talked about hunger, but nothing really came out of the summit. The final communique was rather bland as these are want to be. Year after year, there’s a lot of hope that the G20 is going to be something that’s going to do something productive for the global south in particular, but nothing really seems to happen. Geraud, I’d like to start with you because this was the first year that the African Union Commission participated as a full member of the G20. The a AU Commission issued a statement that its representatives participated in talks over, and let me just issue the four points that they prioritized, advancing social inclusion, not entirely sure what that means; fighting hunger and poverty, facilitating sustainable energy transitions, and reforming global governance institutions. What was your take on the African Union’s debut on the world stage at the G20?\n\nGeraud: First of all, we have to applaud that finally the African Union is represented, even though I think that is much more cosmetic than anything else, much more representative than substantial. And I know that many might be angry about the comment I’m making right now, but yes, I do believe that’s the case. I also believe that debut was quite shy. And it’s understandable because given how Africa Union works, given the Africa Union Commission is without… an organization that does not really have real power, real political power to speak for African countries, I think it was a bit of difficult for the African Union to start with strong agenda, with strong topic on the table, and also to take strong statements, strong approach into that. So, I think it was really quite shy. The new kids in the block trying to learn the ropes and trying to build alliance, trying to know how to follow.\n\nAnd mind you, you have South Africa sitting on the table as well. Now, how do you manage that? Having one country with South Africa being there, having Africa Union being there, how do you manage all those dynamics that’s happening on the table? I do believe that it was a quite complex and difficult approach for the African Union to maneuver. I’m really quite curious to know how the African Union prepared at how countries’ members really… did they really do something substantial in a way that the African Union representation will be substantial, not only just for representation, not only for show? That I’m not really quite sure. So when I look at the different point of discussion, yeah, I’d say very Africa centered and very on par with what we are talking about right now, energy transition, angers, and all those issues.\n\nSo, yes. But the question would be, what did they get out of it? Did they really push to obtain something substantial, results and actions? And you mentioned about anger. Did we talked about anger but really without having anything really on the table? When we see how the G20 ended up with a bit of the fuss, even there, it was quite difficult for African Union to really get anything done, really.\n\nEric: Cobus, it was a very subtle debut for the African Union. Not a big presence as Geraud said. Not lots of huffing and puffing. But we live in an era of politics of huffing and puffing. This is an era of contentious politics — Ukraine, Gaza, Trump, Xi Jinping being there, the Chinese, all of it. And if the African Union wants to assert itself, it’s going to have to speak up. I guess I was surprised that when the climate talks at the G20 this week, more or less collapsed at one point, this would, to me in the era of this kind of contentious politics, would’ve been the moment for the African Union not to leverage power as Geraud pointed out, the African Union doesn’t have a lot of power by design of its member states, but it has moral power.\n\nAnd this would’ve been a moment when the representatives from the AU and the AU Commission could have convened a press conference and said, “This is unacceptable that these climate talks fell apart. You guys caused this problem, get back in there and solve it.” That wouldn’t have required power in terms of raw absolute power. That is a moral power that Africa has to be able to assert itself as the primary victim of climate change and the least among those responsible for perpetrating it. But it didn’t do any of that. And I just wonder if it’s going to take this more reserved approach in this new contentious era of great power politics. Will the African Union ever be heard?\n\nCobus: I mean, I share your concern, but at the same time, that would be a very big swing for the first time they’re included.\n\nEric: Yeah, why not? I mean, that’s where you got to go. Do you know what I mean? I even sense in you this hesitation like this is where we are today in politics.\n\nCobus: Yes. No, definitely. Definitely. And I mean, I think that that was complicated by the fact that, in the first place, COP29 is happening at the same time as the G20, right? So, the G20 wasn’t alone in talking about climate. It was one of two very like huge complicated parallel negotiations. In that context, I think the G20 did achieve one thing, which was to move closer to shared language on what the contributions are supposed to be from large developing countries, which is a big fight at COP29 at the same time. And it’s interesting there’s been some splits in the global South coalition at COP29 with Nigerian representatives actually calling for China and India to occupy some kind of middle space where they also make contributions.\n\nWhat they achieved at the G20 was to clarify obligations versus voluntary contributions, which seems like very, very abstruse legal terms. But it translates into very big differences in terms of what different countries will contribute. The other thing that the African Union did achieve was they were part of a new fund or a new set of institutions and funded institutions that’s aimed at facilitating access to scientific achievement and to do more targeted research. And that has actually been set up by the African Union, South Africa and China and Brazil. So that is an actual achievement. The thing that I would look forward to is some, some of the subsequent G20 meetings would be some of like really well-developed African Union talking points to get more attention.\n\nA major one is illicit financial flows. And there we will see the real moral weight of the African union because the people they’ll be up against will be mostly G7 governments because when we’re talking about illicit financial flows, we’re not talking only about corruption, we’re talking mostly about tax avoidance by large transnational companies. So, there, I’d look to that as an interesting development for the next G20 conference or G20 meeting, which I think is going to be in South Africa. I think that will be the more natural moment for the AU to take on a much more muscular position. I think it may be a tall order on their very first summit.\n\nEric: Well, let’s just pick it up there, because the highlight for Africa at this year’s G20 was in fact the handover from President Lula to your president, Cobus, Cyril Ramaphosa. And Ramaphosa gave a five-minute speech announcing the priorities for the next G20 that’s going to happen when South Africa takes over next year, and he’s going to promote inclusive economic growth addressing food security, leveraging artificial intelligence and innovation for sustainable development. Those are going to be his main priorities for the coming year in the G20. Geraud, when you hear that coming from Ramaphosa, do you think those should be the priorities of an African leader when they are now in charge of one of the world’s most important multilateral forums?\n\nGeraud: I think it’s trying to be centered around what would be current Africa issues, but at the same time being forward-looking in a sense where you don’t want to send to those issues on what Africa is, on what we want, on what’s the current issues of Africa because those issues are “backward,” and those issues are… they’re stereotypical to Africa. He wants to bring those issues, the forward-looking future issues in a way that despite the problem that we do have right now, we want the kind of issue, we want to address those kind of issue that’s going to take us to the next step of development, in the next step of evolution. That’s why talking for example, talking about AI, which for many African country will make no sense whatsoever, Like, why are you talking about AI in Africa?\n\nI understand that it’s a new topic. Countries like China, the U.S., the United Nations are trying to make sense of it, even try to regulate it, what can happen. But in Africa, we are still far behind in that priority. But you talking about that doesn’t really make sense to us. But I will understand that South Africa being the most developed country in Africa, really trying as well, to also take Africa to say, “We’re not going to be stuck in those spots of those old issues that are ours. Let’s try to move forward to the issues that can take us into the future. At the same time, we’re going to try to address our current issues, but our current issues don’t need to be at the central point of what G20 can be for the future for us.”\n\nEric: I guess, Cobus, the thing that surprised me the most when Ramaphosa laid out his priorities is that there wasn’t much talk about debt relief. And the G20 used to be, remember, back during the pandemic, the main forum to discuss debt relief. And that’s where, of course, the debt sustainability initiative came out of. The common framework came out of the G20, both of them largely ineffective, unsuccessful initiatives, for the most part. I think we can call those efforts a failure. Never was a priority of the G7 countries to really address debt relief in the G20. You remember during the pandemic era when the debt issues were most concerning for the G20, they literally copied and pasted a lot of the language over from one year to the next, and from one meeting to the next. This year, very low priority. But I was surprised that Ramaphosa didn’t make debt relief a bigger issue because not only is it a problem in many African countries, across the global south, we’re looking at trillions of dollars of debt now that is going to come due and is weighing down developing countries. Surprising to me. What’s your thought on that?\n\nCobus: Yes, it is interesting. I mean, it’s a really important continental issue, but here we are now in the politics between South Africa being a G20 member and the African Union now also being a G20 member. So, dividing the continental issues and trying to work out the politics of hen South Africa gets to speak for Africa and when they’re not supposed to, that quite underlies some of that issue. It’s a big issue, yeah.\n\nEric: Which is a very sensitive issue among African countries. It’s a super-sensitive issue that a lot of African countries do not like the fact that South Africa is self-nominated as the spokesperson for the continent. And that, in fact, Geraud, that wrinkled the bricks a little bit between Ethiopia and Egypt as well.\n\nGeraud: Yeah, I understand that. But I think that in international power, we don’t need only representation, we need substance. I understand that people would like equality representation and everything, but at some point, if you want to get things done, you’re going to have to have one big kid in the block, that kid that say, “I’m going to get things done.” And South Africa is in that position to do that. That’s why I believe that G20 under South Africa, with the Africa Union, I believe that next year, the next G20, you’re going to Africa Union being much more vocal because it’s going to be under South Africa G20. And I think South Africa was going to try to also make both itself and also Africa Union shine. I believe that people can complain why South Africa did that. Who else could have done that? At the end, who has the power, who has the leverage, who has the exposure, who has the resources? Which country has that resources really to do that? So if you don’t have that, instead of complaining, let’s find a way to work around that.\n\nCobus: I guess the only thing I’d add is that in the end, while certain African countries suffer disproportionately under the pressures of debt relief and how difficult it is to do debt restructuring at the moment, Zambia being obviously the most important one. Particularly, I mean, South Africa has a lot of issues, but that isn’t particularly South Africa’s issue right now. And there’s also I think the strategic avoidance, I guess, of painting debt problems as essentially an African problem when several of the countries in other parts of the world. And what really we need to talk about is the brokenness of the global development financing system. There, obviously, Africa really has a lot to say and needs to take a strong intellectual role. But at the same time, I think they may well be hesitant to paint this as an African problem, whereas what it actually is, is a global north problem.\n\nEric: Okay. Let’s shift now away from Africa and look at the major powers. I think it’s fair to say that this G20 summit was not America’s finest diplomatic outing. There were some rather embarrassing moments for our aged president here in the United States, Joe Biden was under a palm tree apparently when they did the family photo. And when they discovered that he was missing, I mean, I think he was just 10, 15 meters away, the U.S. State Department said that this was due to logistical issues, but he did not appear in the final family photo with all the other leaders. And what was very interesting is that once everybody, and if you watch the video of this, once all the leaders realized that he wasn’t there, people were screaming, “Hey, Biden’s over there.” They just said, “Eh, don’t worry.”\n\nAnd they all kind of walked off stage. And I think that was, if you’re looking for a little bit of a metaphor for America’s place in the world today, that might have been it. Of course, everybody sees Joe Biden now as an authentically lame-duck president. There was a lot of talk about the incoming Trump administration. We’re going to get to that shortly. But the big player at this year’s G20 was, of course, Chinese President Xi Jinping. He was the heavy hitter that came. I think the value for Xi was less at the G20 and a lot on the sideline meetings that he had. That made a lot more news than his appearance at the G20. But let’s talk very quickly about what Xi said at the summit, and it does relate to Africa in some sense because Xi tried to bolster China’s credentials as a, if not the, or a leader of the global south.\n\nI wish I had some sound. I couldn’t find his speech anywhere available to share with you. So I’ll have to read you a few of the quotes and I’d like to get both of your reaction. Xi said in his address, “China has always been a member of the global south, a reliable and long-term partner of developing countries, and an activist and a doer in support of global development.” Geraud, China is really pushing this role as a leader in the global south. It’s competing with India for that mantle in many respects. But do you think that other developing countries, particularly those from Africa, look at China as a global south country, as a developing country? Or do you see it more as one of the big, advanced industrial economies?\n\nGeraud: I think they see China in this hybrid place where sometime it’s that industrial country and also the global south. The global south approach, I think, is much more ideological than anything else, not economically, because when you look from an economics perspective, when they visit China and when they go to New York, they go to Paris, they basically see, okay, China is already in that stage of development, but the reality is when you look at the data, it’s something else. And I think that beyond the data, it’s also much more ideological to see China as a global south because of China’s stance against the global north and powerful country, want represent the current establishment of the international politics, the international order that they all seek to reform now in the global south. So yes, from that regard, they see China as a global south because whether they like it or not, they’re going to see also China as an ally.\n\nIt is an objective ally. An ally that has much more power and leverage and leeway to be able to get something done in terms of multilateralism, in terms of change they want to see happen in the international system. So yes, I do believe that many countries in Africa would see China in that hybrid places depending on who they’re talking to and when they’re talking about. But overall, they’ll see China as a global south country because of the ideological purposes.\n\nEric: Do you think that rhetoric, Cobus, that Xi Jinping laid out as a member of the global south resonates with African countries?\n\nCobus: Yes, I think it does. In the first place, obviously, as we saw at COP29, I think some African countries do draw distinctions between developing countries at the size of China and India and increasingly Brazil and Indonesia, and the rest of the developing world. I think that makes sense. Obviously, these are outsized economies. What China does when it keeps talking about itself as a global south country is it makes a very, I think, powerful, it’s a very powerful gesture, I think, because unlike Japan and South Korea, China isn’t putting itself on the trajectory of having been poor in the past and now having faithfully entering the developed world, and now being able to think of themselves as just simply the same as France, for example, right?\n\nThat is an ideological gesture, but I think it’s a very powerful ideological gesture, and a very, very relevant one right at the moment. Because I think what China is implying there is that no one is becoming a developed country anymore. It’s impossible to become a developed country anymore. None of these large, rich developing countries are ever going to be Belgium-style fully developed countries simply because that category is so crowded out by the G7 that no one is able to join that category anymore. In that sense, I think what China’s doing is political, but it’s political with a very long horizon, knowing where they’re going to be for a long time and knowing where everyone else is going to be for a long time.\n\nGeraud: I think, Cobus, you’re raising a point that’s very interesting to say that no one is going to get to that place of developed country, and thus the need for us today to reform the international system that has been stuck against all of us, not allowing us to get to that stage. And it’s really interesting because at the end, it’s really now carried a mantle of like we want to change, we want the reform. This is why basically we are also calling on those change to happen because the international system has been rigged against countries like us to be able to get to that level. And another element of ideological perspective is to say that, when you look at the FOCAC readout and everything, China’s modernization, the way they define modernization, which is for them is not westernization, you realize that it’s like, it’s also being able to reach the new developed stage that’s not the current developed stage. You see? I don’t know if you see what I mean.\n\nIt’s like being modernized, being industrialized without being what we’re up against today. And I think it’s very ideological and subtle the way China is approaching that question of global south and representation.\n\nCobus: Yeah, I agree. What I would add to that is that it implicitly then asks the question, why is the global order set up in a way where some of, like, when once a country somehow magically attains this developed status, then it gets to dictator to everyone else, right? Why is there this pecking order where somehow it’s natural for developed countries to, say, appoint the head of the IMF and the World Bank? And why does no one else get a say in especially considering that they are being affected much more by the choices made in those institutions?\n\nEric: Is that a rhetorical question or is that a legitimate question? Because money is power.\n\nCobus: I think that’s a question that China’s raising. I think that’s a question that China is asking.\n\nEric: China didn’t have any power on the world stage when it was a poor country, but now, today, as a major power, it has a lot more authority because it’s rich or richer.\n\nGeraud: But when they ask about the IMF, yeah.\n\nCobus: It still doesn’t get to appoint the World Bank governor, right?\n\nGeraud: Exactly. Exactly.\n\nEric: Well, those are legacy institutions, but Xi, in his speech, he laid out eight points of calls for reform. And so Geraud, I don’t know if you were channeling Xi Jinping thought on this one or if you read the speech very closely, but let me read three of the points that stood out to me the most. He wants to improve global economic governance, and this is a quote, he said, “As main creditors, international financial institutions and commercial creditors need to take part in debt reduction and suspension for developing countries.” Now, this is a line that the Chinese have been putting forward for the better part of a year now, saying that the multilateral development finance institutions, the World Bank, the IMF, any of these Bretton Woods institutions need to do more because they are among the primary creditors.\n\nAgain, a lot of people make the mistake that China is one of the major creditors in Africa, which it is, but it only accounts, today, for 11% of the debt on the continent. Eurobond and multilateral development bank financing and loans account for the significant majority of external debt on the continent. He also talked about improved financial governance, here’s another quote, “… to increase the voice and representation of developing countries.” There you go, Cobus. “The World Bank should carry out shareholding review and the International Monetary Fund should carry out a quota share realignment in line with the agreed timeframe and roadmap.” This is a very sensitive issue for the Chinese in particular because when they went to the Obama administration and said they wanted a shareholder review and they wanted a larger quota at the International Monetary Fund, I think it was the IMF, maybe it was the World Bank, they were turned away.\n\nAnd they said no. And that’s what prompted the Chinese then to start the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. So that inequity speaks to, I think, to a lot of the frustrations, Cobus, you were talking about. And then finally, the last point then I’d like to get both of your takes on this — improve global trade governance. Now this one, this is the code for the United States that he’s talking about — “Oppose unilateralism and protectionism.” That is a direct reference to the United States and the sanctions and tariffs. “Restore the normal functioning of the dispute settlement mechanism as soon as possible at the World Trade Organization.” We’ll get onto the WTO in a second, but Geraud and Cobus, those are the calls that both of you are talking about that probably resonate very, very loudly among the African delegations. That’s good politics for the Chinese, there’s no doubt about that. Cobus, let’s start with you and then, Geraud, I’d like to get your reaction.\n\nCobus: I think these remarks would get a lot of sympathy, I think, in Africa. It was notable that he foregrounded international development, which isn’t necessarily a given in a G20 context. And the G20 isn’t necessarily that interested in poor countries no matter what they say. And so it was interesting, for example, dovetailing with Brazil’s anti-hunger stuff, he was also voicing support for G20 anti-poverty initiatives, which include also forms of knowledge transfer as part of relocating research to the global south. So, in a lot of ways, a lot of what he was saying I think was resonating with people in parts of Africa that are very conscious of structural exclusion from these decision-making structures. So, yeah, I do think it resonated.\n\nGeraud: Oh, yes, I share the same views with Cobus, and I can feel and see how the African Union delegation will be like, yes, China is talking for us. And it’s even answering the question that you’re asking if China can really proclaim itself, self-proclaim as leader of the global south, when you see the point that you mentioned, yes, I think it has that “legitimacy” to say, I’m the leader of the global south, I call for reform and everything. And he managed to put also his own agenda with the U.S. in that point. But yes, I think it resonates a lot with African countries that are also hoping those changes to happen, hoping those reforms to happen. Just to get back to the first questions, Africa Union could have said much more, could have expressed much more and could have tried to raise some new points that was really much aligned with Africa with African interest and with African situation, which was not the case.\n\nBut at the end, China tried to pick up, but let’s not forget that China somehow has also a certain part of responsibility, structural responsibility to a certain imbalance that we see, especially in trades between China and Africa in international trades. So yeah, those are the things that needs also to be addressed at some point.\n\nEric: Yeah, well, what she did not talk about is the fact that in trade, that China’s very distorted trade with Africa is contributing to a lot of the problems too. I mean, we have to be honest because we just saw the new Kenyan trade numbers come out and imports are surging of Chinese products, and exports are not going up in anywhere near as much. And so the current trade system certainly benefits a country like China and its ability to pump out enormous amounts of goods for countries that make it difficult for them to compete, given the fact that they can’t beat that China price. So, it’s cheaper to import products from China than it is to make them in a place like Kenya. And that results in these huge trade deficits, which definitely puts pressures on the economy. Certainly, the Chinese are not going to advocate for anything that’s going to hamper that trade.\n\nThey’re going to focus their efforts a lot on the United States in particular and the tariffs that are coming down. One of the other issues that Xi brought up was the question of modernization. And I know this is a big topic for you, Cobus, because this is obviously a concern for many developing countries, especially those in Africa. And so he said, “China does not seek to be a single player.” Again, another throwing shade in a little bit of a dis at the Americans, but rather hopes that a hundred flowers will blossom and that it will work hand in hand with the vast number of developing countries to achieve modernization. Any China watcher or historian may have had their ears perk up when he referenced hundred flowers that will blossom. Because nerdy China watchers are going to remember that in 1957, Mao said, let a hundred flowers bloom, and there was a campaign to promote criticism of the Communist Party that only led to the Anti-Rightist crackdown in 1959, 2 years later, that led to the deaths of considerable and imprisonment of a lot of people.\n\nSo Xi does fashion himself as a descendant of Mao and in terms of his political heritage. So that choice of 100 flowers were blossom really was rather interesting choice of words. And nothing is done by accident, by the way, in a speech by the Chinese. So that must have been an intentional reference to Mao. And I wonder, Cobus, and again, we’re going way, way out of our lane here, okay? But let’s just try this. There is a right-wing surge in U.S. and Europe. Is it possible that they were trying to signal that this was an anti-rightist of right as type of reference, I mean, subtle as it might be? I mean, what could explain that kind of reference in your view? And again, I know you’re not necessarily a China historical scholar on this one, but it just seems so odd to me that that reference would’ve been included in his speech.\n\nCobus: Yeah, I have no clue. I really, I’m not sure.\n\nEric: Okay. Pleading ignorance is perfectly fine on this show.\n\nCobus: I mean, if it’s a dog whistle, it’s a very specifically abstruse one which I don’t think anyone will get. So, it was very confusing for me. Yeah.\n\nGeraud: Exactly. Yeah, because I don’t believe that people in the audience were really… they picked up into understanding what that reference means. And given that China language with the Chengyu, those proverbs that you throw here and there in your speeches, most of the time people don’t get them. I think that many of them just say, “Yeah, it’s one of those Chengyu that he put in the speech and that’s it.”\n\nEric: Chengyu is, of course, the Chinese word for sayings. Who knows? But remember that his audience isn’t only an audience in the room. His audience is also an audience back home too.\n\nGeraud: Yeah, true.\n\nEric: He has a very large domestic audience that he has to play to. Anyway, we have a lot of much smarter people who listen to the show than we are on this, and we would love to hear from any China scholars out there if they thought that reference to a hundred flowers will blossom was a reference to Mao’s hundred flowers campaign as well. Maybe, might be a stretch, who knows? But let’s get back to the key point here. He’s promoting multilateralism and modernization. That is, again, very much code. And those are the dog whistles, as you talked about, against the United States that he says are unilateral and protectionist.\n\nAnd in many ways, they say hamper modernization because of U.S. trade policies. That feels like a winning lying to me because multilateralism in the global south is something that is strongly advocated for. Geraud, when we talk about multilateralism, Africa and African countries are very much opposed to the current, basically, unilateral position that the United States has and would like to see more powers at the table. Much of the way that the Indonesians have laid out in the Bandung Conference in 1955 for the Non-Aligned movement. And we’re talking about a modern non-aligned movement that wants to displace the United States as the sole power and give more power to global south country. So, it feels like Xi’s rhetoric is probably going to hit the mark on that one with a lot of African countries.\n\nGeraud: Oh, yes, definitely. It’s already started during the FOCAC in September, multilateralism reform of the international system came up in the FOCAC final declaration and the Action Plan in 2025, ’27. So yeah, it just tells you it’s really trying to align itself with Africa interest and African frustrations because that’s where he’s playing the smart card to say we are all the victim of that rule-based order that only serve the interest of a few and discard the interest of the many of us. And we want that to change, we want that reform, we want that new approach in the international system. And we want the multilateralism in a sense where it’s not what the U.S. says that pass, it’s not what the “international communities,” when they say that language, lingo, international communities, when they say that from an African perspective, it’s usually the G7 minus few countries, but those countries. When they say that, it’s really a call for a system where every country somehow, every countries or every region’s opinion are taken into account, especially when you have crisis.\n\nWhen you have crisis in, for example, in Libya where Africans are saying something and France at the Security Council and United States decided, no, we’re going to impose a no-fly zone on over Gaddafi and everything and the crisis that ensued after that. It became a regional crisis after that. So yeah, we want an international system where we are also present, where when you talk about the Security Council, where you have permanency there, where we want to be present and talk about that. But something, a caveat I would like to mention here is when China talks about that, China doesn’t also lay out its own clear vision of what it sees to be the international system, even though it’s mentioning multilateralism.\n\nDoes it sit to a system where there is equality, each countries are all the same? Or is it a country where there is a certain sense of hierarchy in the system where that hierarchy is still respected? And here, I’m remembering one of the podcasts where we had a few years, I think last year when you received a guest, we were talking about the way China is seeing hierarchy in the Asia and how it’s perceiving it. And I’m really wondering if it’s also the same vision that it has regarding the reform of international system.\n\nEric: No, China has traditionally seen itself as a supreme power in Asia. And China defines itself as the middle kingdom. And I think Chinese historians, and that was a show, Cobus, you and I spoke with a scholar in Japan who talked about the hierarchy of power in Asia, how China sees itself as the apex power in Asia today. And there was even a quote from Yang Jiechi, who was the former foreign minister and the former top foreign policy official for the Chinese Communist Party who said China’s a big power. And there was some reference, I think, to a South Pacific country. “You’re a small power, and because of that, we get to set the rules.” So, in many respects when we talk about this multilateralism, Cobus, it’s not everybody on the same level. China will still see itself as a major power and not on the same level as say Mali, right? I mean, they’re not talking about this kind of equal level for all countries. Is that your take on that as well, Cobus?\n\nCobus: That is the impression I get as well is that China feels that the global system needs to be reformed, but part of that reform is to acknowledge China’s own size and power and development. So that inherently implies that some other countries will be weak and smaller and less developed than China in that system. I guess then the question becomes how is the decision-making going to be more inclusive and how will it operate differently from what we currently have, and whether it’s just a situation of replacing one strong country with a different strong country.\n\nEric: Well, I think they would probably put up the examples of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and even to some extent the BRICS that were both Chinese initiated. Now, some people will say that the AIIB is definitely a China-led organization. I think the AIIB would disagree with that strenuously. It’s got member states from U.S., I mean from Europe and from Africa and from Asia and from all over the world. And they’re using these multilateral institutions that they created as examples of this less intrusive governance style. The key question comes is at what point does that sense of comradery and benevolence that the Chinese are saying in their governance style, at what point does that stop when interests can contradict their agendas?\n\nSo, when criticisms of Chinese human rights policies, criticisms of Chinese moves in the South China Sea, for example, or things that hit any of the Chinese red lines, at what point then does the Chinese governance style become a lot more assertive and a lot less multilateral?\n\nGeraud: And I think that’s the part of that vision of multilateralism is the sense where there’s no country that has now the right or the legitimacy to criticize another country foreign policies or stance on any kind of issues. Because as long as we don’t have a permanent country or prominent group of country, which norms and value dictates the way we see the international system, the way we see the international order, it means that we are in a space where there’s no legitimacy for any specific or any group of country to criticize any country, big or small, in terms of the foreign policies and in terms of the internal policies. And I think that the vision of multilaterals they have in mind where basically there’s no one set of norm that’s dictated based on one group of country’s interest.\n\nEric: So, three other points that Xi raised, and we won’t go into detail on it, but he wants to improve global digital governance. We heard quite a bit of that at the summit from other leaders. He didn’t go into too much detail about it, but he also wants to improve global ecological governance and improve security governance. So, Xi’s eight points that he talked about at his speech were very much about reforming the international system. I think, Cobus, to your point, it’s about changing the architecture of the international system to be more inclusive to be less dependent on the United States. All of this comes again in the backdrop of the incoming Trump administration and what’s going to happen. I’ve been here in the United States for the past two weeks, I’m heading back to Asia this week, and it’s been interesting to be here because there is a sense of covering your eyes and looking at what’s happening, but at the same time, keeping your fingers very open over your eyes because you can’t turn away from what’s going on in Washington and the appointments of the new cabinet that are taking shape.\n\nAnd so we’re trying to get a sense of what the Trump foreign policy doctrine is going to be like. Semafor reported, and I’d like to get your take on this, Semafor reported that advisors close to President-elect Donald Trump are pushing for renewed U.S.-Africa policy, which focuses on, and this is going to be their line, I think, “deals and deterrence.” And so they’re going to also roll back some of what they see as the overly progressive “woke diplomacy” under the Biden White House. This would involve promoting evangelical Christian conservative interests — Cobus, I know you’re going to have something to say on that — and reversing some of the pro-LGBT policies championed by the Biden White House. So, it looks like the priorities are going to be focused again on China. That’s the deterrence. Cobus, when you hear that coming from the whispers in Washington, how do you interpret that?\n\nCobus: Well, in the first place, I’m not surprised that, of course, they’re punching down on LGBT people because that’s the only thing they know how to do, right? Is punch down on LGBT people. In general, I had to laugh a little bit because this is like, what deterrence? What deterrence are they going to have in Africa? More militarization than they already have? More threats of kicking people out of AGOA? Trump already kicked Rwanda out of AGOA for refusing to take second-hand clothes. What more do they want to do? It strikes me as quite hollow. I don’t expect much action in the U.S.-Africa relationship over the next while because there was zero action in it under Trump, or very little at least, and relatively little under Biden, except for big plans being announced, which I now have quite strong doubts that they’ll actually move forward. From my quite admittedly cynical take, I think it’s big talk and nothing more.\n\nEric: So Semafor also quoted Cameron Hudson, Geraud, who we’ve known quite well over the years. He’s an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which, of course, is a big think tank in Washington. And here’s what Cameron said, he said, “The administration is going to be very pro-business because they see Africa as an opportunity, as Trump himself has said in the past.” And he said that the hope is going to be by doing more deals, the U.S. is going to crowd out the competitors. And I think, again, just as the Chinese use all these code words, when they say competitors, they’re not talking about the Nigerians. They’re talking about the Chinese. So, deals and deterrence, crowding out the competitors, we’re getting a lot of wonderful alliterations coming from the potential Trump administration. What’s your take on crowding out the competitors?\n\nGeraud: You know, when you talk about deals in Africa, you’re the United States in one hand. In the other hand, you also have to keep in mind that you should not be kicking out South Africa out of AGOA because basically it’s the only country in Africa-\n\nEric: Which they haven’t done yet. To be fair, they have not done yet.\n\nGeraud: So just to say that if it was somewhere in their mind, it needs to be put aside completely because it’s the only country in Africa where you can actually say, okay, we can really make substantial deals that fits the current profile of United States and African countries. Because when you remove a country like South Africa, or maybe to a certain extent Nigeria, Egypt in the north there, you don’t have many countries in Africa where the U.S. can say, we are going to make deals, business deals, not humanitarians. One way business deals. And mind you, when you have a country where the private sectors is risk-averse about the political instability in different countries, the profile market of different countries, the return of investment, return on investment, and all of that, how African countries, the market power is not so powerful, it’s not so rich and everything, at the end, you know that yes, there’s only few African countries where American companies or American business or the United States can really make business deals happening.\n\nAnd those countries are South Africa, and accept that you don’t have much of them. So when he says that it’s going to be a lot of deals, I was like, yeah, not many of them will be really fitting on that profile of having business deal. You’re going to have a lot of talks, you’re going to try to promise, you’re going to try to do that, you’re going to incentivize companies to go and invest. But in the same time, you’re going to come back to us and say, “You know what? We don’t control the way companies perceive each countries and everything, and we cannot do that.”\n\nAnd here I’m mentioning it because yesterday, there was this talk that was organized by Carnegie, and they had, as a guest, a former U.S. secretary assistant, Tibor Nagy. And he mentioned the case of the DRC, my country, where he said that, “We had a lot of hopes in the DRC. We kicked out Kabila, and President Tshisekedi came and he wanted American companies to come, but unfortunately,” and he said that, “unfortunately we are not like Xi Jinping, we cannot just order a company to go to invest in your country.” You have those reality-\n\nEric: That’s shocking how clueless that statement is.\n\nGeraud: Exactly. Look at what he said, and you realize like, yeah, when they say deals, I say, come on.\n\nEric: Okay. So, what Tibor doesn’t seem to understand, and it’s remarkable to me because he’s been a professor and he’s been an assistant secretary of state for African affairs at the State Department. He’s traveled up and down, he’s been focused on China for a long time. What he doesn’t seem to understand is that the secret weapon that the Chinese have to get companies to go abroad is Sinosure. That is the risk insurance division of the Chinese government that backstop some of these investments, a lot of these investments. It’s the very thing that a lot of American companies and European companies have been asking for from their governments as well, to provide that risk insurance that will make it easier for them to go to high-risk countries like the DRC, less because they’re being ordered by the CPC or by the Chinese government. Again, they don’t understand the mechanics of why the Chinese have been successful in places like the DRC.\n\nEric: Just for those of you who may not have been able to follow what Geraud was saying on the AGOA and South Africa, let me just provide a little context there. AGOA, of course, is the free-trade pact between the United States and Africa. Only about 25 countries now are members of AGOA. Is that correct?\n\nGeraud: Yeah.\n\nEric: Yeah. It’s about half of the continent. There’s been a lot of grumblings in Congress over the past year, particularly among Republicans, and among some Democrats too, that South Africa is increasingly aligned against us interest by cozying up with Vladimir Putin, with doing deals with the Chinese, and, of course, supporting Gaza at the International Court of Justice, which something that people in Washington take great offense at. Cobus, when you hear this about crowding out the competitors, Geraud is very cynical, I presume you’re also very cynical because, at the end of the day, I’m not entirely sure what American business in Africa actually looks like, simply because the mining companies have said, made it pretty clear they don’t want to go back into Africa, into places like the Congo.\n\nIt’s too risky for them, their shareholders just aren’t going to support it. Freeport-McMoRan left the Congo during the first Trump administration. A move by the way that a lot of ex-Trump administration officials say was a tragic mistake on their part, not to block the exit in the deal that they did with CMOC on that. But the United States is a tech and finance economy, it’s a service’s economy. Let’s say that it actually did materialize where there was a lot of interest among Americans, what would they sell to Africans and African countries.\n\nCobus: There’s a lot of American companies doing business in Africa. For example, Ford, Coca-Cola, a lot of big players, the ones that are interested in setting up in Africa largely already have set up in Africa, and they are doing business. I mean, the question is, which other ones somehow miss the continent on the world map and need to now be reminded of its existence? The entire discourse seems to me a little bit of a fantasy play. Because it seems to assume that there is this hidden pool of African money that these companies can exploit and that they just haven’t yet. Yeah, I don’t know. I think the difference on the Chinese side is, A, as you said, companies like Sinosure do underlay and support these companies to be able to do business.\n\nBut the other big difference is that these companies have business to do there. They have stuff to sell, they have roads to build, they are on the same page as African economies. And by the way, not only China, but it’s also true for the rest of the Indian Ocean realm. One of the large reasons why the U.S. and Europe, it’s always funny for me when they talk about, oh, it’s so difficult to get all these European and American companies to do business in Africa as if the entire economy within which Africa functions wasn’t set up around Western power. Africa is in the position it is in because it serves the purposes of Western power for it to be in that position.\n\nIf it weren’t, it would be in a different position. For a hundred years, Africa’s position in the global economy was a unipolar situation, largely driven by Western power. So now for western governments to be like, “Oh, yes, Africa, we should be doing business.” Why won’t American companies do it? What? It’s ridiculous to me. This entire conversation, I have to admit this, the entire discourse as it comes out of Washington at the moment for me is risible actually.\n\nGeraud: But Eric, I’d like to add on something else. And I think that’s something that can be interesting in a sense where the space they can be. They can be in a space where FinTech and startups, financing those young startup in Africa, but that space is not a space where there is a need to have competitions. And this is where I go back to the framing of all of it. Like, yes, it’s not because U.S. is going to invest in Africa to make business there that you need to oust the competitions. And Africa is so big as a market, as a continent, as opportunities that one country cannot pretend by itself to say, “I’m all in everything that you’re going to need.” So, if U.S. wants to be back, they can be back. But they just have to be sure that in the space where they think they are… They’re just going to have to choose the space where they’re much more competitive than the space where they cannot actually win. And it’s going to be a waste of time and a waste of money and energy to try to be in a space of infrastructure, for example, or build. No, that’s not going to make sense at all. They’re just going to have to keep that in mind. Yeah.\n\nCobus: Yeah. Just adding to that, I find it very disingenuous when everyone keeps talking about, oh, it’s so difficult to get western companies to engage with Africa because Africa is so risky, when the Western financial industry is making huge money, like distorted risk perceptions around Africa. There’s already an entire predatory finance system set up to exploit risk perceptions of Africa. And which was, by the way, encouraged by these governments, the U.S. governments and Western governments encouraged these industries to hunt for frontier markets where they can get higher yield. That was fully explicit. To now suddenly be realizing that, oh, Western companies find Africa risky, yeah, they do. Of course, they do. This is the entire point.\n\nEric: Well, I just want to leave you both with one final thought that came out of the Semafor article that apparently there’s interest from some in Washington who are keen on diplomatic postings in Eastern and southern Africa for game hunting opportunities.\n\nGeraud: Game hunting.\n\nEric: They want to go hunting, they want to kill wildlife. That’s where we are in 2025 America. So, forget about everything else. They want to go on a safari.\n\nCobus: A few years ago, there was some MAGA monster who was posing with a dead giraffe. And I was like we’re sending box on her house, like, really?\n\nEric: My goodness. That’s where we are today. Okay, so we will continue to look at what’s going to happen and unfold in the incoming Trump administration and how it’s going to impact the China-Africa discourse. I get the sense, and I think you guys do as well, that we’re going to go back to the China, China, China, China, China, China, China policy. There’s going to be a lot of that. But in part because Marco Rubio, who is the expected secretary of state, he’s big on that. Now, he’s not going to focus as much on Africa as he is on Latin America and the Western hemisphere, which has been his area that he’s focused on. But no doubt he’s going to bring that same level of alarm to Africa. And it’ll be interesting to see if he goes to Africa in the first year of his time in office.\n\nGeraud: The Q will be who’s going to be the assistant secretary for African Affairs. I think that guy will be at the center point of Trump administration of African policy.\n\nEric: Maybe it might be Cameron Hudson. We don’t know.\n\nGeraud: Yeah, maybe. You never know.\n\nEric: We never know. So we’ll find out. Usually those appointments come closer to the inauguration when obviously the secretary himself has to be named. So after Rubio is gotten through the senate confirmation, then the deputies will be named, which is the assistant secretary. So that is a key position which we’ll be keeping an eye on.

In an April visit to China, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen privately and publicly raised the Chinese economy’s “imbalances and overcapacity.” Yellen expressed worries that this overcapacity could harm U.S.\n\n industries. A particular focus of attention on the overcapacity debate has been China’s “new three” sectors of solar power, electric vehicles (EVs) and lithium batteries – products that are also central to China’s and the world’s low-carbon energy transition.\n\nAnalysts say that EVs are expected to face further setbacks under the second term of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose transition team is planning to cut EV tax credits and further increase tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the characterisation of these sectors as experiencing overcapacity. And not everyone thinks these “imbalances” are a bad thing. Some argue China’s huge production capacity in low-carbon sectors could offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the global energy transition, particularly in the Global South.\n\nUnderstanding Overcapacity\n\nSimply put, overcapacity occurs when a sector’s production exceeds market demand. This imbalance can lead to lower-priced exports and unfair trade. It has implications for companies in other countries, which may be forced to downscale or close if outcompeted by low-priced goods, leading to job losses.\n\nThe U.S. and EU have cited these negative consequences as a justification for the tariffs they have imposed on China’s “new three” goods. In May, the U.S. announced trade tariffs of 100% on Chinese-manufactured EVs, 25% on lithium-ion batteries and 50% on solar cells. In July, the EU announced similar measures on Chinese EVs, a measure formalized at the beginning of October with tariffs of up to 45%.\n\nU.S. and European officials also point to what they call “unfair” subsidies from the Chinese government that have boosted the country’s production and global competitiveness. According to an April report by the Kiel Institute, subsidies for green tech companies in China surged in 2022, with EV giant BYD receiving 2.1 billion euros – nearly 10 times the 220 million euros provided two years earlier.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China is responsible for three-quarters of all lithium-ion battery production, which is crucial in the manufacturing of EV cars. China also produces over 80% of the world’s solar panels, with exports increasing by 34% in the first half of 2023.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping remarked at a China-France-EU trilateral meeting in May that there is “no such thing as ‘China’s overcapacity problem’”. Meanwhile, Chinese economist Chen Yuyu attributes the imbalance more to “weak economic cyclical demand” than excess supply.\n\nBoth Chinese and global demand for low-carbon technology is expected to experience a boom in the coming decades. The IEA predicts that by 2030, based on government targets and pledges that go beyond existing policies, global EV sales will hit 45 million units, which would more than triple the number of new EVs seen in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, global demand for solar photovoltaic system components and batteries is forecasted to expand rapidly over the coming decades. China has set ambitious targets for solar power as part of its decarbonization goals. A 2023 Global Energy Monitor report notes that China could double current levels of solar capacity and meet its 2030 target of 1,200 gigawatts (GW) by 2025. Globally, wind and solar energy are expected to more than double their share of global electricity generation, from 12% in 2023 to 30% in 2030, according to an IEA forecast.\n\nThat said, the Chinese renewable sector is suffering from an imbalance of supply and demand, which is driving down profits at precipitous rates. Industry conversations have been increasingly dominated by the need to control production.\n\nThe View From the Global South\n\nThe debate on overcapacity in the three green sectors concerns not only China and the West but also the Global South, particularly Africa, where some experts view the overcapacity issue differently. Frangton Chiyemura, a researcher specializing in political and economic developments in the Global South at the Open University, tells Dialogue Earth that Africa can help China alleviate the “overcapacity” by connecting demand with supply. While the African market is relatively small for now, cooperation between China and Africa in technological innovation can expand markets for Chinese new energy goods, he says.\n\nOne way in which some of China’s “overcapacity” in the green energy sector is being absorbed is by expanding exports directly to Global South countries. Pakistan, for example, imported 13 GW of solar photovoltaic capacity at a lower cost from China in the first six months of the year. South Africa is experiencing the largest growth in imports of Chinese solar panels into Africa, having imported 4 GW of solar panels in the year up to September 2023, capable of producing electricity equivalent to about 3% of its annual demand, according to a report from think-tank Ember.\n\nRenewable energy production in Africa is low compared to other regions of the world. The whole continent generates just 13 GW of electricity from solar panels – a far smaller capacity than many individual countries worldwide. Chiyemura says China could consider relocating some of its production lines to Africa, pointing to African economies’ relatively high levels of market access to the U.S. and Europe.\n\n“Many African countries have favorable trade agreements with Europe and the U.S., with limited tariffs,” he notes. “If China and some African countries consider the possibility of producing products such as solar photovoltaic systems or wind turbines in African countries… some of the products would be consumed in the local market, but the majority of the products would be targeted at foreign markets.”\n\nHe adds that African countries have many tax exemption agreements with EU and U.S. markets. The African Growth and Opportunity Act, for example, offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for more than 1,800 products from eligible sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nThe head of the Africa Finance Corporation, Samaila Zubairu, has also proposed that China counter the overcapacity narrative by collaborating with Africa to diversify its renewable-energy supply chain.\n\nThe establishment of renewable energy manufacturing capacity in Africa would also dovetail with African economic objectives to develop manufacturing and increase value add on the continent, as seen in policies like Rwanda’s National Strategy for Transformation.\n\nMuyi Yang, a senior researcher at the independent energy think-tank Ember, believes that diversifying supply chains will also benefit China in the long term. As resource constraints grow, transferring industries to resource-rich regions will be more sustainable, he says.\n\nConnecting the dots\n\nWhile there is a clear potential alignment between China’s production and Africa’s needs and vision, action will be needed to capitalize on the opportunities.\n\nYang said the biggest one relates to the lack of infrastructure deployment in African countries and the poor investment environment in local markets, in which foreign investors are hesitant to enter the local market and where most of the countries are dominated by public utilities. “The public sector is unable to support enough new energy projects, and the private sector is reluctant to invest, making it difficult to get projects off the ground.”\n\nThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held in September showed some positive signals, including a pledge to “[provide] African countries with new energy technologies and products, implement 30 clean energy and green development projects, and set up a special fund for the China-Africa green industry chain”. The Beijing Action Plan, a blueprint for the next three years of China-Africa relations adopted at FOCAC, also affirmed that the country would “[support] Africa in developing local value chains, manufacturing and deep processing of critical minerals, build growth circles for China-Africa industrial cooperation in five regions, undertake ten supporting projects of industrial parks for African countries, and hold 100 training sessions on industrialization”.\n\nChiyemura sees these indications as a positive step. “The signal from the Chinese leadership is that we are going to set up some policy instruments to support green industrialization in Africa [and] is a step in the right direction. The signaling effect means that Chinese companies operating in Africa, whether private or state-owned, are likely to shift their commitments towards greener renewable energy projects.”\n\nFikayo Akeredolu, a researcher on the political economy of Nigeria’s energy transition at the University of Oxford, says she favors technology transfer and business investment from investors over economic aid. She notes that technological developments can bring more dynamism and incentives to new energy development and mean that African countries would play an active role in world politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Huang Yiping, dean of the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development at Peking University, has suggested that the Chinese government should implement the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for low-carbon products. The “Green Development Plan for the Global South,” as he calls it, would provide financial support for Global South countries to buy Chinese low-carbon goods, stimulating demand for Chinese manufacturers’ products and supporting green transformation and economic development around the world. He noted that it could, like the Marshall Plan, create a positive cycle of “benefiting others while benefiting oneself.”\n\nFor the Global South, China’s “overcapacity” can be seen as an opportunity for an energy transition, especially when much can still be done to achieve climate goals. But how China fosters South-South cooperation to enable it to continue exports of new energy products to EU and U.S. markets will be critical, be it through building factories, ramping up technology transfer or supporting new energy industry growth in Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\nXie Ruohan is the founder of the pan-cultural Chinese podcast Anachronism.

Ajo kapercaktuar drejtimin e zhvillimeve me te rendesishmepolitike, ekonomike e sociale te viteve 1960–70 dhe me vone. Gjurmet e ketyre zhvillimeve I gjen edhe sot ne fushebetejate dy tre zgjedhjeve te fundit presidenciale ne SHBA, perfshire tentativat per vrasjen e Donald Trump. Asnjezhvillim I rendesishem ne politiken amerikane dhe asnjemekanizem mbi te cilin ajo funksionon, nuk mund tekuptohen teresisht pa njohur vrasjen ne Dallas dhe teashtuquajturin skandal I Watergate.\n\nPer te hedhur drite mbi vrasjen e Kennedy u ngriten dykomisione hetimore. I pari, I njohur me emrin KomisioniWarren (I emertuar pas Earl Warren, Kryetari I Gjykates se Larte dhe kryesues I Komisionit) u ngrit menjehere pas vrasjes se Presidentit Kennedy per te zbuluar te verteten dheparaqitur versionin zyrtar te ngjarjes tronditese. Ai perbehej nga 5 kongresmene te shquar te te dy kraheve tepolitikes amerikane Richard Russell, John McCoy, Gerald Ford, Sherman Cooper, Hale Boggs dhe ish Drejtori I CIAS Alan Dulles, shkarkuar nga Kennedy pas ngjarjeve ne Gjirin e Derrave.\n\nRaporti I Komisionit ju paraqit Presidentit te SHBAveLyndon Johnson ne 24 Shtator 1964 dhe konkludonte se vrasesi Lee Harvey Oswald veproi I vetem dhe pa mbeshtetje. Nje kryqezate e tere u organizua ne shtyp dheTv per te mbeshtetur kete konkluzion, perfshire gazetarinme te shquar te kohes Walter Cronkite.\n\nFaktet dhe dokumentet qe u publikuan me vone e bene ketekonkluzion shume te goditshem. Ne qarqet jozyrtare, historiane, gazetare, njeres te zbatimit te ligjit dhe tedrejtesise te cilet nder vite e kane hetuar kete ngjarje, sundon mendimi qe Komisioni Warren ishte nje aleancepolitike per te fshehur te verteten e vrasjes se PresidentitKennedy. (1)\n\nNe vitin 1967, Prokurori I New Orleans, Jim Garrison, arrestoi biznesmenin Clay Shaw dhe e akuzoi se ne bashkepunim me Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie dhe tetjere bashkepuntore te CIAs e emigrante kubane, kishinkomplotuar dhe vrare Presidentin Kennedi.(2)\n\nClay Shaw u gjykua dhe megjithese Gjykata pranoiekzistencen e konspiracionit per te vrare PresidentinKennedy, Shaw u shpall I pafajshem. Prokurori Jim Garrison nuk mundi te vertetoje ne menyre te qarte dhe tepamohueshme lidhjet e Clay Shaw me CIA.(3)\n\nDisa vite me vone, Victor Marchetti, ndihmes I Richard Helms, Drejtor I Operacioneve Klandestine ne CIA dhe me vone Drejtor I CIA, shkroi nje artikull ku shprehej se njeeksponent I rendesishem I CIA, Howard Hunt (Ne vitin 1972 I arrestuar ne nderhyrjen ne hotelin Watergate) ne 22 Nentor 1963 ishte ne Dallas ne sheshin ku u vra Kennedi. Hunt ne deshmine qe kishte dhene para Komisionit Warren e kishte mohuar kategorikisht qe kishte qene ne Dallas ne 22 Nentor. Ne gjyqin qe Hunt hapi kunder Marchetti ne vitin1984, (Gjykata e Larte e Floridas e nxori Marchettin tepafajshem) deponoi edhe ish Drejtori I CIA Richard Helms. Gjate deponimit ai zbuloi qe Clay Shaw ishte bashkepuntorI CIA, fakt qe u konfirmua nga ai ne deshmine e nje gjyqi tengjashem te Hunt kunder gazetarit Weberman ne vitin 1979.Clay Shaw kishte ndruar jete 10 vjet me pare, ne vitin 1974.(4)\n\nFaktet dhe dokumentat qe u zbuluan ne dhjetevjecarin e pare pas vrasjes se Presidentit Kennedy nxiten shume zerane shoqerine amerikane per nevojen e nje hetimi te ri. Teoriae vrasesit te vetem ishte pak ose aspak bindese per opinionine gjere, pavaresisht se ne mbrojtje te saj ishin ngritur dheshkruan shume njerez te shquar te politikes, drejtesise dhemedias.\n\nI ndodhur para presionit ne rritje, Senati I SHBAve ne vitin1976 miratoi Rezoluten 1540 dhe ne 15 Shtator 1976 u ngritKomisioni I Posacem I Senatit te Shteteve te Bashkuara(HSCA ose Komisioni Schweiker sipas senatorit qe e kryesonte) per te hetuar vrasjet e John Kennedi ne vitin1963 dhe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr ne vitin 1968. Hetimet e Komisionit u mbyllen ne 3 Janar 1979 kur u paraqit raportiperfundimtar. Konkluzioni I Komisionit ishte qe “Kennedyndoshta ishte vrare si rezultat I nje konspiracioni porKomisioni nuk ishte ne gjendje te identifikonte qitesit e tjeredhe madhesine e konspiracionit”.(5)\n\nKomisioni gjithashtu deklaroi qe ne konspiracion nuk janete perfshira Qeverite e Kubes dhe BRSS, FBI, CIA, grupetanti–Castro apo grupe te krimit te organizuar. Pas ketijkonkluzioni me te drejte ngrihet pyetja: ne se nuk e kanevrare keta, kush tjeter mbetet te kete mundesine dhe mjetetper te vrare Presidentin Kennedy?\n\nPer vrasjen e Presidentit Kennedy jane shkruar qindralibra, mijra artikuj, filma, dokumentare, ese, dhjetraraporte, etj. Shumica e autoreve e drejtojne gishtin tek Deep State I SHBA, qe nenkupton, korporatat, industrineushtarake, Pentagonin, CIA, FBI, Sherbimi Sekret. Per keteqellim ata perdoren edhe grupet antikastro ne Miami si dheMafian.(6)\n\nMe poshte do perpiqem te permbledh arsyet dhe faktet qekane paraqitur autore te ndryshem duke cituar si reference me te rendesishmit e tyre:\n\nNixon i humbi zgjedhjet e vitit 1960 dhe Kennedy erdhi ne pushtet. CIA I paraqiti planin e nderhyrjesne Gjirin e Derrave dhe Kennedy e miratoi ate por pa qene I qarte plotesisht per shkallen e angazhimitamerikan. Nje nga planifikuesit dhe drejtuesit me terendesishem te nderhyrjes ne Gjirin e Derrave ishteHoward Hunt, eksponent i CIA, I cili pas disa viteshdrejtoi nderhyrjen ne Hotelin Watergate ku u arrestua e u denua me burg.\n\nNderhyrja ne Gjirin e Derrave u realizua ne Prill tevitit 1961. Trupat kubane zbarkuan dhe kerkuanmbeshtetje nga ajri. Kenedi kuptoi qe kishte rene ne kurth dhe per rrjedhoje mbeshteti formalisht nga ajrime numur shume te reduktuar avionesh dhe vetemnje sulm ajror. Ligjet e SHBAse dhe atonderkombetare, nuk I lejonin atij te nderhynte ne Kube pa miratimin e Kongresit. Pavaresisht kesaj, Pentagoni dhe CIA desheronin te nderhynin me trupatokesore dhe ta pushtonin Kuben por Kennedy refuzoi. \n\nOperacioni ne Gjirin e Derrave rezultoi njekatastrofe e plote. 200 kubaneze u vrane dhe rreth1100 u kapen rob. Te tjeret iken nga syte kembet. \n\nKubanezet anti–Kastro kete e quajten tradheti dheajo shenoi carjen e pare te madhe te Kennedy me drejtuesit e ushtrise, CIA dhe emigracionin kubanezne Miami. Kujtojme qe Kennedy gjate fushateselektorale te vitit 1960 ishte shprehur qe do mbanteqendrim te ashper ndaj Kubes dhe do ta zgjidhteceshtjen e saj.(7)\n\nNe Tetor 1962, amerikanet zbuluan nepermjetfotografive te marra nga aeroplanet U2, se ne pergjigje te dislokimit te raketave amerikane ne Italidhe Turqi, sovjetiket kishin dislokuar raketa ne Kube, te afta te godisnin dhe shkaterronin cdo qytette SHBA. \n\nKy zhvillim kaq dramatik, erdhi ne kushtet kurKennedy dhe rrethi I tij I ngushte po bisedonin per tenenshkruar traktatin e ndalimit te perhapjes se armeve berthamore me BRSS si dhe c’tensionimin ne pergjithesi te marredhenieve amerikano-sovjetike, ne perputhje me doktrinen e bashkekzistences paqesore.\n\nDepartamenti I Mbrojtjes dhe Pentagoni kerkuangoditjen e Kubes dhe pushtimin e saj me cdo cmim. Kennedy I druhej fillimit te luftes se trete boterore e cila do te ishte nukleare dhe mund te conte ne fundine civilizimit. Pergjegjesia ishte e madhe dhe si fillim aiurdheroi bllokimin e hapesires detare te Kubes. Paralelisht ju kerkua sovjetikeve te hiqnin urgjentraketat nga Kuba.\n\nPervec sa dukej mbi siperfaqe, nen surdine, uvendosen shume kontakte dhe u zhvilluan bisedimeme ndermjetes te trete ku I perfshire ishte edheRobert Kenedy, vellai I Presidentit Kennedy. Disahistoriane jane shprehur se Krushchev u paralajmerua qe nese nuk terheq raketat, ushtaraketamerikane mund te organizojne grusht shteti per terrezuar Kennedy dhe lufta do ishte e pashmagshme.\n\nPerfundimisht sovjetiket vendosen te terheqin raketatnga Kuba, Kennedy deklaroi qe nuk do ta pushtojneKuben ne asnje rast dhe terhoqi si kompesim disaraketa nga Turqia. Zemerimi I ushtarakeveamerikane ishte I pashoq. Ata e keonsideruanmarreveshjen te turpshme per SHBA dhe Kennedy sifrikacak qe po dobeson Ameriken e forcon sovjetiketdhe komunizmin global. (8) (9)\n\nAmerikanet kishin ne terren rreth 20 mije keshilltareushtarake te cilet ndihmonin ushtrine dhe qeverine e Vietnamit te Jugut. Pentagoni, CIA dheDepartamenti I Mbrojtjes desheronin qe tenderhynin ne Vietnam me trupa tokesore sepse vetemkeshtu mund te pengohej perhapja e komunizmit ne Azine Juglindore. \n\nKennedy kishte tjeter mendim, ai ishte kunderluftrave, desheronte paqe kudo ne bote. Me njevendim te tijin, te cilin e beri public ne 5 Tetor 1963, Kennedy deklaroi se deri ne vitin 1965 te gjithekeshilltaret amerikane ne Vietnamin e Jugut do tektheheshin ne shtepi. 1000 keshilltaret e pare do teterhiqeshin deri ne fund te Dhjetorit 1963. Kydeklarim zemeroi se tepermi ushtaraket amerikane, Pentagonin, CIA dhe korrporatat e industrise se luftes. Kjo ishte edhe gozhda e fundit ne kofinin e Kennedy.\n\nNe 22 Nentor 1963, pas me pak se dy muaj nga kyvendim, Kennedy u vra ne Dallas. Ne 26 Nentor 1963, kater dite pas vrasjes se Kennedy, Presidenti Johnsonqe e zevendesoi ate, anulloi vendimin e Kennedy dhegradualisht dergoi rreth 500 mije trupa tokesore ne Vietnamin e Jugut. (10)\n\nRaportet e Kennedy me CIA, megjithese ajo e ndihmoite fitoje zgjedhjet e vitit 1960, u perkeqesuan qe ne muajt e pare te pushtetit, per shkak te deshtimit ne Gjirin e Derrave.\n\nKennedy krijoi mendimin qe CIA e futi ne nje aventureqe dihej se do deshtonte, ne menyre qe me pas tenderhyhej ushtarakisht ne Kube. Kennedy nuk pranoite nderhynte ne Kube pasi nderhyrja do binte ne kundershtim me ligjin nderkombetar.\n\nPasi aventura ne Gjirin e Derrave deshtoi, Kennedy shkarkoi Drejtorin e CIAs Alan Dulles, ZvDrejtorinCharles Cabell dhe Drejtorin e operacioneveklandestine Richard Bissell. Ne nje bisede me villain e tij Robert, Presidenti Kennedy u shpreh se do ta gristeCIA si leter ne nje milion copa dhe do ti hedhte ngadritarja. Shpejt ai reduktoi kompetencat e CIA dhezvogeloi buxhetin e Agjensise me 25%. Kjo vendosiedhe nje gozhde tjeter ne kofinin e Kennedy. Pas vrasjesse Kennedy, Alan Dulles u caktua anetar I KomisionitWarren. Shume historian jane te mendimit qe ai u caktua ne Komision per te fshehuar te verteten dhe jo per ta zbuluar ate. (11)(12)\n\nNe rrethet politike ne Washington ishte e njohururrejtja e John Edgar Hoover, Drejtori legjendar I FBIper vellezerit Kennedy. Me ardhjen ne pushtet,Kennedy deshte ta zevendesonte Hoover, por ngurroi ta bente, sepse I frikesohej dosjeve qe Hoover mund tekishte e mund ti bente publike per lidhjet e tij me femrat dhe Mafian. Marredheniet midis tyre u perkeqesuan pas Gjirit te Derrave dhe krizes se raketave pasi Kennedy mendonte qe Hoover nukndante me te informacione te rendesishme per sigurinekombetare.(13)\n\nSapo Kennedy erdhi ne pushtet, ashtu si Nikson rreth10 vjet me vone, deklaroi qe do te hiqte subvencioninprej 25% te kostos se nxjerrjes se naftes dhe qeperfitohej nga korporatat e naftes. Ky subvencion jepejper te perballuar konkurencen e vendeve te Gjirit. Heqja e subvencioneve do prekte ndjeshem fitimet e korporatave te naftes dhe gazit sidomos atyre me bazene Teksas. Kennedy deklaroi planin e tij per heqjen e subvencioneve ne fund te vitit 1963 por nuk arriti tarealizoje ate sepse po ate vit u vra ne Dallas te Teksas.(14)\n\nKubanezet e vendosur ne Miami paten shumepritshmeri nga Kennedy per rrezimin e rregjimit teCastros. Deshtimi I nderhyrjes ne Gjirin e Derrave e ktheu dashurine ne urrejtje. Kjo e fundit u kombinuame urrejtjen e oficereve te CIA te cilet kishin trajnuartrupat e emigranteve dhe kishin planifikuar e zbatuarnderhyrjen ne Gjirin e Derrave. Pas krizes se raketaveKennedy, ne zbatim te marreveshjes me sovjetiket, ndaloi aktivitetin subversiv kunder Castros tekubanezeve ne Miami. Disa nga udheheqesit kubane ne Miami si Pepe San Roman, Erneido Oliva, Felix Rodrigues, Manuel Artime, Antonio Veciana, etj. jo vetem qe kundershtuan ndalimin e aksioneve, por I vazhduan ato dhe disa prej drejtuesve rezulton se ishinte perfshire ne ngjarjet ne Dallas (15)\n\nNe fushaten e vitit 1960 per zgjedhjet presidenciale, Kennedy pati marredhenie te mira me disa nga kokat e Mafias ne Amerike. Kjo kryesisht per shkak te lidhjeveqe kishte krijuar I ati I tij, Joseph Kennedy. MadjeRichard Nixon ben fajtor Mafian per humbjen e tijshume te ngushte ndaj Kennedy ne Texas dhe Michiganne vitin 1960, humbje qe atij I kushtoi presidencen.\n\nPasi erdhi ne pushtet, Kennedy emeroi Prokuror tePergjithshem vellain e tij Robert Kennedy. Ai pa vonesenisi kryqezate te pameshirshme ndaj Mafias. Kjomjaftoi qe edhe Mafia te kthehej ne nje armike po aq teeger ndaj vellezerve Kennedy.\n\nSipas Robert Blakey, ish Prokuror I Departamentit teDrejtesise dhe Kryetari I Keshilltareve te Komisionit teSenatit per hetimin e vrasjes se John Kennedy, krere teMafias si Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante dhe Sam Giancana bashkepunuan me forca te tjera per ta vrarePresidentin ne Dallas.(16)(17)\n\nCfare ndodhi ne Dallas me 22 Nentor?\n\nTre vite para ngjarjeve ne Dallas, CIA kishte miratuardhe ngritur nje grup qitesish te cilet sterviteshin per atentat ndaj Fidel Castro. Operacioni njihet sioperacioni Mongoose. Qitesit sterviteshin duke goditurne distance shalqinj te vendosur ne vetura qe levizninme shpejtesi. Pas ca kohesh grupi e ndroi objektivin. Objektivi I ri ishte Preaidenti Kennedy.\n\nPer vrasjen e Kennedy, sipas historianeve qe e kanehulumtuar ate, jane bere tre tentativa midis periudhesShtator-Nentor 1963. Fillimisht u tentua ta vrisnin gjatevizites se Kennedy ne Çikago, por forcat e sigurise tePresidentit u paralajmeruan per komplotin. Tentativa e dyte u be ne Tampa por karvani I Presidentit ndroirrugen per te shkuar ne vendin e konferences ku ai do merrte pjese.\n\nTentativa e trete u be ne Dallas. Ne te vertete, shumenjerez te ngushte te Kennedy e paralajmeruan te mosshkonte ne Dallas pasi ky qytet ishte qendra e tedjathtes ekstreme. Ekstremistet kishin kercenuar qe do ta vrisnin Presidentin nese do te vinte ne Dallas. Kennedy kishte dyshime, por vendosi te mos ta anullojeviziten pasi kishte shume muaj qe kishte premtur qe do shkonte ne Dallas.\n\nMe faktet qe jane zbuluar sot, askush me mend ne koke,nuk pranon qe Kennedy e vau Lee Harvey Oswald, se paku jo I vetem. Shume autore mendojne qe ai as nukshtiu. Ai u perdor nga organizatoret per te mbuluarautoret e vertete te vrasjes. Madje Oswald kur u arrestua u shpreh qe: nuk e kam vrare une, une jamvetem nje “patsy” (mbuluesi I perdorur nga te tjeretper te mos u zbuluar) (18)\n\nNje nga autoret me te besueshem, juristi dhe keshilltariI Komisionit te Senatit per hetimin e vrasjes se Presidentit Kennedy, Gaeton Fonzi, pretendon qe kazbuluar ata te cilet qelluan. Sipas tij, kubanezet VirgilioGonzales e Eugenio Martinez si dhe agjentet e CIA Bernard Barker e Frank Sturgis, goditen nga kati I gjashte I depos se librave shkollore dhe gardhi I zones me bar perballe karvanit te veturave. Operacionidrejtohej nga Howard Hunt, pergjegjes I CIA per nderhyrjen ne Gjirin e Derrave. Te peste kane qeneoperative te CIA dhe se bashku me James McCord,hyne ne hotelin Watergate, ne ate qe njihet si skandaliWatergate ku u arrestuan dhe denuan.(19)\n\nDy autore te tjere, Rob Rainer dhe Dick Russell, ne podcastin “Kush e vrau Kennedy”, episodi I 10, thonese ata qe qelluan ishin kubanezi Herminio Dias Garcia, John Soutre, vrases francez qe tentoi te vrasePresidentin francez De Gaulle, Charles Nicoletti, vrasesmafioz nga Chicago, (Nicoletti e vrane pak para se tedeshmonte ne Komisionin e Senatit qe hetonte vrasjen e Presidentit Kennedy) Jack Cannon, operativ I CIA. Operacioni u drejtua nga Bill Harvey, zyrtar I larte I CIA I cili ishte pergjegjes I operacionit Mongoose per vrasjen e Fidel Castros por qe me pas ndroi objektivduke u fokusuar tek Presidenti Kennedy.(20)\n\nAutore te tjere serioze si gazetari Anthony Summers dhe historiani John Newman cilesojne CIA siorganizatore dhe ekzekutuese e vrasjes se Kennedy porpa u ndalur ne emra te vecante se kush qelloi.(21)\n\nNE vitin 2007, Saint John Hunt, I biri I Howard Hunt, ne nje interviste ne revisten Rolling Stone, bazuar ne kujtimet e te atit, identifikoi si organizatore te vrasjes se Presidentit Kennedy, ZevendesPresidentin Lindon Johnson, numurin tre te CIA Cord Meyer, tre zyrtare telarte te CIA David Atley Phillips, Bill Harvey dhe David Morales se bashku me nje nga drejtuesit e emigrantevekubaneze ne Miami, Antonio Venciana. Hunt Jr. u shpreh se I ati Howard Hunt, kur ishte ne shtratin e vdekjes pranoi qe ne 22 Nentor 1963 kishte qene ne Dallas. Kjo gje deri atehere ishte mohuar vazhdimishtnga Howard Hunt, madje duke hedhur ne gjyq dyrevista amerikane qe e akuzonin ate se kishte qene ne Dallas ne 22 Nentor 1963.(22)\n\nGjate hetimeve te Komisionit Warren, mediatpublikuan nje foto te tre kembesoreve te arrestuar dheshoqeruar nga nje polic I Dallas ne 22 Nentor 1963.Brenda dites ata u liruan.\n\nJohn Craig dhe Phillip Rogers ne vitin 1992, ne librin e tyre “The Man on the Grassy Knoll”, I identifikuan atasi agjenti I dyfishte I CIA dhe Mafias Charles Harrelsonsi dhe dy operative te CIA Charles Rogers dheChauncey Holt.(23)\n\nNe vitin 1974, kerkuesi investigativ Allen Webermannepermjet analizave shkencore fotografike identifikoidy prej tyre si Howard Hunt dhe Frank Sturgis.(24)\n\nPas vrasjes se Kennedy, nje mori individesh me lidhjeme kete vrasje, ne rrethana mjaft te cuditeshme u vrane, pesuan atak kardiak ose kancer akut.

Kjo jo vetëm prej legjitimitetit të madh që ka korrur, prej diferencës së thellë, po dhe prej emërimeve! Triumfi i tij ishte i jashtëzakonshëm kur përballë kishte një kandidate energjike, më të re, të mbështetur masivisht dhe me një fushatë të energjizuar me grumbullim fondesh si asnjëherë dhe me mbështetje masive të një konglomerati elitash e vipash vanitozë, strukture propagande të mirëoganizuar influencimi me lobingje e sondazhe, çka e rriste orientimin e publikut ndaj saj.\nTrump nuk mundi thjesht një kundërshtare të partisë tjetër, por fitoi mbi superstrukturën që po konsolidohej në demokracinë më të fuqishme të botës.\nE kotë ta them se sa simpati ka krijuar Presidenti i zgjedhur në Shqipëri. Në burgun e Fierit nuk kemi shumë mundësi të ndjekim shtypin, gazetat dhe revistat e mëdha të botës që me siguri i kanë bërë analizat e duhura asaj çfarë ndodhi.\nMegjithatë, besoj të gjithëve por dhe mua këtu më ka mbetur, mesazhi kryesor i Trump; LUFTO, LUFTO, LUFTO – FITO, FITO, FITO!\nNuk ka dyshim se me vendimet, me aktet, me dekretet që do të ndërmarrë, Presidenti i 47 do të përcaktojë një kurs të ri në botë. Ama, fushata, dhe ajo çfarë vendosi qytetari amerikan, përkundër gjithë atmosferës propoganduese që ishte krijuar, përkundër gjithë imponimit me industritë më të forta të opinionit, e ka përmbysur jo pak gjendjen dhe ka krijuar një rend të ri. Një rend që nuk ka dyshim se do të rrezatojë dhe do të ndikojë dhe në vende të tjera.\nSidomos aty ku demokracia, liritë dhe të drejtat bazike po vihen në dyshim nga qeveri e udhëheqës autoritaristë,\nKa ngjashmëri të realiteteve politike e zgjedhore të SHBA me ne këtu.\nNjësoj edhe në Tiranë, industria e propagandës dhe e manipulimit të realitetit, e ndikimit në opinion përmes mediave e sondazheve, tenton të paracaktojë rezultatet dhe ka një axhendë armiqësore, agresive ndaj opozitës.\nNjësoj, përndjekje gjyqësore ndaj kundërshtarit.\nGoditje dhe tentative për asgjesim me mjete ekstrapolitike.\nKuptohet, veçantia jonë është ndoshta unike në botë, sepse Opozitës këtu i duhet të përballet pos të gjitha këtyre, edhe me bandat dhe me krimin e organizuar që janë aleati i vyer i qeverisë.\nNgadhënjimi i Trump tregoi se asgjë nuk është e pamundur.\nDhe është kaq e thjeshtë në fakt, ai e ka thënë me një fjali; Lufto, lufto, lufto – Fito, fito, fito.\nPadyshim se lufta me rilindjen dhe gjithë konglomeratin e saj nuk është e lehtë dhe ka kosto.\nUnë tani nuk jam aty ku duhet të jem, por i izoluar në një qeli të ngushtë dhe shkruaj këtë letër në një fletore që më pas e merr avokati im dhe bëhet publike, për shkak se lufta ime mërziti kryeministrin, prishi qetësinë e tij, dëmtoi karrierën e Ministrit të Brendshëm dhe i prishi terezine grupeve të krimit të organizuar!\nPra kaq mjafton që të jesh në burg, jo vetëm pa prova, por me prova të falsifikuara dhe manipuluara, pa proces juridik të rregullt, pa kryer veprën për të cilën akuzohem. Thjesht e vetëm se denoncova faktin se vëllai i Ministrit të Brendshëm, ishte i denuar në Itali për trafik ndërkombëtar droge dhe vijonte aktivitetin i lirë në Shqipëri me mbrojtjen e qeverisë!\nKjo nuk duhet të shkurajojë askend. Jam i bindur që nëse secili aty ku është, në rolin, në vendin e tij, në jetën e tij; lufton, lufton, lufton, ne do ja dalim. Edi Rama nuk na burgos dot të gjithëve. Ai është në të vërtetë një frikacak që duke e ditur mirë fundin që e pret, tenton të shesë si trimëri dënimin e kundërshtarit dhe shfaq gëzim malinj për këdo që burgos.\nNe e kemi edhe më të thjeshtë. Nuk kemi nevojë ta bëjmë Shqipërinë të madhe dhe një herë. Na duhet vetëm ta bëjmë vend normal, ta ruajmë, ta shpëtojmë nga autokrati malinj dhe ta heqim nga kthetrat e krimit!

He campaigned for reunification with Moldova, which this year renewed a five-year ban on him from entering the country over security concerns, and he is banned for the same reason from entering neighbouring Ukraine.\n\n“I would like that in the next five to ten years, for Romanians to be really proud to be Romanians, to promote Romanian culture, Romanian products,” he told reporters on Wednesday in the capital, Bucharest. “As a Romanian president, I will promote Romanian interests. In most cases, Romanian interests coincide with partner interests.”\n\nEcaterina Nawadia, a 20-year-old architecture student, said she voted for the first time in a national election on Sunday and hopes young people turn out in high numbers.\n\n“Since the (1989) revolution, we didn’t have a really good president,” she said. “I hope most of the people my age went to vote … because the leading candidate is not the best option.”\n\nCristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says Sunday’s vote will be “a tight race” in which the diaspora will likely play a key role in which candidates make it to the runoff.\n\n“We are at a point where Romania can easily divert or slip toward a populist regime because (voter) dissatisfaction is pretty large among a lot of people from all social strata,” he told The Associated Press. “And the temptation for any regime, any leader — will be to go on a populist road.”\n\nHe added that Romania’s large budget deficit, high inflation, and an economic slowdown could push more mainstream candidates to shift toward populist stances amid widespread dissatisfaction.\n\nCiolacu told the AP that if he is elected, one of his biggest goals is “to convince Romanians that it is worth staying at home or returning” to Romania, which has a massive diaspora spread throughout EU countries.\n\n“Romania has a huge chance to become a developed economy in the next 10 years, where honest work is fairly rewarded and people have the security of a better life,” he said. “But for this, we need balance and responsibility … I am running for the Presidency of Romania because we need a change.”\n\nOther key candidates include Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party, or USR former NATO deputy general secretary Mircea Geoana, who is running independently and Nicolae Ciuca, a former army general and head of the center-right National Liberal Party, which is currently in a tense coalition with the PSD.\n\nGeoana, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, told the AP that he believes his international experience qualifies him above the other candidates. “I think I bring a lot of competence and experience and connections in this complicated world,” he said.\n\nLasconi, a former journalist and the leader of the USR said she sees corruption as one of the biggest problems Romania faces and that she supports increased defence spending and continued aid to Ukraine.\n\nRomania has been a staunch ally of war-torn Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. But Simion of the AUR party said he opposes Romania — which has sent a Patriot missile system to Ukraine — contributing further military aid and that he hopes Trump can “stop the war.”\n\nIn 2020, the AUR party went from relative obscurity to gaining 9% in a parliamentary vote, allowing it to enter parliament. Opponents have long accused Simion and AUR of being extremists, charges he denies.\n\n“We are sort of a Trumpist party in this new wave of patriotic political parties in Europe,” Simion said.","url":"https://www.peacearchnews.com/national-news/romanians-cast-ballots-in-presidential-race-that-could-pit-nationalist-against-leftist-in-a-runoff-7667408","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/11/web1_241128-cpw-eu-romania-elections-_1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:05:19","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.074},{"id":266995712,"title":"Elon Musk Now Has His Eyes On Guyana","text":"News Americas, New York, NY, November 21, 2024: Elon Musk is now reportedly eyeing the oil rich CARICOM, South American nation of Guyana even as he positions himself to become one of the most powerful men in the Donald Trump administration.\n\nStartlink, SpaceX, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk raises his hands as he takes the stage during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in November 2024.

In fact, Trump this year became only the second Republican to win the popular vote since 1988.\n\nThe vast majority of counties saw their margins shift in Trump’s direction, both in places where Republicans historically do well and places where Democrats generally have an edge.\n\nAt the same time, Trump’s margins – both in raw votes and percentages – were small by historical standards, even for the past quarter century, when close elections have been the rule, including the 2000 Florida recount election and Trump’s previous two races in 2016 and 2020.\n\nTrump’s victory came without a big boost for down-ballot Republicans. The current narrow margin in the House of Representatives is poised to remain, and Democrats won four Senate races in key battleground states even as Vice President Kamala Harris lost those states to Trump.\n\nDuring his election night victory party, Trump declared that “America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate.”\n\nBut Wayne Steger, a DePaul University political scientist, said the election delivered mixed signals.\n\n“Inflation, immigration, some evidence of backlash against Democrats on identity politics, crime, education, and a public mood moving in a conservative direction all suggested a Republican win,” he said.\n\nStill, “I’m inclined to view it as a close election in which there was enough anti-Democratic sentiment to carry the day.”\n\nHere’s how Trump’s victory sizes up against other recent presidential elections:\n\nReasons for Trump to call it a big victory\n\nTrump won all seven of this year’s battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris, by contrast, fared worse in these states than President Joe Biden did four years earlier.\n\nTrump’s margins of victory in those seven states were wider – easily – than the margins of the seven closest states in the 2020 Trump-Biden election, and every close presidential contest this century.\n\nIncluding votes counted through November 19, Trump’s collective margin in this year’s seven battleground states was about 760,000. By comparison, the 2000 election between George W Bush and Al Gore – which the Supreme Court decided after a weeklong Florida recount – produced collective margins of about 46,000 in the seven closest states, or about one-sixteenth as much as in 2024.\n\nTrump also performed well by historical standards for someone running against the White House-occupying party. Going back to 1932, only six other candidates from the out-of-power party have taken as large a share of the vote as Trump’s near 50 percent. The others notching a higher percentage were Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Ronald Reagan in 1980, Barack Obama in 2008 and Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump’s margin of victory in the Electoral College – 312 out of 538 – was nowhere near the landslide wins of Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1972 or Reagan in 1984. But it was bigger than four of the seven elections this century, including Biden’s four years earlier.\n\nWhere Trump’s victory looks historically small\n\nOther metrics, however, show Trump’s victory was narrow.\n\nMeasured both by vote percentages and raw votes, Trump’s margin of victory is modest, even compared with this century’s other close elections.\n\nFor votes counted through November 20, Trump’s margin over Harris was 1.62 percent. That’s smaller than any winner since Bush in 2000, when the margin was 0.51 percent. Going back further, only John F Kennedy in 1960 and Nixon in 1968 won the popular vote by smaller margins, 0.17 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.\n\nUsing raw votes, Trump’s margin was also smaller than in any election going back to 2000. At about 2.5 million, it was the fifth-smallest popular vote margin since 1960.\n\nIn both percentage and raw votes, Trump’s margin is on pace to be less than half of what Biden achieved four years earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, there is ample evidence that Trump’s strong performance at the top of the ticket did not boost down-ballot candidates much.\n\nOf the seven battleground states, five also held Senate races and one had a gubernatorial contest. The Republican candidate won Pennsylvania’s Senate race, but the Democrat won the Senate races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, and the gubernatorial contest in North Carolina. In North Carolina, Democrats also won the races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, and superintendent of public instruction and were narrowly leading in a state Supreme Court race.\n\nAs the final handful of races are called, the US House is poised to end up at or near its margin from the previous two years, producing a Republican margin that is narrow by historical standards. In the state legislatures, Republicans gained only modestly in chamber control, while Democrats made inroads in other legislatures.\n\n“Trump’s victory was solid and convincing,” said Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political scientist. Still, “the 2024 elections were not a general endorsement of the Republican Party. Many Republicans down ballot did not perform as well as Trump.”\n\nSo far this century, elections have been not only close, but have flipped back and forth between the parties. Since 2000, control of the presidency, the Senate or the House has flipped 16 times in 13 election cycles.\n\nIf this pattern holds, the Democrats could be well-positioned for the 2026 midterms and perhaps the 2028 presidential race.\n\n“Voters have been unhappy with the state of the country,” said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. “Unless Trump creates an abrupt change in the national mood, Democrats have a good chance at a successful 2026 midterm.”","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/how-big-was-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AP24263667411408-1731944508-cNweUU.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:03:44","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":266995682,"title":"Optical Illusion Key Takeaways From Cop29","text":"Rich countries have pledged to contribute $300bn a year by 2035 to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change after two weeks of intense negotiations at the United Nations climate summit (COP29) in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku.\n\nWhile this marks a significant increase from the previous $100bn pledge, the deal has been sharply criticised by developing nations as woefully insufficient to address the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nThis year’s summit, hosted by the oil and gas-rich former Soviet republic, unfolded against the backdrop of a looming political shift in the United States as a climate-sceptic Donald Trump administration takes office in January. Faced with this uncertainty, many countries deemed the failure to secure a new financial agreement in Baku an unacceptable risk.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from this year’s summit:\n\n‘No real money on the table’: $300bn climate finance fund slammed\n\nWhile a broader target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 was adopted, only $300bn annually was designated for grants and low-interest loans from developed nations to aid the developing world in transitioning to low-carbon economies and preparing for climate change effects.\n\nUnder the deal, the majority of the funding is expected to come from private investment and alternative sources, such as proposed levies on fossil fuels and frequent flyers – which remain under discussion.\n\n“The rich world staged a great escape in Baku,” said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.\n\n“With no real money on the table, and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations,” he added, explaining that “poor countries needed to see clear, grant-based, climate finance” which “was sorely lacking”.\n\nThe deal states that developed nations would be “taking the lead” in providing the $300bn – implying that others could join.\n\nThe US and the European Union want newly wealthy emerging economies like China – currently the world’s largest emitter – to chip in. But the deal only “encourages” emerging economies to make voluntary contributions.\n\nFailure to explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels\n\nA call to “transition away” from coal, oil, and gas made during last year’s COP28 summit in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, was touted as groundbreaking – the first time that 200 countries, including top oil and gas producers like Saudi Arabia and the US, acknowledged the need to phase down fossil fuels. But the latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, without explicitly repeating the call for a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev referred to fossil fuel resources as a “gift from God” during his keynote opening speech.\n\nNew carbon credit trading rules approved\n\nNew rules allowing wealthy, high-emission countries to buy carbon-cutting “offsets” from developing nations were approved this week.\n\nThe initiative, known as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, establishes frameworks for both direct country-to-country carbon trading and a UN-regulated marketplace.\n\nProponents believe this could channel vital investment into developing nations, where many carbon credits are generated through activities like reforestation, protecting carbon sinks, and transitioning to clean energy.\n\nHowever, critics warn that without strict safeguards, these systems could be exploited to greenwash climate targets, allowing leading polluters to delay meaningful emissions reductions. The unregulated carbon market has previously faced scandals, raising concerns about the effectiveness and integrity of these credits.\n\nDisagreements within the developing world\n\nThe negotiations were also the scene of disagreements within the developing world.\n\nThe Least Developed Countries (LDCs) bloc had asked that it receive $220bn per year, while the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) wanted $39bn – demands that were opposed by other developing nations.\n\nThe figures did not appear in the final deal. Instead, it calls for tripling other public funds they receive by 2030.\n\nThe next COP, in Brazil in 2025, is expected to issue a report on how to boost climate finance for these countries.\n\nWho said what?\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the deal in Baku as marking “a new era for climate cooperation and finance”.\n\nShe said the $300bn agreement after marathon talks “will drive investments in the clean transition, bringing down emissions and building resilience to climate change”.\n\nUS President Joe Biden cast the agreement reached in Baku as a “historic outcome”, while EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said it would be remembered as “the start of a new era for climate finance”.\n\nBut others fully disagreed. India, a vociferous critic of rich countries’ stance in climate negotiations, called it “a paltry sum”.\n\n“This document is little more than an optical illusion,” India’s delegate Chandni Raina said.\n\nSierra Leone’s Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai said the deal showed a “lack of goodwill” from rich countries to stand by the world’s poorest as they confront rising seas and harsher droughts. Nigeria’s envoy Nkiruka Maduekwe called it “an insult”.\n\nIs the COP process in doubt?\n\nDespite years of celebrated climate agreements, greenhouse gas emissions and global temperatures continue to rise, with 2024 on track to be the hottest year recorded. The intensifying effects of extreme weather highlight the insufficient pace of action to avert a full-blown climate crisis.\n\nThe COP29 finance deal has drawn criticism as inadequate.\n\nAdding to the unease, Trump’s presidential election victory loomed over the talks, with his pledges to withdraw the US from global climate efforts and appoint a climate sceptic as energy secretary further dampening optimism.\n\n‘No longer fit for purpose’\n\nThe Kick the Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the summit, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests attended.\n\nA group of leading climate activists and scientists, including former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, warned earlier this month that the COP process was “no longer fit for purpose”.\n\nThey urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/optical-illusion-key-takeaways-from-cop29/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-27T231840Z_1549184218_RC2BTAAUP58H_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-1730071169-1NgwQw.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:03:44","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":266987576,"title":"Elon Musk Now Has His Eyes On Guyana","text":"News Americas, New York, NY, November 21, 2024: Elon Musk is now reportedly eyeing the oil rich CARICOM, South American nation of Guyana even as he positions himself to become one of the most powerful men in the Donald Trump administration.\n\nStartlink, SpaceX, Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk raises his hands as he takes the stage during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in November 2024.

Since 2000, control of the presidency, the Senate or the House has flipped 16 times in 13 election cycles.\n\nIf this pattern holds, the Democrats could be well-positioned for the 2026 midterms and perhaps the 2028 presidential race.\n\n“Voters have been unhappy with the state of the country,” said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. “Unless Trump creates an abrupt change in the national mood, Democrats have a good chance at a successful 2026 midterm.”","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/how-big-was-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2024/11/Trump-final-1730785946-U7cydW.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":266987550,"title":"Optical Illusion Key Takeaways From Cop29","text":"Rich countries have pledged to contribute $300bn a year by 2035 to help poorer nations combat the effects of climate change after two weeks of intense negotiations at the United Nations climate summit (COP29) in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku.\n\nWhile this marks a significant increase from the previous $100bn pledge, the deal has been sharply criticised by developing nations as woefully insufficient to address the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nThis year’s summit, hosted by the oil and gas-rich former Soviet republic, unfolded against the backdrop of a looming political shift in the United States as a climate-sceptic Donald Trump administration takes office in January. Faced with this uncertainty, many countries deemed the failure to secure a new financial agreement in Baku an unacceptable risk.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from this year’s summit:\n\n‘No real money on the table’: $300bn climate finance fund slammed\n\nWhile a broader target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 was adopted, only $300bn annually was designated for grants and low-interest loans from developed nations to aid the developing world in transitioning to low-carbon economies and preparing for climate change effects.\n\nUnder the deal, the majority of the funding is expected to come from private investment and alternative sources, such as proposed levies on fossil fuels and frequent flyers – which remain under discussion.\n\n“The rich world staged a great escape in Baku,” said Mohamed Adow, the Kenyan director of Power Shift Africa, a think tank.\n\n“With no real money on the table, and vague and unaccountable promises of funds to be mobilised, they are trying to shirk their climate finance obligations,” he added, explaining that “poor countries needed to see clear, grant-based, climate finance” which “was sorely lacking”.\n\nThe deal states that developed nations would be “taking the lead” in providing the $300bn – implying that others could join.\n\nThe US and the European Union want newly wealthy emerging economies like China – currently the world’s largest emitter – to chip in. But the deal only “encourages” emerging economies to make voluntary contributions.\n\nFailure to explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels\n\nA call to “transition away” from coal, oil, and gas made during last year’s COP28 summit in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, was touted as groundbreaking – the first time that 200 countries, including top oil and gas producers like Saudi Arabia and the US, acknowledged the need to phase down fossil fuels. But the latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, without explicitly repeating the call for a transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAzerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev referred to fossil fuel resources as a “gift from God” during his keynote opening speech.\n\nNew carbon credit trading rules approved\n\nNew rules allowing wealthy, high-emission countries to buy carbon-cutting “offsets” from developing nations were approved this week.\n\nThe initiative, known as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, establishes frameworks for both direct country-to-country carbon trading and a UN-regulated marketplace.\n\nProponents believe this could channel vital investment into developing nations, where many carbon credits are generated through activities like reforestation, protecting carbon sinks, and transitioning to clean energy.\n\nHowever, critics warn that without strict safeguards, these systems could be exploited to greenwash climate targets, allowing leading polluters to delay meaningful emissions reductions. The unregulated carbon market has previously faced scandals, raising concerns about the effectiveness and integrity of these credits.\n\nDisagreements within the developing world\n\nThe negotiations were also the scene of disagreements within the developing world.\n\nThe Least Developed Countries (LDCs) bloc had asked that it receive $220bn per year, while the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) wanted $39bn – demands that were opposed by other developing nations.\n\nThe figures did not appear in the final deal. Instead, it calls for tripling other public funds they receive by 2030.\n\nThe next COP, in Brazil in 2025, is expected to issue a report on how to boost climate finance for these countries.\n\nWho said what?\n\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the deal in Baku as marking “a new era for climate cooperation and finance”.\n\nShe said the $300bn agreement after marathon talks “will drive investments in the clean transition, bringing down emissions and building resilience to climate change”.\n\nUS President Joe Biden cast the agreement reached in Baku as a “historic outcome”, while EU climate envoy Wopke Hoekstra said it would be remembered as “the start of a new era for climate finance”.\n\nBut others fully disagreed. India, a vociferous critic of rich countries’ stance in climate negotiations, called it “a paltry sum”.\n\n“This document is little more than an optical illusion,” India’s delegate Chandni Raina said.\n\nSierra Leone’s Environment Minister Jiwoh Abdulai said the deal showed a “lack of goodwill” from rich countries to stand by the world’s poorest as they confront rising seas and harsher droughts. Nigeria’s envoy Nkiruka Maduekwe called it “an insult”.\n\nIs the COP process in doubt?\n\nDespite years of celebrated climate agreements, greenhouse gas emissions and global temperatures continue to rise, with 2024 on track to be the hottest year recorded. The intensifying effects of extreme weather highlight the insufficient pace of action to avert a full-blown climate crisis.\n\nThe COP29 finance deal has drawn criticism as inadequate.\n\nAdding to the unease, Trump’s presidential election victory loomed over the talks, with his pledges to withdraw the US from global climate efforts and appoint a climate sceptic as energy secretary further dampening optimism.\n\n‘No longer fit for purpose’\n\nThe Kick the Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition of NGOs analysed accreditations at the summit, calculating that more than 1,700 people linked to fossil fuel interests attended.\n\nA group of leading climate activists and scientists, including former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, warned earlier this month that the COP process was “no longer fit for purpose”.\n\nThey urged smaller, more frequent meetings, strict criteria for host countries and rules to ensure companies showed clear climate commitments before being allowed to send lobbyists to the talks.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/optical-illusion-key-takeaways-from-cop29/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2024/11/2024-11-05T104325Z_1098545768_RC2XYAA5592X_RTRMADP_3_GERMANY-SECURITY-1730920485-t1AEWi.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:53","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":266987516,"title":"Whats Next For Matt Gaetz He Gave Us A Clue N4934550","text":"Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has been a controversial figure in Congress, but it looks like his time in the House is coming to an end. After President Trump nominated him for Attorney General, he promptly resigned from Congress to ensure that his seat could be filled quickly in a special election. However, this week, he withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nDonald Trump quickly selected former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his new nominee, and many have been wondering what Gaetz will do next. Some argued that he resigned from the 118th Congress and could still be seated in the 119th Congress. \n\nGaetz has now addressed that speculation directly in an interview with Charlie Kirk. During the discussion, Gaetz opened up about his decision to leave Congress and what the future holds for him and his political career.\n\nGaetz, who has represented Florida’s 1st District since 2017, confirmed that he will not be a part of the 119th Congress. That said, despite stepping down from his congressional role, he emphasized that he would not be leaving the fight for conservative values. “I’m still going to be in the fight, but it’s going to be from a new perch,” Gaetz explained. “I do not intend to join the 119th Congress.”\n\nAfter 14 years of public service, Gaetz, now 42, says he feels it’s time for a change. “I’ve got some other goals in life that I’m eager to pursue with my wife and my family,” he shared. While his supporters are disappointed that he won’t be continuing in Congress, Gaetz made it clear that his departure is not an end but a transition to new opportunities.\n\nAs for the future of his district, Gaetz expressed optimism. He noted that several qualified candidates are stepping up to take his place, and he is excited to see his district thrive under new leadership. “I’m actually excited to see Northwest Florida go to new heights and have great representation,” he told Kirk.\n\nGaetz also reflected on his time in office, citing Florida’s successful term limits law as part of his reasoning for stepping down. “In Florida, our voters got to vote on term limits for state government, and the campaign was ‘eight is enough.’ It seems like a pretty poetic time to allow that great new blood to come in,” he explained.\n\nWhile he didn’t say exactly what he plans to do going forward, don’t expect him to disappear from the political scene altogether. He reaffirmed his commitment to fighting for President Trump and the conservative movement, whether in or out of office. \n\n“Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not taking off for, like, you know, a tropical excursion for the rest of my life. I am here to help save this country,” he said. “We need brilliant lawyers on the outside. We need tough congressmen and congresswomen on the inside. We need a leadership structure under President Trump that's going to allow for durability of our movement and the ability to continue this great realignment of our politics.”\n\nRecommended: WATCH: AOC Humiliates Herself Blasting Capitol Bathroom Policy That Protects Women\n\n“And so I'll play a part in that. I plan to be a big voice, but maybe not as an elected member of the government.” Gaetz said.\n\nMatt Gaetz tells Charlie Kirk he does not plan to return to Congress:“I’m still going to be in the fight, but it’s going to be from a new perch.

Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. The blue-ribbon commission created by President Lyndon Johnson to investigate the crime determined that a pathetic loner and addled Communist Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots at the president's motorcade. Two of the bullets struck JFK killing him instantly.\n\nMost Americans don't believe the \"official\" version. There are literally dozens of alternate theories, some of them plausible, some of them ridiculous, that try to make sense out of a senseless act.\n\nKennedy assassination buffs, of which I am one, can rattle off the major theories of the crime. But the fact remains that the Warren Commission, and all the theories about the CIA, the Mafia, the CIA and the Mafia, the Russians, the Cubans and the gays, fail the ordinary test of evidence. All the evidence is circumstantial. \n\nThe legacy of the assassination is a basic distrust in the government and American institutions in general that didn't exist prior to the assassination which came to the fore in the aftermath of the event. The assassination of JFK has been eating away at America's core beliefs for 61 years now and the nation has never come to grips with it.\n\nDonald Trump promised during his campaign for president that if elected, he would declassify all remaining government records on the assassination and release them. \n\nAt this point, only a few thousand of the millions of governmental records related to the assassination have yet to be fully released, and those who have studied the records released so far say that even if the remaining files are declassified, the public shouldn’t anticipate any earth-shattering revelations.“Anybody waiting for a smoking gun that’s going to turn this case upside down will be sorely disappointed,” said Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed, which concludes that assassin Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.For decades, debate has raged not only over whether Oswald acted alone but also whether the FBI and CIA could have stopped him.\n\nThat last observation is one of history's great \"What Ifs.\" But it does little good to speculate about what might have happened. Counterfactuals are fun but useless for understanding history.\n\nThis hasn't stopped the left from bemoaning Kennedy's death as a lost opportunity for everything from peace in Vietnam to the early passage of the Civil Rights Act. \n\nJohn Kennedy was the coldest of cold warriors. There were 900 U.S. troops in South Vietnam on January 20, 1961. On November 22, 1963, there were 16,300 U.S. personnel in Nam. One piece of evidence claims Kennedy wanted out of the war. National Security Action Memorandum 263 approved recommendations by the Joint Chiefs and Defense Department that U.S. troops could be withdrawn sometime in 1963 because the war was going so well.\n\nThat was a pipe dream as Johnson realized early in his presidency. But that hasn't stopped the left from pointing to that memo claiming that Kennedy was killed because he wanted to get out of Vietnam.\n\nThere's also the belief on the left that if Kennedy had lived, the Civil Rights Act would have been strengthened and gotten through Congress more quickly. The Act was passed in 1964 because Johnson evoked the memory of the \"martyred\" president to shame both parties into passing it.\n\nIn fact, Kennedy saw the Civil Rights Act as necessary but as a political disaster. He was dragged into the civil rights fray, seeing it as a political loser in the South, and with few northern Republicans who would stick their necks out to support it, a drag on his reelection campaign. Ideally, he wanted to put the issue off until after the 1964 election. \n\nThe idealized Kennedy on the left is far different from the brilliant, sickly, womanizing, coldly calculating president who almost blew the world to hell during the Cuban missile crisis and challenged the nation to go to the Moon before the decade was out.\n\nAll of that plays into the assassination's legacy. The myth of John Kennedy is that the world and the U.S. would have been far better places if he had lived. In fact, nothing much would have changed if he had lived.\n\nThe myth lives on. \"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend,\" says the old newspaper editor in \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\" The assassination made that a lot easier to accomplish.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2024/11/23/the-impact-of-jfks-assassination-is-still-reverberating-61-later-n4934567","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2017/326/71d349e2-723f-4e6e-957c-3a933ceca0c3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Rick Moran","authors":["Rick Moran"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":266987508,"title":"Chinas Salt Tycoon Telecom Hack Is Worst Breach Of Communications Network In History N4934571","text":"The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, says that the Chinese espionage campaign that penetrated more than a dozen U.S. telecommunications companies is the \"worst telecom hack in our nation’s history — by far.\"\n\nThe Chinese hackers called \"Salt Tycoon\" have been able to real-time phone conversations and demonstrated the ability to move from one network to another \"exploiting relationships of trust,” Warner told the Washington Post.\n\nThe breaches were discovered in September and the scope of the intrusions is just now being revealed.\n\n“Specifically, we have identified that [Chinese government]-affiliated actors have compromised networks at multiple telecommunications companies to enable the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,” the FBI said in a statement on the hack earlier this month.\n\nSalt Tycoon hacked the phones of Donald Trump and JD Vance, as well as individuals who worked for the Kamala Harris campaign.\n\nThough fewer than 150 victims have been identified and notified by the FBI — most of them in the D.C. region, the records of people those individuals have called or sent text messages to run into the “millions,” he said, “and that number could go up dramatically.”Those records could provide further information to help the Chinese identify other people whose devices they want to target, he said. “My hair’s on fire,” Warner said.\n\nIt actually gets worse. The networks are still compromised and kicking the hackers out could involve physically replacing \"literally thousands and thousands and thousands of pieces of equipment across the country,” specifically outdated routers and switches, Warner said.\n\nIt's no secret that China has an enormous operation dedicated specifically to penetrating U.S. networks and hacking other systems relating to national security. Russia has been busy too, working in tandem with sophisticated criminal gangs for information and profit.\n\nHackers have acquired access to the system that logs U.S. law enforcement requests for criminal wiretaps, allowing the Chinese to know who is of interest to authorities. There is no evidence so far that hackers have compromised the collection system itself through which law enforcement listens in on wiretapped calls, said U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.The calls on which Chinese hackers were able to listen in were not part of the “lawful intercept,” or wiretap, system, officials said. But hackers also had access to unencrypted communications, including text messages. End-to-end encrypted communications such as those on the Signal platform are believed to be protected, officials said.\n\n“This is massive, and we have a particularly vulnerable system,” Warner said. “Unlike some of the European countries where you might have a single telco, our networks are a hodgepodge of old networks. ... The big networks are combinations of a whole series of acquisitions, and you have equipment out there that’s so old it’s unpatchable.”\n\nWarner thinks that more regulation is the answer.\n\n“We’re the telecom envy of the world,” Warner said. “I don’t want to slow that innovation. I don’t want to come in with some new, heavy-handed regulation. This ought to just be about safety and security.”\n\nThe Post says that the Telecom sector is \"largely unregulated.\" I don't believe that's true but even if it were, piling on regulations is not the answer. This is war and perhaps it's time to think about how we can hit them back.. The Chinese have to be made to understand that Americans see privacy as a sacred right and that intrusions like Salt Tycoon are a declaration of war.\n\nTrump might be just the man to explain it.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/rick-moran/2024/11/23/chinas-salt-tycoon-telecom-hack-is-worst-breach-of-communications-network-in-history-n4934571","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/233/a0ff2ed6-18f3-46c5-b095-1edaaf4c2fcc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Rick Moran","authors":["Rick Moran"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":266987502,"title":"The Uk Says It Would Arrest Bibi After Icc Issues Warrant N4934559","text":"Earlier this week, PJ Media’s Rick Moran reported that the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Ibrahim Al Masri and Mohammed Deif of Hamas. Deif is dead, so good luck with serving that warrant.\n\nNeither the U.S. nor Israel are signatories to the ICC, so they don’t have to abide by any rulings that his ridiculous globalist body issues. But plenty of other countries do.\n\n“The practical effect is going to be that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is going to have to watch where he travels lest he be arrested,” said Albert Mohler on his podcast on Friday morning. “And just understand that if this can be threatened against the prime minister of Israel, it can and almost assuredly will at some point be exercised against a sitting President of the United States or for that matter, a former President of the United States.”\n\n“Disturbingly, several European nations, including close allies to the United States, have indicated that they believe the ICC, the International Criminal Court, rightly applied these arrest warrants to the Israeli prime minister,” he added.\n\nOne of those nations is the United Kingdom. Britain’s far-left Labour government said it would abide by the ruling if Netanyahu were to set foot on UK soil.\n\nRecommended: Confidence in the UK's New Government Is Dropping\n\nThe Spectator’s Katy Balls reports:\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu faces arrest if he enters Britain. This comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israel’s Prime Minister, along with former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and Mohammed Deif of Hamas, who is thought to be dead already. Justifying the decision to issue warrants for the two Israeli politicians, the court said they shared criminal responsibility for ‘the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.’ In response, the Israeli government has – unsurprisingly – heavily criticised the judgment. The United States (which is not an ICC member) has also ‘fundamentally’ rejected the court’s decision – stating that the ICC has no ‘jurisdiction over this matter’. The incoming Trump administration has warned of a ‘strong response to the anti-Semitic bias of the ICC and UN come January’ when Donald Trump takes office. In contrast, Downing Street has confirmed that it will respect the ICC’s decision once the UK domestic process had taken place.\n\nNaturally, the decision reveals the stark differences between the ruling Labour party and the Conservatives, who are more prone to support Israel. Labour defeated the Conservatives in July’s elections.\n\n“Starmer’s spokesman said the UK government would comply with its legal obligations but added that there was no ‘moral equivalence’ between Israel and Hamas,” Balls writes, adding later, “Already, shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel [of the Conservatives] has criticised Starmer’s response, describing the warrant as concerning and urging the government to ‘condemn and challenge the ICC’s decision.’”\n\nThe declaration from the UK government demonstrates that it would side with an international body sticking its nose where it doesn’t belong over Israel in its fight for survival. It also means that Netanyahu has to be extra careful where he travels.\n\nMohler said:\n\nBut we also need to understand that Israel is going to be shown very quickly who is and is not a friend of Israel. And that also means who is and is not a friend to the need for nations to defend themselves against terrorist organizations. Again, we are not saying that Israel has done no wrong. We wouldn’t say that about the United States. In our own military efforts, it is to say the cause is righteous. And standing with Israel in this sense is also righteous.\n\nBalls reports that \"If Starmer continues to hold his position, he risks a diplomatic rift with both Israel and the incoming Trump administration.\" The UK's move is yet another example of left-wing governments siding with globalist entities instead of standing up for nations that defend themselves.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/chris-queen/2024/11/22/the-uk-says-it-would-arrest-bibi-after-icc-issues-warrant-n4934559","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/271/b6e400c5-fe56-4706-a3d9-16753446d3b3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Chris Queen","authors":["Chris Queen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":266987428,"title":"His Honeymoon Is Over For Me Trumps Pick For Labor Secretary Is A Teachers Union Fave N4934572","text":"Well, that didn't last as long as I would have liked. President-elect Donald Trump had been on a roll with his choices for roles in his next administration. On Thursday, he ruined the good vibes with one horrible, horrible Cabinet pick. \n\nIn Tuesday's Morning Briefing, I celebrated Trump's nomination of Linda McMahon to be Secretary of Education. Her strong views on school choice rattle the people in charge of the teachers' unions, who are the biggest obstacle to education reform because they're powerful leftist political lobbies. I noted that substantive progress with school choice would be \"a direct shot at the heart of the Democrats' main source of funding.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump did something to make the teachers' unions happy. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal:\n\nHard to believe, but Donald Trump on Friday night nominated a favorite of teachers union chief Randi Weingarten as his Labor Secretary. Why would Mr. Trump want to empower labor bosses who oppose his economic agenda and spent masses to defeat him?Mr. Trump’s regrettable choice is Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Ms. Weingarten on Thursday tweeted her support for the freshman Republican. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, has also been pulling for her. In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said she’ll work toward “historic cooperation between Business and Labor.” But Ms. Chavez-DeRemer has backed union giveaways like the Pro Act, which are not “cooperation.”\n\nI'll get to the Pro Act in a moment. For the moment, let us focus on the fact that Randi Weingarten is a vile human being. She was the face of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and championed keeping them closed far longer than even the other tyrants thought was necessary. Weingarten wrecked a generation of public school children, forcing them into a brutal game of \"catch up\" that many will never win.\n\nThen she lied about her role in all of that. \n\nShe's Team Trump with the Chavez-DeRemer choice though: \n\nIt is significant that the Pres-elect nominated Rep. Chavez-DeRemer for Labor. Her record suggests real support of workers & their right to unionize. I hope it means the Trump admin will actually respect collective bargaining and workers' voices from Teamsters to teachers.— Randi Weingarten 🇺🇸💪🏿👩‍🎓🟣 (@rweingarten) November 23, 2024\n\nWhen one of the most clinically insane leftists in America thinks that a Republican politician did a good thing, it means that the Republican just did a clinically insane leftist thing. \n\nFor any conservative who had high hopes for the Trump 47 administration, Weingarten's approval of Chavez-DeRemer's nomination undoes a lot of the goodwill that had been built up. That's not the worst thing about this choice, however. Chavez-DeRemer (an annoying name to type repeatedly, by the way) is one of only three Republicans in the House to support the execrable PRO Act. Its full title is: The Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act. \n\nThe PRO Act is a sop to Big Labor that got its start with California Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) back in 2018. AB5 was a major effort to upend the freelancer-driven gig economy — specifically rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, which had long been targets politicians who are funded by labor unions. My Townhall Media colleagues in California would have been adversely affected by AB5 as well. The bill was so noxious that the left-leaning California electorate passed a proposition in 2020 that carved out exceptions to AB5. \n\nAB5 was one of the worst ideas to come out of California's progressive fever dream, and the PRO Act seeks to make a version of it federal law. \n\nThe PRO Act is the latest attempt in Big Labor's years-long effort to do away with secret ballots in union voting and do things via an insidious process called \"card check\" which, per the Wall Street Journal, will implement \"a coercive process whereby organizers confront employees individually and relentlessly, at work and at home, until they sign a petition card. If the union can collect cards from half of the workforce, it gets certified without a vote.\" In other words, it legalizes union thuggery. \n\nCard check was one of the big issues that we were fighting against back in the Tea Party days. It remains such a high priority for the unions that they're still working on making it law over a decade later. \n\nRep. Chavez-DeRemer not only shouldn't be Trump's nominee for Secretary of Labor, he should never have considered her in the first place. Yes, she's a Republican, but she is a Republican from a deep blue state. More often than not, that means \"moderate Democrat.\" From a conservative perspective, Chavez-DeRemer is carrying red flags in both hands. \n\nYeah, it was cool to have the Teamsters guy speak at the Republican National Convention, that doesn't mean that Trump has to dole out favors to him, which this seems to be. \n\nThroughout this year, I have praised Trump's decision-making. This choice, however, is so stunningly awful that I have to wonder how many other lefties have his ear. \n\nIt's a most sobering thought. \n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

Yeah, everything triggers them, but some triggers are more fun than others. \n\nWe hit the first hiccup of the Trump 47 transition process, which Chris wrote about yesterday:\n\nOne of Donald Trump's more controversial picks for his upcoming cabinet has withdrawn his name from consideration.Former congressman Matt Gaetz announced on X that he will no longer seek the nomination for attorney general.\n\nGaetz was, shall we say, an interesting pick. He could be a thorn in the side of some of his congressional colleagues, something that endeared him to a lot of people. The nomination of Gaetz really sent the Democrats into a tizzy, something that endeared him to even more people. Honestly, I had no strong opinion about the nomination, but I was rather enjoying the reaction. \n\nThis is based on nothing more than a hunch, but the sexual misconduct allegations being thrown at him have a decided \"Christine Blasey Ford\" feel to them. \n\nThere was a lot of chatter from people in the know that Gaetz would withdraw long before nomination hearings began. There was also just as much talk about him getting putting into place — albeit temporarily — via a recess appointment. That really got the Trump naysayers' knickers in a twist. \n\nTrump wasn't caught off-guard by Gaetz's withdrawal, naming the nominee to replace him just hours later, which Matt covered:\n\nHours after Matt Gaetz took his name out of consideration for Attorney General, President Trump announced his new pick for the position.\"I am proud to announce former Attorney General of the Great State of Florida, Pam Bondi, as our next Attorney General of the United States,\" Trump announced in a post on Truth Social. \"Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families. Then, as Florida’s first female Attorney General, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs, and reduce the tragedy of Fentanyl Overdose Deaths, which have destroyed many families across our Country.\"\n\nPam Bondi is an absolutely brilliant choice for attorney general. Her experience as Florida's AG makes her highly qualified to take over the Department of Justice and get rid of the Merrick Garland Swamp rot that is infesting it. She's very no-nonsense and knows how to throw a legal punch. The open borders people are already dyspeptic. My Townhall colleague Sarah Arnold laid out why Bondi has the lefties melting down here. This is from her post: \n\nMSNBC is melting down over Pam Bondi as Attorney General:\"We should all fear [her] because she's competent.\"\"She actually knows how to do this job.\"\"She knows what she's doing about immigration.\"\"She is a dangerous and effective pick.\"🔥🔥pic.twitter.com/BfJ9jeNHzR— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) November 22, 2024\n\nSarah has some more choice video in the article, including a clip of Bondi taking a shot at Dem beta male Mark Cuban. \n\nGiven Pam Bondi's close personal and professional relationship with Donald Trump, why wasn't she his first choice? Since we're having fun with the 4-D chess idea, we have to wonder if the plan always was to eventually have her be the nominee. Perhaps nominating Gaetz first was merely a way to get the Dems so worked up that they'd be more amenable to Bondi once he bowed out.\n\nThat's how this game works, isn't it?\n\nAgain, this is just a lot of spitballin' here. Like I said at the top, we're just having some quick fun.\n\n\"But Kruiser,\" some of you are saying, \"why would Gaetz resign from Congress if that was the plan?\"\n\nI hear that there will be an open Senate seat in Florida once Trump's next Secretary of State is confirmed. \n\nHave a great weekend, everyone. \n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

Oh, it seems like only yesterday they were calling it a relic of the Jim Crow era and all sorts of absurd things. Naturally, they're all for it now, and they intend to use it.\n\n\"Soon to be in the minority, Democrats are ready to use whatever tactics are at their disposal to put up roadblocks for Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump — including the 60-vote threshold many have long sought to abolish,\" notes the Washington Examiner. \n\n“I’d be lying if I said we’d be in a better position without the filibuster,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said. “We have a responsibility to stop autocratic and long-headed [sic] abuse of power or policy, and we’ll use whatever tools we have available. We’re not going to fight this battle with one hand tied behind our back.”\n\nOutgoing Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also claims to view the filibuster as a key element in how Democrats will approach resistance in the upcoming Congress, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. “We had to live with it when we were in the majority,” he remarked, acknowledging the challenges it presents in a divided chamber.\n\nRecommended: Voter Approval for Trump’s Transition Creates Huge Problem for Democrats\n\nThis is true, but he conveniently ignores the fact that Democrats tried to abolish it in 2022, and we can all feel confident that Democrats will try to abolish it again the next time they see it as a roadblock for their agenda and are in a position to abolish it. \n\n“If the Republicans block cloture on the legislation before us, I will put forward a proposal to change the rules to allow for a talking filibuster on this legislation,” Schumer warned the GOP in January 2022, as the Democrats were hoping to pass legislation to radically change election in the United States. \n\nAt the time, Schumer argued that abolishing the filibuster was necessary to pass the Democrats' agenda. \n\n“The vast majority of our caucus strongly disagree with Senators Manchin and [Kyrsten] Sinema [D., Ariz.] on rules changes,” Schumer said. “The overwhelming majority of our caucus knows that if you’re going to try to rely on Republican votes, you will get zero progress on voting rights.”\n\nThe ironic thing about this is that the point of the filibuster is to protect the rights of the minority party by ensuring that legislation cannot pass without significant debate and compromise. Democrats don't want compromise—not when they have a majority, and that's why they go back and forth between loving and hating the filibuster.\n\nThe new Republican majority shouldn't delude itself into thinking that Democrats won't abolish the filibuster at some point. So they need to be tough with the Democrat minority next year and tell them abuse of the filibuster will not be tolerated. If they use the fllibuster to excessively block legislation, they can kiss it goodbye.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/11/24/the-future-of-the-fliibuster-is-up-to-the-democrats-n4934592","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/87/7d315e17-f743-409b-b27e-560afbb5639d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":266987472,"title":"Diabolical Msnbc Anyalyst Bemoans Jose Ibarras Fate N4934558","text":"It's not uncommon in this line of work to say that the legacy media \"beclowns\" itself. But the latest offering from MSNBC is such a horrifically tone-deaf, unbelievably narcissistic exercise in left-wing talking points that the network deserves no quarter. There are differences of opinion, and there is propaganda.\n\nOn Thursday, José Ibarra was found guilty on all counts in the rape and murder of Laken Riley. Ibarra was no dreamer nor one of the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. He did not come to the United States to find a better life. He is a member of the vicious, bloodthirsty Tren de Aragua gang and a violent predator. The evidence against him was overwhelming and included DNA and fingerprints. \n\nExhibiting zero compassion or decency, let alone common sense, MSNBC legal analyst Danny Cevallos had the unmitigated gall to pen a column for the network's site titled “The Guilt of Laken Riley’s Killer Was Never in Doubt.” The original title was “Laken Riley’s Killer Never Stood a Chance.”\n\nOh, what fresh hell is this? What line of unmitigated propaganda do these people expect us to swallow? What ham-fisted, self-righteous attempt at left-wing empathy have we here? \n\nThe link to the original piece was inaccessible for a little while, likely because whatever adults remaining at MSNBC realized that one of their people had once again defecated and fallen in it, so some time was needed to massage it. I will leave it up to PJ's internet sleuths to see if there is a recoverable original version. Here are some excerpts from the current iteration:\n\nRiley’s murder became a political rallying cry at this summer’s Republican National Convention because Ibarra entered the country illegally in 2022. But for all the political controversy, the outcome of this trial was never in doubt. The verdict was going to be guilty. The sentence was going to be life without parole. Generally, defense attorneys prefer jury trials to bench trials. One reason is math. For the defense, this was a hopeless case. The defense did the best it could with bad facts. It almost surely knew it was going to lose. ....Of course, in Ibarra’s case, the judge cut him no breaks — jury or no jury. In fairness, Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard, who presided over the trial, didn’t have that much to decide. Normally, judges have a lot of sentencing options. Criminal statutes often provide for a mandatory minimum or a statutory maximum sentence, leaving a lot in between. For example, when FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of masterminding a massive fraud last November, federal prosecutors asked the judge to sentence “SBF” to 100 years in prison. His defense argued for 6½ years. It’s often a challenge for a judge to determine what is an appropriate sentence while considering minimum sentences, maximum sentences and sentencing guidelines. (Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence.) Not in this case.\n\nCevallos came close to redemption with this conclusion:\n\nSometimes defense counsel just gets handed a truly awful, unwinnable case. The defense’s choice of a bench trial not only saved the state the resources of a wasted jury trial; it also likely avoided unnecessarily prolonging this traumatic experience for the victim’s family.\n\nCevallos may have been trying to recover from what was originally a heartless headline. Of course, we may never know how many revisions the piece underwent to tone it down. He also gives a cursory nod to “the heartrending testimony of Riley’s loved ones.” \n\nThis was not an incident of an \"unwinnable case.\" This was an issue of bringing a hardened, soulless criminal to justice. Of course, for many on the Left, the murder of Laken Riley is an uncomfortable reminder of the current administration's self-serving and barbaric approach to border security. It is a small wonder that it would rather focus on the legal proceedings than wrestle with whatever remains of its collective conscience. Better to try to shift the attention to the legal system than cope with the reality that we have no control over who crosses our border — and the inherent potential for disaster. \n\nDonald Trump Jr. said what most people were thinking in response to Cevallos' blatant, self-serving, and frankly wicked exercise in heartless CRT:\n\nYou literally can’t make up this level of depravity. These people are sick. The guy is a murderer. He’s an illegal alien that killed an innocent young woman but MSNBC would rather go to bat for him.However, much you hate MSNBC it’s not enough! pic.twitter.com/3YSVmbbVBD— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 22, 2024\n\nJosé Ibarra deserves no empathy, no pity, and no sympathy. He is a feral animal who not only murdered a young woman with a bright future but devastated an entire family. The only people with whom such a monster could find succor are those so resolute in their hatred of a president and his supporters that they care nothing for the shedding of innocent blood.\n\nMSNBC is in free fall, and to be honest, the best thing that could happen is for the network to be fire-sold with its denizens scattered to the four winds and forced to seek honest work. Either the reporters and writers have become such dead-eyed, slack-jawed, drool-faced acolytes of progressivism that they are hopelessly mired in their hatred for all things that lean right in any way that they cannot summon one ounce of compassion for Laken, her family, or anyone else who has suffered from crimes at the hands of illegals — or they are evil. And that is a possibility that cannot be ignored. Whatever the case, there is one thing that should come to mind when regarding the legacy media: Carthago delenda est.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/lincolnbrown/2024/11/22/diabolical-msnbc-anyalyst-bemoans-jose-ibarras-fate-n4934558","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/71/fba0c84e-7760-4937-83c1-072109d07819.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Lincoln Brown","authors":["Lincoln Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":266987470,"title":"Campaigning With Liz Cheney Backfired On Kamala N4934591","text":"Whoever thought it was a good idea for Kamala Harris to campaign with former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney screwed up big time. \n\nIt was clear to most of us that Kamala Harris’ decision to campaign with Liz Cheney was a major misstep. While one could argue that teaming up with a Republican might have helped broaden her appeal, much like RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk’s support boosted Trump, it turns out Cheney’s endorsement became a liability, not an asset. According to a new Data for Progress poll, Cheney’s last-minute campaigning with Harris in key swing states actually backfired, reducing enthusiasm for the vice president among critical voter demographics.\n\nA new analysis from Data for Progress and the Progressive Change Institute found that voters in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan prioritized the economy, with inflation and high prices being the deciding factors for many. They viewed Donald Trump as more capable of addressing these concerns and heard more from him on economic issues than from Harris, solidifying his image as the “change candidate.”\n\nIn both polls, we asked voters two questions about how their enthusiasm for Harris was impacted by her campaign strategy. One question featured Harris' decision to campaign with Cheney, while the other question focused on Harris' decision to push economic populist messaging. Our findings suggest that Harris' decision to campaign with Cheney diverted valuable time that could have been spent continuing to hammer on her popular economic messaging in the final days of the campaign. Our polling finds that Pennsylvania Independents were 18 points more enthusiastic to vote for Harris when campaigning on economic issues, and 7 points less enthusiastic to vote for Harris when campaigning with Cheney – a swing of 25 points. In Michigan, Independents were 11 points more enthusiastic to vote for Harris when campaigning on economic issues and 7 points less enthusiastic when campaigning with Cheney — a swing of 18 points. In both states, 70% of voters said Harris campaigning with Cheney either had no impact on their enthusiasm or made them less enthusiastic.\n\nTheir analysis found that even among the Democratic base, \"campaigning on economic issues boosted enthusiasm to vote for Harris by 25 points in Pennsylvania and by 20 points in Michigan when compared to enthusiasm when campaigning with Cheney — suggesting that the economy should have been Harris' sole focus throughout the critical final days, as it stimulated the base and attracted swing voters.\"\n\nRelated: Voter Approval for Trump’s Transition Creates Huge Problem for Democrats\n\nAs anyone could have expected, the economy was the top issue for independents and Republicans—precisely the voters Kamala Harris sought to win over. Inflation and high prices were the most important economic factors in their decision-making, with over 90% of Pennsylvania independents and more than 80% of Michigan independents citing these issues as crucial. Harris’ choice to focus on campaigning with Liz Cheney in the final days rather than doubling down on economic messaging clearly backfired, diminishing enthusiasm among key voters in these critical swing states.\n\n“Overall, these findings underscore how central the economy and the economic pain of the past few years were in shaping voter decisions in Pennsylvania and Michigan,\" explained Data for Progress. \"While Harris ran on a popular economic agenda, she was ultimately unable to convince voters that she, not Trump, would usher in the changes they wanted to see, lower prices, and challenge bad actors and special interests.\"\n\nAmusingly, the left-leaning organization interpreted the results to mean that voters support progressive economic policies.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/11/24/campaigning-with-liz-cheney-backfired-on-kamala-n4934591","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/296/65aa809a-e3ed-4125-a6cf-10adc51c642e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-25 01:02:33","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.015}]}
