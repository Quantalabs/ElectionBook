EU leaders hope to reach a deal at next week’s summit that would allow the assets to be used as part of a loan package to support Ukraine’s military and economy.\n\nUkraine faces a severe funding gap after almost four years of war and is estimated to need €135.7bn over the next two years. Europe aims to contribute two-thirds of that amount. Moscow has accused the EU of theft.\n\nThe Russian Central Bank said on Friday it had filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in response to the EU’s loan proposal.\n\nRussia’s funds in the EU, frozen days after the invasion began, include €185bn held at Euroclear. Both the EU and Ukraine argue the assets should help rebuild damaged infrastructure, describing the plan as a “reparations loan” worth €90bn for Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it was “only fair” that the frozen assets be used to repair the damage caused by the war. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the funds would help Ukraine defend itself against further Russian attacks.\n\nEU officials had expected the legal action from Russia. European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said EU institutions were protected from such proceedings.\n\nBelgium, however, has raised concerns about the risks involved. Euroclear’s chief executive, Valérie Urbain, warned that using the assets could affect the global financial system. Euroclear itself has about €16–17bn immobilised in Russia.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has set conditions before backing the EU plan and has not ruled out further legal steps if the proposal threatens Belgium’s interests.\n\nThe EU is now working to secure an agreement acceptable to Belgium before Thursday’s summit. So far, the bloc has avoided touching the frozen assets directly but has transferred “windfall profits” generated from them to Ukraine. In 2024, that amounted to €3.7bn.\n\nUkraine’s international military support has declined sharply in 2025, with Europe unable to fully replace reduced US aid under President Donald Trump.\n\nTo raise the targeted €90bn, EU members are weighing two options. One involves borrowing on capital markets with the EU budget as a guarantee—a plan Belgium prefers but one that requires unanimous approval, which Hungary and Slovakia oppose.\n\nThe other option is to provide Ukraine with a loan backed directly by the frozen Russian assets, which have mostly matured into cash held by the European Central Bank.\n\nThe European Commission says Belgium’s concerns have been addressed. Under the proposal, Belgium would be fully guaranteed against any financial loss linked to the frozen funds.\n\nIf Euroclear loses assets in Russia, EU officials say the loss would be offset with Russian clearing-house assets held in the EU. Any ruling by a Russian court against Belgium would not be recognised in the bloc.\n\nIn a significant move, EU ambassadors have agreed to immobilise Russia’s central bank assets indefinitely. Previously, the freeze had to be renewed every six months through unanimous votes.\n\nThe decision was taken under Article 122 of the EU treaties, which allows action during an “immediate threat” to the EU’s economic interests or until Russia pays full war reparations to Ukraine.\n\nSwedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson said the agreement would help the EU provide more support to Ukraine.\n\nALSO READ TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE","summary":"The Russian Central Bank said on Friday it had filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court...","url":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/ukraine-eu-moves-to-freeze-e210bn-russian-assets-indefinitely/","image":"https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Zelensky-e1765574804392.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 21:27:31","author":"Femi Akinyemi","authors":["Femi Akinyemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":386949566,"title":"Did Donald Trump Really Use A Walker?

The Core-5 Plan Explained — And Donald Trump’s Role","text":"The United States is reportedly planning a new superclub of five countries, including India in it. There is no official confirmation on this, however Defense One reported that the Trump administration is exploring the idea of 'C5' or 'Core Five' - a new elite group comprising America, Russia, China, India and Japan. This new group, if formalised, will exclude the existing Europe-dominated G7 and other traditional democracy and wealth based groupings. ,American outlet Politico reported that the concept for the new hard-power grouping originated in a longer, unpublished version of the National Security Strategy released by the White House last week. While Politico could not independently verify the existence of this extended document, it was previously reported by Defense One.,Also Read: What's Straining India–US Ties? Lawmakers Blame Trump Tariffs and H1B Visa Fee Hikes,\"The strategy proposes a 'Core Five,' or C5, consisting of the United States, China, Russia, India, and Japan – several countries with populations over 100 million. It would meet regularly, like the G7, at summits on specific topics. The first on the proposed C5 agenda: security in the Middle East, specifically the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia,\" the report said.,According to Politico, the White House has denied the existence of such a document, with press secretary Hannah Kelly insisting that “no alternative, private, or secret version” of the 33-page official plan exists.,Still, national security experts say the idea carries a distinctly “Trumpian” tone, and argue that creating the C5 would align with the current White House’s approach.,\"This is consistent with how we believe President Trump views the world, which is non-ideological, through a sympathy for strong players, and through a tendency to cooperate with other great powers that maintain spheres of influence in their region,\" Torrey Taussig, who served as director for European affairs on the US National Security Council during the Biden administration, told the publication.,She pointed out that Europe is notably absent from the proposed C5, something that would likely lead Europeans to believe the administration sees Russia as a major power with its own sphere of influence in Europe.,Michael Sobolik, who served as an aide to Republican Senator Ted Cruz during Trump’s first term, added that creating the C5 would mark a shift from Trump’s earlier China strategy.,\"The first Trump administration adhered to the concept of great power competition, and that's how we framed and discussed relations with China...

He reported to prison last month.\n In initially sanctioning de Moraes, the Treasury Department had cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes said the use of the act against him was “illegal and regrettable.” Also in July, the Trump’s administration imposed a 40 per cent tariff on Brazilian products on top of a 10 per cent tariff imposed earlier, justifying the tariffs by saying that Brazil’s policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constituted an economic emergency.\n Last month, Trump signed an order to remove the additional import tariffs on some agribusiness products.

The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.Live EventsSince Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.Ukraine says its constitution doesn't allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that \"no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.\"On Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.In October Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.Ukrainian counterattacksUkrainian forces said Friday that they had recaptured several settlements and neighbourhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a months long operation aimed at reversing Russian advances.

The Estate has provided minimal redactions to these photographs; the redactions are limited to nudity,” CNN quoted them as writing.\nRep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told reporters the newly released photos were “significant,” adding that Democrats have reviewed only about a quarter of the 95,000 images received so far.\n“I think anything that we release is significant. I think – clearly, I think people should be able to make judgments on their own as to what they see in these photos.

We will not rest until the American people get the truth.

Gates has called meeting Epstein “a huge mistake.”\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump’s long-known social ties to Epstein have never resulted in criminal accusations, and his team has previously described Epstein as a “creep” Trump expelled from Mar-a-Lago.\nFriday’s release also included images of sex toys.\nEmails released earlier by the committee show Epstein claiming that Trump “spent hours” with accuser Virginia Giuffre and “knew about the girls” Trump and the White House dismissed those claims as a “hoax,” with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the emails “prove absolutely nothing.”\nCNN’s review of Epstein’s emails shows he frequently referenced Trump —sometimes as analysis, sometimes gossip, sometimes to inflate his own importance.\nOthers linked to Epstein have faced fallout despite no criminal accusations: Summers stepped back from Harvard and resigned from the OpenAI board, calling his past ties “deeply ashamed,” while Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor gave up his royal titles and denies wrongdoing.\nUnder a new law passed last month, the Justice Department must release all Epstein files by December 19. Rep. Thomas Massie, who pushed the measure, warned that failing to comply would be a crime.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Massie said he is “encouraged” by recent DOJ disclosures, while Garcia urged the administration to release files immediately and warned that some unreleased images are “incredibly disturbing.”\n“Right now, our plan is to demand that the president release the files… these pictures… some of these photos… are really disturbing.

Robert Garcia, the most senior Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement that the latest release from the estate contained “over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein” as well as “thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties.”\n\nHe wrote: “It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\n\n“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.\n\n“We will not rest until the American people get the truth.

THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.\n\nHouse Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a collection of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate on Friday, offering a new glimpse into the late financier’s long list of high-profile connections. With pressure rising ahead of next week’s deadline for the Epstein files, tensions on Capitol Hill are deepening.Among the 19 photos made public were images of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Andrew, resurfacing old ties that continue to draw intense public scrutiny.ALSO READ: Why has In-N-Out removed No. 67 from its menu? The slang taking over America explainedThese photos represent only a sliver of the more than 95,000 images Democratic lawmakers say they received from Epstein’s estate. While separate from the Justice Department case files that the Trump administration is now required to release, the timing of the release has added pressure ahead of next week’s deadline for the highly anticipated Epstein documents, as per a report by AP News.Taken together, the images, which Democrats say came directly from Epstein’s estate, reinforce that Epstein moved in circles filled with prominent political, financial and cultural figures. The 19 released photos came without captions or context, including a black-and-white image showing Trump standing alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.Live EventsALSO READ: Sen. Mark Kelly navy report: Here's what punishment potentially awaits the Arizona DemocratWhy were these photos released by House Democrats?Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said he would not comment on whether any of the women in the images were victims.

Here's everything you need to knowRepublicans on the committee quickly pushed back, accusing Garcia and other Democrats of attempting to craft a misleading narrative. A spokesperson for the GOP-led Oversight Committee said Democrats were “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump” adding that nothing in the documents received so far shows “any wrongdoing” by Trump, as per a report by AP News.Many of the images released have already circulated publicly, but Democrats say they plan to continue releasing photos in the coming days and weeks. They argue the move is necessary to increase pressure on Trump over his administration’s earlier refusal to release documents related to the Epstein investigation.ALSO READ: What does 67 mean, who made the 67 meme and why is it so popular?Garcia also noted that his staff has reviewed only about a quarter of the photos provided by Epstein’s estate, which include pictures sent to Epstein or kept in his possession. “Donald Trump right now needs to release the files to the American public so that the truth can come out and we can actually get some sense of justice for the survivors,” Garcia said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, as per a report by AP News.How are Republicans responding to the photo release?Trump, once a close friend of Epstein, has said he distanced himself long before Epstein faced sex trafficking charges. Clinton, who acknowledged traveling on Epstein’s private jet, has maintained through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activity. Clinton has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein’s known victims. Still, Republicans on the committee are pushing both Clintons to testify as part of their investigation.ALSO READ: Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi quit the UK, say country life was too boring, head back to the USAndrew has already lost his royal titles and privileges amid revelations about his ties to Epstein, though he denies wrongdoing.Could more high-profile figures be implicated?The release also included images of Steven Bannon, Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Larry Summers and Alan Dershowitz. These men have all denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein.Some lawmakers believe more revelations could emerge once the full case files are released. Rep. Thomas Massie said it was encouraging that the Justice Department has sought permission to release grand jury material. “The grand jury material is just a small fraction of what the DOJ needs to release, because the FBI and DOJ probably has evidence that they chose not to take to the grand jury because the evidence they’re in possession of would implicate other people, not Epstein or Maxwell,” he said, as per a report by AP News.ALSO READ: From US to Australia, mysterious 3I/ATLAS spaceship pushes countries into urgent space-threat drillsFAQsWhy were these Epstein-related photos released now?Democrats are increasing pressure on the Trump administration as a deadline approaches to release the full Epstein files.Do the new Epstein photos show wrongdoing by Trump or others?The Republican-led committee says nothing they’ve received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n( Originally published on Dec 12, 2025 )\n\nRead More News ondonald trump photosepstein photoswoody allennew epstein photossteve bannonepsteinepstein filesepstein files releasedhouse oversight committeetrump epstein\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Earlier, a report said the AI giant is evaluating an increase in H200 chip production to meet robust demand from China.Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter.The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on such sales.Live EventsDemand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private.Major Chinese companies including Alibaba and ByteDance have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday.However, uncertainties remain, as the Chinese government has yet to greenlight any purchase of the H200. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source.Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the U.S. AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Friday as Broadcom's latest results added to concerns about an AI-fueled bubble, dampening optimism stoked by the Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-expected signals on 2026 rate cuts.Broadcom slid 8.4 per cent after the chipmaker warned of slimmer future margins on its AI system sales, despite projecting strong quarterly revenue.

It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Trump attended.Despite the deal, the two countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued.The roots of the Thai-Cambodian border conflict lie in a history of enmity over competing territorial claims. These claims largely stem from a 1907 map created while Cambodia was under French colonial rule, which Thailand maintains is inaccurate. Tensions were exacerbated by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that awarded sovereignty to Cambodia, which still riles many Thais.Thailand has deployed jet fighters to carry out airstrikes on what it says are military targets. Cambodia has deployed BM-21 rocket launchers with a range of 30-40 kilometers (19-25 miles).According to data collected by public broadcaster ThaiPBS, at least six of the Thai soldiers who were killed were hit by rocket shrapnel.The Thai army's northeastern regional command said Thursday that some residential areas and homes near the border were damaged by BM-21 rocket launchers from Cambodian forces.The Thai army also said it destroyed a tall crane atop a hill held by Cambodia where the centuries-old Preah Vihear temple is located, because it allegedly held electronic and optical devices used for military command and control purposes.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onThailand Cambodia ceasefireTrump announcement ceasefire agreementThai Cambodian border conflictThai Cambodian clashesUnited States\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onThailand Cambodia ceasefireTrump announcement ceasefire agreementThai Cambodian border conflictThai Cambodian clashesUnited States \n\nPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth Edition123View all Stories","summary":"President Donald Trump announced a renewed truce between Thailand and Cambodia.

In the latest drop, there are pictures of US President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Prince Andrew, and several other high-profile names.\n“It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends,” said the Oversight Committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, in a statement.\n“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,” it added.\nThese images reinforce that Epstein was tied in the past to a wide variety of powerful and high-profile people whose ties to him are now under significant scrutiny.\nWho All Are In The Photos?\nOne image among a batch of photos released Friday showed Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks.\n\nTrump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appeared to be a social event. A third photo showed Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appeared to be a plane.\nAnother photo showed a bowl of condoms with Trump’s caricature and ‘I’m HUUUUGE!’ text, along with a sign reading “Trump condom $4.50”.\n\nDonald Trump’s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein reportedly began in the 1980s and included socializing at events in Palm Beach and New York. Though Donald Trump later distanced himself from Jeffrey Epstein, claiming he banned him from Mar-a-Lago in the mid-2000s.\nAdditionally, there is a signed photo from former US President Bill Clinton depicting him smiling alongside Epstein and Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving 20 years for her part in the sex trafficking scheme.\n\nOther photos showed former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein’s one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\nHowever, none of these images depicted any sexual misconduct or are believed to depict underage girls. It was not immediately clear when or where they were taken, or by whom.\nAnother notable face is former Trump adviser and noted ally, Steve Bannon, who appeared in one picture sitting across a desk, engaged in conversation with Epstein.\n\nBannon was one of Trump’s closest advisers in the run up to the 2016 election, and in the early days of his first administration. He resigned from the White House in August 2017.\nLarry Visoski, Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime pilot, American engineer and inventor Dean Kamen and Belgian model Ingrid Seynheave also featured in the photographs.\n\nAdditional photos also showed Woody Allen sitting in a director’s chair speaking with Epstein, while another captured Allen and Bannon in conversation. Tech mogul Bill Gates with the former Prince Andrew was also featured. Former Harvard President Larry Summers and lawyer Alan Dershowitz also appeared in pictures from the estate.\n\nThe Republican-led committee obtained the images from Epstein’s estate as part of its ongoing investigation.

COOPER, Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at blocking states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.\n\nThe order is likely to put Colorado in the crosshairs as one of four states that have passed AI laws, though Colorado’s measure setting guardrails around the use of AI has yet to take effect.\n\nMembers of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.\n\nBut Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that “there’s only going to be one winner” as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China’s central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.\n\n“We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it’s impossible to do,” Trump said.\n\nThe executive order directs the attorney general to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Commerce Department to draw up a list of problematic regulations.\n\nIt also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws. Colorado recently announced it expected to be awarded $420 million from one of the programs cited in the order, the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program.\n\nDavid Sacks, a venture capitalist with extensive AI investments who is leading Trump’s policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said the Trump administration would only push back on “the most onerous examples of state regulation” but would not oppose “kid safety” measures.\n\nWhat states have proposed\n\nFour states — Colorado, California, Utah and Texas — have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.\n\nThose laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.\n\nThe laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.\n\nStates’ more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.\n\nBeyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government’s own use of AI.","summary":"Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/12/12/trump-blocks-state-ai-regulations-colorado/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_05228.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 17:03:43","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.028},{"id":386949526,"title":"Epstein Photo Bombshell: Trump, Clinton, Gates & Bannon Surface in Never-Before-Seen Images","text":"Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, showing powerful figures connected to the late sex trafficker, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Steve Bannon, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and others.

Trump, a Republican, has emphasized since announcing the project that he’s doing it with private money, including his own. But that would not necessarily change how federal laws and procedures apply to what is still a U.S. government project.\n\nThe president already has bypassed the federal government’s usual building practices and historical reviews with the East Wing demolition. He recently added another architectural firm to the project.\n\nTrump has long said a White House ballroom is overdue, complaining that events were held outside under a tent because the East Room and the State Dining Room could not accommodate bigger crowds. Trump, among other complaints, said guests get their feet wet if it rains during such events.\n\nThe White House is expected to submit plans for Trump’s new ballroom to a federal planning commission before the year ends, about three months after construction began.\n\nWill Scharf, who was named by Trump as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, said at the panel’s monthly meeting last week that he was told by colleagues at the White House that the long-awaited plans would be filed in December.\n\n“Once plans are submitted, that’s really when the role of this commission, and its professional staff, will begin,” said Scharf, who also is one of the Republican president’s top White House aides.\n\nHe said the review process would happen at a “normal and deliberative pace.”\n\nBesides being too late, the Trust argues, that’s not nearly enough.\n\nThe Trust asserts that plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law.\n\n“The National Trust received no response,” the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit cites a litany of federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nAmong them is a statute: “A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park, or public grounds of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.”\n\nThe Trust notes also that the range design and environmental reviews, along with congressional deliberation, would involve public input.\n\n“This public involvement, while important in all preservation matters, is particularly critical here, where the structure at issue is perhaps the most recognizable and historically significant building in the country,” the complaint says.\n\nBesides the president, the lawsuit names as defendants the National Parks Service, the Department of the Interior, and the General Services Administration, along with leaders of those federal agencies.","summary":"The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking a court to stop Trump’s ballroom project.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/12/12/trump-sued-white-house-ballroom/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25343759791213-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 16:25:05","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":386949406,"title":"Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses in his repayment overhaul is facing bipartisan backlash","text":"Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump&apos;s repayment overhaul is mounting.On Friday&comma; a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education&apos;s proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.The department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.

The photos released Friday were separate from the case files that the Department of Justice is now under compulsion to release, but anticipation is growing as the Trump administration faces a deadline next week to produce the Epstein files that have been the source of conspiracy theories and speculation for years.\n\nThe photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.\n\nRep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee accused Garcia and Democratic lawmakers of “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump,” adding that nothing in the documents the committee has received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president.\n\nMany of the photos have already circulated in the public. Democrats pledged to continue to release photos in the days and weeks ahead, as they look to pressure Trump over his Republican administration’s earlier refusal to release documents in the Epstein probe. Garcia said that his staff had looked through about a quarter of the images it had received from Epstein’s estate, which included photos that were sent to him or that he had in his possession.\n\n“Donald Trump right now needs to release the files to the American public so that the truth can come out and we can actually get some sense of justice for the survivors,” Garcia added.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the photos.\n\nTrump, once a close friend of Epstein, has said that he parted ways with him long before he faced the sex trafficking charges. Clinton, too, has minimized his relationship with Epstein, acknowledging that he traveled on Epstein’s private jet but saying through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier’s crimes. Clinton also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein’s known victims. However, Republicans on the House committee are pushing him and Hillary Clinton to testify in their investigation.\n\nAndrew lost his royal titles and privileges this year amid new revelations of his ties to Epstein, though he has denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe photo release also included images of the right-wing political operative Steven Bannon, billionaires Richard Branson and Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The men have denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who kept many high-profile figures in his circle of friends.\n\nAmid an earlier release of emails between Summers and Epstein, Summers stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard University and faced other fallout to his standing in academic circles.\n\nAllen has faced allegations from his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her as a child. He has denied the allegations.\n\nSome lawmakers, however, believe that other high-powered figures could be implicated in Epstein’s abuse if the full case files from the Justice Department are released.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was instrumental in passing a bill to require the public release of the files, said it was a good sign that the Department of Justice has sought to have grand jury material released from several courts.\n\n“The grand jury material is just a small fraction of what the DOJ needs to release, because the FBI and DOJ probably has evidence that they chose not to take to the grand jury because the evidence they’re in possession of would implicate other people, not Epstein or Maxwell,” he said.","summary":"It's a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/12/12/epstein-photos-trump-clinton-andrew/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25346610394406.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 15:51:16","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":386945738,"title":"GOP Rep Rips Socialism, Drops Immigration Warning: ‘Anti-Christian and Anti-American’","text":"Rep. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) is on a mission to address immigration, proposing what she sees as meaningful reform that could solve the current quagmire over the contentious issue.\n\nSalazar, a Republican whose family is from Cuba, told CBN News she believes many Americans are getting the issue wrong.\n\n“You cannot deport every single illegal in the country, because … we don’t have the manpower to do that,” she said. “At the same time, those are hands that we need to grow the economy.”\n\nBut Salazar, who has a new book out on the issue, “Dignity Not Citizenship,” said the other side of the aisle is also off-base in that they want to “give [a] path to citizenship to everybody and let them make them be citizens even though they broke the law.”\n\nThe congresswoman said she believes there’s a third path that offers a balance — and “dignity.”\n\nShe proposed “The Dignity Act” earlier this year, a legislation she believes would help bring illegal individuals who have been in America for more than five years “out of the shadows.”\n\n“I am not talking about giving those people who have been here for more than five years and do not have a criminal record any type of citizenship or amnesty,” Salazar said. “I’m offering them the dignity status, which … allows them to stay in the country, go home for Christmas, buy a home, pay $7,000 fines, pay 1% of their salary for the next seven years, and to be able to consume, and to live a dignified life in the promised land.”\n\nShe said this is a middle-of-the-road way of solving a “40-year problem” that neither side of the political aisle has been able to fix. Salazar said her faith was the impetus of her decision to try and tackle the issue.\n\n“I am a born-again Christian,” she said. “I am a militant Christian. I believe that this is the right thing to do. It says that in the Bible over and over again — ‘Treat your neighbor as yourself.'”\n\nShe continued, “And do not necessarily give them citizenship, but treat them well, and if they have set roots in our communities, we should grant them some type of dignified life.”\n\nSalazar said she’s not arguing that illegals should have access to federal programs, vote, or become Americans. Instead, she’s looking for a way to permit them to contribute and help out while also allowing them to come forward in a viable and legal way.\n\nThe congresswoman said it’s important to go after illegal immigrants who are criminals, but she said the current dynamic sometimes goes too far.\n\n“I don’t agree that you have to kick out of the country someone who’s been here for 20 years, has three American children, that do not have a criminal record, has been picking up the jalapeno peppers in Southern California, or cleaning the toilets in Manhattan, or in the slaughterhouses, or in the dairies, milking the cows and contributing,” she said. “It’s true, they’re illegals. But the guy who gave him the job also broke the law. So then you start into this spiral that I would like to stop. So bring everyone out of the shadows, make them accountable, and give them dignity.”\n\nSalazar also stressed the importance of the GOP garnering support from Hispanics, noting a failure to do so will cost Republicans elections.\n\nSalazar also spent time decrying socialism and communism, explaining her own background to help frame why these systems disturb her.\n\n“Socialism is Marxism and Marxism is communism,” she said. “We know because my parents are Cubans. I’m first-generation American, and I know exactly what that ideology does to you.”\n\nSalazar continued, “It’s wonderful in theory; it’s miserable in practice.”\n\nShe went on to call communism an “ideology that is evil.”\n\n“It’s nefarious, it’s cruel, it’s anti-Christian, and anti-American,” Salazar said. “So we in the GOP have to wake up and bring new votes to our base.”\n\nUltimately, Salazar said “we are the best country on earth” and encouraged Christians to take action to help bridge divides on immigration — one step that could help stop the spread of socialism.\n\n“Hispanics are the fastest growing population in the United States,” she said. “We need to bring them to the GOP, and I’m doing all I can, and the Lord Almighty will be the one finishing this job, and I assure you that He will.”\n\nSalazar also believes President Donald Trump will support her legislation.\n\n“I’ve always told him, ‘Mr. President, the same God … the Most High who saved you from death in Pennsylvania is the one who will enlighten you, sir, to give dignity to those people,'” she said.","url":"https://cbn.com/news/politics/gop-rep-rips-socialism-drops-immigration-warning-anti-christian-and-anti-american","image":"/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/goprips_hdv.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 15:50:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":386946550,"title":"Trump led Republicans to power in 2024.

Democrats also won a special election in a historically Republican district in Georgia.\n\nThere are also signs that Trump’s influence over his party has its limits, and he failed Thursday to persuade Indiana state senators to approve a new congressional map that could have helped Republicans pick up two more seats.\n\nPerhaps most concerning for Republicans, Trump is losing ground on the very issues that powered his comeback victory last year, potentially undermining his utility as a surrogate for the party’s candidates in the midterm elections. Only 31% of U.S. adults now approve of how he’s handling the economy, down from 40% in March, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Trump has struggled to acknowledge the public’s concern, telling Politico this week that he gave himself an “A+++++” on the economy.\n\nThe picture wasn’t much brighter on other issues that Trump has capitalized on, including crime and immigration. Despite Trump’s aggressive law-and-order posture, which includes deploying the National Guard in Washington and other Democratic-led cities, Americans’ approval of his handling of crime has slipped to 43% from 53% just a few months ago. On immigration, Trump’s most consistent priority since launching his political career a decade ago, approval of his handling of the issue dropped from 49% in March to 38% now.\n\nGOP worries as midterm elections loom\n\nWith Democrats just a few seats shy of reclaiming the House majority, Republicans are watching the developments with a growing sense of unease and frustration that the dynamics of Trump’s first midterm — when Democrats scored a net gain of 40 seats in 2018 — are at risk of repeating.\n\n“If you’re not concerned, then you’re living in a cave,” Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., told reporters Thursday. “If you’re not watching the elections that are happening all the time, then you’re living in a cave. We’re not good at our messaging a lot of times as Republicans. The Democrats are professionals at it. We’re not good at it.”\n\nWith nearly a year until votes are cast, it’s impossible to predict how the balance of power may shift in Washington. Historically, the party that occupies the presidency loses seats in Congress during the first midterm after a presidential election. But the scope of the Democratic wins in 2018 might be hard to replicate as redistricting and other voting patterns result in fewer genuinely competitive districts.\n\nFor his part, Trump remains publicly confident about the party’s prospects.\n\n“People want us to win the midterms, and I think we have great spirit,” he said at an event Wednesday. “We should win the midterms.”\n\nHis chief of staff, Susie Wiles, recently told a podcast that Trump will campaign aggressively next year and the party will effectively “put him on the ballot.” But the challenge of that strategy was on display this week when a trip to Pennsylvania intended to focus on combating inflation was instead overshadowed by grievances about immigrants from “filthy” countries.\n\nOther challenges continue to stack up. Pressure from rogue Republicans forced Trump to ultimately go along with a vote calling for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. And legislation passed this week includes several measures that push back against Trump’s Defense Department.\n\nThe affordability angle\n\nMany Republicans campaigning in some of the most competitive congressional districts in the U.S. aren’t distancing themselves from Trump. John Braun, a state senator in Washington state who is challenging Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, said he would be fine if Trump decided to visit the district. He also noted with approval that Vice President JD Vance plans to increase his travel plans.\n\nWhile he was optimistic about the party’s opportunities, Braun was clear about the challenges facing Republicans heading into 2026. He said affordability is the top issue he hears from voters.\n\n“We have a lot of work to do and a lot of it’s going to depend at the national level in particular on what Republicans do to affect the affordability issues,” Braun said. “People are interested in many things, a wide range of issues. But top of mind right now is how do I support myself, my family in the current environment? We’re going to have to do the right things over the next 11 months.”\n\nIn Washington on Thursday, there was a distinct sense among Republicans in Congress that the right things weren’t happening. Frustration grew after the Senate rejected an extension of health care subsidies, essentially guaranteeing millions of Americans will face a steep rise in costs in January, adding to voters’ existing economic concerns.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has opted against reelection, said this moment is even more perilous for Republicans than the period before the 2018 midterms when the party unsuccessfully sought to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, playing into Democratic attacks on health care. At least during that debate, he argued, voters weren’t losing something as they would in January.\n\n“Us failing to put something else in place did not create this cliff that people are going to encounter,” Tillis said. “That’s the fundamental difference in an election year.”\n\nSome Republicans on Capitol Hill expressed concern that the party has a problem communicating with voters. And if there’s no last-minute fix to prevent the health care hike, some said there may be no effective message.\n\n“If people suddenly pay thousands of dollars more for health care, I don’t know what kind of messaging is going to matter in that circumstance,” said Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif. “It is what it is. And so we can try to (say) ‘oh it’s their fault or our fault.’ Unfortunately, that’s what a lot of the energy around here seems to be devoted to.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.","summary":"Despite challenges, Trump remains confident about the party's midterm prospects, but the GOP's messaging struggles continue.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/12/12/trump-republicans-election-2026-challenges/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Trump_88506-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 15:39:14","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.078},{"id":386949572,"title":"Tears in Translation: Interpreter Breaks Down as Ukrainian Boy Recalls Mother Killed in Russian Strike — Inside His Survival Story","text":"Brussels: An interpreter became emotional and broke into tears when she was translating the sufferings faced by an 11-year-old Ukrainian boy who lost his mother and got critically injured in a Russian missile attack at a Ukraine hospital in 2022.,The interpreter was translating the 11-year-old kid's ordeal at the European Parliament in Brussels.

Will it buy you love? If America’s current generation of centibillionaires are any guide, storied wealth is a one-way ticket to hell. Humanity’s only hope of saving itself is to move to Mars, according to Elon Musk. The Anti-Christ is coming, says Peter Thiel. Crypto is your only security against a collapsing US dollar, says pretty much every bitcoin pusher in the neighbourhood. Many of today’s dystopian plutocrats are the same people who promised utopia in the earlier phases of the internet. Something chemical must have changed since then in Palo Alto’s water supply. Instead of the lure of community and being connected, we are being sold cataclysm and apocalypse. The enlightenment has given way to the even more profitable “dark enlightenment”. \n\nLike many people, I toggle between feeling amused by the adolescent nonsense that you hear from so many tech titans and deep foreboding about their tightening grip on our world. On the one hand, you get people naming their companies after fantasy fiction tropes, especially from Tolkien, and whose idea of a political movie is The Matrix. Their world consists of super villains and super heroes. They seem to have confused masculinity with childishness — petulance, aggression and self-obsession being their idea of maleness. On the other hand, their sway over the federal machinery of state has gone from tangential to central at remarkable speed. We should not be amused by the fact that Thiel’s acolytes are in charge of key nodes of Washington’s power ministries, not just the Pentagon. \n\nAny Europeans puzzled about the level of transatlantic ferocity in last week’s US National Security Strategy document should listen more closely to the broligarchs. Their arch-enemy is the EU and its digital privacy and digital services acts, which they want swept away. Brussels bureaucracy, and woke member state governments, are what is standing between them and domination of the rest of the west. In the coming months, the Trump administration will assuredly step up its attack on EU regulations and make their dilution or abolition central to the future of the western alliance. The US federal government is playing the roles of lawyer, promoter, hitman and agent for Palantir, xAI, Meta and the rest. \n\nAs Paul Krugman noted in an incisive recent Substack, America has become a “digital narco state”. While Australia offers an alternative path of banning social media companies from doing business with under-16s, the Trump administration is pushing their toxins into every corner of society. Trumpian populism may be the story of our age but I am increasingly persuaded that we are underplaying the tech-authoritarian elephant in the room. \n\nIf you want insight into the broligarch mindset watch this Andrew Ross Sorkin interview with Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive. Karp suffers from no shortage of self-regard. “If people listened to me more proactively we’d have a better world,” he says. “I am running the most important tech company in the world.” “We are the backbone of US deterrence.” “If the Democrats ran someone who agreed with me they would win.” \n\nApart from the fact that Karp cannot sit still for a moment, my key takeaway was his sense of persecution. Here is a modern hero who wants to save western civilisation but people don’t show him the love he deserves. Don’t dare ask him about Palantir’s role in helping ICE target and deport illegal immigrants (its platform is called Immigration OS). Karp writes off criticism as “derangement syndrome”. In his mind, Palantir is all that stands between US democracy and its collapse. Please, Swampians, watch this and reassure me that we are in safe hands. You might also spare a couple of minutes to look at this illuminating “Authoritarian stack” compiled by the University College of London’s Francesca Bria. It provides detailed maps of the network of state capture both in the US and increasingly Europe. \n\nI was also struck by this piece by my colleague Hannah Murphy, who was reporting on Balaji Srinivasan’s recent Network State Conference in Singapore. These are the chiefly Thiel-funded libertarians who want to escape the bonds of democracy by setting up corporate city states and even sovereign societies in which governance is decided by the corporation not their inhabitants. It is from Hannah’s piece that I borrowed the phrase “elite victim complex”. \n\nI am thus turning to Hannah this week with a couple of questions. Hannah, you work in San Francisco, which has become a byword for liberal misgovernance. How much of the tech elite’s disdain for the left derives from their experience of that (until recently) woefully misgoverned city? Second, should we take the broligarch worldview literally and seriously? If so, it is hard to feel optimistic about the future of democracy.\n\nRecommended reading \n\nMy column this week looks at a different aspect of the same theme — “Trump is choosing the broligarchs over his base” “When historians assess this age of American populism, Silicon Valley’s plutocrats will surely be judged its winners,” I write. I greatly enjoyed Susan Glasser’s latest letter from Trump’s Washington on how “war is peace”, ignorance is truth etc, and peace prizes are all the rage. In addition to being awarded Fifa’s first peace prize by the world football body’s aptly named Gianni Infantino in the Kennedy Center on Monday, Trump this week renamed the US Institute of Peace as the “Donald J Trump Institute of Peace.” It’s so hard to keep up. Finally, for an admirably concise and vivid book, read Guiliano da Empoli’s The Hour of the Predator: Encounters with the autocrats and tech billionaires taking over the world. Alert Swampians might have noticed that I’m vaguely interested in this topic. \n\nHannah Murphy replies\n\nHi Ed, How much heed should one give to declarations from the likes of Musk that the desperate state of downtown San Francisco heralds “the end of civilisation” and can be blamed on the “woke mind virus”?\n\nFrom my first-hand experience living in the city, its struggles with homelessness, housing shortages, open air drug use and theft are no joke for inhabitants — to the point that even the most liberally-inclined might sympathise with the tough-on-crime stance of new mayor Daniel Lurie. \n\nBut in reality, professional victims such as Elon have long swapped the hills of the foggy city for a life of private jets and sprawling compounds in remote corners of New Zealand or Hawaii.\n\nRather, the “woe-is-me” sentiment comes from a sense that despite contributing to American dynamism, building multibillion-dollar technology empires and generating tens of thousands of jobs in the process, they have been cast as villains in the court of public opinion, and persecuted by liberal politicians in the Biden administration and the EU daring to pursue Big Tech regulation and antitrust lawsuits. \n\nThe solution for the thin-skinned American broligarch seems twofold. The most radical route to pursue is the “network state” movement I wrote about — funding alternative governance initiatives reminiscent of feudalism. But these are highly experimental and to date, none have evolved too far. \n\nMore worrisome is the other option, under Trump’s more transactional second administration, of capturing the state. Think lavishing the president with praise at his recent tech titan dinner, and buying up properties in Washington DC as quasi-embassies to project power and have a presence on the Hill. The current goal of these efforts appears to be to ensure as little red tape as possible for their headlong charge into presumably lucrative artificial intelligence, rather than better civilisation or even helping to improve the city that made them.","summary":"Acolytes of the broligarchs have a grip on key nodes of Washington’s power ministries","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/bb8e995d-930d-4912-87b1-c6fa1080bb7f","image":"https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff49a98f0-2b0e-4d6f-b92a-fac160081b96.jpg?source=cp-insurance-policy&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 14:00:05","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.365},{"id":386950442,"title":"Walz, Omar, and the Billion-Dollar Minnesota Fraud Scandal","text":"Minnesota is now facing one of the largest documented government service fraud scandals in United States history. Under Gov. Tim Walz’s evidently unwatchful eye, federal prosecutors have estimated that approximately $1 billion in taxpayer funds have been siphoned from multiple state- and federally funded social service programs over the last five years.\n\nAs of this writing, 87 individuals have been charged in connection with the scheme, with 61 convictions already secured and more charges continuing to be filed against these fraudsters. The bulk of the fraud scheme centers around two government programs.\n\nThe first target was the Minneapolis-based not-for-profit Feeding Our Future, which distributed federal child nutrition funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in April 2020, the organization’s founder and executive director allegedly oversaw an elaborate fraud operation that involved over 250 fake meal sites throughout Minnesota, siphoning over $250 million in taxpayer funds.\n\nThe second scheme involved Minnesota’s Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention program, which provides treatment to people with autism. Defendants allegedly fraudulently billed Medicaid for autism therapy services that were never provided. They recruited children from Minneapolis’ Somali community who did not have autism diagnoses. Their parents were then paid between $300 and $1,500 per month as kickbacks to keep their children enrolled. To put this into perspective, one company billed Medicaid over $850,000 in one year for one child and was paid out $438,000. Federal prosecutors are still working to determine the full scale of the fraud.\n\nBut none of this should have happened. It could have been stopped far earlier.\n\nThere were early warning signs as far back as July 2019, when Minnesota state officials discovered that there was potential fraud occurring within Feeding Our Future. However, according to former employees of the Minnesota Department of Education, after the state caught wind of the potential fraud, it temporarily stopped payments to Feeding Our Future, which then sued the state. Under pressure from Feeding Our Future leadership, state officials decided to continue providing the payments.\n\nBut everything came to light. Walz blamed the judge in the Feeding Our Future case for forcing the state to continue making the payments, yet this evidently was such a blatant misrepresentation of the facts that the judge himself came out and said, “The Department of Education voluntarily resumed payments and informed the court that FOF resolved the ‘serious deficiencies’ that prompted it to suspect payments temporarily. All of the MN Department of Education food reimbursements payments to FOF were made voluntarily, without any court order.”\n\nAny meaningful due diligence seemingly would have tipped off investigators to the blatant fraud that was occurring. Reports note that nearly $700 million in EIDBI claims have been paid out, with notable spikes around the same period that dozens of new clinics popped up within the state, which even state officials themselves were concerned about at the time, wondering how many were doing actual work.\n\nSo how did Minnesota’s darling Somali congressional representative, Ilhan Omar, respond to the massive allegations against members of her community?\n\nIn typical “squad” fashion, she redirected her answers toward President Donald Trump’s response.\n\nA question has also been raised about whether Omar knew that this fraud was occurring or at least should have been tipped off to the fact that something was amiss. One of her own former campaign officials, for example, was convicted of stealing millions of dollars and has on multiple occasions been seen with another member of the fraud scheme who similarly stole millions of dollars.\n\nPredictably, Trump did not mince his words when discussing the issue. He called Somali immigrants “garbage.” Of course, not every single Somali immigrant was part of this massive fraud scheme; only a fraction of them were. And Trump’s response, while not appropriate, shows that he evidently harbors a deep resentment for those entering our country from abroad and siphoning billions in taxpayer money. This is an issue that Americans had to contend with for four years during former President Joe Biden’s term, as millions of migrants entered the United States unlawfully and were met with three square meals a day and cozy hotel beds to sleep on.\n\nThere are two things that we should take away from the situation: First, Walz would have made an awful vice president if he allowed this level of fraud to occur right under his nose. And second, we need competent leaders who are unwilling to look the other way in the face of obvious fraud.\n\nWalz is not one of those leaders.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The poll's findings look very similar to an AP-NORC poll from December 2022, when Biden was president and the country was grappling with higher rates of inflation. Trump's series of tariffs have added to inflationary pressures and generated anxiety about the stability of the U.S. economy, keeping prices at levels that many Americans find frustrating.\n\nThe president has insisted there is \"no\" inflation and the U.S. economy is booming, as he expressed frustration that the public feels differently.\n\n\"When will people understand what is happening?\" Trump said Thursday on Truth Social. \"When will Polls reflect the Greatness of America at this point in time, and how bad it was just one year ago?\"\n\nMost U.S. adults, 68%, continue to say the country's economy is \"poor,\" which is unchanged from December 2024, before Trump returned to the presidency.\n\nAmericans are feeling strained as they continue to see high prices\n\nWhite House officials plan to send Trump barnstorming across the country in hopes of bucking up people's faith in the economy before next year's midterm elections. But the president this week in Pennsylvania defended the price increases tied to his tariffs by suggesting that Americans should buy fewer dolls and pencils for children. His message is a jarring contrast with what respondents expressed in the poll, even among people who backed him in the 2024 election.\n\nSergio Ruiz, 44, of Tucson, Arizona, said he is using more buy now, pay later programs to spread out over time the expense of gifts for his children. He doesn't put a huge emphasis on politics, but he voted for Trump last year and would like to see lower interest rates to help boost his real estate business. He believes that more Americans having higher incomes would help to manage any affordability issues.\n\n\"Prices are up. What can you do? You need to make more money,\" Ruiz said.\n\nThe poll found that when they do shop, about half of Americans are finding the lowest price more than they would normally. About 4 in 10 are dipping into their savings more than at other times.\n\nDemocrats are more likely than Republicans to say they're cutting back on expenses or looking for low prices, but many Republicans are budgeting more than usual as well. About 4 in 10 Republicans are looking for low prices more than they usually would, while a similar share are shopping for nonessential items less than usual.\n\nViews are largely similar to when Biden was president\n\nPeople felt similarly dismal about holiday shopping and the economy when Biden was president in 2022. Inflation had spiked to a four-decade high that summer. Three years later, inflation has eased substantially, but it's still running at 3%, a full percentage point above the Federal Reserve's target as the job market appears to have entered a deep freeze.\n\nThe survey indicates that it's the level of prices — and not just the rate of inflation — that is the point of pain for many families. Roughly 9 in 10 U.S. adults, 87%, say they've noticed higher than usual prices for groceries in the past few months, while about two-thirds say they've experienced higher prices than usual for electricity and holiday gifts. About half say they've seen higher than normal prices for gas recently.\n\nThe findings on groceries and holiday gifts are only slightly lower than in the 2022 poll, despite the slowdown from an inflation rate that hit a four-decade peak in the middle of that year.\n\nConsumer spending has stayed resilient despite the negative sentiments about the economy, yet Trump's tariffs have caused changes for shoppers such as Andrew Russell.\n\nThe 33-year-old adjunct professor in Arlington Heights, Illinois, said he used to shop for unique gifts from around the globe and buy online. But with the tariffs, he got his gifts locally and \"this year, I only bought things that I can pick up in person,\" he said.\n\nRussell, who voted Democratic in last year's election, said he worries about the economy for next year. He thinks the investment in artificial intelligence has become a bubble that could burst, taking down the stock market.\n\nLittle optimism about an economic rebound in 2026\n\nFew people expect the situation to meaningfully improve next year — a sign that Trump has done little to instill much confidence from his mix of tariffs, income tax cuts and foreign trips to attract investments. Trump has maintained that the benefits from his policies will begin to snowball in 2026.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 U.S. adults expect next year will be economically worse for the country. Roughly 3 in 10 say conditions won't change much. Only about 2 in 10 think things will get better, with Republicans being more optimistic.\n\nThe belief that things will get better has slipped from last year, when about 4 in 10 said that 2025 would be better than 2024.\n\nMillicent Simpson, 56, of Cleveland, Ohio, said she expects the economy to be worse for people like her who rely on Medicaid for health care and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Simpson voted Democratic last year and blames Trump for the greater economic pressures that she faces going into the winter.\n\n\"He's making it rough for us,\" she said. \"He's messing with the government assistance for everybody, young and old.\"","summary":"This holiday season isn't quite so merry for American shoppers as large shares are dipping into savings, scouring for bargains and feeling like the overall economy is stuck in a rut under President Donald Trump, a new AP-NORC poll finds.\n\n\n\n     The vast majority of U.S. adults say they've noticed higher than usual prices for groceries, electricity and holiday gifts in recent months, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.","url":"https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/317124-this-holiday-season-isn-t-very-merry-for-us-consumers","image":"http://images0.naharnet.com/images/272013/w140.jpg?1765546292","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 13:31:37","author":"Naharnet Newsdesk","authors":["Naharnet Newsdesk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lb","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":386947240,"title":"Spanish PM slams US 'extrajudicial operations' off Venezuela","text":"Speaking to Italy's L'Espresso magazine, the Socialist premier urged a peaceful resolution to the growing crisis between President Donald Trump's administration and Caracas, which have sparked fears of an open conflict.\n\nAsked about what the reporter characterised as US extrajudicial killings in international waters, Sánchez said: \"The questioning of international law is, once again, worrying.\"\n\nHe said the operations fuel criticism that the West is inconsistent and applies \"double standards\" on defending international law.\n\n\"We must find paths for dialogue and a peaceful solution to this crisis,\" he continued.\n\n\"In my opinion, these extrajudicial operations are unacceptable, they undermine international law.\"\n\nWashington has been piling pressure on Venezuela for months, with a major naval buildup in the region that has been accompanied by deadly strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats, killing nearly 90 people.","summary":"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez condemned as \"unacceptable\" the \"extrajudicial operations\" carried out by the United States on alleged drug-trafficking boats off Venezuela, in an interview published Friday.","url":"https://www.thelocal.es/20251212/spanish-pm-slams-us-extrajudicial-operations-off-venezuela","image":"https://assets.thelocal.com/cdn-cgi/rs:fit:1200/quality:75/plain/https://apiwp.thelocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251205__87936T4__v1__MidRes__UsVenezuelaMilitaryNavy.jpg@webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 13:22:33","author":"TheLocal","authors":["TheLocal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"es","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":386944064,"title":"JD Vance Accused Of Desperate Attempt To Be 'Relatable Again', 'Sounds Like A Terrible Father' Over Joke","text":"The viral life of a meaningless internet trend is a bizarre thing to witness, but few could have predicted it would reach such a fever pitch that it provoked an active US Vice President to publicly question the First Amendment. Yet, that is precisely the curious saga that unfolded recently when Vice President JD Vance vented his parental frustration over the baffling 'six seven' phenomenon, only to find himself instantly thrust into a political firestorm.\n\nVance, 41, who shares three young children—Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3—with his wife Usha, offered a moment of unexpected candour on X (formerly Twitter). As the current Vice President, a title he has held since January 20, 2025, his social media activity is scrutinised relentlessly.\n\nHe detailed a maddeningly familiar scene in his personal life, revealing that the relentless chant had driven him to plead, however facetiously, that the numbers 6 and 7 be 'banned forever.'\n\nFor those blissfully unaware, the 'six seven' trend has been an auditory plague driving parents and teachers to distraction across the United States. Its origin is just as baffling as its staying power, seemingly bubbling up from rapper Skrilla's tune, Doot Doot (6 7), where the simple numbers are repeated several times.\n\nWhile the meme's meaning is largely nonsense to the children chanting it, the original song's lyrics have been linked to a reference about a six-foot-seven-inches tall basketball player, or possibly 67th Street in Chicago.\n\nWhether it refers to the height of a basketball player or an obscure street in Chicago, the context is irrelevant to the young minds who have adopted it as a meaningless, universal war cry.\n\nThe incident that sparked the Vice President's public exasperation occurred at church, transforming a moment of solemnity into an impromptu family drama.\n\nJD Vance's Viral Parent Problem\n\nIn a widely shared post, Vance recounted the scene with his middle child, Vivek: 'Yesterday at church, the Bible readings started on page 66-67 of the missal, and my 5-year-old went absolutely nuts repeating 'six seven' like 10 times,' he wrote.\n\nThe post was framed as a classic 'dad joke,' an exhausted parent's over-the-top plea for mercy. He followed the anecdote by stating, 'And now I think we need to make this narrow exception to the First Amendment and ban these numbers forever.'\n\nFor millions of parents across the country, the frustration was instantly relatable. The widespread annoyance has even led to bizarre countermeasures, with schools implementing rules to penalise students who utter the number in class, and restaurants like In-N-Out Burger removing '67' from their ordering systems after being swamped by teenagers.\n\nThe comment section quickly filled with solidarity, proving that the 'six seven' trend is one of the few issues capable of transcending America's fierce political divide. One mother commiserated, 'Someone on a podcast said '6, 7 year' and it activated my 12-year-old like he was a sleeper agent. I agree. Ban it. For the good of us all.' A second user cheered the moment of bipartisan unity, saying the issue 'should unite Republicans and Democrats.'\n\nHowever, for a high-ranking official like the Vice President of the United States, no public comment—no matter how transparently a joke—can escape the gravity of politics.\n\nWhy JD Vance's Joke Sparked a Free Speech Row\n\nDespite the clear comedic intent, the post immediately drew a fierce backlash from commentators who deemed the reference to the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, inappropriate coming from the nation's second-highest office.\n\nThe criticism centred not on the trend itself, but on the perceived 'unseriousness' of the man occupying the Vice Presidency.\n\n'I know it's a joke, but the Vice President of the United States advocating for the restriction of freedom of speech is pretty inappropriate,' protested one user on the platform. Another scoffed at the perceived absurdity of the Vice President's focus: 'Are you hearing yourself? You're gonna try to ban a NUMBER because kids are saying it as a joke?'\n\nThe furore quickly expanded beyond a simple disagreement over humour and into a broader critique of the current administration's tone. A fifth user huffed, 'The most unserious administration of all time. Two dudes obsessed with trying to be funny on Twitter while completely f------ up the country. Beyond laughable,' referencing both Vance and President Donald Trump.\n\nThe pile-on continued with personal attacks, as another critic lamented the politician's attempt to connect with the public: 'J.D. tries to be relatable again, like when he told us Americans hated turkey. I've heard how you talk about your children; you sound like a terrible father.'\n\nUltimately, the viral spat serves as a striking microcosm of modern American politics: a trivial piece of pop culture can, in a heartbeat, be weaponised into a debate over constitutional rights, competence, and fitness for high office.\n\nEven a simple, exhausted dad joke about page numbers in a missal is enough to remind Vice President Vance that in the world of high politics, there is simply no such thing as being 'just like every other parent.'\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"VP JD Vance joked about banning the 'six seven' meme after his son's church meltdown.

Former Obama Counsel Who Communicated With Jeffrey Epstein The Most","text":"Kathy Ruemmler was a lawyer at the centre of newly released Jeffrey Epstein material, appearing as one of the most frequent non-family correspondents in the financier's email cache.\n\nOnce Former President Barack Obama's White House counsel and now the general counsel at Goldman Sachs, Ruemmler's exchanges with Epstein, spanning career advice, legal questions and personal notes, have prompted fresh scrutiny after House Democrats and court filings put hundreds of messages and a privilege log into the public record.\n\nA High-Profile Lawyer Appears Repeatedly in the Epstein Files\n\nRuemmler, formally Kathryn H. Ruemmler, served as White House Counsel from 2011 until 2014 and later became a senior partner at Latham & Watkins before joining Goldman Sachs in 2020, where she is currently listed as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel.\n\nEmails produced by the estate and selectively released by House Democrats show a recurring correspondence between Ruemmler and Epstein from 2014 through mid-2019.\n\nSome messages are conversational: career and apartment questions, political observations, while others, according to a court privilege log filed by the executors of Epstein's estate, are described as legal in nature.\n\nVictims' lawyers and oversight investigators have pointed to those descriptions in the privilege log as evidence that Ruemmler's role may have extended beyond social acquaintance. The estate, however, has asserted attorney–client privilege over 277 messages between Ruemmler and Epstein, a claim now central to litigation between Epstein accusers and the estate's executors.\n\nWhat The Documents Actually Show\n\nThe tranche of documents released to Congress included thousands of pages; the House Oversight packet that Democrats made public contains email threads and metadata showing Ruemmler in repeated contact with Epstein and with lawyers retained by him.\n\nSome released messages show Ruemmler seeking Epstein's advice about job offers and housing; others evidence political commentary, including criticism of Donald Trump.\n\nCrucially, the public versions of the court privilege log: a legal inventory that lists documents the estate contends are protected from disclosure, describe dozens of entries as 'attorney–client communications' concerning sexual-assault claims or litigation strategy.\n\nThe log was filed in a civil case brought by several alleged victims against Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, the estate's co-executors, who are accused in separate litigation of facilitating Epstein's operations. The log itself remains a contested artefact: privilege logs do not reveal full content and are sometimes redacted to shield victim identities, which complicates outside assessment.\n\nGoldman Sachs has told reporters that Ruemmler regrets any association with Epstein and that her professional relationship with him occurred while she was at Latham & Watkins, before she joined the bank. Ruemmler's office has not provided further public detail about whether she acted in a formal attorney capacity for Epstein in private practice.\n\nPrivilege, Privacy And Public Interest\n\nThe privilege claim sits at the intersection of two competing legal interests: victims' advocates' demand for transparency into Epstein's network and the estate's assertion of confidentiality rights. Plaintiffs say the privilege log's descriptions make clear the messages bear on litigated allegations against Epstein; the estate says turning the messages over would violate legitimate confidentiality protections.\n\nThe broader legal context has shifted in recent months. Congress passed, and the President signed, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a law that mandated release of unclassified Department of Justice materials related to Epstein; federal judges have authorised unsealing portions of grand jury transcripts and investigative files.\n\nThose movements increase pressure on courts to resolve privilege disputes and on the estate to produce documents. Still, judges have cautioned about protecting victim identities and redacting irrelevant personal data.\n\nBeyond the privilege questions, some documents previously circulate that linked Ruemmler to a draft of Epstein's will, she was at one point listed as an alternate executor in earlier drafts, though that status was later changed. Such administrative ties, opponents say, deepen the public interest in full disclosure; defenders emphasise routine legal correspondence and social contact among lawyers and wealthy clients.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Newly released emails and a 277-message privilege log show Kathryn 'Kathy' Ruemmler — former White House counsel and Goldman Sachs general counsel — exchanged repeatedly with Jeffrey Epstein.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/who-kathy-ruemmler-former-obama-counsel-who-communicated-jeffrey-epstein-most-3792492","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4636821/kathy-ruemmler.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 13:22:12","author":"House Democrats","authors":["House Democrats"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":386943994,"title":"Pedro Pascal on Gaza and his new film: 'I want to live on the right side of history'","text":"Pedro Pascal is now at the height of his career, both figuratively and literally. In this case, the setting is a stylish rooftop club atop the Martinez, one of the most luxurious and meticulously designed hotels along the Cannes promenade. Despite the glamorous backdrop and sweeping views, Pascal does not forget where he came from. He grew up in a family of refugees who moved from country to country. His parents fled Augusto Pinochet’s military dictatorship in Chile in the 1970s, he says. They were granted asylum in Denmark and later moved to the United States, first to Texas and then to California. Asked how this upbringing as a migrant shaped him, Pascal says it defined him completely. He considers himself fortunate to have grown up and been educated in the United States and cannot imagine what would have happened had the family stayed in Chile. He was an infant when they arrived, but the home he grew up in “felt fully Chilean.” When he was eight, his parents received a pardon that allowed them to visit Chile again and reunite with their extended families. “My values come directly from my parents,” he says, adding that their worldview played a decisive role in who he eventually became. On U.S. immigration policy under President Donald Trump, Pascal says only that he wants people to be safe and that he wants to live “on the right side of history.” Given his background, it is unsurprising that Pascal has developed a strong liberal and progressive sensibility, especially around migrant and refugee rights. He is an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ rights and civil rights more broadly and has criticized racism, homophobia and attempts to restrict abortion. On Instagram, he has repeatedly voiced support for Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Pascal has also spoken publicly about the war in Gaza. In December 2023, he called for a ceasefire and for supporting Doctors Without Borders. In 2025, he urged aid for women and children in Gaza suffering from hunger and criticized Hollywood’s silence on Israel’s actions. In January, he is set to co-host a fundraising event in Los Angeles with model Bella Hadid for Palestinians and Sudanese civilians. Notably, he did not join fellow actors Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone in signing an open letter calling for a boycott of Israeli filmmakers, festivals and cultural institutions. Pascal is known for expressing his views openly. Asked whether he fears the consequences, he acknowledges the risk but says, “Fear is how those who want to silence us win.” Efforts to censor creators are increasing, he argues, and his message to artists is to keep telling stories, keep expressing themselves and push back. “Do not let them win,” he says. In 2024, Pascal appeared in Gladiator II as General Marcus Acacius. Then came 2025, a major year for the actor, who turned 50 in April. He appeared frequently on screens, including in commercials, and in the media, including a memorable Vanity Fair cover. The death of his character early in the second season of the post-apocalyptic series The Last of Us drew significant attention. At the Cannes Film Festival, an Australian journalist, known for her blunt questions, reignited discussion of the plot twist during a press conference, prompting murmurs and accusations of spoilers even though the information was no longer secret. Three of Pascal’s films were released in 2025. In The Fantastic Four: First Steps, a Marvel superhero film, he played Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, the genius leader of the Fantastic Four. Pascal described the character as someone possessing “the wisdom of an octopus.” The film grossed $500 million and introduced him to wider audiences. He also proved wrong the comic-book fans who objected to his casting and called him too old or unsuitable. His second film, Materialists, a romantic-comedy love triangle, performed well at the box office and co-starred Dakota Johnson and Chris Evans. The third was Eddington, directed by Ari Aster, the acclaimed filmmaker behind Hereditary, Midsommar and Beau Is Afraid. The film screened in the main competition at Cannes and vied for the Palme d’Or. Despite its star-studded cast — including Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Austin Butler and Luke Grimes — and Aster’s cult reputation, the film flopped at the box office. In Israel, it will not receive a theatrical release but will screen in cinematheques. The first local screening took place this week at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque as part of Utopia Festival 2025, with another set for December 30. The story unfolds in the fictional town of Eddington, New Mexico, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Phoenix plays the town sheriff, who refuses to wear a mask and will not enforce the mayor’s mask mandate. Pascal plays the mayor, with whom the sheriff has a long-standing rivalry. As local elections approach, the sheriff challenges him. The killing of George Floyd soon ignited youth-led protests against racism and police violence. The sheriff’s son becomes an activist, driven in part by a romantic connection, while the sheriff’s wife, played by Stone, is drawn into conspiracy theories. The town turns against the sheriff. Chaos escalates through social media, and tensions rise further over plans to build a massive data center in the area. Asked how he experienced the COVID-19 period, Pascal says he and Joaquin Phoenix were likely “the only two people not affected psychologically.” What he remembers most, he explains, is the collective yet deeply personal nature of the experience. Before COVID, he assumed that, as a middle-aged man, his worldview was fixed and his future predictable. The pandemic disabused him of that notion. He now feels his perspective has loosened, that immediate and tangible things matter more to him than “the big world out there.” Eddington tackles a wide range of contemporary anxieties, from Bitcoin and artificial intelligence to conspiracy theories and cults. It also touches on QAnon, a conspiracy theory that circulated widely among far-right circles in the United States and claimed that a shadowy “deep state” conspired against Donald Trump, that there was a secret child-trafficking ring and that the coronavirus was a hoax engineered by governments. Asked what he thinks of such theories, Pascal says they reflect a deep human vulnerability: trauma, yearning and emotional fragility create openings for conspiratorial thinking. For some, he suggests, it is easier to believe a grand conspiracy than to confront personal pain. He considers this an insightful observation about how individual experiences can be exploited. On how closely Eddington mirrors the realities of contemporary America, Pascal says the film is transparent, revealing and honest. Director Ari Aster, he argues, built a narrative filled with large ideas and uncomfortable truths, but grounded them in intimate, human motivations. “We are still creatures who breathe and feel and look for comfort,” he says, even as tech giants erode stable notions of what it means to be human. Straying from or following the path are both human impulses, he adds, and in that sense, the film ultimately offers hope. To Pascal, Eddington is an “ambitious and relevant story” that reflects deep societal fears while also giving voice to shared human experiences. One of the most memorable moments in the film is the slap scene between him and Phoenix, simultaneously absurd and violent. Pascal recalls the shoot fondly. Although the two had never met before Eddington, the chemistry felt immediate. He hesitated to strike one of his favorite actors, but Phoenix insisted on a real slap. Pascal relented and delivered it without special effects. The moment, he says, laughing, came from wanting to give Phoenix what he needed for the scene. Next year, Pascal will return as the Mandalorian in The Mandalorian & Grogu, a film within the Star Wars franchise. The path to this point has been long and difficult. In his youth, he says, he endured bullying for being “the weird, sensitive kid” obsessed with movies, theater and art. After graduating from an arts school, he performed in theater and made guest appearances on shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Law & Order, but a breakthrough did not come. At 29, he felt his career was over and described those years as a time when “everyone took care of me.” He says he was surrounded by “guardian angels,” including Greta, his pitbull mix, who stayed with him through years of loneliness and financial struggle in Brooklyn. Greta died while he was filming Game of Thrones, the show that finally brought him recognition. He often thinks about the contrast between the poverty of those early years and the comfortable life she would have had with him today. Twenty years after that period of stagnation, 2025 has become the year of “Pedro Pascal is everywhere.” The term Pedro Pascal fatigue has even circulated online, suggesting he is overexposed. But critics of this idea overlook a key strength: Pascal’s ability to take on major roles without becoming trapped by any one character. His portrayal of Oberyn Martell in season four of Game of Thrones, a flamboyant knight whose nights in King’s Landing brothels became fan favorites, did not hinder his credibility in his next major role as DEA agent Javier Peña in Narcos. That performance showcased his ability to bring intensity to a grounded, real-life figure rather than a mythic hero. If Narcos was a major success, The Last of Us is unquestionably the series that cemented his place in popular culture. Pascal plays Joel Miller, a grieving father navigating a dystopian America who slowly rediscovers purpose as he protects Ellie, a teenage girl who may hold the key to humanity’s survival. Joel’s death in the second episode of season two stunned viewers unfamiliar with the game the series is based on. Some were so devastated they stopped watching altogether, prompting producers to clarify that Joel would continue appearing in flashbacks. The emotional impact affirmed Pascal’s central role in the show’s success. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Pascal said he initially “denied Joel’s death” and described his final shooting day as deeply emotional. Arriving on set in full makeup and prosthetics “ruined the mood,” he says, because everyone immediately recognized the gravity of the moment. The show had a profound impact on him and marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Pascal’s refusal to share details about his romantic life at age 50 has only fueled speculation about his sexuality. His bold fashion choices earned him the unofficial title of “the internet’s daddy” in 2023, prompted by a fatherly-inspired look at a film premiere. Reports have linked him to LGBTQ nightlife, and his social media presence has included rainbow-themed posts. He played a gay cowboy in Pedro Almodóvar’s 2023 short film Strange Way of Life, portraying the lover of Ethan Hawke. Pascal says Almodóvar’s work opened a door to an intoxicating world of storytelling, color, culture, rebellion and desire. His connection to the LGBTQ community also stems from his close and supportive relationship with his sister, Lux Pascal, who came out as a transgender woman in 2021. Pascal has called her one of the strongest people he knows and said, “I need her more than she needs me.” Lux has said he played a crucial role in her transition and was one of the first to help shape her gender identity. Earlier this year, Pascal made headlines after criticizing author J.K. Rowling, known for her comments about transgender people. He dismissed her arguments around the legal definition of “woman” as “nonsense” and “villainous.” His remarks drew backlash from conservative audiences. Turning 50 has prompted Pascal to reflect on his life. He told Vanity Fair that the milestone feels more vulnerable than his forties. Asked if he wants children, he said he once imagined taking his kids to the movies as his parents took him, and would welcome “a shortcut” to the stage where a compelling child stands before him as his own, ready to share those experiences.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/culture/article/hy11jf4pz11e","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/30/HkQWHstWZx/HkQWHstWZx_0_0_3000_1994_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 13:06:06","author":"Amir Kaminer","authors":["Amir Kaminer"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.003},{"id":386944074,"title":"'They Have to Go Back … It's a Shame': Trump Blasts Student Visa Rules as Golden Visa Goes Live","text":"US President Donald Trump has aimed at long-established student visa regulations, calling it a 'shame' that foreign graduates, including those from India and China, have to exit the United States upon graduation.\n\nThe remark was made when he formally announced the Trump Gold Card visa, an upscale immigration programme advertised as a quick-track to becoming a US resident and, eventually, a citizen.\n\nDuring a White House roundtable on Wednesday, Trump noted that foreign students, most of whom attend prestigious American universities, are often unsure whether they can remain and work in America after graduation.\n\n'You graduate from college, and you have to go back to India, they have to go back to China, they have to go back to France. They have to go back to wherever they came from. Very hard to stay. It's a shame,' he said.\n\nThe criticism reflects a broader dismay among certain employers and policy-makers about the complexity and constraints of current visa programmes, such as the H-1B and green cards, which have long shaped the capacity of foreign graduates to remain in the US labour force.\n\nTrump's Gold Card: A New Immigration Path\n\nThe Trump Gold Card visa programme officially commenced this week, and its official application portal was launched to provide potential applicants with an easy path to US residency.\n\nThe new regime requires applicants to pay a processing fee of $15,000 (approx. £11,200), after which they must contribute $1 million (approx. £750,000) to the US government if they are successful, as outlined in the laws governing the programme's implementation. Administration officials have defined the visa as a green card, but much better, which will bring economic benefits to the United States and ensure residency for high-achieving foreigners.\n\nThe Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, who stood alongside Trump at the launch, pointed out that corporations would also have access to the Gold Card at a fee of $2 million (approx. £1.5 million) as a sponsor to retain top talent worldwide. He stressed that the programme would appeal to the best people by offering greater certainty than traditional pathways.\n\nEffects on Indian and Chinese Graduates\n\nInternational students from India, China, and France have most echoed the challenges international students face in remaining in the US after graduation. The comment by Trump that these students must go back to their place of origin resonates with current discussions around how the US immigration policy treats foreign talent.\n\nTrump indicated that major US employers have identified the visa system's restrictions as an obstacle to retaining highly qualified graduates. He cited conversations with leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook, saying: 'They can't hire people from the best colleges because you don't know whether or not you can keep the person.'\n\nThe Gold Card is specifically targeted at this problem, as it is said to offer employers and individuals a more certain path to residency. According to officials, the new programme will enable companies to access top schools such as Wharton, Harvard, MIT, and the Stern School of Business at New York University.\n\nLegal Experts Weigh In\n\nSome legal experts have identified potential legal and systemic hurdles, despite the Gold Card visa promising high financial investment and streamlined processing. Critics claim that the programme may be subject to judicial review because it uses executive action that may override the legislative channel, which controls immigration and citizenship policies.\n\nThe issues of concern include how the Gold Card will interact with existing visa categories and whether it will result in unequal treatment of rich applicants versus those who currently use other, more traditional immigration options based on employment or family relationships. Law experts caution that there may be legal disputes over the new arrangement, which could put the applicants' investments or future status at risk.\n\nBroader Immigration Debate\n\nTrump's remarks on student returns and the introduction of the Gold Card take on added significance in the broader US debate about the efficiency and fairness of the US immigration system.

According to satellite data, the ship attempted to mask its location by transmitting false coordinates.\n\nMaduro, who did not initially comment on the operation, addressed it on Thursday during a public event, calling the seizure \"a criminal and illegal act.\" He described it as a \"military assault, kidnapping and robbery, like Caribbean pirates, against a private commercial vessel.\" He said the ship was intercepted \"far north of Trinidad and Tobago, near the Grenadines, heading into the Atlantic,\" not in Venezuelan waters.\n\nMaduro claimed the whereabouts of the crew were unknown. \"The crew of that ship ... are kidnapped, they are disappeared, nobody knows where they are,\" he said. He accused Washington of stealing Venezuelan resources, alleging the operation was carried out \"to steal Venezuela's oil, asphalt and gas.\"\n\nHe added that he had ordered Venezuelan institutions to pursue legal and diplomatic action and to take measures to \"protect all vessels\" transporting the country's crude.\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Ministry issued a separate statement on Wednesday calling the seizure \"a blatant robbery\" and \"an act of international piracy.\" The government argued the action reflects a broader U.S. effort to seize Venezuelan energy assets, citing the loss of control over Citgo as part of what it described as a \"deliberate plan of dispossession.\"\n\nThe ministry said it would pursue the case through \"all available international mechanisms\" and called on supporters to \"remain firm in defense of the homeland.\"\n\nThe seizure comes amid intensified U.S. military operations in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific targeting vessels alleged to be involved in drug trafficking. President Donald Trump confirmed the seizure Wednesday and later said the U.S. intends to take control of the oil aboard the tanker, pending legal procedures.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday the president does not view the action as a step toward broader conflict. \"Prolonged war is definitely not something this president is interested in,\" she said. \"He wants peace.

Then you notice that their Sunday Arts & Style section carried a sprawling four-page spread with 10 color photographs on the glorious Rosie O’Donnell and her passionate loathing of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Post summarized the puff piece on X: “Donald Trump’s first administration took an emotional toll on Rosie O’Donnell. She didn’t think she could endure a second term. This time, O’Donnell had a plan: she moved to Ireland.”\n\nSo let’s give Rosie credit for carrying out the threat to leave America, unlike many exquisitely sensitive celebrities.\n\n“She’s a sensitive soul, a giant exposed nerve who has posed, successfully, for most of her life and career as a brassy Long Island toughie,” gushed Post arts reporter Geoff Edgers. The first Trump term “took an emotional toll on the die-hard liberal, even as she tweeted and marched and spit invective against the president every chance she got.”\n\nSo at least we get the term “die-hard liberal,” and the accurate note on “invective.” But these only make her more lovable to the customers of The Washington Post.\n\nShe moved to Ireland for her child: “O’Donnell, 63, worried about life under an administration that has been hostile to gay rights and gender-nonconforming people in general; her youngest, 12-year-old Clay, is nonbinary.” It used to be “her daughter Dakota.” Then Edgers dropped a pile of obligatory “they/their” terms on Clay.\n\nEdgers pitched O’Donnell vs. Trump as two “vivid triborough loudmouths” who could deliver “late-show bluster.” He quoted Rosie attacking Trump’s personal life: “Left the first wife, had an affair; left the second wife, had an affair. Had kids both times, but he’s the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America.”\n\nThe Post laid out a similarity here but didn’t make it direct: Rosie left the first wife after four adopted kids. Rosie left the second wife after adopting one more. The second wife later committed suicide. That’s not mentioned in this huge article.\n\nEdgers isn’t going to mock Rosie’s moral compass. No, her problem is she cares too much. We’re told, “This impulse to help—anyone, anywhere, at whatever cost—is a constant source of frustration for her friends.”\n\nEven now, Trump enjoys mocking Rosie, and that’s somehow painted as weird while it’s not weird in reverse. When the Irish prime minister came to the White House, Trump mocked Rosie in response to a question from the Real America’s Voice network.\n\nEdgers turned dramatic: “Suddenly, what had once seemed like a classic showbiz rivalry—a Joan Crawford-Bette Davis slap fight rebooted for the reality TV era—was beginning to feel more ominous than absurd.”\n\nOminous? Like Trump was going to send a goon squad to rough her up? Leftists love to dish it out against Trump, but they can’t seem to take it.\n\nThe Post story is accompanied by a Rosie portrait of Trump where she scrawled the words “Felon, Crook, Creep, Liar, Loser, Done.” But that’s not ominous?\n\nOf course, the Post wouldn’t use words that would be upsetting about Rosie’s strange views, like “9/11 conspiracy theorist.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Geoff Edgers has traveled to Ireland for a puff piece. In 2020, he offered the same routine, a huge Sunday tribute to leftist singer Sinead O’Connor, beloved for tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II on “Saturday Night Live.” She was “one of contemporary music’s greatest and most original artists.”\n\nThese women are very much alike—”sensitive artists” at war with everyone The Washington Post hates.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Zelenskyy wants Ukrainians to vote in referendum The idea reflects the Trump administration’s increasing impatience to secure a deal by year-end. According to multiple reports, Donald Trump has informally set a “Christmas deadline” for Ukraine to accept the broad contours of a proposal that Kyiv has so far viewed as an effective territorial concession to Russia.\nThis push comes amid what aides describe as Trump’s growing frustration with the lack of progress. Advisers say he is “sick of meetings just for the sake of meetings”, a sentiment that explains why the administration is pressing Kyiv harder now.\nA peace plan built around ceding territory Zelenskyy has been unusually direct in outlining what he says Washington is demanding. According to him, the US plan would require Ukraine to withdraw forces from the remaining parts of Donetsk and Luhansk that Kyiv still controls, a move that would de facto formalise Russia’s territorial gains and erode Ukraine’s leverage.\nIn return, the US says it will establish a “free trade” or “free economic zone” in these territories, ostensibly as part of a vision to rebuild eastern Ukraine and stimulate cross-border commercial activity.\nEarlier the Washington had floated the idea of Kyiv outright handing over these territories to Russia to unlock negotiations, according to multiple reports. The current proposal attempts a middle ground but one that still centres on Ukrainian withdrawal.\nQuick Reads View All Cabinet approves SHANTI Bill, paves way for private participation in India’s nuclear sector Is Trump moving to allow recreational use of marijuana? Reports spark buzz about easing curbs Kyiv, however, views the latest suggestion as merely a reframed version of the same problem: a settlement that forces Ukraine to surrender strategic land while rewarding Moscow’s military advances. Zelenskyy reiterated that any deal must offer credible security guarantees and cannot legitimise Russian occupation.\nA free economic zone: Stabiliser or strategic gamble? Economically, proponents argue that Donbas, historically industrial, resource-rich and home to pre-war manufacturing clusters could benefit from an internationally backed economic corridor. Supporters inside the US administration believe that trade incentives could “cool down” the conflict environment and create conditions under which Moscow might accept a freeze.\nHowever, analysts warn that such zones do not magically neutralise geopolitical conflicts. Similar experiments in contested regions have rarely succeeded without pre-existing security guarantees. In this case, Russian forces remain deeply entrenched, and Moscow has shown little interest in ceding control or allowing Western-administered economic arrangements near its lines.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD For Ukraine, the risk is stark: withdrawing troops may effectively open the door for Russian advances into the very areas designated for the proposed economic zone, rendering the entire plan unworkable. The US appears to be assuming that Moscow would refrain from pushing further, though the Kremlin has made no such commitments publicly.\nKyiv’s dilemma: Pressure from Washington, threats from Moscow Zelenskyy faces immense internal pressure. Any concession involving territorial withdrawal is politically radioactive. National sentiment strongly opposes ceding land and Kyiv’s parliament has repeatedly rejected proposals that legitimise Russian control. Ukrainian officials told CNN and Al Jazeera that Kyiv cannot accept an arrangement in which its military steps back while Russia faces no reciprocal obligations.\nMeanwhile, US officials insist they are seeking a “realistic” pathway to ceasefire. Trump’s team argues that the war has reached a stalemate and that Ukraine must make hard choices before the conflict further depletes its economy and manpower.\nYet, critics note that the US proposal appears to treat Donbas as a negotiable economic project rather than a battleground central to Ukrainian sovereignty. The assumption that a “free trade zone” could resolve a war driven by identity, security and power not merely economics has been met with scepticism across European capitals.\nDoes Washington’s economic gambit have any real chance? Ultimately, the question is whether an economic incentive can substitute for a military or diplomatic solution. Most analysts say no. Without Russian buy-in, robust security guarantees, and a political framework that respects Ukrainian sovereignty, any free economic zone risks becoming an empty construct.\nFor now, the proposal reflects Washington’s urgency more than a workable peace plan. Whether Kyiv bends under US pressure or whether Trump adjusts his expectations will shape the next critical weeks of the war.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump ‘frustrated’ with Kyiv, Moscow over talks on war US President Donald Trump is “extremely frustrated” with Russia and Ukraine, his spokeswoman said on Thursday, as Kyiv said Washington was still pushing it to make major territorial concessions as part of its plan to end the nearly four-year war.\n“The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war,” Karoline Leavitt told reporters. “He doesn’t want any more talk. He wants action. He wants this war to come to an end.\"\nEarlier Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made remarks that appeared to show little had changed in Washington’s core position on how the conflict should end since it sent a 28-point plan to Kyiv and Moscow last month that heavily favoured Russia.\nAs Christmas approaches, the key question remains: does Trump truly believe Donbas can be transformed into a free-trade bridge to peace or is this another diplomatic dead end?\nWith inputs from agencies","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/does-trump-really-think-making-donbas-a-free-trade-zone-will-end-the-russia-ukraine-war-13959198.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/12/Representational-Image-2025-12-12T175907.481-2025-12-11581877593ba658219220f805ffc4a4.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 12:32:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":386945156,"title":"Akande Compares Seyi Tinubu&#039;s Security To Trump&#039;s Son, Says &#039;Presidential System Is The","text":"Laolu Akande, former Presidential aide, has reignited debate on Nigeria’s governance structure and security priorities, drawing a striking comparison between the security detail assigned to President Bola Tinubu’s son, Seyi, and that of Barron, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, Akande expanded the conversation beyond the immediate controversy to examine the broader excesses enabled by Nigeria’s presidential system of government, the capacity of civil defence operatives, and the challenges of security reform.\n\nSpeaking at the Wole Soyinka Investigative Journalism Awards, which held earlier in the week, the Nobel Laureate had lamented the huge security around Tinubu’s son.\n\nThe issue had trended, particularly online, but there was no formal response from the Presidency.\n\n Why Bayelsa Deputy Governor’s Death Is Painful – Abiodun How 9 UniJos students died in auto crash\n\nSpeaking when he appeared on Channels Television, Akande said, “I don’t think Prof. Soyinka was saying Seyi should not be protected. He was saying we must do it moderately. But this is part of the excesses of the presidential system. And it’s not peculiar to Nigeria,”\n\nHe cited reports that Barron Trump had nearly 30 Secret Service agents securing him while attending school in New York, underscoring how even the American presidential system involves significant protection details — but within a more functional governance framework.\n\nHe argued that Nigeria must reconsider and ultimately abandon the presidential system altogether.\n\n“This is why we need to terminate the presidential system. A presidential system is too expensive. It allows the president to be cocooned in the Villa. That system is not useful for us. This is one example. We don’t have the luxury for all of these excesses,” he stated.\n\nAkande also spoke on the recent policy by the federal government to ban police officers from providing VIP escort duties, an initiative intended to redirect police personnel toward community policing efforts.\n\nWhile supportive of the principle, he warned that the policy cannot succeed in isolation.\n\n“So that policy cannot stand alone. It must include the fact that—what are we doing to mobilise those police people? Because many of them get some kind of welfare when they do those VIP, VVIP jobs. They get some additional welfare beyond their regular pay,” he explained.\n\nHe noted that redeploying officers back to communities, especially in states grappling with serious security challenges, is a positive step but cautioned that the transition may take longer than anticipated due to logistical and welfare-related factors.\n\n“The idea is good for community security, but I don’t think it’s going to happen as quickly as many expect. To the extent that it can go on, that will seem to be what is right,” Akande said.\n\n“The other question is the readiness of the civil defence to take over that responsibility. These are quite interesting conversations.”\n\nAkande agreed with Nobel laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka’s criticism of the large security convoy accompanying Seyi Tinubu, asserting that the president’s directive on reducing security excesses should apply universally — including to members of the First Family.\n\nOn the broader issue of policing and insecurity, Akande stressed that while refocusing officers on community safety is essential, it requires far more than policy declarations.\n\n“Yes, we should have the police secure the community, but it will require a lot more.”","url":"https://dailytrust.com/akande-compares-seyi-tinubus-security-to-trumps-son-says-presidential-system-is-the-problem","image":"https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Akande-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 12:23:15","author":"Daily Trust","authors":["Daily Trust"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":386945748,"title":"Sacred Ground or Enforcement Zone? ICE Raids Test Church Community in Charlotte","text":"CHARLOTTE, N.C. – During a Saturday service project at Casa de Dios church, a normal day of cooking, clearing the woods, and children playing soccer was shattered when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents moved in unexpectedly. As terrified congregants fled into the trees or hid inside, agents detained an El Salvadoran church member, deporting him ten days later and leaving behind his wife and adult children.\n\n\"It was a normal day,\" recalled Pastor Victor Ramirez. \"We heard the news about ICE, but we said, 'this is a safe place.' We were not doing anything; we are not criminals.\"\n\nThe November incident was part of a broader enforcement sweep dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web,\" which has ignited a firestorm in Charlotte's vibrant immigrant community and raised a profound crisis for faith leaders: Can the government freely pursue immigration enforcement within the walls of a church?\n\nThe operation unfolded after a significant policy change. In January, the White House rescinded longstanding \"sensitive locations\" guidelines that had traditionally directed ICE to avoid enforcement at places like churches, schools, and hospitals.\n\nThis policy shift has empowered a wave of intensified enforcement actions in cities with large immigrant populations. While operations like Charlotte's are locally named, they reflect a concerted national strategy. ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. have risen, and arrests at or near sensitive locations, once rare, have become a contentious focal point of fear and legal challenges from advocacy groups.\n\nFederal agents launched Operation Charlotte's Web in November, aiming to target possible criminals in a metro area home to over 300,000 foreign-born residents. Officials reported apprehending upwards of 370 people.\n\n\"If we have known murderers and drug dealers, and really bad people – we want to get them out,\" said President Donald Trump during a recent press conference.\n\nHowever, local pastors and attorneys describe the results as a \"shock and awe\" campaign that has spread fear far beyond its intended targets.\n\nFor Pastor Ramirez, the arrest at his church felt like a violation. It happened after a during a service project after a Saturday service, and the man detained and deported shared the message that day. \n\n\"I understand that ICE has to find criminals, I understand and agree with that,\" the pastor said, standing outside Casa de Dios. \"He's not a criminal. This is church.\"\n\nThe impact has rippled far beyond a single arrest. Faith leaders report aggressive tactics that have frightened entire congregations. Many immigrant churches stopped holding services for weeks. According to local reports, some 30,000 children stayed home from school in the wake of the operations.\n\nThe dilemma is acutely felt by pastors like Dan Titan of Casa Viva Church on Charlotte's east side, who leads a congregation of about a thousand, mostly Latino immigrants.\n\n\"Yeah, I can't lie. There are people without some papers, of course,\" Pastor Titan acknowledged. \"We are the church. We are the body of Christ. We are Christian, and we need to obey the law. We are not against the law. But within there's different ways to do the law, you know.\"\n\nHe went on to confirm the pervasive fear: \"They were scared. That's for sure… There's still people just in their homes.\"\n\nConfrontations like these are shifting from sanctuaries and public spaces into the courtroom. Attorney Anna Cushman of Tedesco Legal, who works with detainees, argues that in church-site detentions, the operations threaten a fundamental right.\n\n\"I first think about the Constitution, protecting the free exercise of religion,\" Cushman said. \"There's not an exception there that says you get to exercise your religion, so long as you don't get in the way of immigration enforcement. There is no exception there.\"\n\nFor Cushman, a Christian, the issue is also a matter of faith. \"What's going on is that we are not welcoming the stranger. We are not treating the least of these as if they are Jesus,\" she said. \"We are called to this kind of radical hospitality.\"\n\nAs the operation took root, a coordinated network of citizens sprang up in opposition. Non-profits, local churches, and neighbors organized protests, blew whistles to warn of approaching agents, and handed out \"Know Your Rights\" flyers. Volunteers delivered food to families too afraid to leave their homes.\n\n\"We don't need ICE coming into Charlotte disrupting our city, creating fear in our city and work space,\" said Niecy Brown of the North Carolina AFL-CIO at a press briefing.\n\nCharlotte City Council Member-elect JD Mazuera Arias held a similar disposition: \"This is not about public safety. It is not about finding criminals. It's about fear, quotas, and it's about control.\"\n\nThe rallying cry has been organized around a central message: that loving your neighbor isn't just the right thing to do—it's holy.\n\nICE declined CBN News' request for an interview. In a statement, the agency said its actions in Charlotte were \"lawful and targeted threats to public safety.\"\n\nAs the legal and political battles continue, the human and spiritual cost remains forefront for leaders like Pastor Ramirez. In a final plea to Washington, he asked for compassion.\n\n\"We pray for {President Trump},\" Ramirez said. \"All we ask for is some mercy because people who attend our church… they're not criminals. We serve a purpose – a purpose of the Lord. That's why we are here.\"\n\nThe nation is left to navigate the intersection of faith, law, and community, where the principle of sanctuary now hinges on judicial interpretation and political will.","url":"https://cbn.com/news/politics/sacred-ground-or-enforcement-zone-ice-raids-test-church-community-charlotte","image":"/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/bca1420icechurchcharlotte02_hdv.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 11:31:24","author":"Brody Carter","authors":["Brody Carter"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":386950484,"title":"Victor Davis Hanson: Enough With the Fraud","text":"On this episode of “Victor Davis Hanson: In His Own Words,” Victor Davis Hanson and Sami Winc discuss the Democrats’ acceptance of fraud and today’s immigrants who refuse to accept our culture. Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of a segment from today’s edition of “Victor Davis Hanson: In His Own Words” from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to VDH’s own YouTube channel to watch past episodes. \n\nSami Winc: So, Victor, let’s turn to a very interesting article in the New York Post by Jonathan Ingram. I think his first sentence is something to the effect of “What Democrats offer us is fraud.” \n\nAnd, of course, he was talking about the Minnesota fraud first, but then he turned more importantly and a greater a part of the article to Obamacare and how it has been subject of a lot of fraud, either fake customers being created by insurers so that they could get $1,000 per enrollee, or false income statements by people who are trying to get insured and they want as much subsidies as they can possibly get. \n\nSo, there’s a lot of fraud in the Obamacare system, according to Ingram’s article. I was wondering your thoughts.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson: We’ve got to remember how the Democratic mind works. They create a federal program. They put people in it to run it. Those people have friends and contractor companies that do business with it. No one’s salary is dependent on whether they do a good or bad job.\n\nThey’re there for life. They got a GS salary. Maybe the contractors have to worry a little bit. And so, if they allow the contractors to cheat or whether they cheat, there’s no downside. When you look at the Democratic reaction to this, they’re not angry. \n\nAnd Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, I don’t know why he did it. It was so candid. He summed it up. He said: What’s the big deal? They buy cars and junk and stuff. \n\nIn other words, in their way of thinking, you just steal money from the government. Poor people get to have it. They buy nice stuff. It gets back and reinvested. It’s not the moral principle. Who cares about that? They don’t care.\n\nI think what’s happening to people in this regard for the Democrats is the anecdotes are starting to add up. All over the 340 million people in the United States, there’s been one too many Minnesota frauds, one too many stories about these thefts in Obamacare, one too many stories about semi-trucks killing people with fraudulent driver’s licenses. One too many stories about this person and that person raped, killed by someone that came across the southern border. One too many personal incidents. \n\nYou go into a store, and somebody’s ahead of you that does not speak the language of the country they wanted to come in. And they pull out like they’re playing cards. You know, it’s like, here’s a Jack, here’s a Queen, or here’s an EBD card. Ooh, it doesn’t work. Here’s another one. Another name, no problem. Here’s another one, another one, another one. \n\nAnd people are just saying it didn’t work, doesn’t work. And then they’re saying, “They’re gonna starve people.” And then we look at obesity and it’s epidemic in people on EBD cards. \n\nI just think they have something that nobody wants to buy anymore. \n\nAnd I think the whole welfare state is vestigial, ossified, calcified, that if somebody just kicked it, it would fall apart. Nobody wants it anymore. It has to have some free market substitute, incentives. \n\nWinc: Can I ask you one thing on that since we did bring up the Somali fraud case in Minnesota? One of your readers, as I was reading comments, said it’s not 1 or 2 billion we’re talking about. It’s eight billion. It’s unconfirmed, and I’m not sure, but it’s a lot.\n\nHanson: We don’t know how much it is, but people have speculated. I always try to use the conservative figure.\n\nWinc: Yeah, but I was wondering how you think this case … I mean, it seems completely unusual how at least the Right is willing to address this case as they are now saying the culture that came in here had flaws and it brought in flaws—i.e., thieving and stealing from government—that are destroying our society. You just really can’t handle it on broad scale. \n\nAnd the question is this, though: How do you think this is going to impact future assessments of immigration? Are people going to start considering the culture that’s brought in by each of the immigrants? \n\nHanson: Yes, that’s what [President Donald] Trump said. But Trump just puts it in the crudest possible terms, Third World, destroying our own society. \n\nWhen I wrote ”Mexifornia” 23 years ago, I said if a person comes from Mexico, they have voted with their feet in saying this doesn’t work. I don’t have enough liberty, freedom, protection, prosperity, security. So, I want to come to this gringo country. Different traditions. But once he gets here, everybody likes Cinco de Mayo, piñatas, tacos, mariachi movies. Enriches the culture.\n\nBut if he has the same attitude that he had in Mexico: Oh, I have a dog, I can’t feed it. I’m just gonna drive out and dump it in front of somebody’s house. Or, well, I have a washing machine, I’ll do what I do in Mexico. I’ll just drive out, throw it outside into an orchard. Or my kids are in gangs, no big deal. If they have that attitude, then immigration doesn’t work.\n\nSo, it requires two things. It’s called the brutal bargain.\n\nAnd that is the immigrant must disown his primary allegiance to his homeland, endure the taunts of being a traitor, prostate. \n\nAnd the host must say, welcome. You want to be an American? Here’s what you have to do: Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check. Sing to me “God Bless America.” Tell me all about the Gettysburg Address. Tell me the difference between Queens and Manhattan.\n\nI want to know something about the country. That’s what we have to do. And we don’t do that. And so, then we get shocked. Wow, these Somalis are … I mean, [Rep.] Ilhan Omar said Somaliland for Somalis only? My gosh, she’s an ethno-nationalist, isn’t she? But she doesn’t say that here. \n\nWe should just say to her, “If you’re going to be an ethno-nationalist in Somalia, and there’s credible allegations you married your brother for immigration fraud, why don’t you just go back and create a good Somalia so people don’t have to flee their beloved homeland? But don’t come over here and make millions of dollars by playing a victim and call the president every day a racist, racist Islamophobe.”\n\nIt’s just like on spec. While you’re the biggest antisemitic, I mean, she was almost censored by the House for her antisemitism.\n\nYes, there is no more support for it. And people are going to get more and more emboldened.

In 1915, he returned to India as Mahatma and inspired the “Third World” to decolonise itself.\nWithout the two World Wars (1914-18 and 1939-45), which crippled the West, given a chance, the Whites would have probably still been ruling their colonies. For these colonies served as their captive markets, and their natural and human resources funded their Industrial Revolution. According to renowned economist Utsa Patnaik, for example, Britain extracted $45 trillion (in today’s terms) worth of resources between 1765 and 1938 from India alone.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Although many still refuse to admit it, being politically incorrect, the societal undercurrents of this strong White bias against the Blacks, indeed all ‘coloured’ people including the Hispanics, continue in most Western countries. America is no exception. Look at how US President Donald Trump is firing on all cylinders against immigrants and others.\nMore from Opinion Head-on | Pakistan’s genocide in Bangladesh had a hidden US hand Tanzania’s 2025 elections: When patronage politics meets popular revolt American political scientist Samuel P Huntington warned in his 2004 essay, “The Hispanic Challenge\" (later in a book, Who Are We?), that the scale and nature of Hispanic immigration was a serious challenge to America’s traditional “Anglo-Protestant” identity and culture. Even Catholic-majority Europe minus this identity is unacceptable! Hispanics are Latin American, Catholic-majority people who are descendants of Spain or speak Spanish.\nTrump is trying to re-establish the White supremacy worldwide—he is Making America Great Again (Maga)! Europe and Nato no longer count as much as they did earlier. White supremacism and Black subjugation, besides the recolonisation of former colonies, are apparently emerging as key policies in the US-led West.\nQuick Reads View All Why Tawang conference on Arunachal-born Dalai Lama sparked Beijing’s anxiety Head-on | Pakistan’s genocide in Bangladesh had a hidden US hand Ironically, Abraham Lincoln was, in 1860, the first president of the Republican Party Trump leads now. It became an anti-slavery party, opposing the expansion of slavery into new western territories of the US.\nThat trend has reversed. Now the Democratic Party has more Black leaders.\nThe Black population in the US now stands at nearly 50 million (15 per cent of the total 342 million), mostly supporting the Democratic Party. The Trump administration is an almost all-White dispensation. The only two high-ranking exceptions known are Scott Turner, US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Susie Wiles, the White House Chief of Staff.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump, grandson of a German immigrant, is particularly peeved at an independent South Africa, which was the worst example of a Western supremacist-cum-colonial mindset. Apartheid became its official policy in 1948 until Nelson Mandela, after a 27-year-long imprisonment, became its first Black president in 1994, ending the Afrikaner rule.\nAfrikaners emerged as a Southern African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers who arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century, along with smaller numbers of French Huguenot, German, and other European immigrants. They developed Afrikaans, a West Germanic language originating from Dutch, spoken primarily in South Africa and Namibia, and it is one of South Africa’s 11 official languages. Slowly, they dominated South Africa’s politics and economy. The Afrikaner-led government implemented the apartheid system of racial segregation until 1994.\nIn the colonial era, the West simply colonised the “Third World” to exploit its resources for its own development. Might was right. No arguments. No questions asked; no answers given.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In the 21st century, however, a new strategy for colonisation—or recolonisation—has emerged. As the phrase goes, ‘Give a dog a bad name and hang him,’ the West is trying to recolonise its former colonies or scout for new exploitable targets by defaming them with a beautiful wordplay—this word, beautiful, is a Trump favourite!—before hanging them.\nAs part of this evolving design, the US-led West needs resources and is looking for issues and sacrificial lambs. Alleged ‘violations’ of human rights, or even terror favour, are outdated bogies—or Trump would have hanged Pakistan first!\nThis is what the West did when it invaded Afghanistan (2001) looking for ‘terrorists’ it had funded and trained and Iraq (2003) under the guise of finding “weapons of mass destruction” (WMD). It is a long list; the West toppled several unfavourable regimes—democratic or dictatorship—by inventing reasons. The US is trying to recontrol the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan for the same reason.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also falls in this category of ‘recolonisation.’ Even after the fall of the Soviet Union (1991), for example, Nato continued its Cold War strategy to encircle Russia and enrolled Ukraine for it. This alerted Russia, and it tried to resuscitate the former USSR minus Communism in a new format.\nEastern Ukraine is resource-rich, and control over these valuable assets is a significant strategic and economic factor in Russia’s ongoing aggression. The regions currently under Russian occupation or near the front lines contain vast deposits of crucial minerals and energy reserves. Since its February 2022 invasion, Russia has seized control of over $12.5 trillion worth of Ukrainian mineral and gas assets—and is refusing to give up.\nThis year, China also proved how a monopoly over rare earths and critical minerals can force other countries, including the US, to fall in line. Since Xi Jinping became president in 2013, China has laid debt traps, floated the transcontinental Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plan, enrolled around 150 countries, and sought to take control of natural resources and other assets across continents.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD This is what Trump is also doing.\nAs soon as he returned to the White House in January 2025 for a second presidential term, he targeted Panama, Greenland, the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and more. Writing in The New York Times (November 17, 2025), Jack Nicas called this policy the “Donroe Doctrine,” after the famous Monroe Doctrine (1823) that warned European powers against further colonisation or interference in the Americas.\nIn a similar fashion, in the current context, South Africa (though in Africa and in the Eastern Hemisphere) and Venezuela fit well as potential targets into this sharp shift in US foreign policy.\nWhen South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House in May 2025, Trump ‘complained’ about Pretoria’s failure to act against those who allegedly tortured the Afrikaners. Trump even gave him ‘evidence’, which were merely print media clippings! Ramaphosa rejected his claims.\nThen the US President used the bogey of the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Johannesburg (November 22-23, 2025) to arm-twist Ramaphosa, announcing that he (Trump) would boycott the event. Moreover, he did not even invite South Africa to next year’s G20 event scheduled in Miami.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In a post on his social media handle, Truth Social, Trump wrote, “The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa because the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific human rights abuses endured by Afrikaners and other descendants of Dutch, French, and German settlers.”\n“To put it more bluntly, they are killing White people and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.”\nClearly, he tried to elicit support from the Dutch, French, and German people as well!\nPretoria’s other crime was its support for suing Israel in the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the Palestinian issue and ‘crimes against humanity’.\nSouth Africa’s natural resources include a vast array of minerals like gold, platinum, diamonds, iron ore, coal, manganese, and uranium, making it a global mining powerhouse. It is also rich in resources like timber and sugar, with significant agricultural and energy resources, particularly coal, which forms the backbone of its energy sector.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Venezuela is another favourite Trump target. America’s next-door Latin American neighbour has the world’s largest proven oil reserves of over 305 billion barrels, followed by Saudi Arabia (267 billion barrels) and Iran (206 billion barrels). In comparison, the US’ oil reserves are only 55 billion barrels, placing it ninth in the pecking order!\nBy accusing Venezuela of various ‘Trumped’-up charges, such as drug cartels, the US is trying to control it, directly or indirectly. If drug production were the biggest threat, Trump would have gone against Myanmar, Afghanistan (opium and heroin), and Columbia (cocaine). Of course, Venezuela is a major transit country for Columbian drugs. But Mexico, the Golden Triangle (Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos), and the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan) are likewise.\nInitially, Trump also blamed Canada and China for the drug issue but has now cooled off! The two countries have also relented a bit—waiting for Trump to leave the White House for good in 2029!\n(The author is a senior journalist.

Clashes raged at more than a dozen locations along their 817-km (508-mile) border in some of the most intense fighting since a five-day battle in July, with both sides blaming each other for renewed hostilities.\nThailand’s army has made clear it wants to cripple Cambodia’s military capabilities and Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Tuesday said operations would not stop. The Cambodian government said it wanted peace and had acted in self-defence, adding that it was willing to negotiate.\nUNESCO Urges Protection For Hindu Temple\nAt the centre of the border dispute is the Preah Vihear Temple, known in Thai as Phra Viharn. The ancient Hindu temple, built during the golden age of the Khmer Empire in the 11th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage site located on the Thai-Cambodian border. The site remains spiritually and culturally significant for both countries.\nRecent reports claimed that Thailand’s military significantly damaged the temple site by using artillery and aerial attacks, hitting several gateways, statues, the northern staircase, and conservation buildings. This was in violation of international law despite Thai claims of targeting only military assets.\nUNESCO raised serious concerns over the escalating Thailand-Cambodia conflict near the Preah Vihear Temple and urged both nations to ensure urgent protection of cultural heritage and uphold international commitments.\nIn its statement, UNESCO stressed the need to protect the region’s heritage “in all its forms,” invoking international laws such as the 1954 Hague Convention and the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The agency said it will continue observing the situation and is prepared to offer technical support and emergency protection measures when conditions improve.\nThe temple had long been contested by both countries since Cambodia’s independence from France. In 1962 and 2013, the International Court of Justice ruled in favour of Cambodia in a long-running dispute with Thailand over jurisdiction of land around the ancient temple, a decision that was rejected by Bangkok.","summary":"India described the damage to the 11th-century Preah Vihear Temple on the Thai-Cambodian border during recent border clashes as “unfortunate.”","url":"https://www.news18.com/india/return-to-the-path-of-dialogue-peace-indias-appeal-to-thailand-cambodia-amid-border-clashes-9766396.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/12/preah-vihear-temple-2025-12-dac9556a028f37f7c75e4dce3a0e734f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 10:59:43","author":"Aveek Banerjee,News18","authors":["Aveek Banerjee","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.068},{"id":386952180,"title":"Trump Launches Gold Card Visa Programme: Cost, Eligibility, Benefits And How To Apply","text":"US President Donald Trump has officially launched the long‑promised “Gold Card” visa programme, designed to replace the EB‑5 visa system and attract major investment into the country. The initiative aims to generate billions of dollars for the US Treasury while offering investors a faster pathway to permanent residency and eventual citizenship. (Image: Instagram)\nEligibility for the Gold Card extends to both individuals and corporations. Individual applicants must qualify for lawful permanent residency and be admissible to the US. Corporations can sponsor foreign‑born employees under the programme, while family members such as spouses and unmarried children under 21 are also eligible to apply, though each must pay separate fees. (Image: Instagram)\nThe costs associated with the Gold Card are substantial. Every applicant or corporate sponsor must pay a non‑refundable processing fee of $15,000. In addition, individuals are required to invest $1 million, while corporate sponsors must contribute $2 million per employee. Other expenses, such as visa‑related charges and medical examination costs, may also apply. (Image: Pexels)\nThe application process is designed to be straightforward. Applicants must first visit the official website, trumpcard.gov, and select the appropriate category – Individual, Corporate, or Platinum waitlist. After submitting personal or corporate details, they are required to create a myUSCIS.gov account to track updates. Payment of the $15,000 processing fee follows, after which the Department of Homeland Security conducts vetting. Once approved, applicants must complete the investment payment of $1 million or $2 million, depending on their category. (Image: Pexels)\nPayments can be made through multiple channels, including credit cards, ACH debit for US accounts, or SWIFT wire transfers for international applicants. This flexibility is intended to make the programme accessible to investors worldwide. (Image: Pexels)\nThe benefits of the Gold Card are significant. Successful applicants gain legal permanent resident status, often under EB‑1 or EB‑2 visa categories, with expedited processing compared to traditional visa routes. Eligible family members can join the primary applicant, and the programme offers a clear pathway to US citizenship. (Image: Instagram)\nHowever, the Gold Card comes with strict rules. Status can be revoked in cases of national security concerns or serious criminal activity. Applicants from certain countries may face wait times of a year or more, despite the programme’s promise of faster processing. Additionally, all holders are subject to US taxation on worldwide income, a requirement that underscores the seriousness of the commitment.

Inside The Deepening Trump-Europe Faultlines","text":"The uneasy transatlantic relationship between the United States and the European Union is once again under strain. In recent days, US President Donald Trump has launched a new offensive against European leaders, calling them “weak,” branding key EU nations “decaying,” and accusing them of letting the war in Ukraine drag on. His remarks accompanied the release of a new US National Security Strategy (NSS), which has sparked concern across Europe for its rhetoric and implications.\nWhat intensified the backlash was not only the tone of the published NSS, but also reports of an unpublished longer version flagged by US outlet Defense One. That internal draft allegedly proposed a plan to “pull” four countries—Austria, Hungary, Italy and Poland—away from the EU and into closer alignment with the US.\nWhile the White House has firmly denied the existence of such a document, stating, “no alternative, private, or classified version exists”, the report has added to growing European unease over Washington’s evolving stance, especially as Trump continues to court nationalist governments sympathetic to his worldview.\nWhat Did The Unpublished Document Allegedly Propose?\nAccording to the report, the draft NSS advocated deepening ties with ideologically aligned governments, specifically those in Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Italy, by supporting parties and movements that promote “traditional European ways of life” while staying pro-American.\nThe draft also reportedly frames Europe as a continent facing “civilisational erasure”, a narrative that has gained traction among Europe’s far-right leaders and in Russia. It criticises EU efforts to curb far-right parties, describing such actions as “political censorship,” and calls for “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory”.\nThe phrasing suggests a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge within the EU. It aligns closely with Trump’s praise for leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, known for defying Brussels on migration, rule of law, and media freedom. The document’s language reflects a wider strategy of splintering the EU from within, favouring regimes that echo Trump-era nationalism.\nThe White House has rejected these claims outright. Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly stated that Trump “put his signature on one NSS”, and no other version exists.\nWhat Has Trump Said About Europe In Recent Days?\nIn a Politico interview, Trump expanded his attack on the continent, saying, “I think they’re weak. I think they don’t know what to do.” He described Europe as a group of “decaying” nations and praised Hungary and Poland as models for tough immigration control. Most of Europe, he suggested, had failed to preserve stability or strategic focus.\nTrump also claimed that Europe was responsible for prolonging the Ukraine war by failing to act decisively. He accused European governments of letting Ukraine “fight until they drop,” suggesting they were more interested in containment than resolution. “They talk but they don’t produce. And the war just keeps going on and on,” he said.\nIn a particularly inflammatory claim, Trump alleged that Ukraine was blocking peace. He said Moscow was “fine” with a US peace plan that proposed major concessions from Kyiv, and accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of refusing to “play ball.” European leaders fear such a plan could prioritise US interests at Ukraine’s expense, leaving Kyiv exposed to future aggression.\nTrump also questioned Ukraine’s democratic credentials, noting the suspension of elections under martial law. “It gets to a point where it’s not a democracy anymore,” he said. Elections have been suspended under martial law since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, in line with Ukraine’s constitutional provisions.\nZelenskyy responded by saying elections could be held within 60 to 90 days if security conditions improve, and that legislative proposals were being prepared to enable this.\nThe Politico interview capped a week of provocations in which Trump was also named the “most powerful person shaping European politics” in the outlet’s annual P28 list, underscoring the extent of his influence on the continent’s direction.\nHow Has Europe Responded To The NSS And Trump’s Comments?\nEU leaders have responded with unusual directness. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that “nobody else is supposed to interfere, without any question” in European democracy, and said “the sovereignty of the voters must be protected.” She linked the reported NSS goals to foreign attempts to influence internal EU politics.\nShe also defended the EU’s proposed Democracy Shield, aimed at combating foreign disinformation and election interference, and stressed that Europe must define its own values. “Let’s stand up for a unified Europe. This is our task… to look at ourselves and be proud of ourselves,” she said at a public event in Brussels.\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper rejected Trump’s characterisation of Europe as weak, citing strong defence investments and sustained aid to Ukraine. She said “two presidents are working for peace”, referring to Zelenskyy and Trump, but only one, Putin, continues to escalate the conflict.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called parts of the NSS “unacceptable,” particularly the notion that the US must “save democracy” in Europe. “We can handle that ourselves,” he said, cautioning against any external attempts to dictate the continent’s political path.\nAre These Countries Really Pulling Away From The EU?\nNot formally. None of the four countries named—Austria, Hungary, Italy, and Poland—have initiated processes to exit the EU. However, their political trajectories suggest growing friction with Brussels.\nHungary and Poland, in particular, have long challenged EU norms. They’ve clashed with the European Commission over judicial independence, press freedom, and LGBTQ rights. Both have embraced nationalist rhetoric that resonates with Trump’s platform: defending sovereignty, resisting migration, and confronting what they describe as “liberal elites” in Western Europe.\nItaly has witnessed a rise in far-right political momentum under governments sympathetic to nationalist causes, while Austria has frequently pivoted between pro-European and populist messaging.\nThe NSS controversy has fuelled fears that the US may be actively encouraging this drift. If these nations interpret Trump’s support as a green light to further defy Brussels, the balance of power within the EU could be reshaped.\nWhy Does This Matter For Europe’s Future?\nThe NSS document, which Russia publicly welcomed as “largely consistent” with its worldview, signals a break from the traditional Atlanticist consensus. The fact that it does not frame Russia as a direct US threat has added to European concerns, especially among NATO members who see Moscow as their primary security challenge.\nEU leaders worry that Washington’s posture under Trump could embolden far-right movements within their own borders, undermine unity on Ukraine, and weaken transatlantic alignment at a critical moment. From digital regulation to energy security and defence integration, the EU has been attempting to assert strategic autonomy. But these efforts may be undermined if a US administration openly supports internal dissent.","summary":"A disputed US strategy document and Donald Trump’s blunt critique of Europe have accelerated debates over political drift within the European Union.","url":"https://www.news18.com/explainers/will-four-nations-break-rank-with-the-eu-inside-the-deepening-trump-europe-faultlines-ws-l-9766035.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-1-2025-08-37c5697382771183b00017741dbf48dd.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 08:56:43","author":"Karishma Jain,News18","authors":["Karishma Jain","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":386952194,"title":"Entering The US?

administrative vetting and are processing the business visas within four weeks,” the official added.\n\nIndia’s ministries of external affairs, home and trade, as well as the prime minister’s office and the top think tank on policy, did not respond to email requests for comment.\n\nFollowing the news, China’s foreign ministry said it had noticed “positive action” from India to facilitate people-to-people exchanges in the common interest.\n\n“China is willing to maintain communication and consultation with India to continuously enhance the level of facilitation of exchanges,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun added.\n\nThink tank Observer Research Foundation estimates that tougher scrutiny led to production losses of $15 billion over four years to Indian electronics makers, which import key machinery from China to make mobile telephones.\n\nMajor Chinese electronics companies, such as Xiaomi, struggled to get visas, Reuters reported last year.\n\nIndustry executives have said such curbs hit their plans to expand in India, while the solar industry was also hit by shortages of skilled labour.\n\nThe removal of red tape comes after Modi visited China this year for the first time in seven years, meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping and discussing ways to improve ties.\n\nSubsequently, both countries resumed direct flights, for the first time since 2020.\n\nThe easing of curbs was prompted by a high-level committee headed by a former cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, now a member of the top government think tank, which also aims to ease investment curbs on China that hurt foreign investor sentiment.\n\n“We welcome the government’s decision to expedite skilled-visa approvals for professionals from land-bordering countries,” said Pankaj Mohindroo, head of industry body the Indian Cellular and Electronics Association.\n\n“This reflects a collaborative approach and the government’s acceptance of our recommendations.”\n\nThe changes come at a crucial time for India, which is scaling up production across categories from finished goods to components and sub-assemblies, he added.\n\nWarming China ties follow us tariffs\n\nIndia’s warmer ties with China follow the surprise levy of a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods by US President Donald Trump, including a penal tariff of 25pc for buying Russian oil.\n\nThat prompted India to reshape its diplomatic calculus, reworking ties with China and strengthening ties with Russia, while continuing to negotiate a trade deal with Washington.\n\nIn this effort, Modi has doubled down on focusing measures to boost growth by improving the environment for foreign investment, including business with China.\n\nIndia also recently cut consumption tax and eased labour laws to lure foreign investors.\n\n“We are cautiously easing some rules around restriction on China, which, we hope, will improve the overall business environment,” the second official said.","summary":"India has cut red tape to speed business

Reveals Trump’s Mounting Frustration Over Ukraine War Deadlock","text":"Impatience in Washington\n\nThe White House has publicly conveyed President Donald Trump’s deep frustration with the lack of progress in ending the war in Ukraine, expressing exasperation with both Kyiv and Moscow. In a stark statement on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president is “extremely frustrated with both camps involved in this war, and he has had enough of meetings that have no other purpose than to meet.” She emphasized, “He doesn’t want any more talk, he wants action. He wants this war to come to an end.”\n\nThe Sticking Points: Territory and Demilitarization\n\nThis impatience comes as negotiations have intensified following a U.S. proposal nearly three weeks ago that incorporated major demands from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that Washington seeks a deal “as soon as possible.” According to Zelensky, the two critical issues remain control of the eastern Donetsk region—the epicenter of current fighting—and the status of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nThe U.S. plan, as described by Zelensky, envisions Ukrainian forces withdrawing from the parts of Donetsk they still control, which would then become a “free economic zone” or “demilitarized zone.” In exchange, Russian troops would withdraw from areas they hold in Sumy, Kharkiv, and Dnipropetrovsk regions but would remain in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions, largely controlled by Russia, remain a primary Kremlin objective.\n\nA Major Concession and a Potential Referendum\n\nThe idea of a demilitarized zone in territories Russia has failed to fully conquer would represent a significant concession from Kyiv, though it would stop short of formal relinquishment. Zelensky noted that the U.S. has not specified who would govern such a territory. His adviser, Mykhailo Podoliak, appeared to support the concept, telling Le Monde that a demilitarized zone with a foreign contingent would be a “natural format for ending the conflict,” acknowledging that part of the territory would remain under de facto Russian occupation.\n\nZelensky asserted that any territorial resolution would ultimately require an “election” or “referendum” in Ukraine. He previously stated readiness to hold a presidential vote if the U.S. and European allies could guarantee security for the ballot.\n\nNegotiations Amid a Difficult Reality for Ukraine\n\nThe American diplomatic push coincides with a challenging period for Ukraine. The presidency has been rocked by a major corruption scandal involving Zelensky’s inner circle, the military is facing setbacks on the front lines, and the population is enduring widespread power outages due to Russian strikes.\n\nOn the ground, the Russian military claimed the capture of Siversk in Donetsk on Thursday, a key barrier protecting the larger cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Ukrainian military command denied the city had fallen, reporting only that small Russian groups were attempting to infiltrate.\n\nA Decisive Week Ahead\n\n“The coming week will be decisive for Ukraine,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated after a meeting of Kyiv’s allies. Beyond the peace talks, European leaders will gather for a summit on December 18 to discuss potentially using frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine. The EU has already removed a key hurdle by making permanent the sanctions against Moscow that enable the asset freezes.\n\nAs pressure mounts from Washington and battlefield realities shift, the path to ending Europe’s largest conflict in decades appears fraught with diplomatic and territorial complexities.","summary":"Impatience in Washington The White House has publicly conveyed President Donald Trump&#8217;s deep frustration with the lack of progress in ending the war in Ukraine, expressing exasperation with both Kyiv and Moscow.

Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles, visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”.\n\nJeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.\n\nBoth sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire.\n\nSmith noted that the Trump administration’s messaging during the ceasefire between India and Pakistan had placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a “difficult position at home”, with critics accusing him of “bending to the will of the US”.\n\nRepublican scepticism\n\nRepublican scepticism — usually muted when it comes to India — was unusually sharp. Congressman Mike Baumgartner of Washington state questioned whether India was genuinely committed to deepening defence cooperation with the United States. He recounted browsing a book on the Indian Army during a recent visit to India and finding a full-page photograph of Indian troops training with Russians while US-India exercises appeared only as a small boxed image. “The next time I go to India,” he said, “I’d like to see those pages reversed.”\n\nHis comments reflected a wider concern in Washington that despite two decades of US outreach, India continues to hedge strategically — maintaining close ties with Russia and participating actively in China-led forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bill Huizenga opened the session by calling India a “defining partner for the 21st century”, praising its expanding naval posture in the Indo-Pacific, its role in the Quad, and cooperation in technology, counter-terrorism and energy. Yet he also acknowledged “understandable concerns” over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to New Delhi and India’s involvement in multilateral platforms shaped by China. Huizenga accused Beijing of pursuing a “string of pearls” strategy to militarise ports across the Indian Ocean.\n\n‘Frozen high-level engagement’\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove issued the strongest warning, cautioning that Trump risked becoming “the president who lost India” because of escalating disputes over trade and immigration. She revealed that a US-India trade agreement had been on track for signature in July but was abruptly withdrawn by the White House. Instead, India was hit with 50pc tariffs — among the steepest applied to any US partner — and a 25pc tariff on India-linked Russian oil imports.\n\nShe criticised the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, noting that Indians hold nearly 70pc of such visas and form a crucial segment of the US technology and medical workforce. The combined effect of these decisions, she said, had frozen high-level engagement and forced the postponement of the Quad Leaders Summit.\n\nYet the hearing also underscored a growing divergence between congressional rhetoric and Trump’s own public posture. While several lawmakers focused sharply on allegations of militancy in occupied Kashmir and criticised Pakistan, others noted that Trump had maintained a strikingly different tone throughout the year. He has issued more than 30 public statements praising Pakistan for its cooperation, calling Islamabad a “key regional partner”, and emphasising the need for balanced engagement with both South Asian nuclear powers.\n\nFollowing the India-Pakistan May conflict, Trump declined to assign blame and instead praised Pakistan’s role in helping defuse tensions.\n\nAnalysts at the hearing indirectly acknowledged that such statements had complicated New Delhi’s domestic political narrative.\n\nIn multiple statements, Trump has reaffirmed that eight jets were downed during the military escalation. For its part, Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale, and later increased the count to seven.\n\nInitially, New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Later in October, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class”.\n\n‘Second-most significant challenge’\n\nDhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation America told lawmakers that India viewed recent US engagement with Pakistan’s military leadership as “unsettling”, particularly after India’s air strikes inside Pakistan in May. Repeating India’s longstanding allegation of Pakistani support for terrorism — a claim Pakistan rejects — he warned that unresolved tariffs would increasingly be perceived in India as “acts of political hostility”.\n\nJaishankar, who is son of the Indian external affairs minister, described Washington’s growing relationship with Pakistan as the “second-most significant challenge” to India-US ties, after trade and tariff disputes. Responding to Trump’s assertion that he personally negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “India’s experience is that third-party mediation has often contributed to Pakistan’s adventurism.”\n\nHe argued that the United States had long pursued a policy of “de-hyphenation”, engaging both India and Pakistan while avoiding involvement in their disputes, and urged Washington to maintain that approach. He noted that “considerable progress” in the relationship remained possible if disagreements over trade and Pakistan were managed.\n\nAt the same time, he acknowledged that defence cooperation continues to expand — including through a new 10-year Defence Framework Agreement, joint production initiatives, the impending launch of the NISAR satellite, and ongoing US support for India’s human spaceflight programme.\n\nSameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund said India remained “poised to become a pole in the international system”, but stressed that New Delhi seeks autonomy, not alignment — a reminder that US expectations often exceed India’s willingness to commit.\n\nJeff Smith also noted that Washington’s outreach to Pakistan’s military leadership — particularly meetings with Chief of Defence Forces and Cheif of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir — had generated political unease in India, contributing to the perception that the United States was recalibrating its regional priorities.\n\nThe overarching message from the hearing was clear: political trust — the element that has long held the US-India partnership together — is now under visible strain. And as Washington reassesses its strategic options in South Asia, Pakistan’s role as a stabilising partner is once again part of the conversation, even if not always acknowledged openly.","summary":"A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India.\n\n\nThe hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy.

Or what will stop them disguising themselves as civilians and taking over this free economic zone? This is all very serious. It’s not a fact that Ukraine would agree to it, but if you are talking about a compromise then it has to be a fair compromise.”\nHe said that if Ukraine were to accept such a plan, it would require elections or a referendum to approve it, stressing that only “the Ukrainian people” can decide on any territorial concessions.\nZelenskyy said, under the US plans, Ukraine would withdraw from Donbas, where Russia is advancing, while the frontlines would be frozen in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Russia would give up a few small pockets of land it controls in other regions.\nZelenskyy has faced strong pressure from Donald Trump to accept the US peace plan. In recent days, Trump has criticised him, alleging that he “has not even read” the draft proposal and questioning his legitimacy while urging Ukraine to hold an election.\nTrump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Thursday, “The president is extremely frustrated with both sides of this war, and he is sick of meetings just for the sake of meeting.”\nZelenskyy said Ukraine’s negotiating team had sent its revised proposal to Washington on Wednesday, adding that territorial issues and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant remain key sticking points.\n“It’s not the final plan; it’s a reaction to what we received … the plan is constantly being worked on and edited, and this is a continuous process that is still going on,” he said.\nIf Washington and Kyiv reach an agreement, a larger question looms: is Vladimir Putin genuinely prepared to sign a deal, or simply stalling with sham negotiations while aiming to push his military offensive through the winter?","summary":"Zelenskyy said Ukraine viewed the plan as unfair without assurances that Russian forces wouldn’t simply move in and seize the area after a Ukrainian withdrawal.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/us-proposes-ukraines-withdrawal-from-donbas-creation-of-free-economic-zone-zelenskyy-ws-l-9765715.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/06/Zelenskyy-AFP-Russia-Ukraine-2025-06-5b5dbcde91174d1e758242abe165974e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-12 06:57:20","author":"Aanchal Sinha,News18","authors":["Aanchal Sinha","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.334}]}
