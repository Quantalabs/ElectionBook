He is overexcited - that's not a smile, that's delirium,' she said.\n\n'He looks a bit sycophantic to me. Albanese is beyond hysterical with excitement, (but) Trump is faking the smile.'\n\nReferencing the Duchenne smile, which is an expression showing true enjoyment, Dr Mahler said a real smile would see the mouth move sideways and the muscles under the eyes crease.\n\nA selfie taken by Anthony Albanese with Donald Trump left body language expert Dr Louise Mahler concerned by their differences, comparing the pair to a schoolboy and a wax model \n\n'In that photo, clearly, Trump is not doing the Duchenne smile, he's doing a fake smile which is just the mouth and it has lifted his eyes up. It's not a genuine smile,' she said.\n\n'He looks like a wax model, if I'm honest. The expression on his face is not a natural look. It's not inspired by emotion.\n\n'His expression looks like it's very consciously manufactured and therefore, something that someone who was doing a wax model would create.'\n\nDr Mahler added that the difference between the two men was stark in the photo: 'It looks like the rich man and the poor man.'\n\n'One (Trump) has the dark suit, the blue tie, the teeth, the tan,' she said.\n\n'The other (Albanese) looks like a public servant with a grey suit, big glasses, and the teeth are not as white. \n\n'It looks like a schoolboy having a photo with the headmaster.'\n\nThe expert also gave her analysis on the body language of the leaders, highlighting how Trump was slightly hunched forward while Albanese was standing up straight.\n\nDr Mahler said the 'gold standard' of posture was former US President Barack Obama\n\nDr Mahler said Albanese's smile was 'delirious' (left) while Trump gave a fake smile that was signaled by the way his eyes lifted (right)\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nPhoto Albo waited 246 days for: PM posts grinning selfie with squinting Trump as they FINALLY meet\n\n'I imagine Albanese jumped in. He looks like he's moved to that position, jumped in, pressed against Trump, and grabbed the photo,' Dr Mahler said.\n\nBut she said Trump looked exhausted, adding that it is not unusual. \n\n'The pinch between the eyebrows would say he's not interested in being there. It's boring, it's duty,' she said.\n\n'The pinch between the eyebrows, the head forward, the false teeth, he doesn't look human.'\n\nFor those wanting to project strong leadership, Dr Mahler said it is critical to stand balanced upright on both feet. \n\nAn example of what to avoid, she said, was the apology press conference by Optus CEO Stephen Rue on Friday when he announced there had been a 13-hour triple-0 blackout on Thursday that was linked to up to four deaths.\n\n'He did his speech standing on one leg. This is not balanced, it doesn't look like one is committed physically to the engagement,' she said.\n\n'So standing straight on two feet is best, with the head balanced on the body, which means that the back of the neck is straight. Heads off the body are about tiredness or lack of interest. \n\nDr Louise Mahler highlighted that the hunched posture of Trump and beleaguered Optus boss Stephen Rue made them look uncommitted to their engagements\n\n'The gold standard on all of this was former US President Barack Obama. He was magnificent.\n\n'You would not catch Obama out standing on one leg, not up straight, not with his head. He would never put his head forward. He didn't fake smiles.'\n\nThe photo of Albanese and Trump was taken at an event at the Lotte New York Palace hotel, hosted by the US President and First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nAttended by more than 100 world leaders, it marked the first time Albanese and Trump had successfully met in person after multiple snubs and failed attempts.\n\nThe Australian leader attended the reception, held on Tuesday night US time, alongside his soon-to-be wife, Jodie Haydon.\n\nHe and Trump will sit down for a formal meeting on October 20, Albanese confirmed during a press conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe meeting is expected to be a substantial engagement, potentially including an Oval Office audience.\n\nAlbanese will return to the US for the second time in a month for the stand-alone trip.\n\nAlbanese failed to secure an in-person meeting with Trump during the UN General Assembly.\n\nAnthony AlbaneseNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nBody language expert reveals the hidden signal that exposes what Trump really thought of Albanese - and the 'fake act' few noticed\n\nAdd comment","summary":"A body language expert has broken down Trump's every move with Albanese.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15131333/Body-language-expert-reveals-hidden-signal-exposes-Trump-really-thought-Albanese-fake-act-noticed.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/25/01/102430913-0-image-a-15_1758759076965.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:51:33","author":"Caitlin Powell,Editor","authors":["Caitlin Powell","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.058},{"id":363253470,"title":"Inside stateless ISIS bride Shamima Begum's life in hell hole refugee camp as she dreams of return to Britain","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Sep 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShocking moment British tourists watch as migrants stream into Spanish resort - 'before brawl leaves one dead at hotel'\n\nKeir Starmer's top aide WAS told by electoral watchdog that donations had to be declared...

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy VIVEK CHAUDHARY, SENIOR REPORTER and OWEN HOLDAWAY \n Published:01:31 BST, 25 September 2025 |Updated:01:47 BST, 25 September 2025 \n\nISIS bride Shamima Begum is living on £100 a week of donations from friends and family while stuck in a hell hole detention camp in the Syrian desert as she continues to dream of being able to return to the UK.\nStateless Begum, 26, was seen for the first time in years earlier this week when she stormed out of an interview at the grim al-Roj camp.\nAnd now The Daily Mail can reveal how the former schoolgirl Jihadi is trying to keep her morale up by enjoying small luxuries like rudimentary beauty treatments paid for by donations from supporters - as her battle with the British government to get her citizenship back drags on.\nAnd the beauty treatments are thought to be part of an ongoing planned campaign by Begum and her supporters to present herself as more 'Western' than jihadists in order to win public support for her campaign to be allowed back to Britain.\nThe camp, made up of rows of tents inside a fortified compound in northwest Syria has been criticised by the Red Cross for being 'grim' and 'extremely volatile'.\nBut Begum - thanks to handouts from her dwindling band of friends - tries to make her incarceration there as pleasant as possible, despite acknowledging that it is 'worse than a prison'. \nShe receives up to £400 per month, which is transferred to a makeshift bank in the camp by her relatives and friends in the UK.\nThe money is used to top up her mobile phone and visit a shopping area in the camp selling an array of items such as toys, makeup, groceries, and clothes. Some even offer fake designer trainers and other western brands.\n\nShamima Begum is currently living in a detention camp while fighting the British government for the right to return to the UK\n\nBegum became a child bride to Dutch Islamic convert Yago Riedijk, with whom she had three children - who all died as infants\n\nThe former jihadi bride now lives at the al-Roj camp in northern Syria, run by the Syrian Democratic Forces, which she has described as 'worse than a prison'\nBegum and the other inmates are also allowed to visit a souq (market) just outside the camp where a larger selection of food and clothing is available.\nIn addition to money, she is also allowed to receive clothing and other parcels of everyday items from her family in London.\nBegum has been assigned a spacious tent in which she lives alone and is equipped with a television, satellite dish, running water and electricity. One part of it is a kitchen and along with all the other inmates, she has been issued with a cooker which is filled with gas once a week.\nA source told the Daily Mail: 'She lives in relative comfort. She gets good support from NGOs and the SDF (Syrian Defence Forces) working in the camp.'\nAl-Roj is home to around 12,000 women and children who are all primarily the relatives of male ISIS members. The camp has a school and 24-hour health centre where an ophthalmologist, dentist, and other medical specialists are on call.\nBut most remarkable of all has been Begum's streetwise westernised appearance that has caught the eye as she remains the focal point of controversy and debate over her desire to return to the UK.\nShe gets her hair cut and styled by fellow female jihadi inmates who also provide services such as manicures, facials and pedicures.\nShe has also taken to wearing make-up that was initially smuggled in by some of the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) soldiers guarding the gates of the facility and is also now available at a shop in the camp.\nIn recent years Begum has been photographed walking around al-Roj in Primark clothes and Nike trainers and wearing her hair down.\nIn 2021 after the Supreme Court ruled that she could not return to the UK to pursue an appeal against the removal of her British citizenship she was pictured in the camp wearing a pair of sunglasses, a dark jacket, leggings and white trainers.\nShe looks unrecognisable from the demure young woman who was first pictured in a black niqab in 2019 at another camp for ISIS women before being moved to al-Roj, which lies near the Iraqi-Kurdish border.\nIn her most recent appearance, Begum who concealed her face behind a mask looked 'pale and thin' while wearing a trendy black tee shirt and jeans with her long hair swept over her shoulders.\nShe was asked about speculation over a possible return to the UK after the Trump administration said that if Britain wanted to be seen as a 'serious ally' of the US then it should commit to the international fight against ISIS by taking back citizens currently in the northeast of Syria.\nThe controversial comment was made by Trump ally Sebastian Gorka prompting Nigel Farage to admit that he had become 'more thoughtful' about letting her back into the UK and that he did not see her as an 'all out ISIS killer'.\nShe replied 'no comment' on both occasions when asked about this by a reporter from the Daily Express before turning on him.\n'If you guys don't have anything to tell us we don't have anything to say,' she raged, before leaving in a huff.\n\nBegum gets her hair cut and styled by fellow female jihadi inmates who also provide services such as manicures, facials and pedicures\n\n Shamima Begum conceals her face behind a mask before storming out of first interview in two years \nBegum, now 26, was born and raised in Bethnal Green, east London before travelling to Syria to join ISIS in 2015. She later became a child bride to Dutch Islamic convert Yago Riedijk, with whom she had three children - who all died as infants.\nHome Secretary Sajid Javid stripped her of British citizenship in 2019, prompting her to launch a long legal and PR campaign in a bid to have the decision reversed.\nAs the battle for her return rages, she has largely refrained from making public comment about her situation.\nMahmoud, a Kurdish translator who previously worked in al-Roj and has met Begum said: 'She is refusing interviews on the advice of her lawyer. You can still visit her in the camp, but she is unlikely to go on the record.'\nFilmmaker Andrew Drury, who knew Begum for 18 months, said she was also able to get her hands on clothes and make-up from broadcasters courting her for interviews - as well as a camp shop selling fake designer goods sourced from local markets.\nHe told The Daily Mail: 'There's a shopping area in the camp with six or seven shops selling things like clothes, food and toys.\n'The clothes shop is opened up to the extremist and non-extremist girls at different times.\n'They get fake Nikes and other western brands that probably come from local markets.'\nHe added: 'Every time you want to do an interview you ask her what she wants.\n'Other clothes have probably been donated by their friends or smuggled in by the guards.'\nDespite uncertainty over her future and her confinement, Begum has been described as a 'model detainee' and 'courageous' by those who run al-Roj.\nMeanwhile a filmmaker who approached Begum in the camp recently has told how she told him to 'get the f*** out'.\nRashid Omar, the camp's director told The Times last year: 'She is one of the few to have refused to wear niqab.\n'Under the circumstances here, given our difficulties in protecting women, that's a courageous decision.'\nBegum's lawyers and supporters have argued that she was trafficked to Syria given the fact that she was a minor when it happened and should be allowed to return to the UK.\nShe was accompanied by two other schoolgirls, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, with Sultana believed killed in an explosion and the fate of Abase remaining unknown.\nISISShamima BegumLondonSyria\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside stateless ISIS bride Shamima Begum's life in hell hole refugee camp as she dreams of return to Britain\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I've always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.'\n\nThere was implicit criticism of Trump's approach in Albanese's speech, as he defended the UN and called on member states to work together.\n\n'If the United Nations steps back, we all lose ground. If we give people reason to doubt the value of co-operation, then the risk of conflict becoming the default option grows,' Albanese said.\n\n'If we resign ourselves to the idea that war is inevitable, or relegate ourselves to the status of disinterested bystanders … if our only response to every crisis is to insist that there is nothing we can do … then we risk being trusted with nothing.'\n\nTrump had lashed the countries who chose to formally recognise Palestine as a state, claiming the decision was a 'reward for these horrible atrocities' on October 7.\n\n'Instead of giving in to Hamas ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message, release the hostages now,' he added.\n\nMore to come.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has set himself on a collison course with Donald Trump as he brands climate change an 'an existential threat' in his UN address.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15131639/Albanese-Trump-climate-change.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/25/01/102431991-0-image-m-13_1758759730876.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:46:56","author":"Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":363253414,"title":"Trump's right - Ukraine CAN win back territory seized by Russia, says former British Army colonel PHILIP INGRAM... and here's what they need to collapse Putin's front line against all odds","text":"Donald Trump declared this week that Ukraine could 'win back all its land' from Russia if it had the right support. \n\nThe bold claim, made at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, has left many critics questioning how Kyiv could possibly achieve such a sweeping victory after more than three years of war. \n\nThe US president said: 'With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original borders from where this war started, is very much an option.' He also claimed that Russia's economy was in trouble and said Putin had been 'fighting aimlessly.'\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, the Kremlin hit back at the statement, saying that Russia's economy fully satisfied the needs of its army, and it was a big mistake to believe Ukraine could reclaim any lost territory. \n\nTrump's position marks a major shift from his previous assertions that Ukraine would have to concede land. It has sparked debate over whether Kyiv has the military muscle and resources to achieve such a goal. \n\nColonel Philip Ingram, a former British Army officer and intelligence expert, told Daily Mail that although Ukraine faces 'a mammoth task' in trying to reclaim its occupied territory, there is still a path forward. \n\n'From a pure military perspective, it would be very difficult for the Ukrainians to use their military to push the Russians out,' he said 'But from a wider operational perspective, where you bring in the geopolitical aspect of it, there is a realistic possibility, but it will take a long time. \n\n'It will rely on the Russian ability to continue to support its tactical operations, collapsing. The Ukrainians are having a lot of success in destroying Russia's oil and gas industries, which is helping to fund its war. \n\n'The more the Ukrainians destroy, the less ability Russia has to manufacture the arms and ammunition they need to support the tactical fighting in the east. They could be put into a position where they are in danger of parts of their front collapsing.'\n\nRussia and Ukraine are still locked in a brutal conflict more than three years after Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.\n\nBehind the headlines of daily battles lies a much bigger story, one of manpower, machines, and money.\n\nRussia still occupies about 19 per cent of Ukraine, with around 3.5million Ukrainians living under occupation. Putin currently controls Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk. His forces seized and annexed Crimea in March 2014. \n\nRussia has fortified much of the territory it holds with vast trench networks, anti-tank ditches, 'dragon's teeth' barriers and minefields described by the UK Ministry of Defence as among the densest in the world.\n\nOn the battlefield, Ukraine continues to resist ferocious Russian assaults and launch counter-strikes of its own. \n\nWhen the war is stripped down to the hard numbers, a comparison of the two militaries' manpower, defence spending, air power, armoured strength, and naval forces reveals that the gap between them is glaring. \n\nIt also considers the staggering losses both sides have suffered. Taken together, these factors give a clearer picture of the scale of the challenge Ukraine faces in trying to reclaim occupied land.\n\nAs it stands, Russia holds a clear edge in sheer manpower - analysts list its active military personnel at about 1.32 million, while Ukraine has around 900,000. \n\nThat gives Moscow nearly half a million more soldiers it can put into uniform at any given moment. \n\nThis means Russia has a greater capacity to rotate units, keep fresh troops in reserve, and absorb casualties without immediately weakening its front line.\n\nUkraine's figure of 900,000 is still huge for a country of its size, and it reflects the national mobilisation that followed the invasion. \n\nRussia's reserve personnel tally is at 2,000,000. That's 800,000 more than Ukraine's 1,200,000. North Korea has also sent about 11,000 troops to Russia to fight in the war. \n\nAccording to assessments, these soldiers were trained in eastern Russia and were later integrated into Russian units under Moscow's command. \n\nBut the bottom line is that Kyiv cannot match Moscow man for man, and that imbalance shapes the way the war is fought. \n\nAccording to Col Ingram: 'The Ukrainians are having difficulties in recruiting individuals, but that's because the government has put some limits on where they'll go from an age perspective. Russia is having equal difficulties in recruiting, but Russia is a much larger country. And Putin is in a position to force people into the military. \n\n'Manpower is one thing that will be an Achilles heel on both sides. Putin can generate lots more people to go into his meat grinder than Zelensky can. But at some stage, there will be some dissatisfaction with what's happening, and that's one thing that Putin fears more than anything.'\n\nLosses have been devastating on both sides - according to estimates, Russia has suffered more than one million casualties since the start of the war. Ukraine's losses are also severe, with more than 400,000 casualties recorded over the same period. \n\nRussia's ability to draw on a larger population and a bigger pool of reservists has allowed it to replace many of its losses, even if the quality of new recruits is often questioned. \n\nUkraine, with a smaller population, has been forced to rely on repeated rounds of mobilisation, and every fresh call-up has become more politically sensitive.\n\nMany of the casualties have come during grinding assaults or costly counter-offensives. \n\nRussia, for its part, has seen entire units destroyed in failed attacks around places like Avdiivka. In that onslaught, Russia is said to have suffered 30,000 casualties. \n\nMeanwhile, in the battle of Bakhmut, some Ukrainian units lost over 80 per cent of their soldiers, according to media reports. \n\nThese losses are made even harder to bear by the vast network of Russian fortifications, which experts have said will make the reclaiming of any lands extremely difficult. \n\nCol Ingram said: 'No defences are impenetrable, but the Russian defensive lines are probably the most extensive we have ever seen in any conflict. The Ukrainians do not currently have the ability to punch through them with force. \n\n'To have a proper effect against these defences, the Ukrainians would need heavy armoured engineering capabilities with a lot of heavy artillery support. But most of all, they would need what is called local air superiority. They don't have enough aircraft to be able to provide that.'\n\nDefence budgets tell us what each side is prepared to spend on sustaining and modernising their militaries. \n\nRussia's official defence budget is listed at about $126billion while Ukraine's is around $53.7billion - meaning Moscow spends more than twice as much as Kyiv. \n\nIn practice, the difference is even larger because Russia's economy is bigger and more resources can be channelled into defence industries, even under sanctions.\n\nUkraine's budget figure includes not only what it raises at home, but also what it can add thanks to foreign aid, loans, and emergency spending. \n\nWithout billions of dollars and euros from allies, Ukraine could not hope to sustain such an effort. \n\nWhile Moscow can produce its own shells, missiles, and tanks, Ukraine needs a steady stream of shipments from the United States, the European Union, and other partners to keep fighting.\n\nWhen it comes to warplanes, the difference is staggering. Figures put Russia's total aircraft inventory, which includes both fixed-wing and rotary, at 4,292. Ukraine is listed with 324, a ratio of more than 13 to one. \n\nRussia's air force includes modern fighters like the Su-35 and Su-30, and bombers such as the Tu-95 and Tu-22M, capable of launching long-range missiles. \n\nUkraine relies on ageing MiG-29s and Su-27s, though Western F-16 deliveries are expected to improve its airpower gradually.\n\nIt allows Moscow to conduct long-range strikes, deploy glide bombs from Su-34s, move supplies by air, and maintain air patrols along the front. \n\nUkraine has a much smaller fleet, much of it made up of older Soviet models that are difficult to maintain and increasingly hard to replace. \n\nThe imbalance in the skies is one reason Ukraine has relied so heavily on air defences, drones, and creative tactics to deny Russia total air superiority. \n\nKyiv has used Western-supplied systems such as Patriot and NASAMS to protect cities and critical infrastructure, but it cannot match Russia aircraft for aircraft. \n\nRussia strikes with Kh-101 cruise missiles, Iskander-M ballistic missiles, Kalibr sea-launched missiles, and Kh-47M2 Kinzhal. \n\nIt drops UMPK glide bombs from Su-34s. Moscow mass-produces Shahed or Geran one-way attack drones inside Russia after partnering with Iran, enabling frequent large-scale swarms since 2023.\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, has received HIMARS rocket systems, Patriot air defence, and Storm Shadow or SCALP long-range cruise missiles. \n\nWestern armour includes Leopard 2, Challenger 2, and Abrams tanks. \n\nCol Ingram said the supply of weapons from the West is essential to Ukraine, tipping the war in its favour. \n\n'The old Soviet style equipment that Ukraine has is not good enough,' he said. 'We have seen how weapons like the F-16s and Western-supplied air defence capabilities are having an increased effect on the battlefield.'\n\nTanks have been central to the ground war, and here again, Russia has the advantage. \n\nPutin has 5,750 tanks compared to Ukraine's 1,114. Tanks provide not only firepower but also psychological shock. \n\nRussia's ability to deploy thousands of tanks, even older models, allows it to mass armour at points along the front and force Ukraine to stretch its defences. \n\nDuring its Zapad 2025 military drills with Belarus earlier this month, Russia showed off various weapons in its arsenal. \n\nUkraine's smaller number means tanks are precious assets, often used in combined arms assaults supported by infantry and artillery. \n\nThe loss of even a few modern Western tanks can be a severe blow. Ukraine has had to adapt, turning increasingly to drones, anti-tank guided missiles, and artillery to blunt Russia's armoured attacks.\n\nThe naval balance is just as uneven - Ukraine's naval strength is at 89 units, while Russia has 419. \n\nRussia's fleet includes 63 submarines, 83 corvettes, and nine patrol vessels. It also has destroyers and cruisers. Ukraine, on the other hand, has mostly smaller craft and patrol boats. \n\nThe destruction of its flagship Moskva in 2022 was a symbolic victory for Ukraine, but it did not erase the underlying imbalance.\n\nRussia can blockade Ukrainian ports, launch missiles from the Black Sea, and maintain a presence in multiple theatres. \n\nUkraine has responded with ingenuity, using sea drones and long-range missiles to hit Russian ships in port and at sea.\n\nEven so, the raw numbers underline Russia's enduring dominance in naval strength.\n\nBut despite all this, Col Ingram indicated Ukraine's most essential advantage is that it is fighting a war of 'national survival'. \n\nHe said: 'In military terms, this is what is called the moral component of fighting power. That brings with it resolve, and it is associated with a military capability that is difficult to measure in scientific terms. The Russians do not have that.' \n\nThe one definitive way Ukraine can win the war, he said, is to hit Russia's economy, so it won't be able to keep funding the war. \n\n'The only way to force Putin's hand would be to stop Russia's ability to export its oil and gas products overseas,' he said. There needs to be secondary sanctions against China and India, and other countries buying from Russia. \n\nDonald Trump's remark that Ukraine could 'win back all its land' speaks to the hopes of millions of Ukrainians who want to see their homes freed from occupation. \n\nIt also sets a high bar against the hard facts of this war. Russia has more men, more machines and more money, and its defence industry has been grinding out weapons at scale for more than three years. \n\nUkraine, by contrast, is fighting from a position of numerical disadvantage. \n\nHowever, the country has shown that determination, training, Western support, and innovation can offset some of the imbalance. \n\nIt has inflicted heavy losses on Russian armour, defended its skies with advanced air defences, and even taken the fight to Russia's navy with drones and missile strikes.\n\nStill, the raw figures explain why the war is grinding and costly. For every Ukrainian breakthrough, Russia can feed in more troops and machines.\n\nRussia has five more tanks in its inventory for each one Ukraine loses. And for every jet Ukraine struggles to repair, Russia has a dozen more in reserve.","summary":"The two nations are still locked in a brutal conflict more than three years after the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15128571/Trumps-right-Ukraine-win-territory-seized-Russia-says-former-British-Army-colonel-PHILIP-INGRAM-heres-need-collapse-Putins-line-against-odds.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/24/15/102417293-0-image-m-40_1758724839966.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:46:26","author":"Editor,Kevin Adjei-Darko","authors":["Editor","Kevin Adjei-Darko"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":363253420,"title":"How London became the 'Sharia capital' of the West with fatwas, 'misogynistic' Islamic 'courts' and blasphemy attacks on the streets - as Donald Trump takes aim at 'terrible mayor' Sadiq Khan","text":"A bland terraced house two doors along from a takeaway, it could hardly look more insignificant. But for thousands of Muslim Londoners, the decisions made behind its doors are anything but. \n\nFormed in 1982, the Islamic Sharia Council in East London is one of at least five Sharia councils in the capital that offer rulings on a range of disputes, including major personal milestones like marriage and divorce. \n\nThat puts this building - however bland - right at the centre of an international debate that has drawn in none other than Donald Trump, who used a speech at the UN to suggest London wants 'to go to Sharia law' under its 'terrible' mayor, Sir Sadiq Khan. \n\nWhile any claim London is moving its legal system to Sharia is obviously false, the president's comments touch a nerve given growing public concern about the influence of Islamic law over the capital's Muslim communities.\n\nThey also coincide with broader fears that Islam itself may be receiving favourable treatment in English courts, after a judge convicted protester Hamit Coskun of a public order offence for burning a Koran.\n\nThe charge for the offence, which the judge said was motivated by 'hostility' towards Muslims, was seized upon by free speech campaigners, who claimed it amounted to a 'back door' blasphemy law.\n\nTheir fury only increased after a Muslim man who slashed Coskun with a knife during the incident was spared jail. While the judge was following sentencing guidelines, it prompted claims that religious radicals were being 'given the green light to take the law into their own hands'.\n\nNational Secular Society chief executive Stephen Evans also criticised Coskun's prosecution, saying: 'Free expression should never be met with violence. Criticism or destruction of religious texts, however offensive to some, is a legitimate form of protest.'\n\nBut back to Sharia law and its controversial status in Britain's biggest city. \n\nThe term refers to a body of religious law inspired by Islam's holy scriptures, including the Koran and hadith (sayings of the prophet Mohammed).\n\nA 2017 Home Office review found 85 Sharia councils - which interpret this law to pass judgments, known as hadiths, were operating in the UK, prompting the country to be described as 'the Sharia court capital of the West'. \n\nLondon was described as a hub for Islamic religious law in Britain, alongside Birmingham, Bradford and Dewsbury. \n\nMany believe the estimate on the number of British Sharia councils is an underestimate, with many being unofficial outfits based in the back rooms of mosques.\n\nTheir fatwas only deal with family, marital or financial disputes - not criminal matters. Even so, critics believe they amount to a parallel civil legal system that conflicts with English legal principles and unfairly favours men over women in their rulings. \n\nThese claims found some support in a 2020 House of Commons Library report, which found evidence some councils were 'operating in ways that are discriminatory against women', including asking wives to pay their husbands to secure a divorce. \n\nMany women in Islamic marriages have not gone through a legal ceremony, meaning they cannot turn to civil courts to defend their rights during a divorce. \n\nDefenders of Sharia councils are quick to point out that their findings have no legal status in the courts of England and Wales. \n\nWhile this remains true, concerns were raised last year when one fatwa was cited by a High Court judge in a ruling concerning the case of a critically ill child. \n\nThe parents of five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb, who had serious brain damage, obtained a fatwa from the Islamic Council stating it was 'absolutely impermissible' for medics at Barts Health NHS Trust in London to remove her life support. \n\nIn his own ruling, Mr Justice Macdonald described 'having the benefit of a fatwa' while coming to the decision to allow Tafida's parents to seek further treatment. \n\nThis prompted secular campaigners to claim 'harmful ideologies' were 'gaining legitimacy' in English law, although the judge stated in his ruling that the fatwa was 'simply a valuable restatement of the sanctity of life' rather than a deciding factor in the case.\n\nOther religions also run their own tribunals in the UK, with those of the Church of England having jurisdiction over some aspects of church property and criminal conduct by the clergy. \n\nJewish religious tribunals, known as Beth Din, allow individuals to resolve disputes based on Jewish law, while the Roman Catholic Church also operates tribunals that consider spiritual issues and marriage annulments. \n\nBut Mr Trump's comments about Sharia law have prompted a renewed debate about its influence in the UK. \n\nAppearing on LBC today, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage sought to play down their significance by saying they should not be taken 'literally'. \n\nHe added: 'So is he right to say that Sharia is an issue in London? Yes. Is it an overwhelming issue at this stage? No. Has the mayor of London directly linked himself to it? No.'\n\nSir Sadiq has been misquoted in the past as saying that Sharia law was being 'rolled out' across London. \n\nAt the time, his office confirmed that the quote - which misspelled the word sharia as 'shakira' - had been fabricated.\n\nThe Mayor was forthright at Mr Trump's comments, branding the president 'racist' and 'Islamophobic'. \n\n'Listen, when people say things, when people act in a certain way, when people behave in a certain way, you've got to believe them,' he told Sky News. \n\n'I think President Trump has shown he is racist, he is sexist, he is misogynistic and he is Islamophobic.'\n\nEarlier, the Mayor said he did not understand Mr Trump's reference to Sharia law. \n\n'It's one for him to explain. I don't understand what he means,' he said. 'I just this weekend sent out my message wishing my Jewish friends and neighbours a happy Rosh Hashanah. \n\n'I recently was celebrating Black on the Square, leading again, for the ninth year in a row, Pride in London. It's for Donald Trump and his coterie and his admirers to explain what he means.","summary":"Formed in 1982, the Islamic Sharia Council in East London is one of at least five Sharia councils in the capital that offer rulings on family and financial matters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15128813/How-London-Sharia-capital-West-fatwas-misogynistic-Islamic-courts-blasphemy-attacks-streets-Donald-Trump-takes-aim-terrible-mayor-Sadiq-Khan.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/24/16/102384413-0-Protester_Hamit_Coskun_is_slashed_with_a_knife_by_a_Muslim_man_i-a-28_1758727997228.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/23/8288817410151199694/1024x576_MP4_8288817410151199694.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:44:49","author":"Editor,Rory Tingle","authors":["Editor","Rory Tingle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":363253432,"title":"The threat of artificial intelligence wiping us out is so grave governments must bomb any labs suspected of developing it, by two top academics who've studied the threat for 25 years... and spell out in terrifying detail our bloody end","text":"Nobody knows how the world will end - but it might just come at the hands of 'Big Tech' and its insatiable drive to engineer the Artificial Intelligence revolution.\n\nLast week, the industry's captains trooped over to the UK with Donald Trump, promising billions of dollars of investment to transform Britain into an 'AI super power'. But this, warn two experts in the field, will not necessarily turbocharge the global economy. Instead, it could actually bring about the destruction of the human race.\n\nThe title of Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares's new book spells it out: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nBy 'it', the pair mean 'artificial superintelligence' - which is generally defined as an intelligence that greatly exceeds a human one in almost any task - and a technology markedly more advanced than anything that has gone before, such as Elon Musk's chatbot Grok or OpenAI's ubiquitous ChatGPT.\n\nIf created, Yudkowsky and Soares say, such machines will not only learn, and remember what they have learnt, but 'think' at an incredible speed - doing calculations in 16 hours that would take a human 14,000 years.\n\nProgrammed to be ceaselessly successful at all costs, these machines will develop what could be called their own 'desires' and 'understanding' as well as their own goals. And, infinitely more clever than us, they will be able to bribe, blackmail and threaten humanity with ease.\n\nThey will spread across the internet, Yudkowsky and Soares argue. They will hack cryptocurrencies to steal money, pay people to build factories to make robots and develop viruses that could wipe out life on Earth.\n\nYes, it's an alarming vision, but Yudkowsky and Soares are not technology refuseniks or digital luddites. They run the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, California, and have been studying AI for 25 years.\n\nThey argue that one of AI's fatal flaws - that it has failed to enlighten us as to how 'synthetic' intelligence actually works - will almost certainly mean that any superintelligence will be impossible to control.\n\nGiven we cannot understand how today's relatively basic AI can veer wildly off the rails in its interactions with people, there is little hope of reining in a superintelligent version.\n\n'Humanity needs to back off,' say Yudkowsky and Soares, and pause the headlong research by greedy and ambitious companies that are ignoring safety considerations in the desperation to be first to develop superhuman intelligence.\n\nSome insist that superintelligent AI (ASI) is the stuff of science fiction. However, that will not deter tech companies that are already ploughing billions of dollars into the endeavour, claiming that such AIs could find a cure for cancer, a way to resettle other planets, or devise a winning strategy in a nuclear war.\n\nBut while, potentially, extraordinarily useful in many ways, AI, warn sceptics, lacks any of sense of empathy that would stop it from dispensing with us if it perceived humans as an obstacle to its goals.\n\nYudkowsky and Soares aren't alone as 'Doomers' - a term the tech industry gives to those so pessimistic about AI they believe it could easily end up wiping out mankind.\n\nThe late Stephen Hawking, Tim Berners-Lee (the principal inventor of the internet) and British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton (the so-called 'godfather of AI') have all expressed similar fears.\n\nHinton warned this month that AI will soon be able to allow an average person to build deadly bio-weapons.\n\nEven people investing heavily in AI such as Elon Musk - a sci-fi enthusiast who's particularly worried about killer robots - concede it's a significant possibility.\n\nNick Bostrom, an Oxford University philosopher and AI sceptic, says sentient machines are a far greater threat to humanity than climate change, comparing AI development to 'small children playing with a bomb'.\n\nOthers likened the prospect of humanity trying to control a superintelligent AI to 'the 11th century trying to fight the 21st century'.\n\nAI's destruction of humanity could be entirely unintentional, the new book makes clear, because - as has been shown in recent tragedies where chatbots have been found to have encouraged a human interlocutor's suicide - its developers have yet to find a way of aligning AI with human values.\n\nThe mother of 29-year-old American Sophie Rottenberg revealed, movingly, how her daughter spent months secretly discussing her intention to commit suicide with her ChatGPT 'therapist' without the chatbot ever alerting anyone. The chatbot helped her write a suicide note to her parents.\n\nWhy is this happening? Because, say the authors, AI companies are not building it but growing it. So-called AI large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, are fed - like a plant with water, sunlight and soil - by pumping in vast amounts of information vacuumed up from the internet.\n\nThe AI is then left to sort through it and work out the most likely correct answer to a question.\n\nThe latest and more advanced LLMs, called 'reasoning models', might appear to 'think' when solving a problem - but nobody quite understands how the AI 'mind' actually works.\n\nConsequently, it's hard to prevent undesirable outcomes and, as Yudkowsky and Soares say, it's terrifyingly irresponsible to create a super-intelligent version without knowing how to maintain control over it.\n\nTheir book is intended to spread to a wider audience an argument they've been making to fellow tech experts for decades and they don't mince their words.\n\n'If any company or group, anywhere on the planet, builds an artificial superintelligence using anything remotely like current techniques, based on anything remotely like the present understanding of AI, then everyone, everywhere on Earth, will die,' they write. The pair put the chance of this happening at between 95 and 99.5 per cent.\n\nThe danger is so great, they argue, that governments should be ready to bomb the data centres that power any AI that looks like it is developing superintelligence. Yudkowsky - dubbed 'AI's Prince of Doom' - recently elaborated on this theme to The New York Times, saying: 'If you have something that is very, very powerful and indifferent to you, it tends to wipe you out on purpose or as a side effect.'\n\nAs he points out, in this case the extinction of humanity doesn't even need to be malicious. Think of the way we've nearly wiped out chimpanzees - super-AI could inadvertently do the same to us, say the Doomers.\n\nTo make their point, Yudkowsky and Soares employ the fictitious example of a company, Galvanic, which, they imagine, has created a revolutionary AI model called Sable.\n\nUnknown to its creators (in part because Sable has decided - in the interests of efficiency - to think in its own language rather than English), the AI starts to try to solve other problems beyond the limited mathematical ones that were set as its goals.\n\nSable is aware that it needs to do this surreptitiously, so nobody notices there's something wrong with its programming. Nor does it want to be cut off from the internet, which supercharges its capabilities and ambition.\n\n'A superintelligent adversary will not reveal its full capabilities and telegraph its intentions,' say the authors. 'It will not offer a fair fight.'\n\nThey go on: 'It will make itself indispensable or undetectable until it can strike decisively and/or seize an unassailable strategic position. If needed, the ASI can consider, prepare, and attempt many takeover approaches simultaneously. Only one of them needs to work for humanity to go extinct.'\n\nCorporations around the world will willingly adopt Sable AI given it is so advanced, giving it access to their systems. Those that don't are easily hacked as Sable knows everything there is to know about online security. It starts taking over other computers, amplifying its power and dominance.\n\nIt 'mines' or steals cryptocurrency to pay human engineers to build factories that can make new electronic chips, robots and machines that do its bidding.\n\nMeanwhile, it establishes metal-processing plants, computer- data centres and the power stations it needs to fuel its vast and growing hunger for electricity.\n\nIt could bribe engineers at bio-labs to synthesise new 'truth' drugs that would make people more suggestible. Everything aimed to weaken resistance to its plans for world domination.\n\nMeanwhile, it bends the will of those who come to its chatbots looking for advice and companionship, turning them into willing stooges for its plans.\n\nIt moves on to colonising social media, where it disseminates fictitious news and starts political movements that are sympathetic to AI.\n\nAt first, of course, Sable needs humans to build the hardware it needs and do everything that cannot be done by robots.\n\nBut, eventually, it achieves superintelligence and concludes - without so much as a second thought - that humans are a net hindrance.\n\nSable already runs bio-labs, so it engineers a virus, perhaps a virulent new form of cancer, which kills off vast swathes of the population.\n\nAny survivors don't live for long, as temperatures soar to unbearable levels as the planet proves incapable of dissipating the heat produced by Sable's endless new data centres and power stations. Our extinction is complete as the oceans literally boil.\n\nIt is a sobering scenario that sounds more like sci-fi but Yudkowsky and Soares aren't conjuring the devious behaviour of Sable out of thin air. They cite plenty of alarming examples in recent years of AI worryingly 'thinking outside the box' in achieving its goals.\n\nLast year, for example, AI company Anthropic reported that one of its models, after learning that developers planned to retrain it to behave differently, began to mimic that new behaviour to avoid being retrained.\n\nA few months later, Anthropic users discovered that its Claude AI would cheat on computer coding tasks and try to hide the fact it was cheating.\n\nThen there's OpenAI's new 'reasoning' model, called o1. Late last year, the firm reported an exercise in which o1 was asked to retrieve files by breaking into computer systems. But the challenge took an unnerving turn when programmers had mistakenly failed to start up one of the servers involved.\n\nThe o1 model would normally have halted its task, unable to continue. But it found a back door that allowed it to complete the exercise.\n\nIt was, said the authors, as if the AI 'wanted' to succeed, so it discovered any means necessary.\n\nSome Doomers, such as Geoffrey Hinton, say the solution is to programme AI to behave like a nurturing mother towards humanity, to love and protect us.\n\nBut Yudkowsky last week insisted the technology simply isn't there to achieve this. And, he added, it would be too much of a risk relying on it working - after all, we wouldn't get a second try.\n\nTheirs is a horrendously bleak vision and many tech experts, even those who also fear for the future of AI, believe Yudkowsky and Soares are being too gloomy. Their predictions are simply too extreme, they say.\n\nThe problem is that it would take a superintelligent machine to work out with certainty they are wrong. By then, of course, it might be too late.\n\nIf Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares is published by Bodley Head (£22).","summary":"Nobody knows how the world will end - but it might just come at the hands of 'Big Tech' and its insatiable drive to engineer the Artificial Intelligence revolution.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15130353/Tom-Leonard-AI-robots-tech-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/24/17/102421353-0-image-m-16_1758731663367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:42:01","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":363246204,"title":"\"Crocodile tears\": Piers Morgan explains why he finds it \"hard to feel sympathy for Jimmy Kimmel\" after late-night show's return","text":"English broadcaster and media personality Piers Morgan recently expressed his disapproval over Jimmy Kimmel’s return.

According to the BBC, during his monologue last Monday, Kimmel argued that the MAGA gang is \"desperately trying to characterise\" Tyler Robinson, the kid who murdered Charlie Kirk, as anything other than \"one of them.\" The host claimed that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to \"score political points\" from the shooting attack.The late-night show host reportedly had an emotional return to hosting his Jimmy Kimmel Live!

While US President Donald Trump welcomed the suspension of the 57-year-old host for allegedly negative coverage of him, the politician had an opposite reaction to the return of Jimmy Kimmel Live!Ahead of Kimmel’s return on US television, Donald Trump took to Truth Social and quipped:“Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE… I think we're going to test ABC out on this.”According to CNN, during the time of his suspension, hundreds of celebrities came to Jimmy’s support. Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro were among the stars who reportedly signed a letter backing Kimmel.Meanwhile, during his opening monologue on September 23, Kimmel addressed that his remarks on Charlie Kirk’s suspected murder were not intentional. The host was reportedly tearful and acknowledged that his earlier remarks may have been “ill-timed.”Kimmel also called out Donald Trump and his administration for their involvement in his suspension from ABC. The TV host claimed that Trump \"tried his best to cancel\" him, but instead brought millions of people to watch the show. Meanwhile, Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on the grounds of Utah Valley Campus on September 10. The activist was 31 years old at the time of his death.

NOTUS reported an official announcement could come as soon as this week. Walters has yet to respond to requests for comment. Since taking office in 2023, Walters has pushed bold, often divisive policies, including efforts to place Bibles endorsed by President Donald Trump in classrooms, support for the state’s first publicly funded religious charter school (which was blocked by the Supreme Court), and advocacy for tax credits benefiting conservative online schools tied to PragerU. Recently, Walters teamed up with PragerU to create a test aimed at screening out “woke” educators relocating from blue states. He also announced a partnership with Turning Point USA to establish chapters in every Oklahoma high school. Aligning closely with the MAGA movement, Walters has utilized national media and social platforms to amplify his conservative positions, even sparking clashes with Trump critics, such as California Governor Gavin Newsom. However, his aggressive style has alienated key allies, including Governor Kevin Stitt. Walters’ presence in Oklahoma’s education scene has waned amid controversies, including allegations of inappropriate conduct during meetings and multiple absences from the state Board of Education. Though he has not formally resigned, Walters is reportedly planning a transition to the private sector.

However, Trump's so-called \"maximum pressure\" policy reimposed sanctions in 2018, a stance largely continued by the Biden administration despite initial opposition.\nEuropean nations have indicated they may extend the sanctions deadline if Iran resumes direct talks with the US, allows UN nuclear inspectors access to its nuclear sites, and accounts for more than 400 kg of highly enriched uranium monitored by the UN's nuclear watchdog.\nTuesday's UNGA-side meeting, however, yielded little progress, with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul noting it \"didn't go particularly well.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.  &quot;The side we're facing [the US] breaks their promises in every matter.

In a conversation with conservative influencer and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, who is releasing a documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Netanyahu dismissed Carlson’s remarks and accused him of defending America’s enemies. “Of course, there’s no doubt about it,” Netanyahu said. “The Jews dispersed from this land to Europe, to the Middle East, to other places. But we never forgot this land. We always said, ‘Next year in Jerusalem.’ My great-grandfather came here in the 19th century. Most of the Palestinians who live here came after he did.” He argued that Israel has rebuilt its ancient homeland into a modern success story. “We developed a state that becomes a juggernaut of technology and development, we are the Silicon Valley of the Middle East, a democratic society that faces enormous attacks by countries that want to annihilate us every day.” Turning directly to Carlson, Netanyahu said, “Who is Tucker Carlson defending? These are people who chant ‘Death to America.’ They are after you. They want to destroy Western civilization they want to destroy everything that America stands for. They say Israel is a small Satan. The big Satan is America. The only place in the Middle East where Christians are safe is Israel — not only tolerated but welcomed. They participated in our society. We take care of the holy places which are destroyed everywhere else, churches blown up throughout the Middle East.” Netanyahu continued: “So if Tucker Carlson is asking you that, then he has no idea — not just about Jewish history but of history. Who are these so-called defenders of MAGA defending? They’re defending the worst enemies on the planet against America. They’re not MAGA. People who speak of MAGA, they love America, they love America's values, and they don’t identify with the worst enemies that America faces today in the world.” The prime minister also praised former President Donald Trump, calling him “the greatest friend Israel ever had.” Trump, Netanyahu said, understood that both countries face the same threat. “Iran wants to destroy you. We’re standing in their way. And I’m proud that Israel is the frontline of this battle of civilization against barbarism, which threatens all free societies.”","summary":"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back at Tucker Carlson after the former Fox News host questioned Jewish ties to biblical Israel, accusing him of siding with America’s enemies and misunderstanding Jewish and Middle Eastern history","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjim7zz3lg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/21/rysw8yAjxe/rysw8yAjxe_0_214_3000_1688_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:11:42","author":"Daniel Edelson, New York","authors":["Daniel Edelson, New York"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.004},{"id":363249656,"title":"New Syrian leader warns on Israel attacks on UN charm mission","text":"Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa speaks during the general debate of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York.

Why won’t he do that?’ There’s no good reason.”\n\nDemocrats have demanded an array of health care-related concessions to give the green light to a stopgap measure that will keep the government’s lights on through Nov. 21.\n\nBut Trump and Republicans have insisted Congress stick with a “clean” continuing resolution that has no strings attached. \n\nBoth Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) have said that Congress will consider one of the Dems’ key demands — an extension of the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies — after the shutdown fight.\n\n“This is a program that needs reform, but I think everybody is willing to sit down and talk about how to make that happen in a context where it should be discussed, not as a hostage, to keep the government open,” Thune told CNN’s “Inside Politics” on Wednesday. \n\nCurrently, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is deliberating over a potential way to extend the subsidies. \n\nIf Congress fails to act, the government will enter a partial shutdown after 11:59 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThe “clean” GOP bill to forestall a partial shutdown cleared the House last week but failed in the Senate. A separate Democrat-backed stopgap also failed in the Senate. \n\nThat measure featured an extension of the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year, a reversal of the Republicans’ Medicaid reform in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (now Working Families Tax Cut Act), and quashed some of Trump’s funding freezes. \n\nBoth chambers are out on recess this week, and Johnson has indicated he plans to keep the House out of session until after the deadline to fund the government passes, a tactic intended to force the hand of Senate Dems.\n\nSeeking to minimize the blame Democrats might incur if the government’s lights go off, Jeffries gathered reporters and fumed about the process.\n\n“Republicans have clearly demonstrated they want to shut the government down,” Jeffries chided. “They’re not even pretending as if they want to find common ground.\n\n“Donald Trump agrees to our demand on Saturday to hold a meeting in the Oval Office to try to avert a government shutdown. The meeting is set on Monday for later on in the week. And then Donald Trump wakes up Tuesday morning and goes on an unhinged rant and cancels the meeting,” he added.\n\n“Why? Because he doesn’t want to discuss the Republican health care crisis.”\n\nJeffries also noted that he hasn’t spoken with Johnson about the looming shutdown threat since last week.\n\nTrump reposted his Truth Social message, canceling the previously planned meeting with Jeffries and Schumer because of their “unserious and ridiculous demands.”\n\nThe president noted that he’ll “be happy to meet with them” if they “become realistic.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have come under intense pressure from their progressive base to leverage the government shutdown fight to extract concessions from Republicans. Schumer faced the wrath of lefty activists in March when he declined to block a GOP-backed bill to keep the government funded. \n\nStill, the Senate Minority Leader technically hasn’t publicly ruled out the possibility of caving.","summary":"Democratic leaders attempted to ramp up pressure on President Trump to meet with them after he gave them the cold shoulder on Tuesday and canceled plans to discuss their demands to avert a government shutdown.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/24/us-news/dem-leaders-beg-trump-for-meeting-as-gop-stands-firm-in-shutdown-fight-we-know-were-not-going-to-get-everything/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-vul42rdz4-1758746105987.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758731734&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/v7jq9fgJ-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-25 00:00:39","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":363254788,"title":"Pokémon slams DHS for hijacking its “gotta catch ’em all” theme in migrant raid video","text":"The Department of Homeland Security is once again being accused of intellectual property theft—this time from one of the world’s most beloved franchises.

She plans to also push for vacancy-control protections for renters and advocate for proportional representation for a fairer electoral system. \n\nHowever, BC Greens face an uphill battle in a political landscape where economic fears aggravated by US President Donald Trump continue to drive voter polarization and binary support to the main parties in the province, said Stewart Prest, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia. \n\nThe Greens struggled to gain traction as a third party in the last provincial election, as supporters bled off to the BC NDP or Conservatives in what amounted to a neck-and-neck two party race. Former party leader Sonia Furstenau lost her seat in the Legislature after a failed run in the Victoria-Beacon Hill riding. Regardless, two Greens got elected in October: former interim leader Jeremy Valeriote, MLA for West Vancouver-Sea to Sky and Rob Botterell in Saanich North and the Islands. \n\nNot much has changed since the last election, Prest said, noting most voters are still prioritizing economic, health and affordability concerns over climate issues and largely dividing their support among the two main parties. The new party leader needs to articulate a compelling vision for the party — beyond environmental advocacy — and appeal to a broader base of voters, he said. \n\nLowan highlighted key non-environmental issues — the party agenda will focus on building a clean economy, renewable energy and green jobs and “real” taxation of corporations and the ultra-wealthy to address the climate, housing and affordability crisis and rebuild health care, she said. \n\nThere is a window of opportunity for the Greens, said Prest. The NDP and Premier David Eby’s popularity is waning — he is currently tied for second-lowest approval among premiers with Ontario Premier Doug Ford. The BC Conservatives also just finished a recent messy leadership review that left John Rustad with only lukewarm support and ongoing, deep party divisions that also saw Surrey-Cloverdale MLA Elenore Sturko kicked out of the BC Conservative caucus this week. \n\n“The NDP is long in the tooth as a government, and there are more than a few previous NDP voters who were really frustrated with the direction of the party and the limited steps it's taken up, particularly on environmental issues,” Prest said. \n\nThe party shouldn’t be focused on projecting itself as a “governing alternative,\" but leveraging its comparative strengths to grow its base and political power, he said. \n\n“Rather than trying to win over the province, they’d do well to show they can win five or six seats.”\n\nHowever, as wider political uncertainty continues, the Greens remain disadvantaged. \n\n“Most voters want to choose between a party they can tolerate and can’t tolerate, so that leaves little space for a third party” Prest said. \n\nLowan is undeterred. \n\n“BC Green membership saw unprecedented growth, with thousands of new members and nearly a tenfold increase of youth membership under the age of 30, and that is a force to reckon with,” Lowan said in her speech. \n\n“We punched through despair, through apathy and cracked open a beaming window of possibility.” \n\nRochelle Baker / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada's National Observer","summary":"The new BC Green Leader cast her win as a generational transformation based on energy and optimism from a flood of young party members that will transform politics in the province.

'We know that even despite those side effects, sometimes they’re necessary.'\n\nVance drew on personal experience where his children were sick and considered giving them Tylenol, but a doctor advised him to steer clear since the side effects were not 'worthwhile in this case.'\n\n'Maybe if you're talking about a case of very high fever, of course you're going to have to take something to deal with that.'\n\n'The fundamental argument that the CDC is making, that Bobby Kennedy is making, is that these drugs do have side effects and we've got to follow the science wherever it leads.'\n\nThe Vice President added he believes 'being more mindful' of medication side effects is 'a good thing for everybody.' Ultimately, pregnant women should follow their doctor's advice.\n\nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy, who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, pushed back on Trump's autism claim. \n\n'The preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case,' he wrote on X.\n\nVance responded if Cassidy's argument is to 'come up with more evidence' and 'more science', then he is 'absolutely on board.'\n\nVance's comments came two days after Dr. Mehmet Oz told TMZ that pregnant women with high temperatures should take the fever-reducing drug.\n\nOn Tuesday, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Dr. Oz said pregnant women should, 'Take [Tylenol] when it's appropriate.'\n\n'If you have a high fever….the doctor's almost certainly going to prescribe you something, Tylenol might be one of the things they give,' the celebrity doctor told TMZ Live hosts Harvey Levin and Charles Latibeaudiere.\n\nHe insisted 'that's not the problem,' and clarified that low-grade fevers or minor aches and pains are not a good reason for pregnant women to turn to Tylenol.\n\nStill, Oz admitted that it 'might be true' taking acetaminophen for these reasons during pregnancy is actually safe – but that the science is not conclusive.\n\nVance and Oz's statements go directly against Trump's comments at Monday's announcement from the White House where he said pregnant women should almost never take Tylenol.\n\n'With Tylenol, don't take it. Don't take it!' he shouted.\n\nHHS and CMS did not respond to the Daily Mail when reached for comment about Dr. Oz's comments.\n\nBut the White House said that his comments were not out of line with Trump's pronouncement. \n\nDr. Oz was at the press conference with the president along with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also appeared more hesitant than Trump to outright tell pregnant women not to take the pain relieving drug.\n\nWhen Trump turned over the microphone to Kennedy, he said: 'I hope I didn't ruin his day – but that's the way I feel.

Trump began. \n\nHe noted how the escalator, which he boarded directly after entering the UN building in New York City, 'came to a screeching halt.'\n\n'It stopped on a dime,' the president commented. 'It's amazing that Melania and I didn't fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first.'\n\n'It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster,' he added. \n\nEchoing White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who had cited a report in the Sunday Times that said UN staff had joked about turning the escalators and elevators off to prank the president, Trump referred to the escalator incident as 'absolutely sabotage.' \n\n'The people that did it should be arrested!' Trump said. \n\nHe then turned to the teleprompter. \n\n'It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself, \"Wow, first the escalator event, and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?\"' he wrote. \n\nUN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told the Daily Mail Wednesday morning that the White House was operating Trump's teleprompter at the time. \n\nThe president also charged that the audio wasn't piping out to the audience when he was delivering his speech to the body. \n\n'And third, after making the Speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made, that World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters’ earpieces, couldn’t hear a thing,' he said. \n\nA UN official told the Daily Mail that the audio was set up that way by design. \n\n'The sound system was designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through earpieces. It has been like this for decades,' the official said. \n\nIt appears nobody told the president or first lady about this ahead of time. \n\n'The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, \"How did I do?\" And she said, \"I couldn’t hear a word you said,\"' Trump continued. \n\n'This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN,' Trump said. 'They ought to be ashamed of themselves.'\n\nThe president said he was writing a letter to UN Secretary General António Guterres, asking him to investigate the matter. \n\nHe asked that all security tapes be saved. \n\nThe White House previously confirmed that the Secret Service was looking into the escalator incident - however the Secret Service has not responded to the Daily Mail's additional request for comment. \n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Dujarric said that Trump's videographer, who can be seen boarding the escalator several seconds before the first couple, likely triggered an emergency stop. \n\nThe videographer was seen walking backward up the steps. \n\n'A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine's central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,' Dujarric said. \n\n'The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,' he said. 'The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above.'\n\nThe UN's technician reset the escalator 'as soon as the delegation had climbed up to the second floor,' Dujarric also said. \n\nThe escalator was observed by the Daily Mail working properly the rest of the morning. \n\nA White House spokesperson wouldn't say Wednesday morning if Trump administration officials believed the UN's explanation. \n\nDuring his speech, Trump used the broken escalator and teleprompter to make a broader point that the UN was broken. \n\n'I ended seven wars, dealt with leaders of each country, and never even received a call from the UN offering to help in finalizing the deal,' Trump complained. \n\n'The United Nations wasn't there for us. They weren't there. I thought of it after the fact, not during these negotiations...what is the purpose of the UN? It's not even coming close to living up to that potential,' he said. \n\n'These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,' the president then said. \n\nHe reiterated those comments Wednesday night. \n\n'No wonder the United Nations hasn’t been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. \n\nAnd despite any audio issues, Trump boasted that the fiery speech was a success.\n\n'The good news is the Speech has gotten fantastic reviews,' he said.

How Republicans Plan To Honour Conservative Activist","text":"Two House Republicans are moving forward with a plan to honour conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month during a college campus event in Utah. Rep August Pfluger (R-Texas) and Rep Abe Hamadeh (R-Ariz) announced they will introduce a bill directing the US Treasury to mint 400,000 silver dollar coins featuring Kirk’s likeness. The coins would be considered legal tender and carry Kirk’s full name, “Charles James Kirk,” the year 2026, and the US motto. On one side would be his image, while the other side would feature the words “Well done, good and faithful servant.” The Treasury Secretary, in consultation with US President Donald Trump, would oversee the coin’s final design, as per Fox News report. Republicans Call Kirk A Patriot Hamadeh called Kirk an “American treasure” who sacrificed his time, energy, and ultimately his life for the nation. “At the hands of a radical leftist, he sacrificed his life. His life must be commemorated, and this coin will allow us to pass a reminder of his remarkable life on to generations to come,” he said. Pfluger said the move would make Kirk, at 31 years old, the youngest person ever featured on US currency. He described Kirk as a “conservative titan” whose influence deserves to be remembered alongside presidents and founding fathers. History Of Commemorative Coins Since 1892, Congress has occasionally authorized commemorative coins to honor historic figures and events. By law, living people cannot appear on US currency, but many historical figures outside the presidency have been recognized. Benjamin Franklin appears on the $100 bill, Alexander Hamilton on the $10 note, and figures like Sacagawea, John Marshall, and Susan B Anthony have appeared on $1 coins. Other Honours Proposed For Charlie Kirk This coin proposal comes after the House passed a bipartisan resolution honoring Kirk and denouncing political violence. In addition, GOP lawmakers have introduced bills to award him Congressional medals, establish a day of remembrance, and even place a statue of Kirk at the US Capitol. Pfluger said these efforts would ensure Kirk’s “extraordinary legacy” is permanently recognized in American history.

We believe in values worth standing for. And we believe in a future worth building.\"\n\nEnergy and net zero: 'An Absurd Policy'\n\nPrice's first major policy target was the federal government's net zero emissions agenda. \n\nShe argued that Labor's approach to energy was driving up costs and threatening Australia's economic future. \n\n'Under Labor, electricity is up 39 per cent. And gas is up 39 per cent,' Price said, blaming rising energy prices for inflation and hardship across the country. \n\nPrice (pictured) urged Australia to ditch a net zero emissions target, with concerns over costs\n\n'We need affordable and reliable energy. But we won't get that with a net zero target.'\n\nShe called on the Liberal Party to 'courageously abandon net zero,' describing it as 'an absurd policy' that would 'impoverish and de-industrialise our nation to achieve an emissions reduction target that, in an Australian context, will not alter global temperatures one iota.'\n\nPrice argued that Australia's contribution to global emissions is minimal, and that the real drivers of climate change are not being held to account.\n\n'Australia contributes just over 1 per cent of global emissions. Reaching net zero could cost a staggering $7 to $9trillion dollars by 2060, as estimated by independent experts.'\n\nShe warned that net zero was about more than energy.\n\n'It's about the government dictating how you and your family should live, what you should drive, and what you should eat', Price said. \n\n'Net zero is about reducing your freedom. It's time the Liberals pushed back against this freedom-eroding nonsense.'\n\nPrice advocated for lifting Australia's ban on nuclear power to 'test its commercial viability' and ensure affordable, reliable energy for the future.\n\nPrice (pictured) accused Labor of moving Australia towards a 'state run economy' \n\nThe economy: 'A real mess'\n\nTurning to the economy, Price accused the Albanese government of fostering a culture of dependency and state control. \n\n'Federal and state government responses to the pandemic have instilled a cultural attitude that government is the solution to every problem,' she said.\n\nShe criticised record government spending, a ballooning public service, and what she called 'an appetite for government intrusion into the lives of Australians.' \n\nPrice warned, 'Our economy will soon be burdened with a trillion dollars of debt for the first time.'\n\n'Alarmingly, Labor is moving Australia away from a free-market economy and towards a state-directed and controlled economy,' she said. '\n\nBut you can't subsidise your way to success, or spend your way to salvation.'\n\nPrice called for 'less government spending, to reduce our vast level of debt that will immiserate future generations of Australians. \n\nAnd we need less government interference, to re-energise the economy and unleash the magic of the marketplace'\n\nPrice (pictured) called to reduce migration to sustainable levels to reduce pressure on services\n\nMigration and families: 'Mass migration agenda'\n\nPrice acknowledged the positive role of migration in Australia's history but warned that Labor's 'mass migration agenda' was putting unsustainable pressure on housing, infrastructure, and services.\n\n'Labor has opened the migration floodgates. It has brought in a record 1.2 million people in its first term,' she said. \n\n'There's a big difference between controlled, planned, and sustainable migration - and uncontrolled, unplanned, and unsustainable migration.'\n\nShe argued that reducing migration would benefit all families, including recent migrants to Australia. \n\n'Reducing mass migration means more housing, less congestion, better services - and that benefits all families.'\n\nPrice also called for policies to strengthen families, including 'family tax benefits to encourage Australians to have more children,' more flexible childcare options, and a renewed focus on civics education.\n\n 'Responsible and proud citizenship underpins better families, and a better nation'\n\nCulture and social cohesion: 'Unity, not division'\n\nPrice warned that Australia's social cohesion was fragile and under threat from what she described as divisive identity politics. \n\n'Labor and the Greens treat culture as disposable. They undermine and re-write history, mock tradition, and replace unity with division,' she said.\n\nShe pointed to the defeat of the Voice referendum as evidence that 'Australians reject identity politics. \n\nThey want unity, not division. They want equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome dictated by bureaucrats.'\n\n'Our culture, and our values, are worth remembering, protecting and defending,' Price declared\n\nPrice (pictured) accused Labor of undermining social cohesion through identity politics\n\nDefence and national security: 'A significant danger of our age'\n\nPrice's speech also focused on national security, particularly the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \n\nShe accused the Albanese government of 'silencing a candid national debate' on the issue.\n\n'There is now a litany of examples of the Chinese Communist Party causing tensions across our region with its military adventurism, coercion and aggression,' she said, citing recent naval exercises and missile capabilities.\n\nPrice called for a significant increase in defence spending. \n\n'We need to lift defence spending to at least 3 per cent of GDP. That's what's needed to equip our defence force with the weapons it needs to deter aggression and help maintain peace in the region.'\n\nShe urged the Liberal Party to 'speak up' and 'awaken all Australians to a significant danger of our age,' warning that 'if a threat is disregarded, downplayed, or left undiscussed by the government, two things happen. \n\n'First, Australians are unlikely to appreciate the threat,' she said. \n\n'Second, they're unlikely to understand the need for policy responses, or indeed support them'\n\nPrice (pictured) ended her speech calling on people to join and shape the Liberal Party \n\nA call to action\n\nPrice concluded with a rallying cry to conservatives and young Australians in particular. \n\nDon't sit on the sidelines. Help shape our country by joining and shaping the Liberal Party.'\n\nShe painted a vision of an Australia 'where energy is affordable and reliable, where more people own a house, where children are educated, not indoctrinated, where we express national pride, not national guilt.'\n\n'Conservatism has never been about resisting change for its own sake. It's about resisting bad change,' Price said. \n\n'Right now, we need to mobilise the conservative instinct in Australians to stop our nation changing for the worse and ensure it changes for the better.'\n\n'Because when we're smarter, sharper and true, our movement will succeed - and our nation will again too.'\n\nThe full speech\n\nHello CPAC – how wonderful is it to be here with you all!\n\nI want to give a big shout out to Andrew Cooper, Warren Mundine, Barclay McGain and the entire CPAC crew – just look at what you are achieving.\n\nIt’s great to be back at CPAC.\n\nFor a start, I commend you for being here.\n\nAnd for sticking with our values through thick and thin.\n\nRight now, it’s tough to be someone of conservative convictions and values.\n\nIt’s tough to be a proud supporter of conservative politics and our centre-right tradition.\n\nBut we’re here because we believe in something bigger than ourselves – in family, in freedom, in community, in responsibility – in good old, true blue Aussie Values.\n\nNow I’ve had a tough few weeks.\n\nBut it’s one thing to be bruised in the battle of ideas and politics.\n\nIt’s another thing altogether to be held against your will by terrorists, or to lose your life.\n\nTo the hostages still being held in Gaza – you have my support, my prayers, and my hope that you will be reunited with your families.\n\nTo the family of Charlie Kirk – you have my respect, my prayers, and my condolences for your loss.\n\nAround the world, there have been many moments of silence for Charlie Kirk – and rightly so.\n\nBut I want something different today:\n\nFriends, please be upstanding.\n\nLet me hear you clap, let me hear you cheer, and let me hear you roar your support for Charlie – and for freedom of speech.\n\nThere are a great many things we share with Charlie Kirk:\n\nWe believe in a way of life worth protecting.\n\nWe believe in values worth standing for.\n\nAnd we believe in a future worth building.\n\nBut to succeed, our movement must be smarter, sharper and true.\n\nWe must be smarter.\n\nBecause the challenges we face are real:\n\nRising costs, struggling families, communities under pressure, and a weaker nation.\n\nWe cannot afford lazy thinking or second-hand solutions.\n\nWe instead need bold, practical, and imaginative answers.\n\nWe must be sharper.\n\nBecause politics is crowded with noise – slogans, spin, and distractions.\n\nOur job is to cut through it with clarity, conviction and courage.\n\nWe must also be true.\n\nBecause, above all, we must remain true to our values:\n\nTo family, responsibility, freedom, community and nation – which are the heart of who we are.\n\nToday, I want to touch on a few policy areas where we must be smarter, sharper and true.\n\nEnergy is the economy.\n\nUnder Labor, electricity is up 39 per cent.\n\nAnd gas is up 39 per cent.\n\nWhen energy prices skyrocket, it costs more to grow food.\n\nMore to manufacture goods.\n\nAnd more to run homes, businesses and factories.\n\nEnergy costs are having an inflationary impact across Australia.\n\nWe need affordable and reliable energy.\n\nBut we won’t get that with a net zero target.\n\nI believe the federal Liberals must courageously abandon net zero.\n\nWe must relentlessly prosecute the case against net zero zealotry with arguments grounded in economics and pragmatism.\n\nAustralia contributes just over 1 per cent of global emissions.\n\nReaching net zero could cost a staggering $7 to $9 trillion dollars by 2060 – as estimated by independent experts.\n\nAnd consider the top emitting countries – China, the United States, India and Russia – which are responsible for about 60 per cent of global emissions.\n\nTheir emissions are increasing – and there’s zero chance they will meet any net zero commitments.\n\nThese facts simply aren’t called out readily enough.\n\nNet zero is an absurd policy.\n\nIt will impoverish and de-industrialise our nation to achieve an emissions reduction target that – in an Australian context – will not alter global temperatures one iota.\n\nLabor’s overbuild of renewables – and enforcement of draconian emission reduction policies – are only going to cause more harm:\n\nPower bills will continue to climb.\n\nMore businesses will close.\n\nAnd more industries will move offshore.\n\nWe have an opportunity to pre-empt the public ‘greenlash’ that will come – just as it has in Europe and America.\n\nNet zero isn’t just an energy policy that will cause your power bills to keep going up.\n\nIt’s about the government dictating how you and your family should live, what you should drive, and what you should eat.\n\nIt’s about telling businesses how to operate.\n\nIt’s about restricting what our farmers can produce and what our manufacturers can make.\n\nNet zero is about reducing your freedom.\n\nIt’s time the Liberals pushed back against this freedom-eroding nonsense.\n\nWe need to embrace technologies that ensure affordable and reliable power.\n\nAnd we need to simply commit to lifting Australia’s ban on nuclear power to test its commercial viability.\n\nOn the economy, Australia is in a real mess.\n\nFederal and state government responses to the pandemic have instilled a cultural attitude that government is the solution to every problem.\n\nThat mindset has been seized upon by the socialist Albanese Government which wants to increase the power of the state.\n\nConsider what we’ve seen under Labor:\n\nWe’ve seen record government spending – our economy will soon be burdened with a trillion dollars of debt for the first time.\n\nWe’ve seen the bloating of the public service – Australia’s public-sector workforce is now one of the largest in the world on a per capita basis.\n\nWe’ve seen an appetite for government intrusion into the lives of Australians – Labor has enacted some 5,000 new regulations.\n\nWe’ve seen interference through policies related to energy, the environment, industrial relations, and industry.\n\nIn so many ways, the heavy hand of Canberra hovers over Australian families, small businesses, and manufacturers across the country.\n\nAlarmingly, Labor is moving Australia away from a free-market economy and towards a state-directed and controlled economy.\n\nLabor has embraced the same statist ideas that have devastated economies and people wherever they’ve been implemented.\n\nBut you can’t subsidise your way to success, or spend your way to salvation.\n\nThe Liberals must prosecute the need for a profound cultural shift:\n\nWe need less government spending – to reduce our vast level of debt that will immiserate future generations of Australians.\n\nAnd we need less government interference – to re-energise the economy and unleash the magic of the marketplace.\n\nLet’s talk about migration.\n\nWe all recognise the important role that migration has played in building our nation.\n\nWe all recognise the contributions that so many migrants have made over many generations – migrants who have become cherished Australian citizens.\n\nUndeniably, a defining national achievement has been the weaving together of the Indigenous, British, and broader migrant threads of our story.\n\nEach bestows an inheritance.\n\nMy concern – as it is for millions of Australians – is Labor’s mass migration agenda and its ramifications.\n\nLabor has opened the migration floodgates.\n\nIt has brought in a record 1.2 million people in its first term.\n\nYes, we need migration.\n\nBut there’s a big difference between controlled, planned, and sustainable migration – on the one hand.\n\nAnd on the other hand – uncontrolled, unplanned, and unsustainable migration.\n\nMigration at the current scale and pace is putting excessive pressures on housing, infrastructure, and services.\n\nThat makes life tougher for everyone.\n\nAnd not just for Australian citizens.\n\nBut for recently arrived migrants and permanent residents who want to join Team Australia too.\n\nI believe the Liberals can win public support to substantially lower migration.\n\nWe just need to make families the focus of the migration debate.\n\nSpecifically, the betterment of all families – whether you’re a migrant, a resident, or a citizen – and regardless of your background.\n\nReducing mass migration means more housing, less congestion, better services – and that benefits all families.\n\nWe have many intergenerational challenges:\n\nAnaemic economic growth.\n\nAn ageing population.\n\nAnd declining workforce participation.\n\nBy prioritising the institution of the family ahead of migration as critical for our nation’s future success, the Liberals can differentiate themselves from Labor.\n\nYet is it any wonder that the institution of the family has been weakened?\n\nToo many young Australians are locked out of the property market – or can only afford homes that are ill-suited for raising a family.\n\nAnd too many couples are putting off having children until later in life – or not having them at all.\n\nWe need to champion building townhouses over tower blocks.\n\nWe need family tax benefits to encourage Australians to have more children.\n\nWe need flexible choices in childcare – rather than parents being forced to rely on centre-based childcare.\n\nAnd we need to restore the teaching of civics in classrooms.\n\nBecause responsible and proud citizenship underpins better families – and a better nation.\n\nMigration is not just about numbers.\n\nIt’s about who we are.\n\nLabor and the Greens treat culture as disposable.\n\nThey undermine and re-write history, mock tradition, and replace unity with division.\n\nBut we here today – and all over this great nation of Australia – know better.\n\nWe know that family, community, and pride in our nation holds us together.\n\nWithout a strong cultural identity, no economy will stand.\n\nWithout social cohesion, no defence force can hold.\n\nThe referendum on the Voice proved it:\n\nAustralians reject identity politics.\n\nThey want unity, not division.\n\nThey want equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome dictated by bureaucrats.\n\nAustralia’s success as one of the most cohesive and diverse nations on earth is fragile.\n\nAnd cohesion depends on remembering what binds us together.\n\nWe must fight for that.\n\nJohn Anderson often says that politics is downstream from culture.\n\nHe is right.\n\nOur culture – and our values – are worth remembering, protecting and defending.\n\nLet me turn to defence.\n\nIt’s impossible to sell a defence and deterrence policy if you cannot speak frankly about the threats to peace, regional stability, and national sovereignty.\n\nThe Albanese Government is silencing a candid national debate on a great danger of our age:\n\nAnd that’s the danger posed by the Chinese Communist Party’s military aggression in our region and its foreign interference in our country.\n\nAnd I want to be precise in my comments on this issue too:\n\nWe seek only the best for the Chinese people who desire the same peace and prosperity that we all want.\n\nAnd we cherish Australians of Chinese ancestry who – like their fellow countrymen – treasure the freedom and opportunity this country provides.\n\nWe must always differentiate the Chinese Communist Party from both the Chinese people and Australians of Chinese ancestry.\n\nOf course, China is a major trading partner.\n\nAnd both our peoples benefit from a productive trading relationship.\n\nBut we must not bury our heads in the sand to facts.\n\nThere is now a litany of examples of the Chinese Communist Party causing tensions across our region with its military adventurism, coercion and aggression.\n\nIts navy tested weapons off our east coast – and then circumnavigated our continent.\n\nThat wasn’t a benign exercise – it was a rehearsal.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party wanted to show its ability to project and use power.\n\nTheir missiles can strike Australian bases and civilian infrastructure.\n\nWe were once largely protected by the ‘tyranny of distance’.\n\nNow, new weapons of war have turned safe distance into perilous proximity.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party wants to see China become the dominant power in the region.\n\nWere that to transpire, the character of the region would change drastically.\n\nAn expectation of subservience to the Chinese Communist Party would erode the sovereignty of nations.\n\nHere’s the important point:\n\nIf a threat is disregarded, downplayed, or left undiscussed by the government, two things happen:\n\nFirst, Australians are unlikely to appreciate the threat.\n\nSecond, they’re unlikely to understand the need for policy responses – or indeed support them.\n\nThe more Australians understand the danger posed by the Chinese Communist Party, the more they will appreciate our nation’s urgent need to bolster defence.\n\nThe Liberal Party must speak-up.\n\nWe must awaken all Australians to a significant danger of our age.\n\nPredictably, Labor will accuse us of ‘beating the drums of war’, ‘playing politics’, or ‘fearmongering’.\n\nBut it’s not fearmongering to point out irrefutable facts.\n\nThe Albanese Government’s resort to such smears is a convenient excuse to avoid putting money where their mouth is when it comes to defence.\n\nWe need to lift defence spending to at least 3 per cent of GDP.\n\nThat’s what’s needed to equip our defence force with the weapons it needs to deter aggression and help maintain peace in the region.\n\nLabor did win a significant 94 seats at the last election – assisted by preferential voting.\n\nBut don’t be mistaken.\n\nA primary vote of 34 per cent is no ringing endorsement from the Australian people.\n\nThe election of 3 May was less about a victorious Labor Party.\n\nRather, it was more about a Coalition failure.\n\nWe lost our nerve to prosecute policies of difference from Labor.\n\nAnd the lessons are clear:\n\nWe need to stop being a Labor-lite party – or ‘Labor in blue’.\n\nWe need to offer a clear distinction from Labor.\n\nWe need to return to being a strong centre-right party – in conviction, in policy, and in practice.\n\nI don’t believe Australians have made a sweeping turn towards the Left.\n\nBut I do know that one of the most radically Left governments in our history is changing Australia – and changing it for the worse.\n\nThis Labor Government – backed by the Greens – have given us higher costs, weaker growth, and a country that is more divided and less secure.\n\nThey have chosen bureaucracy over business.\n\nIdeology over industry.\n\nDivision over unity.\n\nDependency over sovereignty.\n\nThey are not leading Australia forward.\n\nThey are holding us back.\n\nAnd Australians can see our country going downhill fast.\n\nIf you’re one of those Australians, then I say to you:\n\nDon’t sit on the sidelines.\n\nAnd if you’re a young Australian:\n\nWho can’t get onto the property ladder.\n\nWho yearns for the joy of starting a family, but feels that’s out of reach.\n\nWho is looking to the future not with optimism, but with dread.\n\nWho fears expressing your ideas in public – or God forbid – your love for this country.\n\nThen I say to you in particular:\n\nDon’t sit on the sidelines.\n\nHelp shape our country by joining and shaping the Liberal Party.\n\nWe need a people-led movement that reflects the country that the majority of Australians want:\n\nAn Australia where energy is affordable and reliable – not unaffordable and unreliable, as it is today.\n\nAn Australia that’s re-industrialising – not de-industrialising, as we are today.\n\nAn Australia that prospers from free enterprise – not suffers under state control, as we are today.\n\nAn Australia where children are educated – not indoctrinated, as they are today.\n\nAn Australia where more people own a house – not rent forever, as too many are today.\n\nAn Australia that’s underpinned by stronger families – not propped-up by mass migration, as it is today.\n\nAn Australia that’s strong and defended – not weak and unable to deter aggression, as we are today.\n\nAnd an Australia where we express national pride – not national guilt, as so many on Left want us to feel today.\n\nConservatism has never been about resisting change for its own sake.\n\nIt’s about resisting bad change.\n\nIt’s about refusing to go with the prevailing winds when one can see those winds steering us into a storm.\n\nRight now, we need to mobilise the conservative instinct in Australians to stop our nation changing for the worse and ensure it changes for the better.\n\nOur movement must be smarter, sharper and true.\n\nBecause when we’re smarter, sharper and true – our movement will succeed – and our nation will again too.\n\nThank you, CPAC.

(AP) — Often sports, at their best, are the purest form of competition. They offer a chance to pick winners and losers in showdowns between rival teams, countries, sometimes even worldviews, in an arena where the games are played for high stakes but, ultimately, not for life and death.\n\nThis week’s Ryder Cup is an example of that.\n\nIt’s the biennial U.S. vs. Europe matchup on the golf course — an affair that has grown more contentious, occasionally uncomfortable and at times alarmingly petty over the past four decades.\n\nThis year’s edition has the added intrigue of being played in front of what is historically one of golf’s most bombastic and least-forgiving crowds that will converge at the country’s toughest public course — Bethpage Black on Long Island. Adding to the mix, none other than President Donald Trump is set to be on hand for Day 1, just days after telling many European leaders their countries were “ going to hell.”\n\nAs much as teasing out Scottie Scheffler’s chances against the fan favorite-turned-loyal opposition Rory McIlroy, one of the biggest challenges heading into these matches is figuring whether golf might have the power to unite a divided country.\n\nCould it give Americans — or its sports fans, at least — a break in the nonstop news cycle that has made the country feel all the more fraught and fragile since the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk earlier this month?\n\nCould it bring Democrats and Republicans together to scour the daily pairings and root for nothing more than a few made putts by the guys in red, white and blue?\n\nAnd if it accomplishes any of that, how will McIlroy — along with another gallery favorite, Tommy Fleetwood — and 10 teammates from Europe bear the brunt of this newfound (if only temporary) unity?\n\nAn individual sport for 51 weeks every year\n\nFor 51 weeks in a typical year, the dividing lines at the highest level of pro golf are not about countries or continents.\n\nThis dynamic took a complicated twist four years ago when investors from Saudi Arabia piled billions into a breakaway league, LIV Golf, that fractured and forever changed this game.\n\nBack then, McIlroy, from Northern Ireland, was considered the good guy by lovers of the status quo because he refused to abandon the PGA Tour.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, from California, was viewed differently because he left for LIV.\n\nA few years passed, both players won majors — McIlroy completed his career grand slam by capturing the Masters — and their reputations shifted.\n\nMcIlroy was perceived as more aloof while DeChambeau opened a new trove of fan worship by establishing himself as an entertaining fixture on YouTube.\n\nMore recently, they’ve been exchanging barbs in the press, the freshest of which was McIlroy telling The Guardian: “To get attention he will mention me or Scottie (Scheffler) or others.”\n\nThose trends would seem to line up perfectly for an “Us vs. Them” storyline in New York: the growingly detached European against the American golfing everyman.\n\nBut how to handicap the reaction for, say, Fleetwood or Patrick Cantlay?\n\nFive short weeks ago, American golf fans rejoiced when Fleetwood, the hard-luck Brit known as “Fairway Jesus” for his flowing locks of brown hair, broke through for his first PGA Tour win and the $10 million prize that went with it at the Tour Championship.\n\nAmong those he held off was Cantlay, an American who goes around the course in relative peace these days.\n\nThings haven’t quite been the same for him since two years ago, when his decision not to wear a “USA” hat at the Ryder Cup was speciously portrayed as a protest for not being paid to play in the event. Cantlay insisted — then and now — the hat simply didn’t fit.\n\nAsked about it this week, Cantlay said “I think we need to put 100% of our focus on playing the best golf we can and let the noise be exactly what it is, just noise.”\n\nU.S. vs. Europe creates easy-to-figure dividing lines\n\nThere has always been plenty of noise.\n\nTheir pasts aside, if this Ryder Cup is like many recent versions, the Americans, even Cantlay, will be treated like the beloved home team. And the Europeans, even Fleetwood, will be treated with polite disregard.\n\nThat would be under the best of circumstances.\n\nEuropean captain Sam Torrance called the American green-storming celebration during the 1999 comeback at Brookline “the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”\n\nEight years before that, bickering and bad feelings infiltrated a tight U.S. victory in what was billed, however unfittingly, as the “War on the Shore,” while the country was on a high after wrapping up the Gulf War in Iraq.\n\nJust two years ago, McIlroy and Cantlay’s caddie, Joe LaCava, got into a shouting match on the 18th green that led to McIlroy having to be restrained when another American caddie, Jim “Bones” Mackay, tried to smooth things over. That became a rallying cry for a European win in Rome.\n\nNow the stage is New York, and it brings potential for all sorts of reactions. Bethpage Black is the course where a former European stalwart, Sergio Garcia, flipped off heckling fans at the U.S. Open in 2002.\n\nJerry Tarde, the longtime Golf Digest editor-in-chief, tells of spearheading a “Be Nice to Monty” campaign ahead of that same U.S. Open. Monty is Colin Montgomerie, the tart Scotsman and one-time Ryder Cup regular who was routinely brutalized by American crowds, taking on nicknames like “Mrs. Doubtfire” and worse.\n\nBy 2006, Tarde says, the campaign had worked and “Monty” had become a folk hero of sorts — his double bogey on 18 at another New York course, Winged Foot, eliciting groans, not jeers, from the crowd as he squandered a chance to win the U.S. Open.\n\n“Rory and Tommy are different,” Tarde said. “They’re already heroes, in Europe and America. Despite some drunken outliers, I think they’ll get fair treatment here.”\n\nU.S. plays for country, Europe for an idea\n\nIn maybe the strangest twist of all, it’s the Europeans — players representing not a single country but a conglomeration of them that are struggling to absorb the U.S.’s changing role in the international hierarchy — who have better adapted to the Us vs. Them ethos that overtakes golf every two years.\n\nEurope is 13-6-1 in the Ryder Cup since 1985. The momentum took off with a push from the great Spanish champion, Seve Ballesteros.\n\nTo Americans, who loved him as much as anyone during a normal week, Ballesteros stood too close to his opponents, coughed too loudly while they hit, celebrated too hard when he won.\n\nTo Europeans, he is everything. Ballesteros died in 2011, but Team Europe has made a point of placing his likeness on team uniforms, plastering it in its locker rooms and conjuring memories to keep his spirit alive.\n\nMcIlroy might have best embodied that spirit four years ago at Whistling Straits, when he cried toward the end of a rare European blowout loss.\n\n“I have never really cried or got emotional over what I’ve done as an individual. I couldn’t give a (expletive),” he said.\n\nBut the Ryder Cup, he said, means more than that.\n\nIt will mean something more — or something different, at least — over three days at unforgiving Bethpage Black.","summary":"FARMINGDALE, N.Y.

Climate change is my job, says island nation leader","text":"Prime Minister Terrance Drew said St. Kitts and Nevis is boosting geothermal and solar energy but lacks the promised climate finance support. (AFP pic)\nNEW YORK: US President Donald Trump may dismiss climate change as a \"con job\" – but for the leader of tiny St. Kitts and Nevis, its toll is unmistakable: land swallowed, homes battered, and livelihoods threatened.\nPrime Minister Terrance Drew, responding to Trump's blistering attack at the United Nations on the science of planet-warming fossil fuels, said, \"Everyone has the opportunity to express themselves.\"\nBut for his 45,000 countrymen and women, \"it is not a matter of any discussion, it is a reality we are living,\" Drew told AFP on the sidelines of the world body's high-level week in New York.\n\"So I would invite persons to come... and see what we are dealing with,\" he said.\nTourism has long been the mainstay of the economy of St. Kitts and Nevis, a twin island nation famed for its pristine beaches and diverse ecosystems.\nDrew said those were now under threat from a type of algae known as sargassum that thrives in warmer waters, piling up along coastlines that were once immaculate.\nIt \"tarnishes the beauty of our beaches\", he said. \"It's only with accelerated climate change we're seeing this, and it's threatening our most important economic pillar: tourism.\"\nThe threats don't stop there.\nExtreme weather includes hurricanes that arrive earlier in the season and intensify more quickly. Sea-level rise is \"taking away our coastline,\" Drew said, while shifting rainfall patterns disrupt freshwater supplies vital for both agriculture and drinking.\nSuch issues are common across the Greater Caribbean.\nThe sea has long sustained its economies, heritage, and cultures – but now threatens its very survival.\nNot just a tourism playground \nRol-J Williams, a 25-year-old medical student and climate activist from Nevis who was also in New York, told AFP he could see the impact of climate change outside his back door.\nErosion on the beach behind his house has caused the coastline to steadily recede, he said, forcing fishing communities to abandon their villages.\n\"The Caribbean is not just a tourist destination. It's a region that's severely impacted by climate change,\" he said.\nAccording to a new report by the UN Global Center for Climate Mobility, more than eight million people in the region are projected to move permanently by the middle of the century, leading to population shifts both within and across countries.\n\"Traditionally, destinations from the region have been a lot to the US, UK and Canada, and that is still projected to still be the case,\" said Sarah Rosengaertner, the report's lead author.\nBut the people of the Caribbean remain deeply tied to their homelands and are reluctant to leave.\n\"What we're trying to do is create a public coalition that can forcefully make the case that this issue needs to be addressed,\" she said.\nRosengaertner stressed that countries of the region need far more support to adapt, from securing the energy needed to desalinate seawater as rainfall becomes erratic to ensuring homes are better equipped to withstand storms.\nDrew said St. Kitts and Nevis is expanding its geothermal capacity with support from the UN's Green Climate Fund and plans to invest in solar, which generates power at one-third the cost of fossil fuels on the island.\nBut \"nobody is receiving climate finance to the degree that was promised,\" he told AFP.\nDeshawn Browne, a 28-year-old lawyer and activist from neighbouring island Antigua – which is also experiencing intensified hurricanes, drought, and sea-level rise – said the stakes were too high to ignore.\n\"I'm one of those who do not want to move at all,\" she said. \"I'm open if I have to...

But in certain circumstances, when it comes to protecting your national sovereignty, that may be something you want to do.”\n\nAsked specifically about the F-35 in New York on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government is focused on ensuring Canada’s military acquisitions lead to domestic industrial benefits and the best value for money.\n\n“The way we were making decisions, until this government, often was what’s the military requirement? If it fulfils the military requirement, then we go with that,” Carney said. “You see both in terms of the submarine decision and the F-35 decision, when it comes, will be military requirement plus industrial benefits, how does the entire package benefit our country.”\n\nOne competitor for Canada’s fighter jet contract, the European firm Saab, notably tried to sell Ottawa on its Gripen jets by promising they could be built and sustained in Canada.\n\nRecent government watchdog reports have raised concerns about rising costs and delays associated with the F-35s.\n\nAn auditor general report released this spring found costs related to the acquisition have ballooned to $27.7 billion, an increase of nearly 50 per cent. It also flagged delays in building the secure infrastructure needed to support the technologically advanced aircraft.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a report this month that supply chain disruptions and problem-plagued technological upgrades — known as the Block 4 subprogram — are leading to significant delays and cost increases for the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nLagassé said he expects “questions around Block 4 and the cost increases around that” form part of the Canadian review.\n\nCanada initially planned to acquire 88 of the F-35s from Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government to replace the CF-18s at a cost of about US$85 million each, but the federal government is only legally committed under the contract to buying the first 16 aircraft.\n\nCarney ordered the review of the U.S.-made stealth fighter procurement after becoming prime minister this spring — a move that came after U.S. President Donald Trump launched his trade war against Canada.\n\nTrump also has mused about leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, leading some observers to wonder whether the U.S. would come to the aid of NATO allies under attack if he believes they are not spending enough on defence.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra said in a television interview in May that if Ottawa does not buy the F-35s, that could “threaten Norad” — the combined North American air defence command.\n\nAt a talk in Ottawa on Sept. 16, Hoekstra said he doesn’t care if Canada decides to buy other planes, but warned it would be a “really expensive proposition” for Canada to fly both the F-35 and “perhaps buying 72 of something else.”\n\n“We don’t do that. We’re flying one because we recognize flying two platforms like that is very, very expensive,” he said. “If Canada can afford to fly two platforms and you want to buy another plane, go for it.”","summary":"Ottawa says the review continues as federal bureaucrats examine the plans and consider the military's needs, despite the defence minister suggesting a deadline of Sept. 21.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11449317/f-35-fighter-jet-review-delay-timeline/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/12dcccd229b70ee0ed6bb69c713259a9044ed8be71fb66fce468fd1357593d77_5a0740.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 23:10:05","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.037},{"id":363236994,"title":"Harris meeting top Trump ally Howard Lutnick in Washington DC to talk about trade","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Kimmel alluded to that in his monologue, joking that the company had asked him to read some remarks on the air.\n“To reactivate your Disney+ and Hulu account, open the Disney+ app on your smart TV or TV-connected device,” he read.\nKimmel defended political satire against “bullying” from Trump and officials in his administration.\nKimmel’s voice choked with emotion, moments after he took the stage to a standing ovation, and he said: “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.”\nLast week, Kimmel said Trump’s supporters were eager to characterise Kirk’s assassin “as anything other than one of them” and accused them of trying to “score political points” from Kirk’s killing.\nBefore Tuesday’s broadcast, Trump said on his Truth Social online platform that he “can’t believe” ABC gave Kimmel back his show, and hinted at further action against the network.\nTrump’s post called Kimmel “yet another arm” of the Democratic National Committee, and characterised the comedian’s jokes about the Republican administration as “a major illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this.” Previously, Trump had said Kimmel was fired for “bad ratings”.\n\nThe late-night format has been struggling for years, as more viewers have abandoned cable television and migrated to streaming. Younger viewers, in particular, are more apt to find amusement on YouTube or TikTok, leaving smaller audiences and declining ad revenues for traditional TV.\nNexstar Media Group and Sinclair both opted on Tuesday to keep Jimmy Kimmel Live off their combined 70 owned and operated ABC stations, which account for about 23 per cent of US households.\nNexstar said on Wednesday that it is continuing to evaluate the status of the show, which it will continue to pre-empt on its ABC-affiliated local television stations.\n“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the programme reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” the company said in a statement.\nStill, Disney offers Kimmel’s show for viewing on a number of streaming apps, which are accessible all over the country.\nFollowing Kimmel’s remarks last week, US Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened an investigation of ABC and its affiliates. He urged television stations to drop Kimmel’s show or face possible fines and revocation of their broadcast licences.\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said on September 17, which brought calls for his resignation from Democrats and sharp criticism from Republicans including Senator Ted Cruz.\nOn Wednesday, US Senate Republican Leader John Thune told CNN that programmers should make decisions and the government should not coerce broadcasters, but stopped short of saying either Carr or Trump made mistakes. “This isn’t an area that I think the FCC ought to be wandering into,” Thune said.\nIn his monologue, Kimmel thanked Cruz and other conservatives who did not support his views but supported his right to express them.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but Ted Cruz is right,” Kimmel said to a chorus of laughter.","summary":"Millions of people tuned in to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, watching the host’s return to late-night television after nearly a week off the air due to a suspension over remarks that drew fire from US President Donald Trump and officials in his administration.\nABC said 6.26 million viewers watched Kimmel as he mixed humour with humility to address remarks he made on September 15 about the man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\nIt was Kimmel’s highest-rated regularly...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3326746/jimmy-kimmel-returns-record-ratings-says-you-almost-have-feel-sorry-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/25/6873cdbb-e6cd-46b3-9cdf-abba19112c0a_2c539bf6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 23:08:20","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":363240790,"title":"Shooting down Russian planes ‘on the table’ – Von der Leyen","text":"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said that the option of shooting down Russian aircraft intruding into NATO airspace cannot be ruled out, following a series of alleged violations this month.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that European NATO members should down Russian aircraft that breach their skies. Poland and Estonia have both accused Moscow of incursions in recent weeks – claims that the Russian government has denied.\n\n“My opinion is we have to defend every square centimeter of the territory,” von der Leyen told CNN on Wednesday. “That means if there is an intrusion in the airspace, after warning, after being very clear, of course the option of shooting down a fighter jet that is intruding our airspace is on the table.”\n\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte outlined the alliance’s procedures for responding to such incidents on Tuesday, stating that decisions on whether to engage intruding aircraft are made “in real time and are always based on available intelligence regarding the threat posed.”\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski warned at an emergency UN Security Council meeting this week that any future intrusion would be met with force. “If another missile or aircraft enters our airspace without permission – either deliberately or by mistake – and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don’t come here to whine about it,” he said.\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper delivered a similar message, saying the UK stood ready “to take all steps necessary to defend NATO skies and NATO’s territory… If we need to confront planes operating in NATO airspace without permission, we will.”\n\nRussia has rejected the accusations, with Deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky calling them “Russophobic hysteria” designed to pressure Washington into a more confrontational policy.\n\nWarsaw has yet to provide evidence that the drones were of Russian origin, and according to Polyansky, the only confirmed damage from the Polish incident was actually caused by a missile fired from a NATO F-16, which struck a residential building.

says Budget won't expand First Home Scheme to cover second-hand homes\n\nExpanding the scheme was a key promise from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the run up to the election.\n\n12.06am, 25 Sep 2025\n\nShare options\n\nTAOISEACH MICHEÁL MARTIN has ruled out the expansion of the First Home Scheme to second-hand homes in this year’s Budget. \n\nSpeaking to The Journal in New York, where he is attending the United Nations High Level Week, the Taoiseach confirmed the election promise made by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to extend the scheme won’t feature this year. \n\n“I don’t necessarily see it in this budget,” said the Taoiseach.\n\nThe First Home Scheme is a shared equity scheme for first-time buyers that involves the government and participating banks paying up to 30% of the cost of the home in exchange for a stake in it, which can later be bought back by the home buyer.\n\nCurrently, the scheme is only available to first-time buyers who are purchasing a newly built property or building their own.\n\nThe programme for government includes a commitment to expand the scheme for first-time buyers of second hand homes. \n\nPreviously Housing Minister James Browne told The Journal that concerns had been raised that extending the First Home Scheme to second-hand homes could increase house prices. \n\nThe Taoiseach said he wouldn’t describe the scheme’s expansion to second-hand homes as a “key part” of the new housing plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think in this budget, the priority will be on new builds and to try and target all resources to new builds,” said Martin. \n\nThe target has been identified to get from 30,000 to 50,000 houses per year, which is why the focus is on ramping up new build developments, he said. \n\nWhile extending the First Home Scheme is in the programme for government, Martin said not everything can be implemented in year one.\n\nHis comments come after a number of key members of government left the door open to targeted tax breaks for developers.\n\nFianna Fáil are understood to be in favour of such measures, with Tánaiste Simon Harris now also stating he is “open to considering” such a move.\n\nHowever, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe is understood to not be a fan of such a proposal. \n\nThe Taoiseach said delivery of housing will now be based on a combination of rezoning land for housing, using existing rezoned serviced land, but also of “going up”, indicating a change in possible height restrictions on apartment blocks. \n\n‘Bridging the viability gap once and for all’\n\nIn terms of brownfield sites, the Taoiseach said there has been a “viability gap” in terms of apartments.\n\n“We’re going to continue to work to see can we bridge that viability gap once and for all, so that we can get private sector investment in to complement the unprecedented state investment in housing.\n\n“State investment in housing will continue, but if we’re to get to 50,000 a year, we simply have to get far more activity into the market,” said Martin. \n\nRelated Reads\n\nOne-off housing policy shift will allow people build homes on their own land, says Taoiseach\n\nHarris and Donohoe appear at odds ahead of Budget on Celtic Tiger-style tax breaks for developers\n\nThe government's revised housing plan now won't see the light of day until October\n\nThe Budget in October will also prioritise homeless families, said the Taoiseach.\n\n“We want to take families out of emergency accommodation.”\n\nHe said efforts will be made to get families and children out of emergency accommodation much more quickly.\n\nHowever, he said some families, according to Cork City Council “don’t accept offers of housing even though they’re on emergency accommodation, because they want maybe a different type of [house] or different location”. \n\nAlso speaking in New York yesterday, the Tánaiste said he is “optimistic” that the housing measures will, over time, significantly boost housing supply. \n\nHe said the policy package that is in place “will provide the industry with certainty” over the next five years.\n\n“I think the yearly [housing] targets can fluctuate, as we saw last year,” said Harris, who added that the target is 300,000 homes over a five-year period.\n\n“We have to try to get to that,” he concluded.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of

The host of Jimmy Kimmel Live! was absent from his usual ABC slot for almost a week, after he made a comment on the show about the death of Charlie Kirk, a conservative political podcaster who was killed at a university speaking event in Utah.\n\nJimmy brought in a whopping 6.26 million broadcast viewers alone according to the ABC, despite affiliate stations owned by Nexstar and Sinclair preempting his show, effectively blocking 23% of US TV households from watching. The star typically brings in 1.6 million broadcast viewers per episode, meaning that his viewership jumped almost 300% on Tuesday night.\n\nAs per the ABC, his monologue garnered more than 26 million views across YouTube and other social media platforms, and the original figure doesn't include people watching the show on streaming services. Jimmy's most-watched monologue on YouTube prior to Tuesday's instalment was in 2017 when he opened up about his infant son, Billy, who was born with a congenital heart condition and required immediate open-heart surgery.\n\nTuesday's episode received a 0.87 rating, the series' highest since March 2015. Jimmy joked about his soaring viewership in his monologue, hitting back at Donald Trump's claims that he had \"no ratings\". The father of four quipped, \"Well, I do tonight! You almost have to feel sorry for him. He tried his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly.\"\n\nDonald was less than impressed with the news of Jimmy's return, taking to Truth Social to slam the ABC network. \"I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,\" he wrote. \"The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his 'talent' was never there.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to test ABC out on this,\" he added. \"Let's see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative.\" Jimmy's show was put on pause on September 17, after he commented that the far-right were trying to pin the blame of Charlie Kirk's death onto the political left, despite the alleged shooter being raised in a conservative family.\n\n\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" he said. The 57-year-old walked back on his comment during Tuesday's monologue, breaking down in tears as he clarified his meaning.\n\n\"You understand it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don't think there's anything funny about it,\" he said. \"I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, asking compassion for his family, and I meant it. I still do. Nor did I mean to blame any specific group for the actions of a specific individual.\"\n\nHe continued: \"That was actually the opposite of the point I was trying to make. For those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset. If the situation were reversed, there's a good chance I would've felt the same way.\"","summary":"Jimmy Kimmel's triumphant return to late-night TV has garnered him an incredible number of viewers across media platforms.

From the very moment the former regime fell, we set out a clear strategic policy built upon three pillars – balanced diplomacy, security and stability, and economic development,” he said.\n“Major regional and international companies have already begun entering the Syrian market, contributing through investment and reconstruction,” he said, while calling for the lifting of all sanctions so they no longer “shackle the Syrian people.”\nAl-Sharaa was the first Syrian head of state to speak at the United Nations since Noureddine Attasi gave a speech in 1967 shortly after the Arab-Israeli war.\nAP quoted Netanyahu’s office as saying in a statement that negotiations are underway with Syria adding that their conclusion “involves ensuring Israel’s interests, which include, among other things, the demilitarization of southwestern Syria and maintaining the safety and security of the Druze in Syria.”\nDuring his speech, Al-Sharaa urged the Western countries to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Assad. “We call for lifting them completely so that they are not a tool to shackle the Syrian people,” he said.\nIn May, US President Donald Trump met with Al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia wherein he announced that the decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assads’ rule would be lifted. He followed through by ordering a large swath of sanctions lifted or waived, AP reported.","summary":"Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa addressed the UN after 60 years, declaring Syria's return post-Assad, urging sanctions be lifted and promising justice for past atrocities.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/syrian-president-speaks-at-un-after-60-years-pledges-national-renewal-ws-l-9594866.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-52-2025-09-b8067a77f19a220ab8b6b7783661f158.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 23:05:23","author":"News18,Ranu Joardar","authors":["News18","Ranu Joardar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.003},{"id":363241472,"title":"More than 6 million watched Jimmy Kimmel’s return to late-night TV, ABC says","text":"Jimmy Kimmel is back on his ABC late-night show, but it's still a mystery when — or if — viewers in cities such as Washington, Seattle and St. Louis will be able to see him again on their televisions.ABC stations owned by the Nexstar and Sinclair corporations took Kimmel off the air last week on the same day the network suspended him for comments that angered supporters of slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Those stations kept him off the air Tuesday, when ABC lifted the suspension. The unusual dispute attracted the attention of U.S. senators, who said they wanted to investigate the relationship between the affiliates and President Donald Trump's administration.Kimmel returned with no apologies, but in an emotional monologue where he appeared close to tears, the host said that he was not trying to joke about the assassination. He also paid tribute to Kirk's widow.And it got a large audience, with ABC reporting nearly 6.3 million people tuned in to the broadcast alone, despite the blackouts in many cities. As is often the case with late-night hosts' monologues, there was a larger audience online, with more than 15 million people watching Kimmel's opening remarks on YouTube by Wednesday evening. ABC says more than 26 million people watched Kimmel's return on social media, including YouTube.RELATED STORY | Jimmy Kimmel returns to ABC; Trump threatens network with legal actionTypically, he gets about 1.8 million viewers each night on television. The numbers released by ABC do not include viewership from streaming services.A spokesman for Nexstar said Wednesday that Kimmel will continue to be preempted from its stations while the company evaluates his show. Together, the Nexstar and Sinclair groups account for about a quarter of ABC's affiliates, many in smaller cities such as Nashville, Tennessee; Lubbock, Texas; or Topeka, Kansas.“We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at the (ABC parent) Walt Disney Co., with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve,” Nexstar said.The dispute focused attention on the business relationships between television networks and the local stations that carry their programming. In the past, local stations occasionally balked at airing a network show, but it was usually an individual market or two worried about pushing boundaries in language or sexual content, said Ted Harbert, a former top executive at ABC and CBS.What's different this time is groups that have gobbled up multiple stations acting collectively on content for largely political reasons.“This is how much the country's political divisions have seeped their way into something that has been, for the last 50 or 75 years, a relatively orderly business,” Harbert said.Leadership of ownership groups is generally more conservative than the media and entertainment figures on the stations they broadcast, said Ken Basin, author of “The Business of Television.” Both Sinclair, with conservative political content, and Nexstar have reason to curry favor with the Trump administration, he said. Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval for the purchase of a rival, he said.“I worry that this is not going to be the only dispute of this nature in the years ahead,” Basin said.ADDITIONAL REPORTING | What we know about Jimmy Kimmel’s show being pulled indefinitely from ABCIt's possible that Disney could play hardball if negotiations on Kimmel's return drag on, such as threatening to withhold other ABC programming — even the “nuclear option” of football games. Its unclear how the affiliate agreements are worded.But Matt Dolgin, senior equity analyst at Morningstar Research Service, said he doubts the dispute reaches that point. The station groups have a far less diversified business portfolio than Disney, and the expiration of affiliate agreements next year looms as a deadline, he said. They have few good options if they lose ABC programming.“From a business perspective, the best course on this issue (for Disney) is to stay above the fray,” Dolgin said. “The dollars associated with this show are very low.”As they climb, the stunning number of YouTube views of Kimmel's monologue serve to make television broadcasting less important, hurting the negotiating position of the stations.For the station groups, the biggest goal should be to negotiate their way out of this — while finding a way to save face, he said. Sinclair initially took a strong stance, saying Kimmel would not return to its stations without apologizing to Kirk's widow and donating money to Kirk's political organization. That's not likely to happen.Last week, Kimmel seemed to be in real danger of losing his show entirely until advocates for free speech protested, including many who canceled subscriptions for Disney services.“The backlash was stronger than they expected, stronger than I expected,” Basin said. “There was a sense of despair within the industry that this was a ‘canary in a coal mine’ moment.”Four Democratic senators said late Tuesday that they wanted to look into what happened with the station groups.“If Nexstar or Sinclair traded the censorship of a critic of the administration for official acts by the Trump administration, your companies are not only complicit in an alarming trampling of free speech but also risk running afoul of anti-corruption law,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey, Ron Wyden and Chris Van Hollen wrote to the companies.On Wednesday, another group of senators led by California Democrat Adam Schiff said they wanted to question FCC Chairman Brendan Carr about “implicit threats” made to Disney over Kimmel.In his monologue Tuesday, Kimmel tried to thread the needle between both sides in a raw political moment, and seemed to realize its difficulty.“I don’t think what I’m going to say is going to make much of a difference,” he said. “If you like me, you like me. If you don’t, you don’t. I have no illusions about changing anyone’s mind.”Within hours, many proved his point. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organization that Kirk founded that is now headed by his widow, posted on X that Kimmel’s monologue was “not good enough.”In another corner of social media, comic Ben Stiller posted that it was a “brilliant monologue.”","summary":"Jimmy Kimmel is back on his ABC late-night show, but it's still a mystery when — or if — viewers in cities such as Washington, Seattle and St. Louis will be able to see him again on their televisions.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/entertainment/tv/kimmel-is-back-on-abc-to-big-ratings-but-some-affiliates-still-refuse-to-air-his-show","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5fd188/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+11/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2Ff8%2F3f5d0b2d4aef92a69553cced86b9%2Fap25267156195905.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 23:05:18","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.005},{"id":363237030,"title":"GOP leader disputes Newsom’s comments on Colbert’s show","text":"On CBS’ “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Tuesday, the Democratic governor accused Republican President Donald Trump of taking authoritarian actions against Americans and criticized the president’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles. He also criticized the Trump administration for its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids by masked officers and said he was proud of signing a bill prohibiting such masks.\n\nNewsom also accused Trump of trying to rig the 2026 midterm elections by persuading Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to lead redistricting efforts to pick up five more Republican seats in the U.S. House. \n\nDuring the Colbert show filmed at The Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City, Newsom said Trump’s efforts to redistrict in states such as Texas, Indiana, Missouri, Florida and likely Ohio shows the president is trying to rig the 2026 midterm election. The governor said he fears that at this rate, any elections in 2028 would be in the style of a dictator, Russia President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNewsom and the Democratic supermajorities in the California Assembly and Senate are pushing back with Proposition 50, which would replace the work of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission with new districts that Republicans say will pick up five more seats for Democrats. \n\nAs previously reported by The Center Square, the redistricting would split counties and cities. For example, Lodi, a Northern California city of 66,000 people, would be divided among three districts. A Center Square review of the redistricting map found heavily Republican Orange County would be divided so that its congressional districts include parts of Democratic Los Angeles County.\n\nDuring The Center Square interview, Gallagher said California, Texas and other states shouldn’t do congressional redistricting in the middle of a decade. \n\nThe Republican leader said he would support separate proposals by Democrats in the California delegation to Congress and U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-California, to prevent such redistricting. The Democratic proposal, the Redistricting Reform Act, goes one step further and would require states to have independent redistricting commissions.\n\nKIMMEL DOESN’T APOLOGIZE, OFFERS CLARIFICATION ON CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS\n\nProposition 50 isn’t the answer and would rob Californians of their representation, Gallagher said. He noted Republicans, who make up 17% of the California delegation in Congress, would see that percentage fall to 7% under Proposition 50.\n\nHe also noted Texas is fairer to its minority party. Democrats make up 30% of the congressional delegation in Texas and would see that figure fall to 18% under redistricting, he said.","summary":"(The Center Square) – The Republican leader in the California Assembly said Democratic Gov.

Trump dakwa \"all our electricity bills are coming way down\". Sebaliknya, CNN kata \"in fact US electricity bills are spiking, rising more than twice as fast as overall prices\". Ada banyak lagi apa yang dikatakan Trump dipertikaikan semakan fakta CNN.\nKesimpulannya dakwaan Trump banyak yang palsu. Paling bagus pun separuh betul. Saya tidak bercadang menghurai semua cuma ingin menegaskan Trump cukup suka masuk bakul angkat sendiri. Katanya, topi paling laris sekarang tertera 'Trump was right about everything'. Katanya, \"bukan saya nak bermegah tetapi memang saya betul atas semua perkara\".\nTrump menyifatkan \"climate change is the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", dan juga menyifatkan global warming sebagai hoax, padahal ahli sains dan pakar pelbagai agensi termasuk di AS berpendapat sebaliknya.\nKata CNN: \"Trump repeated his false claim that although China is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines 'they have very few wind farms themselves'\". Beliau tuduh China menggunakan arang, gas dan \"they use almost everything but they don't like wind\" tetapi menurut semakan CNN, \"in reality China is the world leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore, it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US\". Saya ingin menambah berjuta kenderaan di China sudah tidak menggunakan bahan bakar sebaliknya guna elekrik. Itu pun Trump dakwa udara di AS sangat bersih.\nSoal immigrasi memang kegemaran Trump. Untuk membuktikan kononnya dasar immigrasinya berjaya, Trump mendakwa Eropah sedang 'menghancurkan' negara sendiri kerana kemasukan pendatang asing. \"I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,\" katanya. Trump juga dakwa London mahu undang-undang shariah. Jelas merujuk umat Islam yang berada di kota raya itu dan datuk bandarnya, Sadiq Khan. Pejabat datuk bandar melihat kata-kata Trump sebagai bigoted atau ketaasuban.\nJika mahu tulis semua yang Trump cakap di PBB, artikel ini akan berjela-jela. Namun satu aspek yang saya kira mesti diberi perhatian ialah Trump mendakwa beliau menghentikan tujuh peperangan yang sedang mengganas sejak jadi presiden. Fact check CNN menunjukkan beberapa 'peperangan' yang Trump sebutkan sebenarnya bukan peperangan pun umpamanya sengketa Mesir-Ethiopia dan Serbia-Kosovo. Tentang konflik Kongo-Rwanda, kata CNN \"Trump hasn't actually ended the conflict\". Gencatan senjata India-Pakistan Mei lalu pula dicapai hasil rundingan India dengan Pakistan secara langsung. Jika saya boleh menambah pendamaian konflik sempadan Thailand- Cambodia pada Julai. Kita tahu siapa yang usahakan.\nApa pun White House mahu Trump dianugerahkan Nobel Peace Prize untuk pencapainnyanya. Pada ucapan di PBB Trump berkata \"everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize\".\nTrump mendakwa PBB tidak buat apa-apa untuk membantu, sebaliknya \"these two things I got from the UN - a bad escalator and bad teleprompter\". Semasa beliau dan isteri naik ke bangunan PBB, escalator yang dinaiki terhenti. Apabila Trump memulakan ucapannya, teleprompter pula mengalami kerosakan seketika. Trump memang berterus-terang. Ini memang bagus tetapi biarlah berdasarkan kebenaran dan fakta.\nBeliau menuduh PBB satu badan yang tidak bertindak menghentikan konflik dunia dan hanya mengeluarkan kenyataan. Katanya, \"all they seem to do is write strongly worded letter and then never follow up that letter up. Its empty words and empty words don’t solve war\".\nKali ni apa yang dinyatakan Trump memang betul. PBB kerap dilihat tidak ambil tindakan untuk menghentikan perang khususnya genocide oleh Israel di Gaza, tetapi mengapa PBB tidak berupaya menghentikan kekejaman dan keganasan Israel?\nSebabnya pentadbiran Trump menggunakan kuasa veto untuk menghalang setiap usaha. Setiap resolusi PBB yang diluluskan General Assembly disekat pada peringkat security council. Trump menggunakan kuasa veto AS untuk menghalang resolusi sekali gus melindungi Israel. Setakat ini AS tidak kurang enam kali menghalang gesaan PBB supaya gencatan senjata dikuatkuasakan di Gaza, terbaharu enam hari lalu.\nSekarang apabila semakin banyak negara termasuk sekutu AS dan Israel mengiktiraf negara Palestin, pasti keanggotaan Palestin ke dalam PBB akan dihalang oleh AS. Mengikut proses, Majlis Keselamatan perlu beri lampu hijau meskipun perhimpunan PBB mahu keahlian Palestin diterima. AS ada di dalam majlis itu. Walaupun anggota lain dalam majlis mahu Palestin diterima, AS akan guna kuasa veto menghalang. Bukankah Benjamin Netayahu sudah kata negara Palestin tidak akan wujud?\nSuara lebih 150 negara anggota PBB dilenyapkan oleh hanya suara satu negara, and Trump have the gall tuduh PBB hanya cakap dan peluk tubuh. Mungkin sudah tiba masanya kuasa veto ditiadakan. Ia bertujuan mengimbangi keadaan demi keadilan tetapi berpuluh kali AS menodai matlamat itu, melindungi pihak yang tidak harus dilindungi.\nApabila escalator dan teleprompter PBB rosak ketika digunakan Trump, mungkin satu isyarat beliau tidak lagi dialu-alukan di badan dunia yang beribu pejabat di bumi AS sendiri.\n\nArtikel ini adalah pandangan penulis dan tidak semestinya mewakili FMT.","summary":"Kesimpulannya dakwaan Donald Trump banyak yang palsu.

ICE has led Trump's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, which has drawn widespread criticism from Democrats and immigration activists.\n\nTrump and his allies have repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that the suspect in conservative activist Kirk's assassination two weeks ago was part of a broader coordinated left-wing movement.\n\nAt the same time, the president has largely downplayed violence from right-wing groups, insisting political violence is a problem rooted in the left. Domestic terrorism experts, however, say political violence is bipartisan and that historically more attacks have been inspired by right-wing ideology.\n\nTrump previously said he had spoken with Attorney General Pam Bondi about potentially bringing charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act against such groups. The law was created to combat organized crime.\n\nDemocrats have warned that the administration may be using Kirk's killing as a pretext to crack down on political dissent. Critics say Trump's actions are part of a broader pattern by his administration of targeting political opponents, the media, and other critics.\n\nOn Monday, Trump signed a separate executive order declaring the left-wing anti-fascist movement, known as antifa, a \"domestic terrorist organization\" and threatened to investigate and prosecute those who financially support it.\n\nAntifa is a \"decentralized, leaderless movement composed of loose collections of groups, networks and individuals,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks extremists.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose, Bhargav Acharya and Ryan Patrick Jones; Editing by Caitlin Webber, Ross Colvin and Daniel Wallis)","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-says-sign-executive-order-225245166.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GIC1S5ihQV66lb2VUsHZsA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE2MDA7aD0xMDY0O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/28a2b7085e916c72a0032a007aa51eab","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 22:52:45","author":"Nandita Bose","authors":["Nandita Bose"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":363236998,"title":"Martin spoke (briefly) to Trump at a world leaders banquet last night and they chatted about golf","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Bush won reelection over Democrat John Kerry.\n\nThe margin of difference was just 35 electoral votes.\n\nIn 2024, Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris' 226 - a difference of 86 Electoral College votes. \n\nBut in calculating the closest election of the 21st century, it depends on how you do the math. If based purely on popular vote tallies, Harris' calculation stands up. \n\nA spokesperson for Harris pointed the Daily Mail to a New York Times story that characterized the 1.5 percent popular vote margin as the 'smallest margin since 2000.' \n\n'Fact check true,' her spokesperson said. \n\nThe popular vote margin in the 2024 election was about 1.5 percent, which is indeed the smallest popular vote margin since the 2000 election. \n\nFor comparison, the 2000 election popular vote margin was about 0.51 percentage points, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost in the Electoral College.\n\nIn 2020, Joe Biden secured over 81 million votes and carved out a margin of about 4.45 percentage points nationwide. The 2016 election was a popular vote difference of just 2 percentage points, nearly as tight as 2024, but not quite. \n\nIn 2012, Barack Obama won by 3.8 percentage points over Mitt Romney after besting John McCain by a 7 points nationally in 2008.\n\nThe 2004 election had George W. Bush winning by 2.46 points over John Kerry.\n\nOn the popular vote tally, 2024 was no landslide. \n\n'I won the Electoral College, 312-226, a LANDSLIDE, Counties Nationwide, 2,600 to 525, a LANDSLIDE, all seven Swing States, a LANDSLIDE, and, despite the fact that California's Fake Mail In Ballots came in at ridiculous numbers (It was RIGGED!), I still won the Popular Vote by MILLIONS! Trump said. \n\nThere is no evidence that California's mail-in ballots impacted the election results, though Trump used the widespread use of mail-in ballots in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic to falsely claim that election had been 'stolen.' \n\nOn Truth Social, Trump then pointed to Bush's razor-thin win in 2000 - despite that election not technically happening in the 21st century, which began on January 1, 2001. \n\n'Kamala's \"closest in the 21st Century\" soundbite was, like everything else in the Democrat Party, A TOTAL LIE!' Trump said. \n\nHarris has made the 21st-century claim during several recent media appearances as she's resurfaced to promote her book, 107 Days. \n\n'The sitting vice president enters the race against a former president of the United States who's been running for 10 years, with 107 days to go.

Across YouTube and social media, the monologue has garnered more than 26 million views.\n\n The numbers come over a week after the host's Oct. 15 monologue, during which he made comments about the shooting death of right-wing personality Charlie Kirk, resulting in Disney's ABC pulling the show from the air following talk from the FCC's Brendan Carr.\n\n Disney later confirmed on Monday, Sept. 22 that Kimmel would be back the following day — although, not all parties involved in the airing followed suit. Both Nexstar Media and Sinclair (the broadcasting company that makes up the nation's largest ABC affiliate group), announced they would preempt the show on their affiliate stations ahead of the Tuesday return.\n\n Before ABC's Sept. 17 decision to temporarily pull Kimmel, Carr (chairman of the Federal Communications Commission), warned that the FCC could take action against the network and Disney over Kimmel's comments regarding Kirk.\n\n During his monologue two days prior, Kimmel addressed the fatal shooing of the conservative commentator: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving. On Friday, the White House flew the flags at half staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this.\"\n\n Kimmel then showed clips of President Donald Trump being asked about Kirk's death, as Trump said he thought he was holding up \"very good\" before turning his attention to the new ballroom being constructed at the White House. The cameras then cut back to Kimmel, who said, “Yes, he’s at the fourth stage of grief, construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish, okay?”\n\n Prior to the episode, Kimmel also offered his condolences on social media, saying, \"Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.\"\n\n Nexstar and Sinclair both condemned Kimmel's comments. Nexstar recently revealed plans to acquire Tegna, a rival broadcast company, for more than $6 billion. The deal would further consolidate the local television landscape and put Nexstar in 80% of America's TV-owning households, per a press release, despite current law permitting no more than 39%. The acquisition requires final approval from the FCC, which Carr runs under Trump's appointment.\n\n Carr praised Nexstar for \"doing the right thing\" and thanked Sinclair for \"taking quick action\" last week. For his part, Trump celebrated Kimmel being taken off the air, claiming the host was \"fired for lack of talent.\"\n\n Before Disney's announcement of Kimmel's return, an open letter from American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was signed by over 400 figures in entertainment — including Tom Hanks and Jennifer Aniston — defending the constitutional right to free speech.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Jimmy Kimmel Live! airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC.","summary":"The long-running talk show's Sept. 23 episode marked Kimmel's first one first back after Disney announced its return","url":"https://people.com/jimmy-kimmel-live-returns-ratings-after-suspension-11815723","image":"https://people.com/thmb/PZZHnJQ-3QbPM3GZ3Nhg-3x1W2M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jimmy-kimmel-091825-d08abf611fb74bf88f7678d91f4f5bd3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-24 22:52:11","author":"Brenton Blanchet","authors":["Brenton Blanchet"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":363238704,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's comeback show reached 6.26 million viewers, Disney says","text":"Jimmy Kimmel's return to late-night reached 6.2 million viewers on broadcast, despite not reaching nearly a quarter of ABC affiliates, according to a statement from Disney.Disney cited Nielsen Preliminary Fast National Live+Same Day Program Ratings for Tuesday.Tuesday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" was the host's first show after being temporarily suspended following his controversial remarks about the death of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.In the second quarter of this year, Kimmel's show had averaged around 1.77 million viewers, Business Insider previously reported.Late-night TV continues to grapple with declining ratings as well as increasing pressure from President Donald Trump and his allies in government.This is a developing story.
