The people in this room are high-IQ individuals. I’m running against a low IQ individual,” Trump told the audience. He had insulted Harris in the past, having described her as “dumb as a rock.” Harris became the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee last week after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. High-ranking Democrats and major party donors urged Biden to withdraw in the wake of his disastrous June debate with Trump, when more concerns were raised over his declining health and the ability to win the election in November. Harris has since secured enough commitments to be officially nominated as her party’s candidate at a convention next month, according to an Associate Press survey. During a campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Tuesday, she launched a scathing attack against her rival, claiming that she knows “Donald Trump’s type” and listed “all kinds of predators” she dealt with when serving as a prosecutor. She repeatedly called Trump a “convicted felon” and accused him of “restoring to some wild lies.” The campaign was shaken up by an attempt to assassinate Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump narrowly escaped death as the gunman’s bullet grazed his ear. The incident prompted the resignation of Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle, who admitted that the agency had failed to properly protect the former president.","summary":"Former US President Donald Trump has claimed that his rival Vice President Kamala Harris has a “low” IQ \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601779-harris-has-low-iq-trump/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66a6e38d85f54048417a3573.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 00:39:17","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":252839840,"title":"How JD Vance's early missteps shake confidence in Trump campaign","text":"The choice of Senator JD Vance as former President Donald Trump’s running mate initially signaled a campaign brimming with confidence and looking to solidify Trump’s legacy beyond a second term. Yet, in less than two weeks, Vance’s candidacy has faced significant hurdles, shaking the sense of invulnerability that had surrounded the Trump campaign.Unearthed remarks stir controversyA slew of years-old quotes, videos, and audio clips, recently unearthed by Democrats and the media, have emerged, casting a shadow over the campaign’s efforts to appeal to women, voters of color, and blue-collar voters—key demographics Vance was supposed to win over, as reported by NYT.His past remarks, which include derogatory comments about “childless cat ladies,” advocating for a “federal response” to stop abortions in Democratic states, and suggesting higher taxes for childless Americans, have incited widespread criticism. Attempts by Vance to clarify these statements have only added fuel to the fire, exemplified by a clip where he stressed that he did not intend to insult cats: “I’ve got nothing against cats,” he said.Awkward public appearancesVance’s initial public appearances have not helped his cause. During a rally in Middletown, Ohio, he awkwardly tried to preempt criticism by joking that his preference for Diet Mountain Dew could be deemed racist, assuring the audience that “Diet Mountain Dew is good.”Trump's resilient campaign momentumThese issues have emerged after a dramatic period for Trump, who survived an assassination attempt and managed to unify the Republican Party and even some skeptics. The Republican National Convention, which began with calls for national unity, saw the Trump-Vance ticket gain momentum and an increased lead in the polls.However, this success has brought unintended consequences. Vance was supposed to campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, the Republican surge led to President Joe Biden withdrawing from the race, elevating Harris and energizing Democratic support. This shift left Vance without a clear opponent, struggling under the national spotlight.Criticism from unexpected alliesCriticism has come from unexpected quarters as well. Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports and a prominent figure in the Trump movement, questioned Vance’s policies: “You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people’s kids? We sure this dude is a Republican? Sounds like a moron,” quoted by NYT as saying.Campaign's public support for VancePublicly, the Trump campaign has stood by Vance. Campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the criticism as “liberal talking points” and reiterated their determination to defeat Harris. However, Vance’s controversial comments have particularly resonated with women, a group Trump has long struggled to win over.Impact on female votersThe addition of Vance to the ticket has mobilized new opponents, including actress Jennifer Aniston, who criticized his perceived denigration of childless women. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page lambasted Vance’s debut, comparing his remarks to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” comment in 2016.Supporters argue that the criticism is overblown, noting that Vance suggested lowering taxes for families with children rather than raising them for childless Americans. On SiriusXM’s “The Megyn Kelly Show,” Vance defended his stance, saying, “I’m proud to stand up for parents...I want to fight for your interests.”Digital era amplifies misstepsVance has also faced backlash for a 2021 proposal to give parents more voting power and for comments on conservative podcasts that included antisemitic and racial stereotypes. His spokesperson clarified that Vance agrees with Trump that states should set their own abortion policies, dismissing the attacks as distractions.In today’s digital age, Vance’s comments have spread rapidly across social media, resonating beyond the internet. Democrats have mocked his proposals as “weird,” with Senators Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy recording a video ridiculing the idea of giving parents more votes.Future outlook for the Trump-Vance ticketThe Harris campaign has managed to maintain the focus on her presidential bid, successfully diverting attention from Trump. Harris aides revealed that many of the old videos circulating were unearthed by their campaign and the Democratic National Committee. They have relished defining Vance before he can establish himself.While some argue that any Trump running mate would face similar scrutiny, the Harris campaign is satisfied with the damage done to Vance.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-jd-vances-early-missteps-shake-confidence-in-trump-campaign/articleshow/112092874.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112092878/112092878.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 00:26:46","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":252839384,"title":"Trump says US should be crypto ‘superpower’","text":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Former President Donald Trump laid out his plans to wholeheartedly embrace cryptocurrency if elected for a second term, telling hundreds of cheering supporters of the digital tokens that he wants the U.S. to be a “bitcoin superpower” under his leadership. In his keynote address at a bitcoin conference Saturday in Nashville, Tennessee, the Republican presidential nominee promised to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and create a bitcoin “strategic reserve” using the currency that the government currently holds. He also promised to remove Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler if elected and implement a crypto advisory council, teasing the crowd by asking attendees if anyone wanted to join. “We will have regulations, but from now on the rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” he said. Trump’s keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference showed how radically his position on cryptocurrency has changed over time. He was not always a fan of cryptocurrencies, writing on social media in 2019 that their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” He has embraced the digital currency in recent years, and in May, his campaign began accepting donations in cryptocurrency. Throughout the nearly 50-minute speech, Trump repeatedly sought to contrast his support of cryptocurrency to the Biden’s administration efforts to regulate the industry, telling the crowd that the federal government was “blocking your way.” Trump said he wanted cryptocurrency “mined, minted and made” in the United States. The former president appealed to bitcoin fans by pointing to U.S. law enforcement seizures of the digital token. “They took it away from you,” he said. “So, as I take steps to transform that vast wealth into a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans, today I repeat my promise to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht.” Ulbricht created the underground drug-selling website Silk Road but was sentenced to life in prison after a judge held him responsible for six overdose deaths linked to his website. Some of the nearly 800 attendees who flocked to downtown Nashville to hear Trump speak wore “Free Ross Day One” hats, in a nod to Ulbricht’s prison sentence.","summary":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Former President Donald Trump laid out his plans to wholeheartedly embrace cryptocurrency if elected for a second term, telling hundreds of cheering supporters of the digital tokens that he wants the U.S. to be a &#8220;bitcoin superpower&#8221; under his leadership.

The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, wrote in a memo. Her campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris’ running mate stumped for her. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Mandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate. She thought Biden did a “great job” in the White House, but acknowledged she “would not have been nearly this excited” if he remained in the race. “I finally feel hopeful now,” Robbins said. She added, “We can win this with Harris.” Meanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream. Vance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has “got a little bit of a bump from her introduction” but predicted it would soon dissipate. “Look, the people are going to learn her record,” Vance said. “They’re going to learn that she’s a radical. They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/28/harris-camp-claims-200m-raised-in-first-week/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24209751569086.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 00:06:38","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.033},{"id":252839270,"title":"Is Washington orchestrating Manila’s new security pacts as a bulwark against Beijing?","text":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will meet their counterparts in the Philippines and Japan this week to discuss regional security issues, including security threats posed by Beijing in the Indo-Pacific. The visit comes shortly after Manila and Tokyo signed a landmark defence pact, one of a number of recent security tie-ups between the Philippines and other countries that analysts believe Washington has helped to orchestrate in order to create a bulwark against Beijing’s growing influence on the region. On Tuesday, Blinken and Austin will meet with Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Enrique A. Manalo and Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro in Manila for the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue, where they will discuss strengthening defence ties and the increasingly heated territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. Before heading to Manila, the two senior US officials travelled to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Defence Minister Kihara Minoru to discuss a number of regional security issues and “continue to build on the momentum” of the US-Japan-Philippines trilateral cooperation, according to a US State Department press release. Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow in the Southeast Asia Programme at the Lowy Institute based in Sydney, Australia, told This Week in Asia that the recently signed Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) between Manila and Tokyo was part of a broader regional trend in which the US brings like-minded partners together to work on common security issues. On July 8, Teodoro and Kamikawa signed the RAA, enabling the two nations to jointly train troops and provide mutual aid during natural disasters. It will pave the way for larger military exercises between Filipino and Japanese troops. “I believe to some extent, the US plays a role behind the scenes in bringing the Philippines and Japan together. Washington has brought South Korea and Japan together in Northeast Asia through the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework. We also have Australia-Philippines-Japan-US, or as some call it ‘the Squad’,” Yaacob said. “This is nothing new, as historically, the US has been active behind the scenes in setting up defence and security cooperation arrangements in Southeast Asia. Even during the 1960s and early 1970s, Washington’s involvement in the planning stage made the Five Power Defense Arrangements a reality,” he added, referring to the multilateral defence agreements made between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom following Britain’s withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Asked whether Washington is using the Philippines as its bulwark against Beijing in the Indo-Pacific, Yaacob said the phrase “using the Philippines” inaccurate, arguing instead that there is a “strategic convergence” between Washington and Manila. “The former is trying to check China’s growing influence and potential military threat in the Indo-Pacific region, while the latter is concerned about its overlapping maritime claim with Beijing. Both see China as a security concern from different perspectives. China’s assertive and aggressive behaviour against the Philippines does help Beijing’s case. In fact, these behaviours pushed Manila to seek closer relations with Washington,” Yaacob said Manila and Beijing have been locked in an increasingly contentious territorial row in the South China Sea for several months, with the latest skirmish on June 17 between the Philippine navy and Chinese coastguard taking place at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Many analysts consider the clash a turning point in the escalating conflict, as it resulted in several Filipino sailors being injured, with one suffering a severed thumb. Yaacob explained that while the US government is competing with China for dominance in the South China Sea, Washington is also pushing its allies to strengthen their defences because its military is overstretched and other embattled allies are also competing for their weapons and arms supplies. “States in the Indo-Pacific have to compete with Ukraine and Israel for attention. The war in Ukraine and its impact on Europe is a lesson for the Indo-Pacific region. One lesson is that Indo-Pacific states with common security interests should join together and share resources, and they should rely less on the US,” said Yaacob. “In terms of numbers, China has the largest navy in the world. Along with its economic strength, China poses a great challenge to the US hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region. It is difficult for the US to confront China on its own while at the same time focusing and providing material assistance to Europe and Israel,” he explained. Broad coalition In addition to its RAA with Japan, the Philippines has increased security ties with a number of other countries recently and announced that it is working on making similar agreements with even more. “We are going to work on an RAA hopefully with Canada, with France, (also) with New Zealand and with other countries that escaped my memory,” Defence Secretary Teodoro said in a TV interview on July 22. Besides the potential RAA, France recently included the Philippines in its annual Indo-Pacific air force mission, Pegase 24, which Manila’s Department of National Defence hailed as “a first in the history of Philippine-France defence relations”. The Philippine and Vietnam coastguards also recently announced they are in talks to hold their first-ever joint drills, despite their overlapping claims in the South China Sea. Last week, Teodoro also signed a memorandum of understanding with his counterpart in Singapore, Ng Eng Hen, to “foster closer people-to-people links” and build on an existing agreement on education, training aid and support activities for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, according to a statement from the Singapore’s defence ministry. Chester Cabalza, president of the Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said the orchestration of new and similar RAA with New Zealand, France and Canada next year arises from the pattern originally crafted and implemented by the US with the Philippines, followed by Australia and Japan. “These countries are all allies of Washington that share democratic values and strategic visions of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” Cabalza said. “The visit of the two top American leaders in Manila is a reassurance of its defence commitments with its oldest treaty ally in Asia amid uncertainties in the ongoing colourful US election,” he added. Washington, according to Cabalza, has become a protectionist superpower, striving to maintain its presence in the Indo-Pacific region while also maintaining its role as the world’s policeman in the Baltic region and the Middle East. “Despite its complex security anxieties and economic headwinds, Washington still tries to fulfil its obligations. However, this should be a guiding principle for a middle power like Manila to build more cooperation with the allies of the US,” Cabalza said. Twofold anxiety Matteo Piasentini, a security analyst from the China and Indo-Pacific desk at Geopolitica, an Italian think tank, disagreed with the view that Manila is being “orchestrated” by the US into entering security agreements with other countries. “We saw in the case of the RAA with Japan, it is the result of more than a decade of enhanced and deepened ties, as well as convergence in security interests. The fact that these countries are also ‘like-minded’ in upholding freedom and openness in the Indo-Pacific does not necessarily make them proxies of the US,” Piasentini told This Week in Asia. “The US may welcome these initiatives as synergistic with their strategies, but thinking that a state like Japan is ‘pushed‘’ to do such agreements is simplistic and misleading. Japan’s strategic thought is rooted in decades of policymaking,” he added. Some have suggested that Manila is seeking out these defence pacts because it has doubts about whether the US will come to its aid should its conflict with China continue to escalate. However, Piasentini said agreements like the RAA with Japan cannot be considered a replacement for a reluctant US, since they do not contain reciprocal commitments on mutual defence like Manila has with Washington. In 1951, the Philippines and the US signed a Mutual Defence Treaty that calls on both countries to aid each other in times of aggression by an external power. US officials including have reiterated their commitment to the MDT multiple times in recent years, with President Joe Biden calling it “ironclad”. But according to Piasentini, Manila is still grappling with the twofold anxiety of being treated like a proxy of the US and being abandoned by the US at the same time. “Sure, nothing is definitive nor written in stone, which is why Manila has to bear the cost of dealing with the powerful patron, the US. But since 2019, both former US President Donald Trump and the Biden administrations reaffirmed that the MDT applies to the South China Sea,” Piasentini said. According to him, what Manila needs to do to counter China’s aggressive actions in the disputed waters is enhance its military and deterrence capabilities, which is why it is entering these military pacts – to strengthen their capabilities and learn from other armed forces. “But these states have no obligation to intervene in case of conflict, so I don’t think these agreements serve the purpose of alleviating Manila’s fear of abandonment,” he explained. Considering its rising tensions with China, Piasentini said Manila has been thrust into the role of trying to establish a defence-security network in the region. “As a state that perceives an immediate threat to its borders, the Philippines is doing what it can diplomatically to deepen military ties with essentially whoever is interested. I believe it is also a reaction triggered by a latent dissatisfaction with how Asean is currently paralysed. We shouldn’t forget though that these agreements are relatively cost-free and contain loose commitments by the parties,” Piasentini stressed.","summary":"Analysts say the US has played a key role in pairing the Philippines with nations like Japan to create a coalition that can counter China.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3272068/washington-orchestrating-manilas-new-security-pacts-bulwark-against-beijing","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/26/28657f83-7e15-4d3b-b283-9f02da0994be_f0790f84.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/10/ftee_2.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 00:00:15","author":"Jeoffrey Maitem","authors":["Jeoffrey Maitem"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.388},{"id":252839216,"title":"Letters to the Editor, July 29, 2024","text":"Article content OVER THE OPENING I looked forward to watching the opening ceremony of these Olympics as I have over my many years.

After the Games were over and medals won was when the fun ceremony came along and the closing and passing of the flag to the next host country was held, with the athletes relaxed and enjoying the friends they made. It was long because of the boats going down the Seine, then the ceremony going all over Paris, finally the torch lighting nowhere near the where the activities will be, but floating in the air.

It was a horrendous paper — don't ask me what I was doing there other than booking a paycheck. My late editor, Don Forst, used to tell me that if I wanted truth, I should be novelist. But I was in newspapers, which meant I did whatever was necessary to sell papers, fighting every minute to try to find a way to tell the truth in the face of a phalanx of editors who knew how to sensationalize no matter what the story. The facts would periodically drift into my copy, and I would be most grateful for the reprieve. The stock market can be like that paper. We say all sorts of things and create all sorts of theses to explain what's driving the action, but eventually the rubber meets the road. That will be the case in this jam-packed week , with the earnings from Microsoft on Tuesday, Meta Platforms on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon on Thursday. There's been a whole lot of extrapolation about how these Club holdings are really doing without a lot of facts — not that the facts mattered with either Alphabet or Tesla , both of which failed to disappoint last week, and yet their earnings were greeted with disappointment anyway. I do not mean that cynically. If the so-called \"great rotation\" out of megacap technology stocks into small caps that began earlier in July hadn't been at its zenith, I think both stocks would have rallied. The crucial line for Club name Alphabet was the Google Cloud number, which was much better than expected . The issue with YouTube, whatever the heck it was said to be, made no sense whatsoever. They can't handle how much business they have. And all the spending on the data center to support generative artificial intelligence initiatives? The company is in a jam on this one. If Alphabet said it cut back on data-center spending, then it would be alleged the company is falling behind Amazon and Microsoft in the AI race. Instead, Alphabet said it would keep spending a great deal, so it was blasted as a company with no discipline and certainly no return on investment. The company also is now dogged by another competitor in search engines after ChatGPT creator OpenAI announced a prototype of SearchGPT . Well, that had to happen, didn't it? I will take my chances that the Google franchise maintains its longtime dominance. The reaction to Tesla was just plain weird. Tesla's stock began to soar at the end of June on absolutely nothing. We all knew the electric vehicle maker was going to miss estimates. I mean, what's the big deal? I don't know a soul who thought this quarter would be even remotely in line. But when it wasn't, somehow that was revelatory. I actually liked the call because CEO Elon Musk laid out the longer-term vision, which was great because I didn't care what that longer-term vision was going to be if he didn't stay as chief executive. Now that I know the multiyear plan — autonomous vehicles, solar energy and robots — I am inclined to push the stock hard as it falls. We saw so much bilge extrapolated to the tech titans reporting this week that it will be delightful, at last, to have the facts get in the way of the story. I expect the much-hyped rotation to stay hyped even as we know the truth: Nobody is actually buying the small caps because so many of these companies are pathetic. They are just buying baskets of these stocks, specifically funds tracking the Russell 2000 and S & P 600 . There isn't enough liquidity in these small-cap gauges, so anyone who sells a large amount of megacap tech and goes into these indices makes them look super good. That's going to hang over this week's earnings like a nasty shroud. Then there's the data center sword of Damocles that skewered Alphabet. It can do the same to all of these companies set to report because they also have been writing checks like mad to Club holding Nvidia to secure AI computing resources. I think Microsoft on Tuesday evening might be vulnerable from the cloud side because of Google Cloud's robust growth. Microsoft has to come out and tell a ServiceNow -like story about Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant product. This also will be the first quarter where we have the new AI-infused personal computers. Will Microsoft have say something good about the initial customer response? It's not clear given the way that shares of fellow portfolio name Best Buy have stalled, and Best Buy is the company doing the plurality of the selling of these AI PCs . Still, Microsoft is the stock with the fewest enemies. It stands to reason that it will acquit itself well. The following evening Meta gives us its results. Maybe we can get some clues from CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday during his fireside chat with Nvidia's Jensen Huang at Siggraph, a big graphics conference in Denver. It's a favorite venue of Huang's, and Monday will be truly a remarkable get-together given how not long ago these two CEOs were not that close. Of course, Zuckerberg is shrewd enough to not get in the way of Meta's earnings quiet period, but I think he might explain why he's spending so much on Nvidia hardware, which could take the sting away from an Alphabet-like inquiry on the company's earnings call a few days later. Zuckerberg is a forward-thinking person, so he may actually be able to articulate why he is spending all the money on the data center. Facts, not stories. The digital-ad business is a good one for Zuckerberg. Still, like everyone else in the industry, Meta might be grappling with some drop off in spending from Asian e-commerce giants Temu and Shein, which had been aggressively courting customers abroad . However, this risk has now been pretty well-telegraphed, and I am just hoping for no faux surprises. It's very hard to move the needle for this company given its scale. For example, Zuckerberg has a red-hot property in the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which would be big for just about any company except a tech titan expected to generate almost $160 billion in revenue this year. I wonder if the smart glasses — and the investment Meta might be making in Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica — will even get mentioned on the call. On Friday, shares of EssilorLuxottica had a huge move, which might have stolen some of the upside. Apple reports on Thursday, and if you think the cloud-computing heavyweights are spending on too much AI, then you should be buying Apple. It's basically an AI play without the heavy capital expenditure spending risk. If you buy Apple here, you also are following the traditional thinking that this is the last earnings report before a new iPhone version launches in September, so you want to get in right after the quarter. It's a good story. Amazon is problematic like Alphabet. It's spending a fortune on AI while losing a fortune on its digital assistant Alexa. Sure, there was just a big Prime Day event that featured steep discounts on a lot of items. However, Wall Street doesn't care about that. It wants to hear a clearly articulated story about why Amazon is so enamored with AI. I think CEO Andy Jassy and Co. will have something good to say, or at least a decent story. But it feels tired, in need of something new. I just don't think a strong Amazon Web Services number will do the trick. All of these stocks are fighting another enemy now, besides data-center spending fears and the small-cap run: the Federal Reserve. As it dawns on people that the Fed will cuts soon, any sign that there may be a housing recovery — even if there isn't one materializing yet — will be met with buying in stocks that benefit from that development. Just consider three of the biggest gainers in Friday's session: Mohawk Industries , the carpet company; Fortune Brands Innovations , the high-end home accessory business; and DeWalt parent Stanley Black & Decker , which we own for the Club. The first two reported OK earnings, and their stocks still took off because the companies showed discipline, which will turn into operating leverage when the rate-cutting cycle begins. As for Stanley Black & Decker, we sold some into Friday's strength because we don't want to get skunked by a bad quarter Tuesday morning. Basically, we wanted a smaller position until we have a better sense of how the toolmaker intends to capitalize off the moment. Over the past few quarters, I thought management would tell a good story as we waited for the housing market to turn, but it hasn't so far. I don't know why, but we have to keep these guys on a short leash: We don't want to discover facts that get in the way of the Fed rate cut cycle. The strength in anything home makes us unsure about how in heck all of the government debt can be so easily absorbed. Right now, it's been spectacular for bonds as yields trend lower, which keeps the housing-related story on track. You need both low bond yields and lots of rate-cut chatter to make this part of the market get momentum. It's got something to build on. The megacap techs, on the other hand, do not have something to build on after this recent rotation. They have not been able to lose their whipping-boy status. Maybe this week could be the week that it happens. Random musings I want to briefly address a few more topics before the busy week of earnings officially arrives. Contrary to the numerous press reports about my supposed \"endorsing\" of Vice President Kamala Harris, I want to repeat where I stand about the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination through the lens of investing in the stock market: The former California senator — whose brother-in-law, Tony West, is the chief legal officer of Uber Technologies — has real contacts among the tech titans. President Joe Biden always chose to have his agencies wear down tech companies. He appointed to key roles at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission antitrust attack dogs who have it in for tech. Unless Harris specifically says her hypothetical administration would change nothing about its approach, I believe it's hard to be more disdainful of tech than Biden, who truly did not care about these companies other than to try to break them up or prosecute them. I believe Harris will be more practical, if only because she knows so many of them and can talk to them face to face. Biden couldn't. Biden's main conduit to the business world has been Gina Raimondo, the brilliant head of the Department of Commerce. Notably, Raimondo said she expected Harris to be on board with the semiconductor manufacturing build out in the U.S. because she had expressed so. But the most important part of the Wall Street debate when it comes to Harris versus Republican nominee Donald Trump is the shocking antagonism Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has against Big Tech. Vance uses old-fashioned populist rhetoric against corporations, and he is no friend of the tech titans. The idea that the Republican Party is uniformly pro-business has become more complicated. The tariff proposals that Trump has floated could really hurt business. And Trump's recent comments about Taiwan paying the U.S. for defense that raised questions about his support for the self-governed island and chipmaking hub? That was music to Chinese President Xi Jinping's ears. It would also make me change my stance toward owning and not trading Nvidia because the company would not be able to get the chips it needs if the Chinese make a move on Taiwan. What a reckless statement. That's why I said if you own a lot of international companies and tech stocks and want to vote to help your portfolio, Harris is more likely to help those firms than hurt them. I want to point out that what I didn't say was that if you wanted to vote your paycheck, you should vote Trump, especially if you are wealthy, because he wants to cut your taxes. His help for you when it comes to taxes is as profound as I expect Harris to be when it comes to tech. And now I need to mention this nearly $500 million verdict against Club holding Abbott Laboratories over allegations that it failed to disclose the risks of its specialized infant formula. I know I repeatedly warned about this case, but I am stunned about the size of the damages handed down Friday. Abbott said it would try to have the verdict overturned. But the case was handled in St. Louis, Missouri, the worst venue for defendant drug companies. I am very concerned by this decision not just as an Abbott shareholder, but as an American. The Food and Drug Administration needs to step up here because this was an outrage, and Abbott must pull its formulas for premature infants now because it only makes $9 million a year on them. What a travesty our country has become when it comes to suing companies. But I don't expect Biden's agencies to get behind Abbott. They are pretty much in league with the plaintiff's bar on everything. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long GOOGL, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, META, MSFT, SWK and ABT.

Urban & Mike Pompeo at The Wall Street Journal. Yet there’s “no evidence” of that — and “much evidence to the contrary”: Trump lifted the Obama arms embargo on Ukraine, sent it Javelin missiles that proved critical and backed Speaker Mike Johnson’s passing more aid to Kyiv. In office, he can “unleash America’s energy potential,” eroding Russia’s “war-crimes budget,” and impose “real” sanctions, “bulk up” the US defense industry, revitalize NATO and lift restrictions on Ukraine’s weapons. “This will re-establish a position of strength, which Putin will understand means the war must end.” Libertarian: Secret Service Is Not Underfunded “While there is likely much blame to go around” after the July 13 Trump assassination attempt, “the idea that the [Secret Service] is starved for resources doesn’t hold much water,” argues Reason’s Joe Lancaster. In testimony to Congress, USSS now-ex-Director Kimberly Cheatle “indicated that understaffing was an issue,” but “before members of Congress respond by breaking out the federal checkbook,” noted that “Secret Service real spending has grown from $2.34 billion in 2014 to $3.62 billion in 2024,” up 55% in 10 years, per the Cato Institute’s Chris Edwards. Says Lancaster: “It should be clear that the problem at the Secret Service is not a lack of funding, and lawmakers should resist any calls to throw more taxpayer money at it.” From the right: Kam’s Just Another Radical Lefty Kamala Harris “is Bernie Sanders with lipstick,” argues Liz Peek at The Hill. Her “progressive left” record includes “embracing Medicare for All when it was in vogue and the Green New Deal before Americans saw billions of dollars being thrown at fulfilling unpopular electric vehicle mandates.” She also supports “the right to an abortion anytime, anywhere, regardless of fetal viability and with no requirements that a certified doctor perform the procedure.” On crime, she backed “Prop 47, a California initiative that decriminalized many crimes, the result of which has turned the state into a perpetual crime scene, her own city of San Francisco now being one of the most devastated.” Veep watch: Shapiro = Harris’ Best Bet Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.) is Vice President Kamala Harris’ best bet for a running mate, explains National Review’s Jim Geraghty. “The formula is simple”: If Harris “wins two or three of the ‘Blue Wall’ states” (Michigan, Wisconsin, as well as Shapiro’s Pennsylvania), “she’s very likely to finish with 270 or more electoral votes; if she doesn’t win them, she’s almost certainly toast.” And Shapiro’s “approval rating in [his] state is still high (57%), with much more support among Republicans and independents than your average Democrat.” He’d also make history as the first Jewish vice president. But breaking barriers and other qualifications like governing or foreign-policy experience are all secondary to the main task: helping “get Harris to 270 electoral votes.” Right now, that looks like Shapiro. Tech beat: Boost Cybersecurity, Everybody “Today, we must incentivize companies to implement proper cybersecurity, and not hesitate to levy sizable financial penalties when negligence puts consumers at risk,” warns Steve Weisman at The Hill. Beyond the recent CrowdStrike fiasco, the threat of “massive computer attacks by cybercriminals and foreign nation-state adversaries are now common, yet we seem to learn little each time.” E.g.: In “a required regulatory filing,” AT&T “disclosed that it had suffered a significant data breach affecting pretty much all of its 109 million customers.” Plainly, “steps should be taken to protect the security of our data, networks and systems,” such as “strong, unique passwords for all accounts,” and “multi-factor identification so when a password is compromised, the cybercriminal will not be able to access the account.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Pundits claim a re-elected Donald Trump will “cut off aid to Ukraine, give away its territory, and deal directly with Vladimir Putin to impose an ignominious ‘peace’ on the country,” observe David J.

Ford profit missFord Motor shares plunged 11% in extended trading after the company missed Wall Street’s second-quarter earnings expectations due to increased warranty costs. The automaker beat revenue estimates and raised its free cash flow target, but maintained its 2024 earnings guidance, disappointing investors. Ford reported adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents, falling short of the expected 68 cents, while automotive revenue reached $44.81 billion, surpassing the anticipated $44.02 billion. Tesla dives Tesla shares plunged over 12% on Wednesday, their steepest decline since 2020, after the electric vehicle maker reported weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and a further drop in automotive revenue. The decline in revenue, attributed to price cuts and incentives amid slowing sales and heightened competition, particularly in China, has dragged the stock down 13% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is up 16% over the same period.

Google has been accused by conservatives of interfering in elections dating back to 2008, with the Hunter Biden laptop story suppression in 2020 leading many on the right irate. Now, those who enter the terms ‘assassination attempt’ into the system, the attempt on the life of Donald Trump just two weeks ago doesn’t show up. The news reached Donald Trump Jr. who issued a blistering statement on X regarding the omission. He wrote: ‘Big Tech is trying to interfere in the election AGAIN to help Kamala Harris. We all know this is intentional election interference from Google. Truly despicable.’ Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy posted his own attempt with the caption: ‘Can verify’. ‘Why are you censoring the ass*ss*nat*on attempt of DJT??’ asked the popular LibsofTikTok account. The screenshot below their posts shows a user searching the words ‘assassination attempt on’ and then lists several names of people who were shot at decades ago as part of its auto-complete feature. Some of the non-Trump names were Ronald Reagan, Bob Marley, Vladimir Lenin, Gerald Ford and William Seward. A DailyMail.com search of the phrase ‘the assassination attempt of’ Sunday evening produced Reagan and Archduke Franz Ferdinand but not Trump. Trump was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, miraculously surviving. “We’re working on improvements to ensure our systems are more up to date,’ a Google spokesperson told the New York Post in a statement. ‘Of course, Autocomplete is just a tool to help people save time, and they can still search for anything they want to. Following this terrible act, people turned to Google to find high quality information– we connected them with helpful results, and will continue to do so,” they added. They claimed that no ‘manual action’ had been used to create these auto-completes and there are ‘protections’ against suggestions that are aligned with political violence. In March, a Media Research Center study not only cited 16 incidents of Google election interference but also claimed that Google’s new AI tool Gemini ‘won’t answer negative questions’ about Joe Biden. ‘MRC researchers have found 41 times where Google interfered in elections over the last 16 years,’ MRC Free Speech America vice president Dan Schneider and editor Gabriela Pariseau wrote in the report’s summary. ‘From the mouths of Google executives, the tech giant let slip what was never meant to be made public: That Google uses its ‘great strength and resources and reach’ to advance its leftist values,’ the authors added. Google has strongly denied the claims in the report, calling them ‘baseless, inaccurate complaints that have been debunked by third parties’ including ‘many that failed in the courts’. The report cited research by AllSides researcher Dr Robert Epstein, who found that ‘Google’s results and get-out-the-vote reminders favored Democrats and shifted the 2020 election results by at least 6 million votes.’ Dr Epstein added that the American corporation’s search algorithm ‘likely shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton’ in 2016. ‘Google’s outsized influence on information technology, the body politic and American elections became evident in 2008,’ the authors summarized. ‘After failing to prevent then-candidate for president Donald Trump from being inaugurated following the 2016 election, Google has since made clear to any discerning observer that it has been — and will continue — interfering in America’s elections.’ ‘Its impact has surged dramatically, making it evermore harmful to democracy,’ they added. ‘In every case, Google harmed the candidates – regardless of party – who threatened its left-wing candidate of choice.’ MRC Free Speech America, a division of the conservative Media Research Center, also blasted Google’s AI service Gemini, for allegedly ‘refusing to answer questions damaging’ to Biden. It said the engine also appeared to favor left-leaning Democrat candidates. This included Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008, and Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012. The site is also accused of using its algorithm to exclude autofill results that were potentially damaging to Hillary Clinton in 2016, and ‘not doing the same for then-candidates Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders’. Google condemned the report as inaccurate. ‘There is absolutely nothing new here – just a recycled list of baseless, inaccurate complaints that have been debunked by third parties and many that failed in the courts,’ the search engine said. ‘Politicians on the left have a long history of making similar claims too. ‘We have a clear business incentive to keep everyone using our products, so we have no desire to make them biased or inaccurate and have safeguards in place to ensure this. ‘Numerous conservatives have been particularly successful in using our platforms to spread their message to a wide audience.’ Google said third parties including the Economist, Stanford and Ahrefs conducted similar studies and ‘found no evidence to support claims of political bias’. ‘Our algorithms look at features and qualities of sites, not individual pages and never political ideology,’ a Google spokesperson said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSearch engine results on Google about the recent assassination attempt on Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Google triggers new election conspiracy by excluding Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/google-triggers-new-election-conspiracy-by-excluding-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Google-sparks-frightening-new-election-conspiracy-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 23:15:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":252837830,"title":"New Poll Shows Kamala Harris’ Growing Appeal Among Voters","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin US Vice President Kamala Harris speaks at a moderated conversation with former Trump administration ...

(Photo by Chris duMond/Getty Images) Getty Images In a political landscape rife with controversy and shifting loyalties, a new poll reveals an unexpected trend: Vice President Kamala Harris is rapidly gaining traction with voters across the United States. Initially, doubts surrounded Harris’s reception by the general public. However, with substantial financial backing from prominent Democratic donors and strategic support from key party organizers, her campaign is gaining momentum. The Numbers Speak: A Surge in Popularity With the election being exactly 100 days away, the latest poll, conducted after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek re-election and endorsed Harris as his successor on the Democratic ticket, shows a remarkable increase in enthusiasm and voter interest among Democrats. This shift in voter sentiment highlights the core nature of the 2024 presidential race and the role Harris’s candidacy may play in shaping America’s political future. The poll also shows a decline in favorable views of Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump, who initially saw a spike in support following the assassination attempt and the Republican National Convention.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Getty Images According to the report, 86% of Democrats and 52% of all Americans believe Harris should be the Democratic nominee for president, with only 14% of Democrats preferring a different candidate. Enthusiasm for Harris’s candidacy is particularly strong among Democrats, with 88% expressing enthusiasm (63% very enthusiastic, 25% somewhat enthusiastic). This compares favorably to the 82% of Republicans who feel hopeful about Trump’s candidacy.

This marks an increase from 70% among Democrats and remains steady for Republicans compared to previous polling data before Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race. Despite the support from the Democratic Party, voters view this election season as a high-stakes event, touching on sensitive that affect the core values of American democracy. For instance, the national conversation on racial justice, inspired by ongoing incidents of police violence and systemic barriers, has made race a central topic. Race, an undercurrent in American politics, has taken on new meaning with Harris’s growing popularity, and voters will continue to closely watch each candidate’s stance on these issues. A Turning Point for American Democracy As the first Black and South Asian woman nominated for the presidency by a major party, Harris’s candidacy challenges the historical status quo and invites voters to reimagine leadership in the 21st century. This election, in essence, will be a turning point for American democracy, one which will test the resilience of its institutions, the inclusivity of its governance, and the commitment of its people to strive towards a more equitable American future. The increasing voter engagement and enthusiasm for Harris show that there is a collective curiosity for something that defies the status quo. As the election season continues, the narrative around Harris and her vision for the country will play an important role in influencing public perception and voter turnout. Because of that, the eyes of the nation—and the world—continue to be curious.

Legible City Hong Kong is a new commission for the M+ facade by Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw. It is a video game of sorts in which a player can “navigate” a virtual city made up of three-dimensional Chinese characters by riding a special exercise bicycle inside the museum that is connected to the big outdoor screen. A smaller screen in front of the bike shows players their progress. This work is based on Shaw’s 1980s series “Legible City”. Back then, he made three versions, set in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Manhattan in New York, and Karlsruhe, a city in Germany. As in the Hong Kong piece, the basic structure of each was modelled on the local street map and all the buildings were replaced by text. These earlier works have no geographical markers – all three urban areas are pretty flat, after all – but the text gives a sense of place. The words that outline Manhattan, for example, are stories related in the form of monologues by residents including former New York mayor Ed Koch, architect Frank Lloyd Wright, a taxi driver, and a certain real estate mogul named Donald Trump. Players could try to follow their narratives by pedalling on a bicycle similar to the one at M+, with each city revealing itself through the words of people who know them. The Hong Kong version, which is set in the Central, Sheung Wan and Sai Ying Pun neighbourhoods during the 19th century, has been created more than three decades after its predecessors, and some technological advances are evident. The resolution is much higher and there is a semblance of the city’s topography, with the navigable area delineated by Victoria Harbour and the hilly backdrop of Hong Kong Island. The words, which appear in terracotta orange (the colour of traditional Canton tiles), are better modelled, with realistic shadows of the player seen as they cycle past them. And players can burn a few calories, too, as the stationary bicycle adjusts to the gradient of the route and makes pedalling harder when going uphill. What Shaw, who is chair professor of Baptist University’s Academy of Visual Arts, describes as “a kinaesthetic conjunction of the active body in the virtual domain” is quite remarkable and perhaps too easily taken for granted in an age of touch screens and virtual reality. Riding through the virtual streets, one can appreciate the sense of space and control as if one were on a real bicycle, without being encumbered by specialist equipment. But it is the text and the font used to display it that really sets this work apart from the previous versions. In 2021, Hong Kong novelist Dung Kai-cheung published Hong Kong Type: A Love Letter 150 Years Late. It was inspired by his visit to a 2020 exhibition at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, in Sha Tin, where he discovered Hong Kong Type, a set of typefaces designed by British missionaries in the 19th century for the mass production of Chinese-language bibles in the then-new colony. The unconventional story Dung tells in his book is split into three parts: the first is set during the Hong Kong anti-government protests of 2019-20, when his protagonist, Dai Sun-fai, takes on a research project for an exhibition about Hong Kong Type to find quietude and purpose. The second part sees her communing with spirits who give her lively, first-hand accounts of historical figures such as Robert Morrison, founder of the first Anglo-Chinese school in Hong Kong and one of the first to translate the Bible into Chinese. I would like to have a love story in this work, because it is a work which is presented to Hong Kong [via the M+ facade] Dung Kai-cheung, from whose novel the artwork’s words come The third part – from which the text in Legible City is taken – consists largely of an imagined love letter written by Dai’s late great-grandfather. It is addressed to a biracial woman born from the rape of a Chinese woman shortly after the British took over Hong Kong in 1842. Written after she died, the letter records the tragic circumstances of a short life and, like other parts of the novel, is brimming with historical references that reflect Dung’s desire to record his home city’s life story. Dung explained at the M+ project’s opening reception that he immediately picked this text when, at the suggestion of Osage Gallery director Agnes Lin, Shaw approached him about collaborating on it. “I would like to have a love story in this work, because it is a work which is presented to Hong Kong [via the M+ facade],” he said. Dung was deeply involved in working with designers to create 3D characters modelled on Hong Kong Type and helped pick out a section of the story set in Sheung Wan and Sai Ying Pun. Conceptually there is something seductive about a city defined only by its stories. The title of Shaw’s series suggests the influence of Italo Calvino’s allegorical novel Invisible Cities, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan about all the cities he saw on his travels. Dung mentioned at the facade’s unveiling that Calvino is one of his favourite writers. Despite the name of Shaw’s work, his Hong Kong is not easily legible – sentences are truncated by the many sharp turns in one of the oldest parts of the city – although Dung and Shaw see artistic value in experiencing the text in this haphazard, piecemeal manner because it denies the authority of a single narrative and allows the players to focus on the shape of each word. In so doing, they may notice the subtle differences between Hong Kong Type and what we are accustomed to today. This will also encourage people to read Dung’s novel, the pair reason. As a piece of public art its jumbled phrases, appearing without context, are bound to be baffling even for those who read Chinese. Fortunately, a pre-recorded demo version of this “game”, which is screened on the facade every evening except Fridays when there is a live stream directly from the bicycle station, carries a clearer message. Some sections of the demo are shown with an overlay of what those Hong Kong streets are like today. These expose the city as a palimpsest of histories, memories and stories. Shrouding with familiar 21st century buildings and shop signs words used in the 19th century to express a man’s love for a woman lends the work poignancy. As Dung said of the choice of text, the best love stories should always be tragic. When it comes to the love story between Hongkongers and their home, the tragedy is how much we have forgotten. “Jeffrey Shaw: Legible City Hong Kong” is shown on the M+ facade from 7-9pm every evening until October 6, 2024. The installation with the stationary bike is in the Found Space area of M+ and is open for public participation free of charge from 10am-10pm every Friday, with visitors’ journeys live-streamed on the facade.","summary":"As if playing a video game, visitors to museum ride a stationary bike through a virtual Hong Kong where Chinese characters replace buildings.

The video gained attention after tech billionaire Elon Musk shared it on his social media platform X on Friday evening without explicitly noting it was originally released as parody. The video uses many of the same visuals as a real ad that Harris, the likely Democratic president nominee, released last week launching her campaign. But the video swaps out the voice-over audio with another voice that convincingly impersonates Harris. “I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility at the debate,” the voice says in the video. It claims Harris is a “diversity hire” because she is a woman and a person of color, and it says she doesn’t know “the first thing about running the country.” The video retains “Harris for President” branding. It also adds in some authentic past clips of Harris. Mia Ehrenberg, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said in an email to The Associated Press: “We believe the American people want the real freedom, opportunity and security Vice President Harris is offering; not the fake, manipulated lies of Elon Musk and Donald Trump.” The widely shared video is an example of how lifelike AI-generated images, videos or audio clips have been utilized both to poke fun and to mislead about politics as the United States draws closer to the presidential election. It exposes how, as high-quality AI tools have become far more accessible, there remains a lack of significant federal action so far to regulate their use, leaving rules guiding AI in politics largely to states and social media platforms. The video also raises questions about how to best handle content that blurs the lines of what is considered an appropriate use of AI, particularly if it falls into the category of satire. The original user who posted the video, a YouTuber known as Mr Reagan, has disclosed both on YouTube and on X that the manipulated video is a parody. But Musk’s post, which has been viewed more than 123 million times, according to the platform, only includes the caption “This is amazing” with a laughing emoji. X users who are familiar with the platform may know to click through Musk’s post to the original user’s post, where the disclosure is visible. Musk’s caption does not direct them to do so. While some participants in X’s “community note” feature to add context to posts have suggested labeling Musk’s post, no such label had been added to it as of Sunday afternoon. Some users online questioned whether his post might violate X’s policies, which say users “may not share synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm.” The policy has an exception for memes and satire as long as they do not cause “significant confusion about the authenticity of the media.” Musk endorsed former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, earlier this month. Neither Mr Reagan nor Musk immediately responded to emailed requests for comment Sunday. Two experts who specialize in AI-generated media reviewed the fake ad’s audio and confirmed that much of it was generated using AI technology. One of them, University of California, Berkeley, digital forensics expert Hany Farid, said the video shows the power of generative AI and deepfakes. “The AI-generated voice is very good,” he said in an email. “Even though most people won’t believe it is VP Harris’ voice, the video is that much more powerful when the words are in her voice.” He said generative AI companies that make voice-cloning tools and other AI tools available to the public should do better to ensure their services are not used in ways that could harm people or democracy. Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, disagreed with Farid, saying he thought many people would be fooled by the video. “I don’t think that’s obviously a joke,” Weissman said in an interview. “I’m certain that most people looking at it don’t assume it’s a joke. The quality isn’t great, but it’s good enough. And precisely because it feeds into preexisting themes that have circulated around her, most people will believe it to be real.” Weissman, whose organization has advocated for Congress, federal agencies and states to regulate generative AI, said the video is “the kind of thing that we’ve been warning about.” Other generative AI deepfakes in both the U.S. and elsewhere would have tried to influence voters with misinformation, humor or both. In Slovakia in 2023, fake audio clips impersonated a candidate discussing plans to rig an election and raise the price of beer days before the vote. In Louisiana in 2022, a political action committee’s satirical ad superimposed a Louisiana mayoral candidate’s face onto an actor portraying him as an underachieving high school student. Congress has yet to pass legislation on AI in politics, and federal agencies have only taken limited steps, leaving most existing U.S. regulation to the states. More than one-third of states have created their own laws regulating the use of AI in campaigns and elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Beyond X, other social media companies also have created policies regarding synthetic and manipulated media shared on their platforms. Users on the video platform YouTube, for example, must reveal whether they have used generative artificial intelligence to create videos or face suspension. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Price | Associated Press WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, wrote in a memo. Her campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris’ running mate stumped for her. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Mandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate. She thought Biden did a “great job” in the White House, but acknowledged she “would not have been nearly this excited” if he remained in the race. “I finally feel hopeful now,” Robbins said. She added, “We can win this with Harris.” Beshear spoke from experience to supporters, telling them their work could be the difference in what’s expected to be a close race. Beshear won his 2019 campaign by a margin of about 5,000 votes of 1.41 million ballots cast. He was reelected in November by a relatively comfortable margin. “Every door knock mattered. Every phone call mattered. Every difficult conversation that people had with their uncle at Thanksgiving mattered,” Beshear said of his 2019 race. “Everyone here today that signs up to volunteer … you might be the difference in winning this race for Vice President Harris.” Meanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream. Vance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has “got a little bit of a bump from her introduction” but predicted it would soon dissipate. “Look, the people are going to learn her record,” Vance said. “They’re going to learn that she’s a radical. They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.” Vance was echoing Trump, who in a campaign appearance with Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday, called Harris a “crazy liberal,” accused her of wanting to “defund the police” and said she was an “absolute radical” on abortion. Harris, a vocal proponent of abortion rights, has made clear that she will make Republican-backed efforts to restrict reproductive rights a key plank in her campaign. “There is no liberal horse that she has chosen not to ride,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Trump backer Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also tried to brand Harris as a full partner for “a lot of the worst decisions of the Biden administration,” including the chaotic August 2021 pullout of U.S. troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military. Cotton also accused Harris of emboldening Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah by pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the war in Gaza. Netanyahu met separately with Harris and Biden at the White House on Thursday. Afterward, Harris said she urged Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with the militant group Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she also affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza and the “dire” humanitarian situation there. Tensions in the Mideast intensified on Saturday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. Trump at his Saturday rally said the Golan Heights incident “will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States president and vice president.” And Vance on Sunday accused Harris of being “a disaster” on the conflict. Still, some Republicans are concerned that Harris’ entrance has given Democrats a spark and that Trump needs to recalibrate. Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said Harris is in a “honeymoon” period that will probably last a month, but he also said that both Trump and Vance should stop the personal attacks against Harris because those will not drive people to vote. Instead, he said they must stick to the issues and “stay away from the insults.” “But hopefully the numbers, the polls, will get Donald Trump to realize what was working and what didn’t,” Sununu said Graham was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Sununu was on ABC’s “This Week,” and Cotton was on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Price reported from Waite Park, Minnesota, and Barrow from Cumming, Georgia.

Undeterred by Bream’s attempts to steer the conversation, Buttigieg insisted that Trump only kept two promises while in office for his first term: overturning Roe v. Wade and tax cuts. As a result, the politician said Trump can’t be trusted when he says he’s not in favor of a national abortion ban. “Yeah, he’s disavowed a lot of things. I don’t believe him, because he lies all the time,” Buttigieg said. In a clip that is making the rounds on social media Sunday, Buttigieg told the conservative news channel host that overturning Roe v. Wade was “one of the few” campaign promises that Trump managed to keep while president. “You know, he didn’t keep his promise of 6% economic growth. He didn’t keep his promise to drain the swamp,” he explained. Watch the clip, as shared by Buttigieg, below: When Bream attempted to contend that Trump had “a pandemic to deal with,” Buttigieg interjected that “even before the pandemic, America went into a manufacturing recession, which really hurt places like where I come from in the industrial Midwest.” “He broke his promise for that kind of economic growth. He broke his promise to pass an infrastructure bill, right?” Buttigieg continued. “He said he would do that. He failed to do it. The Biden-Harris administration got it done. He even broke his promise to that Jan. 6 mob when he said, ‘I will be at your side when you march down to the Capitol.’” Trump “actually did keep two promises,” he added. “He kept his promise to destroy the right to choose in this country. And he kept his promise on tax cuts for the rich. And if you want to know what a second Trump term would be like, I would start by looking at those rare promises that he actually managed to keep.” Bream and Buttigieg also spoke about crime rates in the U.S. and the American border with Mexico. Both crime and immigration have remained top issues for voters across the country. “Border crossings are down” thanks to Biden, Buttigieg said, and later added, “Remember, the worse things are at the border, the better things get for Donald Trump. So he has a vested interest in it remaining chaotic down there.” After Bream referenced “high profile” cases of crime in the country, Buttigieg interjected, “Of course, there are individual cases, but this is my point. Trying to make people think that crime is up when crime is down under Joe Biden and crime was up under Donald Trump.” “Now, I don’t know how often that gets reported on this network,” he continued. “So if you’re watching this at home, do yourself a favor and look up the data. Great. So if you look this up at home, you will know that crime went down under Biden and crime went up under Trump.” You can watch the exchanges between Bream and Buttigieg in the videos above.","summary":"The Secretary of Transportation tells Shannon Bream that the former president kept two promises while in office — and that's it\n\n\nThe post Pete Buttigieg Schools Fox News on What Trump Actually Thinks About Abortion: &#8216;He Lies All the Time&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/pete-buttigieg-trump-abortion-ban-fox-news-clip/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pete-buttgieg-fox-news.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 22:57:31","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.443},{"id":252839988,"title":"Severed Finger in Bowl of Chili Leads to Bizarre Retraction From the NYT","text":"The New York Times was forced to issue a correction on a story last week after it unknowingly interviewed a woman who’s among the country’s most infamous fraudsters.

That quote didn’t last long on the Times’ website, however. It was removed approximately an hour later and a correction—likely among the most eccentric in the paper’s 172-year history—was placed at the article’s bottom. “The Times removed comments from one voter in an earlier version of this article after learning that the person had been convicted in an extortion scheme in which she made fraudulent claims,” it read. The correction referred to Ayala’s history as the fraudster who infamously planted an acquaintance’s severed finger into her Wendy’s chili, claiming it was served to her that way. She tried to bank tens of millions off the fast food chain and reportedly cost Wendy’s tens of millions of dollars because of the bogus allegations—but she never saw a dime herself. Instead, she was sentenced to nine years in prison after she was convicted of grand larceny for the scam. Ayala was slapped with the nickname “Chili Finger Lady,” a moniker and reputation that should have prevented anyone from ever taking her seriously again. The Times’ mistake appeared to have been first pointed out by Gilad Edelman, an editor at The Atlantic. He wrote to X that “something just seemed odd about the quote” so he Googled her, and, alas, her well-documented history as a fraudster presented itself. It remains unclear how Ayala was able to sneak a quote into the country’s paper of record, and spokespeople for the Times have merely referred outlets to its correction when reached for comment on the matter. At the center of the story was a Times/Siena College poll that asked respondents whether they’d be open to being contacted by a reporter to discuss “the issues in this survey.” The story carried three bylines: Shane Goldmacher, Ruth Igielnik, and Camille Baker. They have not addressed the gaffe publicly, and reports have not identified who conducted the ill-fated interview.","summary":"ReutersThe New York Times was forced to issue a correction on a story last week after it unknowingly interviewed a woman who’s among the country’s most infamous fraudsters. \n\nThat gaffe was published as part of an article about Kamala Harris cutting into Donald Trump’s polling lead.

He does not believe that with Biden's announcement it is safe to say that Donald Trump will be elected as US President. Trump is certainly ahead in the polls and in the ratings, but the margin, in his view, has been quite small. \"So it's premature to say that he's going to succeed. I think in this sense Hariss' candidacy is a good sign, because there was a lot of panic and a lot of anxiety in the Democratic ranks, because it would have been worse if Biden had just fallen off the podium in the next debate, or even crazier, if he had passed away,\" the expert stressed. At the same time, Andzans admitted that Hariss is not very popular, but she is a proven asset and has national recognition. At the moment, Harris is the best possible option for a nomination in this situation, and it is already evident that many Democratic Party heavyweights have expressed their support for her possible candidacy. Asked whether Biden's refusal to run in the US presidential elections could be used by Russia and China to their advantage to take action in the world's hot spots, the expert replied that it was unlikely that both countries would try to challenge the US more actively now. \"I don't think they will try to challenge anything, because Harris is on the same line, in a way she is a surrogate of Biden and has stood by him at all times,\" said Andzans. Overall, the expert believes that more surprises are not ruled out in the run-up to the US presidential elections. \"What could be more interesting than this! Two candidates who are basically 80 years old. One is convicted, then someone tries to kill him, and the other withdraws from the race. I think there are still surprises to come,\" Andzans added. As reported, this past Sunday US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race. After announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race, Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to become the Democratic Party's nominee for the US presidency.","summary":"RIGA - After US President Joe Biden&#39;s withdrawal from the race for re-election, current US Vice President Kamala Harris is the best option f......","url":"http://www.baltictimes.com/harris_is_the_best_option_for_the_democratic_presidential_nomination_-_expert/","image":"https://media.baltictimes.com/media/photos/161702_1257045988669a5e2664208_big.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 22:48:07","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"lv","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":252836796,"title":"Latvia will have its hands full regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election - Rinkevics  - The Baltic Times","text":"RIGA - Latvia will have its hands full regardless of the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, President Edgars Rinkevics told LETA on Monday. The president said that the victory of one candidate or the other should not be taken for granted. \"We will have our hands full in any case, but we should not focus on the pre-election battles and debates, we need to prepare for a very extensive, intensive diplomatic work after the November elections, both with the Congress and with the new administration,\" Rinkevics said. The president voiced hope that whoever wins the presidential election, the US will not slip into isolationism, that there will be an understanding that NATO is essential not only for Europe but also for US' security, and that transatlantic ties must be strengthened. \"Authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, North Korea were able to come together very quickly in the name of common interests. If we want to stand up to this, we also need to agree on closer cooperation,\" Rinkvics said. The president noted that the US electoral debate and campaign is currently very polarized, as evidenced by the recent assassination attempt against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the harsh rhetoric on social media. At the same time, the president said that Latvia would cooperate with any president elected by the people of the United States. \"We have had good experiences with both Democrats and Republicans in the administration and with both parties in Congress. Whoever becomes president of the United States, whichever party wins a majority in the Senate or the House of Representatives, my experience as foreign minister for many years and now as president shows that we cannot take things for granted - we have to constantly explain the specifics of our region and why proportional support has always been important,\" the president said. Rinkevics added that even when George W. Bush became President of the United States, Latvia fought to be admitted to NATO, which took a lot of energy. However, when President Barack Obama came to power in the US, there was Russian aggression against Georgia, and then it was possible to start thinking seriously about the first defense plans for the Baltic states. \"The annexation of Crimea, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine - all this shows that neither Latvian, nor Baltic, nor European diplomats will have time to relax,\" Rinkevics said. Assessing cooperation with the current US President Joe Biden, Rinkevics said that he had had the opportunity to meet Biden several times during his tenure as foreign minister. Rinkevics also recalled that Biden visited Latvia in 2016 when he was the US Vice President. The president also said that Biden was very well versed in both European and global issues, given his experience in foreign policy. In his view, Biden's understanding of our region and of international developments is very deep and broad. Rinkevics pointed out that in late 2021 and early 2022, when there was a lot of talk about a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was the US administration that warned the world, using intelligence data. \"It was a large-scale sharing of intelligence information with the public, warning allies, Ukraine, which was unprecedented in my memory. And I think that to a large extent, it allowed Ukraine to prepare and also to create the initial package of retaliatory economic sanctions and support packages, so that Ukraine could hold on and fight for the first few months,\" Rinkevics said.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson growing curls will be easier. She’ll lodge insults and put-downs. She’s got nothing to lose. Not like she’s going forth to rediscover radium. Until 20 minutes ago she was categorized as a card-carrying joke. She’ll increase her popularity among suburban women. And the GOP needs those suburban women voters to build Trump credibility. Suddenly, old Lack Joe Biden comes off a winner? Now freshly announcing he’s exiting only because he loves his country? THAT’s BS!! He’s exiting kicking and screaming. He’s canny. He thinks only for himself — and his grabby family. Mouthing this merde is because now it helps HIM. If he can smooth her over he’ll look better for picking her. Mind, she’s HIS choice, his product. Like going to the fruit market and picking something that has the least dents. He originally selected her because her embodiment — what she represented — was his ticket to the White House, not because she was next to join Mensa. Trust me, Jamie Dimon was not out hunting for her. The first talk Hillary Clinton just wrote an op-ed column excoriating Donald. Called him “unhinged . . . failed . . . dangerous.” Really? Pay attention. January 1993, I reported my first meeting with our then-new first lady. Hillary had invited me to a White House lunch. Donald had just married wife No. 2, Marla, and was ALL — ALL! — America’s then-first lady cared about. She repeatedly asked who attended . . . what did Marla wear . . . how was Donald . . . what did he say. Her conversation? ALL Donald. Only Donald. Not one thing about America, Europe, life, excitement, wages, customs, that husband — nothing. So now, what? Our fem Dem will cackle to Xi of China who’ll then run crying to his mother? She’ll make Putin fold and shiver and shake and get scared? After shouting “Death to America,” Iran’s Ayatollah will add “Except for Mrs. Harris?” What’ll she do about crime, rising prices, hospitals closing, poverty, global hatred, homelessness, defunding police, lawlessness, inflation, coral reefs, drugs, guns, crime, ocean acidification, water scarcity, fishing, deforestation, unemployment, aging population, immigrants, poverty, drugs, taxation? I mean, please. She gets nervous just running away from wearing a dress. What’s next? And left? We’re talking freeing crooks. Bronzing Bernie Sanders. She labeled Genghis Khan as fun. And Israel? She believes Hitler was just cranky. Forget that she coddled hack Biden, who today would flunk kindergarten, and that Mrs. Biden was a friend of the Secret Service’s former chief. Forget she conned us so we’d think low Joe was smart, sharp, on target, keen and wow-ee snappy and alert with a killer mentality. Before her anointment, records state only 16% of female voters viewed her favorably. So, wouldn’t we love a strong woman at the top of our country? Yes, yes, yes we would. Absolutely. YES! We were way out front for Hillary. 2008, I campaigned madly for my friend Geraldine Ferraro to be VP of the US. It’s just that this one is not the one.","summary":"Hillary Clinton just wrote an op-ed column excoriating Donald.

U.S. Senate Candidate Dave McCormick toured a natural gas pad in Warren, Pennsylvania, Friday to contrast his \"all of the above energy\" goals with Harris’ resurfaced comments from her 2020 campaign that she would ban fracking. Dave McCormick was quick to pivot to Kamala Harris this week as he vies for Senator Bob Casey’s Senate seat, considered one of the most likely pick-ups for Republicans to regain Senate control. McCormick released an ad Tuesday clipping Harris’ most liberal comments with Casey’s endorsement, calling Harris \"the most liberal Presidential nominee in U.S. history.\" The McCormick campaign points to Casey endorsing Harris as proof he is \"deeply out of step with the needs of Pennsylvanians.\" A 60-second version of the ad will air this Monday during the Olympics in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre and Pittsburgh markets. McCormick has spent months tying Senator Bob Casey to President Joe Biden, who according to a Fox News poll conducted June 7-10 had a 58% disapproval rating. The morning after the Pennsylvania primary in April, McCormick debuted his first general election ad \"98 Percent\" slamming Senator Bob Casey for voting with President Joe Biden 98% of the time. For months and most recently at the Republican National Convention, McCormick contrasted \"Biden and Casey's failed policies\" with the Trump-McCormick vision for Pennsylvania. As the presumptive Democratic nominee has changed in less than week so has the moniker fielding attacks from Republicans. HARRIS' FAVORABILITY SEES DRAMATIC SPIKE AFTER BIDEN DROPS OUT: POLL Former President Donald Trump and McCormick, who have both committed to unleashing American energy as pillars of their campaigns, latched onto comments made by then-candidate Kamala Harris at a CNN town hall. \"There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,\" Harris said in 2019. Reacting to Harris’ resurfaced comments at a rally in North Carolina Wednesday Trump said, \"She wants no fracking.\" President Harris and her campaign have since walked back those now viral comments alleging, she would not ban fracking. \"Trump's false claims about fracking bans are an obvious attempt to distract from his own plans to enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class,\" a spokesperson for the Harris campaign shared in a statement with Fox News. \"The Biden-Harris Administration passed the largest ever climate change legislation and under their leadership, America now has the highest ever domestic energy production. This Administration created 300,000 energy jobs, while Trump lost nearly a million and his Project 2025 would undo the enormous progress we’ve made the past four years.\" When asked by Fox News about Harris’ comments, McCormick pointed instead to the Biden-Harris administration’s record on energy, painting a conflicting view from the one presented by the Harris campaign. \"In this crazy effort to eliminate fossil fuel consumption in our country with all the EPA regulations, the ban on fracking, the LNG pause and killing the Keystone pipeline, the Biden administration has put hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidies to transition to EVs and to solar panels,\" McCormick said. \"The majority of those solar panels and lithium batteries come from China, so in this crazy strategy of the radical environmental left, we've made ourselves more dependent on our greatest adversary. That’s the folly of the Biden administration's energy policy: bad for security, bad for our economy and bad for the environment. We need pro-energy policies that open up the opportunity here in Pennsylvania.\" In a Fox News exclusive, Dave McCormick toured Bull Run Energy in Warren, Pennsylvania, Friday. Co-founded by Justin Hansen and Sam Harvey, the duo oversee 19 employees, 1,400 oil wells, and drill and frack 5 or 6 wells a year. Most of the oil they produce becomes products like lipstick and other lubricants and everyday products. \"Our company is very small,\" Harvey told Fox News Friday. \"We have 21 total employees, including myself and Justin. All the shallow conventional operators in northwest Pennsylvania are small businesses, so this is not Big Oil. This is people trying to make a living. It’s a very marginal business. It's hard to make a living doing this.\" Harvey outlined the difficulty of a one-size-fits-all approach to energy regulation, advocating to scale restrictions to the size and operation of an oil or gas business. Under the Biden-Harris administration, he said the top-down approach hasn’t matched the reality on the ground. \"Over the past three or four years, we've had a lot of regulations that have been rolling down from the federal government,\" Harvey said. \"They roll down to the state government, and then they're just now starting to get implemented toward us. What we're seeing is that a lot of these regulations are designed for Big Oil companies that are drilling unconventional, deep horizontal wells. It doesn't seem like the folks who wrote the regulations in D.C. have ever come out and visited what these shallow, conventional operations are like. The language doesn't even fit what we're doing here.\" McCormick told Fox News he visited Bull Run energy to do just that – see how small gas and oil operations are run so he’s equipped to legislate on Pennsylvania’s energy economy. \"I want to make sure I understand all the issues associated with our energy economy.\" McCormick said. \"So that when I'm a senator, I can be a pro-energy senator that does all the things necessary to make sure our energy sector develops.\" Earlier this year, McCormick unveiled his \"Keystone Agenda\" which includes \"unleashing Pennsylvania energy.\" The policy platform lays out a plan to remove Biden-era restrictions on gas and oil projects, embrace \"all of the above\" energy production, and use America’s natural resources to build energy independence and national security. \"We're blessed in Pennsylvania with the fourth largest natural gas reserves in the world,\" McCormick added. \"We just can't get access to them, and we can't get them into the hands of consumers around the United States and around the world. That's the key. Pennsylvania’s senator should be fighting for those things. Bob Casey has been weak every step of the way and has been for more regulations and eventually the elimination of fossil fuels. That’s bad for Pennsylvanians and bad for America.\" SOME SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATS AREN'T SOLD ON KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT: ‘MIXED FEELINGS’ In response, the Casey campaign doubled down on the senator’s commitment to \"responsible fracking\" and his voting record against fracking bans. \"David McCormick is grasping at straws because the people of Pennsylvania have figured out what he really is — a Connecticut hedge fund mega-millionaire who lied about where he lives, supports a dangerous abortion ban, built up the Chinese military, and invested millions in China’s largest fentanyl producer,\" a Casey campaign spokesperson shared with Fox News. \"Meanwhile, Bob Casey supports fracking and is actually delivering for the Commonwealth by holding greedy corporations accountable, lowering costs, and supporting veterans and seniors.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"This race and this election is about two fundamentally different views of the world and how we should lead our country forward, how we can have an economy that's for working people, how we have secure borders, how we have a robust energy sector, so we can be an energy superpower,\" McCormick told Fox News Friday. \"That's the choice between, Biden-Harris-Casey. Now, Harris-Casey versus McCormick-Trump at the top of the ticket. It's a fundamentally different view.\"","summary":"In the wake of President Biden&apos;s campaign resignation, Pennsylvania&apos;s Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick toured a national gas pad","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/u-s-senate-candidate-dave-mccormick-tours-natural-gas-pad","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/06/931/523/TRUMPMOS3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 22:34:13","author":"Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.089},{"id":252836936,"title":"Gisele Bundchen still the bikini queen at 44!

The lagoons reportedly form between the dunes during the rainy season (May-September), and the water is prevented from draining by a layer of impermeable rock. Gisele and little Vivian also enjoyed horseback rides in Lençóis Maranhenses. There were at least nine people taking sunset drives on ATVs in Bündchen's group, but it's unclear if one of them was her boyfriend of a year, jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente. The Nourish cookbook author also shared a delectable snap of some sort of quiche. Gisele co-parents Vivian and 14-year-old son Benjamin Rein Brady with seven-time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady, whom she divorced in 2022 after 13 years marriage. The retired NFL quarterback - who celebrates his 47th birthday this Saturday - famously named his Wajer 77 mini-yacht 'Viva La Viva' in honor of Bündchen and he just put the renamed 'TW12VE Angels' vessel on the market for $6.999M. Tom - who also fathered 16-year-old son John Edward Thomas Moynahan with babymama Bridget Moynahan - has not gone on even one date with SI Swimsuit stunner Brooks Nader despite reports, according to TMZ Sports.

The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations -- 66 per cent -- came from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle. Additionally, over 1,70,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. \"The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real -- and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,\" Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign said in early July that it raised USD 331 million in the second quarter, topping the USD 264 million that Biden's campaign and its Democratic allies raised in the same period. Trump's campaign had USD 284.9 million in cash on hand at the end of June, while the Democratic campaign had USD 240 million in cash on hand at the time. Harris quickly coalesced Democratic support after Biden, whose candidature fizzled following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump, exited the race. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were quick to announce their support. Prodigious Democratic fundraisers, former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama, also announced their endorsement on Friday. The Democratic National Convention next month will, however, decide if Harris will become the party's nominee, Al Jazeera reported. Harris, at her fundraiser on Saturday, said she remained the \"underdog\" in the race but that her campaign was picking up steam. Her takeover has re-energised a campaign that had faltered badly, as Democrats were left in doubt about Biden's chances of defeating Trump or his ability to continue in the White House if he had won. Meanwhile, in his campaign appearance in St Cloud, Minnesota, on Saturday, Trump called Harris a \"crazy liberal,\" accused her of wanting to \"defund the police,\" and said she was an \"absolute radical\" on abortion. As 100 days are left until the elections, polls over the past week have shown Harris and Trump essentially tied, setting the stage for a close-fought campaign, Al Jazeera reported. On Sunday, Mitch Landrieu, a campaign co-chair, said on MSNBC that Harris \"had one of the best weeks that we've seen in politics in the last 50 years.\" \"This is going to be a very close race,\" he said.

The ground has shifted under both political parties since June 27, when President Joe Biden’s poor performance in his debate with Trump threw the Democratic Party into chaos and prompted Trump’s team to eye an expanded electoral map. The race was rattled yet again after the former president survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. Just days later, he chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate and rallied the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee. Then, a week ago, Biden announced his exit from the race – and pointed to Harris, his vice president, as his successor. Within 36 hours, Harris had rallied the party behind her candidacy, locking down enough support from Democratic National Convention delegates to become the party’s presumptive nominee. Then she hit the ground running, holding events with voters in the swing state of Wisconsin on Tuesday, a Black sorority on Wednesday and teachers on Thursday. Friday morning, she touted the endorsements of Barack and Michelle Obama. Trump has responded to Harris’ apparent momentum with a series of personal attacks. At recent campaign stops, he has referred to her as “evil,” mocked her laugh and the pronunciation of her name, and said that “the American dream is dead” if Harris wins in November. The vice president responded at a Saturday fundraiser that the attacks by Trump and his running mate were “plain weird.” Polls are only beginning to capture the new state of play in a race that now has no clear leader. A Democratic vice presidential pick and convention, as well as potential debates between Harris and Trump and between their running mates, could further shake up the 2024 contest in the 100 days between now and Election Day, November 5. Trump escalates attacks on Harris The issues and lines of attack that are animating both campaigns are increasingly coming into view. Trump’s campaign has focused on inflation, border security and crime – and the former president is arguing that Harris bears just as much blame as Biden on those issues and that she is more liberal than her boss. However, Trump has also escalated his attacks on Harris, criticizing her in deeply personal terms at campaign events Friday and Saturday. At a conservative Christian gathering in Florida on Friday, he said that Harris had been “a bum three weeks ago” before her ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket and dubbed her “the most incompetent, unpopular and far-left vice president in American history.” He also said he “couldn’t care less” about mispronouncing her first name. Then, at a Saturday night rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Trump called Harris “evil” over her handling of the border and said that if “a crazy liberal like Kamala Harris gets in, the American dream is dead.” He also mocked his Democratic opponent’s laugh, claiming that the media was trying to portray Harris as a “Margaret Thatcher,” referring to the late British prime minister, but that “it’s not gonna happen,” because “Margaret Thatcher didn’t laugh like that.” A Harris spokeswoman responded to Trump’s Minnesota speech by slamming the GOP nominee as a “bitter, unhinged, 78-year-old convicted felon.” On Friday, Trump said protesters who sprayed pro-Hamas graffiti in Washington on Wednesday were Harris supporters, even though the vice president condemned their actions. He criticized her for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress, without noting that Harris met privately with Netanyahu and that his own running mate also didn’t attend the speech. And Trump said that Harris “doesn’t like Jewish people. She doesn’t like Israel. That’s the way it is, and that’s the way it’s always gonna be.” Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. Trump, who continues to peddle falsehoods and raise fears about election fraud, also drew heat on social media for telling the Florida audience that if he wins in November, they won’t have to vote again. “You won’t have to do it anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I’m a Christian. … You gotta get out and vote,” the former president said. “In four years, you won’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Harris, at a Western Massachusetts fundraiser on Saturday, said that the former president was pushing “wild lies” about her record and that the attacks by Trump and Vance were “plain weird.” “I mean, that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris told supporters. In campaign events since emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris is taking on Trump over abortion rights and casting him as a threat to freedom. “We are seeing a full-on agenda that is now about restricting rights, and one of the most fundamental rights, the right to make decisions about your own body,” she said at the Massachusetts fundraiser. “If there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one’s own body, what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking?” Harris has also been pointing to the former president’s legal troubles. In remarks to campaign staffers Monday – her first time delivering a brief version of her new stump speech – she recalled her time as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, saying that she “took on perpetrators of all kinds.” “Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” Veepstakes, convention questions Among the next orders of business for Harris’ campaign is to accomplish two tasks in a period of days or weeks that Trump’s campaign achieved over months. First, she must choose a running mate. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a team that is poring through financial documents, family histories, public statements, published documents, voting records, campaign experience and social media postings. Tony West, Harris’ brother-in-law and a former associate attorney general under Holder, is also playing a central role in the search. Democrats close to the process say the roster of leading contenders being vetted still includes North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who has developed a close relationship with Harris and has also been previously vetted and confirmed by the Senate, is also under consideration, along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sources say. Many of those potential picks have been offering Harris’ campaign informal glimpses of how they’d perform as her running mate through appearances on cable news shows. Democratic pollsters have been asked to test how Harris and the prospective candidates would fare in their home states – and in key battlegrounds – in hypothetical matchups against Trump and Vance. Harris has told the team of lawyers and advisers conducting one of the most accelerated vice presidential searches in modern American history that she plans to name her running mate before August 7. Then, Harris’ campaign and its allies must rapidly revise plans for the Democratic National Convention, which is set to start on August 19 in Chicago. Instead of nominating Biden for a second term, Democrats will use the convention to showcase the outgoing president passing the baton to Harris – and could alter the party’s programming to better align with the vice president’s personality and political appeal. Her campaign must also identify Harris’ best path toward 270 Electoral College votes. Biden’s hopes of a second term were thought to reside primarily in sweeping the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris, though, has been polling better among young and non-White voters – and could prove more viable in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina that appeared to be moving away from Biden. Debating the debates One of the biggest questions, now that Harris has replaced Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, is whether she will face Trump on the debate stage. The June 27 clash on CNN between Trump and Biden had already transformed the race. And a Trump-Harris debate could shape the race’s final weeks perhaps more than any other event. Biden and Trump had agreed to another debate – one that would take place on September 10, hosted by ABC. Harris said she would participate in that debate. “I think the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage. And so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she told reporters Thursday. However, Trump’s campaign released a statement indicating that the former president wouldn’t commit to any future debates until the Democratic nominee is formally selected. “Given the continued political chaos surrounding Crooked Joe Biden and the Democrat Party, general election debate details cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement Thursday. That prompted Harris to reply on social media: “What happened to ‘any time, any place?’” Coconut trees and ‘childless cat ladies’ Perhaps the clearest indicator of the political earthquake that’s taken place in recent days is the shift in cultural vibes and viral moments. Just a week ago, Republicans were riding high after a convention in Milwaukee at which Trump’s reaction to the assassination attempt days earlier – his right fist raised in the air as he mouthed “Fight” to the crowd – had become a rallying cry. Now, Democrats – who were previously fretting about slow fundraising, a disengaged base and slippage in support among young, Black and Latino voters – are rallying behind a candidate with more cultural cachet among those same voters. And Republicans are on defense, with Trump’s vice presidential pick, Vance, having to defend prior comments that could alienate the suburban women the Trump ticket is courting. Vance has come under fire over comments he made as a Senate candidate on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show in 2021. He told Carlson that the United States is being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He then specifically mentioned Harris, Buttigieg and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as examples. Vance did not acknowledge that Harris has two stepchildren with her husband. Buttigieg, who has since become a father to two children, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday that he and his husband were struggling with “a fairly heartbreaking setback in our adoption journey” when Vance made the remark. Actress Jennifer Aniston criticized Vance for the comment as someone who has struggled to have children and said she prays his daughter is “fortunate enough to bear children.” In an interview Friday with conservative host Megyn Kelly on SiriusXM, Vance said he was being sarcastic and the substance of what he said has been lost. He said he was criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming “anti-family.” “The simple point that I made is that having children, becoming a father, becoming a mother, I really do think it changes your perspective, and in a pretty profound way,” Vance said. Vance said it’s a “catastrophic problem” that the United States has the “lowest birth rate in our history in this country.” As CNN previously reported, the United States’ fertility rate has been trending down for decades, and in 2023 it reached the lowest rate in a century. Vance said his remarks about childless adults had been motivated in part by a conversation with his wife about balancing life as a working mother. “What a weird society that we’ve set up where moms who want to work, the thought that a lot of them are having is, ‘I can’t have more babies because it’s going to be bad for my career,’” Vance said. “How about we make the workplace more accommodating to working moms and working dads so that we can promote a real culture of life?” Harris, on the other hand, has been the beneficiary of a series of viral moments. Charli XCX, the British pop singer, declared the vice president “brat,” which is the title of her sixth studio album and a Gen Z summer soundtrack. It set off an avalanche of posts on TikTok, X and other social media platforms featuring the same shade of bright green as the album cover and video compilations of Harris. Then, there were the coconut memes, revisiting a May 2023 speech in which Harris spoke about “a difference between equality and equity.” “None of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context,” she said in that speech. “My mother used to – she would give us a hard time sometimes – and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’” Since then, coconuts and coconut tree imagery have been used online in support of Harris, with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis even posting an endorsement of the vice president communicated through three emojis: a coconut, a palm tree and an American flag. “What we’re seeing is a really classic example of when pop culture really gets intertwined with politics, and it takes a special kind of candidate and a special kind of leader to inspire that,” Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost, a 27-year-old Democrat, said on CNN. “It has to be organic. You can’t make it happen.” Harris’ previous remarks revisited There were signs that after a launch that had gone better than Democrats could have hoped, Harris’ previous remarks were coming under fresh scrutiny. CNN’s KFile reported Friday that Harris voiced support for “defund the police” in a radio interview in June 2020 amid nationwide protests for police reform, just months before denouncing the movement after she had joined the Biden presidential campaign. “This whole movement is about rightly saying, ‘We need to take a look at these budgets and figure out whether it reflects the right priorities,’” Harris said on a New York-based radio program on June 9, 2020, adding that US cities were “militarizing police” but “defunding public schools.” On Saturday, ahead of the campaign rally in Minnesota, the Trump campaign released a video that slammed Harris for her “soft on crime policies,” highlighting her 2020 support on social media for a fund that bailed out protesters in the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The Minnesota Freedom Fund is one of several US charities dedicated to helping low-income defendants post bail that boomed in the aftermath of Floyd’s death. However, the fund, in addition to other charitable bail groups, later came under fire after some defendants who were bailed out were arrested again for alleged acts of violent crime. As Trump’s campaign adjusts its tactics for the race against Harris, the former president has made clear on social media and on the trail that he plans to make political ideology an issue. “We’re not ready for a Marxist President,” Trump said Thursday on Truth Social, “and Lyin’ Kamala Harris is a RADICAL LEFT MARXIST, AND WORSE!” Trump had long criticized Biden over border security. He is similarly blasting Harris – who early in Biden’s presidency was tapped to tackle the root cause of migration from Central America. The Republican National Committee on Thursday posted a video on social media featuring assorted clips of Harris saying that an undocumented immigrant was not a criminal. Down-ballot Republicans have similarly begun attacking Harris as too liberal. In Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in one of the year’s most important races, posted a video Tuesday featuring Casey praising Harris – followed by a series of clips of Harris speaking in support of eliminating private health insurance, passing the progressive “Green New Deal,” abolishing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a mandatory gun buyback program and more. On Friday, McCormick posted a slightly shorter version of the video. “Starting this Monday, Pennsylvanians watching the Olympics will also see Bob Casey and Kamala Harris’ dangerously liberal agenda on display,” he said.

Tim Walz (D-MN) said he would not hide from his legislative history as a Democratic governor should he become Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate. Walz, who is also the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, was asked about former President Donald Trump attempting to portray Harris as a far-left candidate, and if his record as governor, including legalizing recreational marijuana and expanding LGBT rights, could either support or disprove Trump’s arguments. The Minnesota governor brushed off these concerns, arguing that his state is “a top five business state” and is within the top three happiest states in the country. “Look, they‘re going to label whatever they‘re going to label,” Walz said on CNN. “The fact of the matter is where you see the policies that Vice President Harris was a part of making, Democratic governors across the country executed those policies, and quality of life is higher, the economies are better.

Some have speculated that the boost in energy for the Harris campaign will only be temporary, as both commentator Piers Morgan and Gov.

President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris last Sunday following weeks of interparty fighting among Democrats on whether he should pass the torch to the next generation after his debate fiasco against former President Donald Trump, the newly confirmed GOP presidential nominee, last month in Atlanta.Newsweek has contacted Harris' and Shapiro's spokespeople for comment via email on Sunday.Biden's subsequent endorsement of Harris has positioned her as the presumptive Democratic nominee, with the critical task of selecting a running mate now at the forefront as the Democratic National Convention is set to begin in Chicago on August 19.Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the process, that Harris has narrowed her list of potential running mates to three elected officials: Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The Polymarket odds reflect this shortlist, with Kelly at 30 percent and Walz at 15 percent, trailing Shapiro's leading position.Shapiro, 51, is a relative newcomer to the governor's office, having taken the helm in January 2023. However, his political career in Pennsylvania spans nearly two decades, including six years as the state's attorney general, terms in the state's House of Representatives, and service on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners.Despite his rising stock in the vice president race, Shapiro's potential nomination has not been without controversy. A coalition of public education advocacy organizations recently urged Harris not to select Shapiro, citing his support for private school vouchers. The issue typically falls along partisan lines, with Republicans advocating for vouchers as a means to provide better opportunities, while Democrats and many educators argue that they divert funds from public education.Shapiro's record on education has been mixed. While he initially supported a $100 million school voucher program, he later vetoed it. In July, he signed a state budget that included a $1.1 billion increase for public schools, demonstrating a commitment to public education funding.Manuel Bonder, Shapiro's spokesperson, defended the governor's record in a previous statement to Newsweek: \"Governor Shapiro has consistently delivered historic increases in public education funding and finally, after decades of inaction, moved Pennsylvania towards adequately and equitably funding our public schools.\"As the Democratic National Convention approaches, speculation about Harris' choice continues to intensify. The Harris campaign has remained discreet about the selection process, telling Bloomberg that the vice president has \"directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates.\"Other names mentioned in various reports as potential VP candidates include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.For Shapiro, the increased attention brings both opportunities and challenges. His record as governor will likely face intense scrutiny in the coming weeks, as will his ability to appeal to a national audience. Pennsylvania's status as a crucial swing state adds another layer of strategic importance to his potential selection.","summary":"The Pennsylvania governor leads the vice presidential race as Harris narrows her shortlist, with a prediction market showing his odds doubling over the weekend.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/josh-shapiro-vp-race-kamala-harris-polymarket-odds-1931272","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437982/kamala-harris-josh-shapiro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 22:17:31","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":252835898,"title":"With Vance’s rocky debut, Republicans ask if Trump’s VP bet will pay off","text":"Until the very end, some people close to Donald Trump tried to talk the former president out of picking Sen.

The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total yesterday, said the bulk of the donations – 66 per cent – comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real – and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” the campaign’s communications director Michael Tyler wrote in a memo. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organised when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise USD400,000 but ended bringing in about USD1.4 million, according to the campaign. Harris quickly coalesced Democratic support after Biden, whose candidacy fizzled following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump, exited the race. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were quick to announce their support. Prodigious Democratic fundraisers former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama announced their endorsement on Friday. Harris at her Saturday fundraiser said she remained the “underdog” in the race but that her campaign was picking up steam. Future Forward, the largest super PAC in Democratic politics, announced last week it had secured USD150 million in commitments over the first 24 hours from donors after Biden bowed out and endorsed Harris. Democratic House and Senate candidates said they also have seen a surge in support since Harris emerged as the party’s likely nominee.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/harris-raises-usd200-million-signs-up-170000-volunteers-in-first-week/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/page-28-c_29072024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 22:03:16","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.062},{"id":252835948,"title":"Two years in 100 days: Extraordinary US election enters the homestretch","text":"The 100-day sprint to the US election began Sunday, the final act in a campaign transformed by an assassination attempt and the stunning exit of President Joe Biden. After weeks of infighting and despondency over Biden’s candidacy, Democrats have largely consolidated behind Vice President Kamala Harris, radically reshaping a race that was fast becoming Republican nominee Donald Trump’s to lose. Republican strategist Matt Terrill said Harris’s uniting of the Democrats had ensured a photo finish on November 5 — a ballot that will largely be decided by around 100,000 swing voters in a handful of battleground states. “It comes down to those independent, undecided voters. Inflation, immigration, the economy and crime — those are the issues they care about,” he told BBC News. “Right now, I think, former president Trump is doing quite well on those issues. This election will be a referendum on the incumbents in office — that’s still Biden and Harris. We’ll see how that takes shape,” Terrill said. While American election campaigns typically last almost two years, the 2024 edition has effectively been reset, making it unofficially the shortest in modern history. The Democratic convention in mid-August is expected to be a jubilant celebration of the party’s new standard-bearer Harris, who is enjoying record fundraising, growing grassroots support and an early boost in polling. It all looked so different just a month ago. Dogged by voters’ concerns about his age and mental acuity, the 81-year-old Biden was an outside bet at best, trailing his predecessor in the first presidential rematch since Dwight Eisenhower trounced Adlai Stevenson in 1956. Biden’s dismal June 27 debate showing ignited a five-alarm fire within his party. The flames were fanned by a flawless show of unity behind 78-year-old Trump at the Republican national convention — an event galvanized by the failed bid, just days earlier, to assassinate the former president at a rally in Pennsylvania. After an initial show of defiance, Biden bowed to the inevitable and dropped out last weekend. Harris, a generation younger at 59, threw her hat in the ring — turning what had been a stale contest between two unpopular, aging, white male candidates into a dynamic and unpredictable showdown. The former Biden-Harris ticket — now just the Harris campaign — held its biggest-ever rally Tuesday in Wisconsin and has raised more than $120 million in recent days, with disenchanted donors returning to the fold. Trump’s previous three-point nationwide lead in polling averages has been practically halved in a week, and the contest has become a margin-of-error tussle in most of the crucial swing states that decide elections. But Democrats enjoying the sugar high of the last week have been cautioned by party elders to sober up, with Harris still facing an uphill battle to beat the oldest major party nominee in history. “Before long, Harris’s ‘honeymoon’ will end and voters will refocus on her role as Biden’s partner and co-pilot,” Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio wrote in a memo this week. Democratic strategist James Carville told MSNBC that Democrats needed to cut the happy talk and prepare for the coming storm. “They’re coming at us and they’re going to keep coming. And this kind of giddy elation is not going to be very helpful much longer because that’s now what we’re going to be faced with,” he said. Even former president Barack Obama has cautioned against hubris, acknowledging as he endorsed Harris that Democrats are “going to be underdogs” and that she would have to earn the trust of voters.Trump, who has seen his favorability ratings tick upward since the July 13 attempt on his life and the successful Republican convention, will rally this weekend in the traditionally Democratic state of Minnesota. Harris, meanwhile, heads to Massachusetts for a fundraising event and will send her surrogates — including some favorites in the contest to be her running mate — out across battleground states.","summary":"The 100-day sprint to the US election began Sunday, the final act in a campaign transformed by an assassination attempt and the stunning exit of President Joe Biden.

They are very capable of doing so,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “No one can ever be allowed to stop or impede free speech or gathering,” he added. His remarks came after the Secret Service reportedly encouraged Trump’s campaign to stop scheduling outdoor campaign events following his assassination attempt, opting instead for large indoor arenas. Trump was wounded when a 20-year-old gunman shot at him during an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, killing one person and injuring two others. Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last Tuesday after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission of protecting high-profile politicians. She told a congressional committee that the Secret Service was alerted “two to five times” ahead of the attack about a “suspicious individual” at the rally, but was unable to locate him before he opened fire.

We’re creating a space of honesty and trust, where we can support each other and work for a new, brighter future.” The letter also included a link to a “social media kit” with pre-written posts that “white dudes” can use to try to get others to join the group. “The best friendships I’ve found with other men are built on mutual respect, trust, and supportive understanding,” one post says. “Would you trust Donald Trump to respect you, to honor your trust, and support you in brotherhood?” Buttigieg and Harris were once presidential primary rivals but lost out to President Biden. Biden, 81, then famously dropped out of the race last week, paving the way for Vice President Harris, 59, to take his place as the party’s presumptive presidential nominee and leading Dems such as Buttigieg to fall into supporting roles. Buttigieg’s support has apparently already helped. Morales initially called for 10,000 registrations for Monday’s virtual event, but after Buttigieg announced he was in, interest in it apparently exploded. “Yesterday afternoon, we emailed 8,000 of you so we could ask you to reach out to your friends and see if we could get this little group up to 20,000 before Monday’s call. And you guys absolutely crushed it! We are excited to announce that as of about 10 minutes ago, we are 20,000 strong,” Morales wrote. “Something unprecedented is happening here, and we are a part of it together.“ The group does not say explicitly whether non-whites will be allowed to attend, and a Post request for comment was not immediately returned. Race and nationality are becoming cornerstone issues this election as wars continue abroad, debacles such as US immigration rage and the rhetoric at home turns toxic.","summary":"Kamala Harris is using potential veep candidate Pete Buttigieg to woo “white dude’’ voters — “who need to be honest with ourselves and each other about the role we’ve played in our nation’s history.’’","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/28/us-news/harris-campaign-creating-space-for-white-dudes-to-be-honest-about-role-in-history/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/harris-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:56:28","author":"Joe Durbin","authors":["Joe Durbin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.447},{"id":252835238,"title":"No Tax On Tips - Be Careful What You Wish For","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin TIPS 3-C-07JUL00-BU-MAC The History and Sociological implications of tipping.

After paying the hosts, bus boys and dishwasher she keeps about 70% of the total. by Michael Macor/The Chronicle (Photo By MICHAEL MACOR/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images Donald Trump, our once and possibly future President, has been speaking about his idea to eliminate taxes on tips. He got the idea from a very intelligent waitress in a restaurant in one of the Trump buildings. The idea is part of the Republican Party platform for 2024. \"Republicans will make permanent the provisions of the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans. We will eliminate Taxes on Tips for millions of Restaurant and Hospitality Workers, and pursue additional Tax Cuts\". Of course the platform statement does not get into the nitty gritty details. There are two proposed bills to amend the Internal Revenue Code to be make tips more or less tax free. There is the \"No Tax on Tips Act\" introduced in the Senate by Ted Cruz (Senate bill) and the \"Tax Free Tips Act of 2024\" by Thomas Massie and Matt Gaetz in the House of Representatives (House bill). MORE FOR YOU Dana White Savagely Announces UFC’s Split With Undefeated Fighter Robert Downey Jr’s Casting As Doctor Doom Sparks Backlash From Fans Google Says Sorry After Passwords Vanish For 15 Million Windows Users Two Bills As I read them. the two bills would have profoundly different results. For illustrative purposes I have made up a restaurant server. Their name is Robin Waitstaff and they are among the group of servers who don't make a lot more than minimum wage. Robin is a single parent with three kids. They get by in part because of the child support that their ex Terry irregularly provides. In 2023 Robin worked 2,000 hours for $4,260 in wages and $30,000 in tips which works out to $17.13 per hour. There is $2,621 in Social Security Medicare tax withheld from their pay. The employer has to match that, but there is a credit given to the employer to the extent of the match that is over minimum wage. Then we come to income tax. Robin's income tax of $1,348 on line 16 of Form 1040 is reduced to zero by the Child Tax Credit. But that's not all. There is the Earned Income Credit of $1,963 and the additional child tax credit of $4,652 making a \"refund: of $6,615. So on net considering the withholding for Social Security Medicare tax and the refund on Form 1040, IRS is paying Robin $3,994. The Senate Bill creates an above the line income tax deduction for cash tips reported to the employer. This will be a significant benefit to higher earners or those without dependents, but it will not change Robin's bottom line at all. The House Bill is different. It amends Section 102 to define tips as gifts. It eliminates Social Security Medicare tax on tips and unemployment tax. It is a great deal for Robin's employer, but kind of disastrous for Robin. They save $2,295 in Social Security Medicare tax, but their 1040 \"refund\" is reduced by $4,897 because earned income is so much lower. The savings in Social Security Medicare is not a pure savings as it may have an effect on future benefits. For people with very low lifetime earnings (average indexed monthly earnings below $1,174), the return on additional amounts paid into Social Security is actually quite good. It is worth noting that both bills and all the rules currently existing apply to tips to employees. There are a lot of people who receive tips who are not employees. Among them are many of the entertainers in \"gentlemen's clubs\" and meal delivery drivers. Nether of the bills apply to them. Is Robin The Norm? There seems to be a lot of information on how much tipped employees make. Some of it must be true, but I am not able to discern what. This report titled Short Changed states \"While the national median individual income in the United States is $40,480, tipped restaurant workers median individual income is just 37 percent of the national median income, at only $15,198.9,10 High earning tipped restaurant workers are nearly nonexistent, and over 95 percent of these workers earn less than $53,000 a year.\" A former waiter that I consulted encouraged me to go to Reddit for some information. The discussion under \"How much do servers make in tips?\" provides anecdotal evidence that things might not be quite so grim for tipped employees, There are comments like: \"I once took a promotion to salaried management at $55k/year and it was a pay cut for more hours. I wouldn’t wait tables for $23k a year unless it was 2 shifts a week maximum.\" Regardless the argument in favor of the proposal seems pretty weak. Proposed legislation does little or nothing for or actually harms low paid servers. And when it comes to higher earning servers I have a hard time seeing why someone who makes $80,000 per year serving in a high end restaurant, assuming they are not non-existent, should be exempt from income tax on most of their income as opposed to people in all sorts of other disparate jobs earning that sort of money. Of course I feel the same way about clergy having exempt housing allowances in the hundreds of thousands. About The Earned Income Credit The idea that an income exclusion can end up hurting someone is counter-intuitive, but it is a real thing. An exemption that nobody I know of objects to is Section 112 - Certain combat zone compensation of members of the Armed Forces. Without digging too far into the fine points all or most of the compensation that service members earn in any month in which they serve in a combat zone or are in hospital as a result of wounds, injury or disease as a result of service in the combat zone is excluded from gross income. The exclusion for officers is limited to what the highest paid enlisted member earns, which is more than what most officers make. It seems like it came as a bit of a shock in the early stages of the War On Terror, when junior enlisted service members found they came out behind when they were deployed. That was because they had qualified for the earned income credit, but when they qualified for the combat pay exclusion, they no longer had earned income. The 2004 Working Families Act added an election that allows combat pay to be included in the earned income computation. The 2008 Heroes Act made the election permanent. Warren Buffett is a great proponent of the Earned Income Credit as an antidote to the extreme inequality that a successful free market economy is bound to create.

JD Vance's national introduction as former President Donald Trump's running mate has been less than ideal.Vance, known for his best-selling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" was elected to office less than two years ago. Many Republicans have long viewed him as a future face of the party, given his Midwestern background and his appeal to many MAGA adherents.But on the heels of a CNN analysis that showed Vance was the least-liked non-incumbent vice-presidential nominee in at least 44 years, the network also revealed that the GOP lawmaker has a double-digit unfavorable rating with voters across the Midwest.According to CNN, Vance had a 28% favorable rating and a 44% unfavorable rating — or a minus 16-point favorability rating — among voters surveyed in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin in July.For Republicans banking on Vance to help boost the party across the Midwest, his standing is far below where he'll need to be in order to win over swing voters in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin.CNN data reporter Harry Enten during an appearance last week also pointed to data showing that Vance had a minus 5-point favorability rating after the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\"The people who know him best, the region that knows him best, they like him even less than America likes him,\" he told the network's Erin Burnett.If JD Vance's popularity in his home region (-16 pts) is any sign, it won't get better for Vance nationally (where he's historically unpopular).Also, Vance's favorable rating is just 5% with undecideds (i.e. not for Harris/Trump) in the prez race. His unfavorable rating is 29%. pic.twitter.com/WmDhN1vchlVance is still early in his political career, but the Trump campaign needs him to move the needle now.Even in GOP-leaning Ohio, Vance vastly underperformed other statewide Republicans on the ballot during his 2022 Senate race.While Republican Gov. Mike DeWine won reelection by 25 points that year, Vance defeated his opponent — then-Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan — by only 6 percentage points.Democrats have needled Republicans over Vance's selection, arguing that his views on issues like abortion will repel female voters. But Trump has so far stood behind his vice-presidential pick.","summary":"JD Vance had a 28% favorable rating and a 44% unfavorable rating among voters in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, a July CNN survey found.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-midwest-presidential-election-gop-trump-2024-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/66a56c7fa0fc5856d597fe88?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:44:55","author":"John L.

It’s not ideal for a presidential campaign to peak roughly 100 days before an election, but these surveys, especially contrasted with other polling better for Trump, show the former president’s case against President Biden doesn’t translate to one against Vice President Kamala Harris as easily as GOP strategists might have hoped. They also show a race arguably slipping away under Trump’s nose. Especially given a common thread of these polls seems to be a “vibe” check; in other words, battleground voters like Kamala Harris more than they do Donald Trump right now, and it’s unclear how the Republican candidate changes that. As the Fox polls show, no matter who is ahead or behind, Trump is under water everywhere and Harris isn’t. Great for scuba diving but not great for close elections. In Michigan, which Biden won by fewer than 3 points in 2020, the Harris-Trump race is tied at 49% in a head to head, though Trump is up 45% to 43% against Harris in a race including Robert Kennedy Jr. (5%), Jill Stein (1%) and Cornel West (1%). Other positives for Trump, relatively speaking: He gets 17% of the black vote here, far better than the 0% he got in a recent Detroit News-WDIV-TV live-dial Michigan poll that showed a tied race. Trump also has a plurality of independents here with 36%, more than a double-digit lead over Harris and Kennedy. Still, Harris has a higher net-favorable rating than Trump, albeit by 1 point. Wisconsin, decided by less than a percentage point in the last two elections, sees a 1-point Trump lead in the binary battle and a race tied at 46% in the expanded field. Harris has support here from 92% of Democrats and 51% of women in the larger battle. Trump has 52% of men and 89% of Republicans and is +2 with independents. Just as in Michigan, though, Harris has a better net favorability: by 5 points. She’s at 49% approval and 49% disapproval; Trump is at 47% and 52% respectively. Pennsylvania, which was a little more than a – point race in 2020, is a dead heat here in the two-way matchup: 49% to 49%. That sounds great, but Trump has reason to worry, taking just 85% of Republicans in the expanded field, where he is down 45% to 43%. Other red flags in the larger field: Trump leads by just 8 points with men and 4 points with white voters. And when it comes to approval, Harris is treading water with 49% approval and disapproval, while Trump is 7 points under (46% approval; 53% disapproval). Minnesota sees a 6-point Harris lead in a binary battle and a 7-point lead in an expanded field where Trump takes just 84% of Republicans and clings to 5-point leads with men and white voters. She is 4 points above water in favorability, a 17-point net advantage over Trump. Republicans blame the media or blame Democrats for changing presidential candidates before the convention. While those are reliable punching bags to be sure, playing the excuse game more than three months before the election is less effective than coming up with a winning strategy. The trouble is that when it comes to the race against Harris, top Trump strategists seem to be caught flat-footed regarding the major problem facing the GOP ticket post-convention: changing the “vibes” that seem to all be in Harris’ favor since Biden stood down last weekend. During an appearance on Friday’s Brian Kilmeade Show, Trump consultant Chris LaCivita vowed his campaign would provide a “split screen all day long” between his candidate and the vice president on various issues. He then suggested it was premature to book a September debate between Trump and Harris because Democrats “don’t have a nominee yet” and there is an “open window for someone to challenge her.” “She doesn’t set the tone . . . we’re setting the agenda and implementing it,” LaCivita said, sounding like the Trump campaign is 10 points up instead of in a margin-of-error race where his candidate is struggling in terms of key metrics. Is there time to course correct? Probably. But is there any interest? To be determined.","summary":"Donald Trump received a rude awakening Friday night from Fox News, when it reported fresh polling in four key states that showed three of them too close to call and the other one slipping away.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/28/us-news/in-vibe-election-battleground-poll-shifts-should-scare-donald-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-wtvwlnuxp-1722200739737.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722186365&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jPoKF1ZH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:44:41","author":"A.g.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) argued the Democratic Party is using “all the king’s horses and all the king’s men” to put the party back together ahead of the 2024 election after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race. In the week since Biden dropped his 2024 reelection bid, the president and many Democratic lawmakers have endorsed Harris as the party’s 2024 presidential candidate. DeSantis contended that the presidential debate from last month did irreversible damage to Biden’s reelection campaign, resulting in the media making a major push to have the president drop out. “And now what you see is all the arteries of the left, the corporate media, Hollywood, academia, they’re using all the king’s horses and all the king’s men to try to put the Democratic Party back together again, and they have to whitewash Harris’s background to be able to make her palpable to the American people,” DeSantis said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. The Florida governor then questioned if the Democratic Party can succeed in making Harris an appealing candidate for president, arguing that “She owns all the policies of the Biden-Harris administration.” DeSantis then predicted that people will see “massive gaslighting” regarding Harris over the next 100 days ahead of the election. “That’s going to continue, and they’re going to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people,” DeSantis said.

As a new candidate, here's how she matches up to Republican nominee Donald Trump, according to three large aggregate polls.Following weeks of interparty fighting among Democrats on whether Biden should pass the torch to the next generation after his debate fiasco against Trump last month in Atlanta, the president endorsed Harris the day he withdrew from the race, starting a flood of pro-Harris memes on TikTok, over $100 million worth of donations, and 170,000 campaign volunteers.With 100 days until Election Day on November 5, aggregate polls from The New York Times, The Hill, and RealClearPolitics show Trump leading Harris at a smaller margin than her predecessor Biden prior to his exit.Aggregate Polls Of the three aggregate polls, RealClearPolitics shows the smallest gap between Trump and Harris, with Trump ahead by 1.7 percentage points at 47.9 percent and Harris at 46.2 percent. Prior to his exit, Biden was down 3.1 percentage points, at 44.8 percent, with Trump at 47.9 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average.The Times'aggregate poll puts Harris at 2 percentage points behind Trump, 46 to 48 percent respectively. In the previous matchup between Biden and Trump, the archived New York Times poll showed an additional percentage point lead for Trump, with him at 47 percent and Biden at 44 percent.The Hill's aggregation shows Trump garnering 48 percent of the vote, with Harris behind 2.1 percentage points at 45.9 percent. Up until July 21, the date that Biden dropped out, The Hill's aggregator showed him trailing Trump 43.3 to 46.6 percent, a 3.3 percentage point difference.Newsweek has reached out to the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment via email on Sunday.Included PollsSince Biden's exit, the largest poll sample included in all three aggregates is the Morning Consult survey of 11,297 registered voters conducted between July 22 and 23. It found Harris leading Trump 46 to 45 percent—the highest level of support recorded for Democrats since tracking began in 2022, surpassing Biden. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point.That poll's findings are similar to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between July 22 and 23, which put Harris ahead of Trump for the White House, 44 to 42 percent respectively. However, the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent means either candidate could be leading. The online poll was of 1,241 adults, including 1,018 registered U.S. voters.On the other hand, a survey of 3,013 registered voters included in the aggregate national polls is the HarrisX/Forbes poll, conducted between July 22 and 25. The results showed that 47 percent of registered voters support Trump, while 45 percent support Harris. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points.The Rasmussen Reports poll, which was not included in the Times' aggregate, but in the other two, shows the largest margin lead for Trump.A national telephone and online survey of 1,074 likely voters conducted from July 22 to 24 found that Trump had a 7-point lead over Harris. Fifty percent of voters support Trump, while 43 percent support Harris, 4 percent support another candidate, and 3 percent are undecided. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.The presidential election is determined by Electoral College votes rather than the popular vote. Candidates must secure 270 electoral votes to win the presidency, which is not always accurately reflected in national aggregate polls, as state-specific victories are necessary to secure electoral votes.","summary":"Here's how Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump match up according to poll averages over the past week since Joe Biden left the race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/harris-trump-polling-averages-one-week-after-biden-exit-1931251","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437967/donald-trump-kamala-harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:40:08","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":252834400,"title":"After Trump assassination attempt, House staffers may be required to take active shooter training","text":"A Long Island Island Republican unveiled legislation to require congressional staffers to get active shooter training in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. Rep. Anthony D’Esposito’s bill would apply to full-time employees of the lower chamber. Under his bill, the House Administration Committee must issue rules for the training protocols within 60 days of its passage. Members of the lower chamber, officers, part-time employees and interns would also be able to receive training. However, it would not be required for them. The training would also be available remotely. Full-time staffers would have until “December 31 of the year in which the session begins” or 60 days after starting out as a full-time employee to finish the training under the bill. A former officer in the New York Police Department, D’Esposito has been outspoken about public safety and law enforcement issues since taking office in early 2023. D’Esposito’s bill comes amid heightened security concerns around top politicians in the aftermath of the attempt on Trump’s life during the Butler, Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Just a day before the assassination attempt on Trump, D’Esposito claimed to have dealt with a bomb threat in his Garden City. The threat took the form of a phone call and his office alerted the proper authorities, according to a spokesperson. “Whether it’s bomb threats to my office or an attempted assassination against President Trump — it’s time for everyone to unite against political violence,” D’Esposito said in an X post earlier this month. The House of Representatives is currently on its August recess and is not scheduled to reconvene until September. Meanwhile, the Senate is set to convene this week before heading off to its August recess. There are multiple investigations underway into the security failures that led to a bullet grazing past Trump’s right ear and drawing blood during his rally last month. Last week, House leadership announced it was forming a bipartisan task force to look into the matter. President Biden has also called for an independent review and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General has confirmed that it is investigating. Kimberly Cheatle announced her resignation as director of the Secret Service last week.","summary":"Long Island GOP Rep.

But for now, at least, the state seems to be outside of his grasp. During a Saturday night rally in St. Cloud’s Herb Brooks National Hockey Center, Trump continued to insist that Minnesota, which has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since Richard Nixon’s 1972 landslide, is within reach. “Tom, we’ve got to bring this home, there’s no excuse, there’s no excuse,” Trump said in one of his frequent shout-outs to U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, R-6th District. Trump described Emmer as a close friend even though he torpedoed the lawmaker’s efforts to become House speaker last year. Trump also said “if they don’t cheat, we will win this state easily.” The possibility of winning Minnesota in November’s election is fed, at least in part, by Trump’s loss of the state by fewer than 2 percentage points in 2016, said David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University. “Trump said that if he had visited the state one more time, he could have won it,” Schultz said. “That always stuck in his craw.” In 2020, Trump lost the state by 233,000 votes, a larger margin than in 2016, prompting Trump to claim fraud and say he would never visit the state again. There was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Polls taken before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement showed a tight race. But polls taken after Harris began her bid for the White House paint a completely different picture. A Fox News poll released Friday showed Harris leading Trump 52%-46% in Minnesota, and a KSTP-Survey USA poll released the same day indicated there was an even wider gap, 50%-40%. Yet, in his speech to about 8,000 people who packed the St. Cloud hockey arena, Trump attacked Biden much more often than Harris, whom he dismissed as a “radical leftist” San Franciscan who is “worse than Biden.” He repeatedly called her a “border czar” (she was not) who is to blame for an influx of migrants, and he mocked Harris’ laugh. “In Minnesota, you will have people you don’t have now,” Trump warned, claiming 20 million undocumented migrants would enter the country under a Harris presidency. Yet Trump spent much of his time repeating the stump speech he used to attack Biden’s politics and mocking the 81-year-old president’s age. He often had to remind himself that Biden is no longer his rival for the White House during his 90-minute address. “I don’t want to waste a lot of time because it’s over now, right? He’s gone,” Trump said at one point. “I told you he would be. I told you he wasn’t going to make it. I told you.” Not a ‘top-tier battleground state’ The St. Cloud speech, and other stumbles by the campaign of Trump and his VP pick JD Vance, indicate it may be struggling to pivot to the new threat Harris poses. On CNN Sunday morning, Walz said there’s “a new burst of energy” moving Harris up in the polls in Minnesota and elsewhere. “There’s just a whole new vibe to the campaign,” said Walz, who is on a short list of possible Harris running mates. Abhi Rahman, deputy communications director for the Democratic National Committee, said there are no immediate plans for Harris to campaign in Minnesota. “We don’t think Minnesota is a top-tier battleground state,” he said. “We don’t think it’s going to flip.” Trump gave his standard stump speech in St. Cloud, a rambling discourse filled with grievances and misstatements. He praised Minnesota’s GOP members of Congress and called U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-5th District, a “terrorist.” The rally was aimed at a local audience as well as a national one, so at times Trump aimed to localize his address, saying, incorrectly, that Walz failed to call in the National Guard to quell unrest after the murder of George Floyd and that he was forced to do so himself. Trump also said he would “save the Iron Range” by eliminating a 20-year sulfide mining moratorium on 225,378 acres of Superior National Forest, which is located in a watershed that feeds the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. “We will turn the Iron Range into a mineral powerhouse like never before,” he said. But the battleground in Minnesota will be in the Twin Cities suburbs, Schultz said. In that arena, abortion rights and Democratic attacks that link Trump to a Heritage Foundation wish list of ultraconservative issues called Project 2025 is likely to have resonance. And Vance’s denigration of childless women does not help. “Vance does not move suburban voters,” Schultz said. “It’s more psychological warfare than reality. (Trump’s) base is already motivated.” While Trump’s visit to Minnesota may or may not have won him many new converts in the state, his campaign will take something home. Before the rally, Vance held a top-dollar fundraiser in Minneapolis. The top tickets cost $50,000 a couple and afforded a “roundtable” with Vance, as well as photos with the Ohio senator and the ability to attend a reception. The last time he was in Minnesota, in May, he raised about $1 million for the state GOP party as well as an undisclosed amount for his campaign.","summary":"Polls taken after Vice President Kamala Harris joined the race show her opening up a lead over the former president. \n\n\nThe post Analysis: Trump sees Minnesota victory in St. Cloud visit, but state remains just out of his reach appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/elections/2024/07/analysis-trump-sees-minnesota-victory-in-st-cloud-visit-but-polls-history-disagree/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/VanceTrumpStCloud2024_940.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:32:51","author":"Ana Radelat","authors":["Ana Radelat"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":252834694,"title":"Harris raises $200 nil in first week of White House campaign; signs up 170,000 volunteers","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has raised $200 million since she emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week, an eyepopping haul in her race against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, wrote in a memo. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Harris quickly coalesced Democratic support after Biden, whose candidacy fizzled following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump, exited the race. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, former House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were quick to announce their support. Prodigious Democratic fundraisers former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama announced their endorsement on Friday. Harris at her Saturday fundraiser said she remained the “underdog” in the race but that her campaign was picking up steam. Meanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates have stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream. Vance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has “got a little bit of a bump from her introduction” but predicted it would soon dissipate. “Look, the people are going to learn her record,” Vance said. “They’re going to learn that she’s a radical. They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.” Vance was echoing Trump, who in a campaign appearance with Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday, called Harris a “crazy liberal,” accused her of wanting to “defund the police” and said she was an \"absolute radical” on abortion. The vice president, a vocal proponent of abortion rights, has made clear that she will make Republican-backed efforts to restrict reproductive rights a key plank in her campaign. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Harris is “a nice person, but she’s incredibly liberal.” “If you expect Vice President Harris to change the course we’re on as a nation, you’re going to be sadly disappointed,” he said. “There is no liberal horse that she has chosen not to ride.” Trump backer Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also tried to brand Harris as a full partner for “a lot of the worst decisions of the Biden administration,\" including the chaotic August 2021 pullout of U.S. troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military. Cotton also accused Harris of emboldening Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah by pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the war in Gaza. Netanyahu met separately with Harris and Biden at the White House on Thursday. Afterward, Harris said she urged Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with the militant group Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she also affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza and the “dire” humanitarian situation there. Tensions in the Mideast intensified on Saturday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. “Frankly, it emboldens Iran and terrorist groups like Hezbollah because they believe that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will continue to put more pressure on Israel than it puts on Iran and its terrorists that are encircling Israel with the stated objective to destroy Israel,” Cotton said of the calls from Biden and Harris for a cease-fire in Gaza. Trump at his Saturday rally said the Golan Heights incident “will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States president and vice president.” And Vance on Sunday accused Harris of being “a disaster” on the conflict. Still, some Republicans are concerned that Harris' entrance has given Democrats a spark and that Trump needs to recalibrate. Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said Harris is in “honeymoon” period that will probably last a month, but he also acknowledged that both Trump and running mate JD Vance should stop the personal attacks against Harris because those will not drive people to vote. Instead, he said they must stick to the issues and “stay away from the insults.”. He said Trump missed an opportunity to do that in recent campaign events, but “hopefully they can get back on track. I think he was on track for a couple months there. I think that the change in the campaign has kind of fired him up to go against her, personally.” But Sununu also acknowledged that, ”nobody can get Donald Trump to do anything.

The campaign, which announced its latest fundraising total on Sunday, said the bulk of the donations — 66% — comes from first-time contributors in the 2024 election cycle and were made after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the race and endorsed Harris. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. Election Day is 100 days away. “The momentum and energy for Vice President Harris is real — and so are the fundamentals of this race: this election will be very close and decided by a small number of voters in just a few states,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, wrote in a memo. Her campaign said it held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats under consideration to serve as Harris’ running mate stumped for her. Harris campaigned in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday, drawing hundreds to a fundraiser that had been organized when Biden was still at the top of the Democratic ticket. The fundraiser had originally been expected to raise $400,000 but ended bringing in about $1.4 million, according to the campaign. Mandy Robbins, 45, of Decatur, Georgia, drove to one of those organizing events Sunday in the northern suburbs of Atlanta to hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a potential Harris running mate. She thought Biden did a “great job” in the White House, but acknowledged she “would not have been nearly this excited” if he remained in the race. “I finally feel hopeful now,” Robbins said. She added, “We can win this with Harris” Beshear spoke from experience to supporters, telling them their work could be the difference in what’s expected to be a close race. Beshear won his 2019 campaign by a margin of about 5,000 votes of 1.41 million ballots cast. He was reelected in November by a relatively comfortable margin. “Every door knock mattered. Every phone call mattered. Every difficult conversation that people had with their uncle at Thanksgiving mattered,” Beshear said of his 2019 race. “Everyone here today that signs up to volunteer … you might be the difference in winning this race for Vice President Harris.” Meanwhile, Trump, running mate Sen. JD Vance and their surrogates stepped up efforts to frame Harris as a far-left politician out of touch with with the American mainstream. Vance said after a stop at a diner in Waite Park, Minnesota, on Sunday that Harris has “got a little bit of a bump from her introduction” but predicted it would soon dissipate. “Look, the people are going to learn her record,” Vance said. “They’re going to learn that she’s a radical. They’re going to learn that she’s basically a San Francisco liberal who wants to take San Francisco policies to the entire country.” Vance was echoing Trump, who in a campaign appearance with Vance in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday, called Harris a “crazy liberal,” accused her of wanting to “defund the police” and said she was an “absolute radical” on abortion. Harris, a vocal proponent of abortion rights, has made clear that she will make Republican-backed efforts to restrict reproductive rights a key plank in her campaign. “There is no liberal horse that she has chosen not to ride,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “ Trump backer Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also tried to brand Harris as a full partner for “a lot of the worst decisions of the Biden administration,” including the chaotic August 2021 pullout of U.S. troops led to the swift collapse of the Afghan government and military. Cotton also accused Harris of emboldening Iranian proxies Hamas and Hezbollah by pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over civilian casualties in the war in Gaza. Netanyahu met separately with Harris and Biden at the White House on Thursday. Afterward, Harris said she urged Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with the militant group Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she also affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself but expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza and the “dire” humanitarian situation there. Tensions in the Mideast intensified on Saturday after Israeli authorities said a rocket from Lebanon struck a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 children and teenagers. The strike raised fears of a broader regional war between Israel and Hezbollah, which denied a role in the attack. Trump at his Saturday rally said the Golan Heights incident “will go down as another moment in history created by a weak and ineffective United States president and vice president.” And Vance on Sunday accused Harris of being “a disaster” on the conflict. Still, some Republicans are concerned that Harris’ entrance has given Democrats a spark and that Trump needs to recalibrate. Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said Harris is in “honeymoon” period that will probably last a month, but he also said that both Trump and Vance should stop the personal attacks against Harris because those will not drive people to vote. Instead, he said they must stick to the issues and “stay away from the insults.” He said Trump missed an opportunity to do that in recent campaign events, but “hopefully they can get back on track.” Sununu, however, acknowledged that ”nobody can get Donald Trump to do anything” he doesn’t want to do. “But hopefully the numbers, the polls, will get Donald Trump to realize what was working and what didn’t,” Sununu said Graham was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Sununu was on ABC’s “This Week, and Cotton was on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Read More Adam Peaty hints at starting a family with Holly Ramsay following split from ex Adam recently revealed he endured 'three years of hell' after suffering from depression and alcoholism and splitting from his long-term girlfriend Eirianedd Munro - but has now rediscovered his passion for swimming. He admitted he 'didn't want to see a pool again' after being 'broken' by the sport, turning to drinking and partying as an escape. When asked why he didn't quit the sport all together when at his lowest he said: 'I was within a hair of giving it all up. What was I going back for? Pride? It took a while to find the answer. 'But I wanted to teach [my son] George and any other children I have in future that you don't give up when things get hard or the world feels like it's against you. You give up when the time is right. I can take losses, but I couldn't take regret. Regret would eat any man inside out.' In 2022 his three-year relationship with Eirianedd ended after he appeared as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing - as did his eight-year unbeaten streak in the pool, and he took a mental health break after the Commonwealth Games. The swimmer said he became very depressed and turned to alcohol to cope.

'Gordon is a high performer. He worked his way up to the upper echelons of his industry and works in a place where there's no bulls***' 'I take a lot from that and from the professionalism he has every single day with a relentless pursuit. 'So, when I see that, I'm like, 'Yeah, why can't I work like this? Why can't I do this every single day? Why do I have to be so emotionally engaged with things?' He added that watching Gordon operate in his job inspired him to change his own manner and approach to swimming.

Loana Lecomte — a French cyclist competing in her second Olympics — was competing during the Mountain Bike Cross Country final … making good time and bouncing over all the obstacles at Élancourt Hill near Paris.

(@timbaetpoumon) July 28, 2024 @timbaetpoumon Check out the clip … Lecomte’s hustling down a steep hill when she hits a snag and flips over the front of the bike, slamming hard to the ground and going limp immediately. The cyclist behind her has enough time to maneuver out of the way, narrowly avoiding running her over … but, she still looks seriously hurt as cameras cut away.

Thankfully, photogs later caught her standing upright, face bandaged up with her coach … so looks like Loana’s going to be just fine. Lecomte finished sixth in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in this same event … and was reportedly in third when she crashed — so, it seems she could’ve medaled this year.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is resuming her credibility attacks on the Supreme Court in lieu of sweeping reforms proposed by President Joe Biden as Democrats question whether justices have made ethical violations. Warren previewed Biden’s proposal, which could include term limits, an enforceable ethics code, and a constitutional amendment that would eliminate presidential immunity, in a Sunday interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union. “We’re working on changes to the Supreme Court,” Warren said. “It can be term limits. It could be adding the number of justices, things we can do without having to have a constitutional amendment.” “We also have to change our Supreme Court, because right now we have a Supreme Court that has basically jumped the guardrails and is out there giving power to the president, saying that the president can commit any act that the president wants, saying that Congress cannot authorize agencies to act,” the senator continued. “So we’ve got a Supreme Court that is actively undermining our democracy.” Warren’s comments come after the Supreme Court ruled that former President Donald Trump may have some immunity from prosecution related to actions he took after the 2020 election. The ruling enraged many Democrats who have argued that the conservative majority, generated by Trump, is eroding the institution of the high court. Biden is expected to unveil his proposal on Monday. Democrats have called for an ethics code in the wake of controversy surrounding Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. These concerns have largely been panned by Republicans as smear campaigns attacking the legitimacy of the court. Thomas has been criticized for accepting luxurious “gifts” from wealthy donors without disclosing them. He has maintained that he was not required to do so. Alito has refused to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, defendants over an upside-down flag in 2021 and an “Appeal to Heaven” flag outside his New Jersey beach home, arguing that his wife had legal rights to fly the flag that is associated with those who stormed the Capitol. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) filed impeachment articles against Alito and Thomas on July 10 as a response to the “unchecked corruption crisis on the Supreme Court” that has “spiraled into a Constitutional crisis.” Warren has previously been critical of the Supreme Court, regarding the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the high court’s interference with Biden’s plan to cancel student debt.","summary":"Sen.

Among the controversial now-deleted tweets was a \"Yes\" in reply to a question asking if pride flags and illegal immigrants should be banned from schools and churches, and another affirmative response to whether the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. These actions are notably out of character for the 1978 Formula 1 World Champion, whose public engagements and statements have historically been apolitical and focused on the sporting and business aspects of racing.Recognizing the discrepancy, Andretti's team acted swiftly. \"Mario's account has been compromised. We're working on it,\" confirmed his representatives, as reported by GP Fans, as they reached out to platforms to control the damage and began efforts to secure his account. Meanwhile, the offensive tweets were promptly deleted once the hacking was realized.The breach drew considerable backlash from the X community, raising concerns about Andretti's reputation and his suitability for future roles. Speculation abounded particularly around his potential involvement with a new Formula 1 team entry, with fans and critics alike weighing in.Despite the hack, it's important to remember Mario Andretti's recent history of advocacy for diversity and inclusion. At the 2022 Indianapolis 500, driver Romain Grosjean's race car, managed under Andretti Global, proudly displayed a pride rainbow on its sidepods. Michael Andretti, Mario's son and head of Andretti Global, explained, as quoted in the same report from GP Fans:\"We're really proud to stand with DHL and once again bring the Delivered with Pride message to the racetrack.\"The month of May is the perfect stage to promote diversity and help build a culture of inclusion. We look forward to seeing the DHL Pride livery on track during this week's test days and again through the Indy 500.\"Andretti Global is continuing with its push to join the Formula One grid. After receiving approval from the FIA in October 2023, the American team's bid was ultimately rejected by Formula One Management in January with the note that they might be reconsidered in 2028. Mario Andretti explained at the time, as quoted by NBC Sports:\"I was offended, actually. I don't think we deserved that, to be honest with you.\"All they have to do is look back and we didn't just talk about, 'We're going to do this and that.' We're doing it, and it shows proper commitment.\"What else do you want? It's a big investment in the series, and you'd think they would welcome that. Even the value of the series is more valuable with 11 teams than 10, so I don't know.\"Tell us what is really wrong.\"That's another offensive statement there. How are you going to take them? We're the ones that worked it out, and GM said it over and over, 'Andretti or nothing,' and then they still tried to take it.\"I don't know. There's an undercurrent there that I don't understand quite honestly.\"But if they want blood, well, I'm ready.\"","summary":"Mario Andretti's Twitter account was hacked after engaging in controversial tweets.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/mario-andretti-representatives-insist-former-f1-champion-has-been-hacked-after-donald-trump-tweets-1931255","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437973/mario-andretti.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-28 21:08:21","author":"Lydia Mee","authors":["Lydia Mee"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.115}]}
