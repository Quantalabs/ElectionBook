We know that he’s worried about the state of the Russian economy,” Starmer stated. “I’m here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin’s war machine. Because ultimately, alongside our military support, that is what will bring peace closer.”\nTrump’s Stance On Sanctions And Peace Talks\nTrump, who has expressed a desire to broker a swift end to the conflict, previously claimed he could negotiate a resolution in just one day. Last month, he warned of imposing steep tariffs and additional sanctions on Russia if Putin did not take steps to end the war. Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump said that by pushing for a settlement, he was doing Russia and its leader a “very big favour.”\nThe UK government believes Russia is under increasing financial strain due to the ongoing conflict, with rising inflation and high interest rates putting pressure on its economy. The UK has sanctioned 2,100 Russian individuals and entities since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, including more than 100 ships transporting Russian energy, particularly 93 oil tankers, significantly impacting Russia’s oil sector.\nStarmer’s visit to Brussels includes a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who has previously warned that Western nations must shift to a “wartime mindset” and accelerate defense production to counter Russia’s aggression. The UK prime minister is also under scrutiny over Britain’s defense spending, with calls for a clear timeline on increasing it to 2.5% of GDP from the current level of just over 2%.\nOver the weekend, Starmer hosted German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at Chequers to discuss the situation in Ukraine. A spokesperson for the prime minister said the talks focused on ensuring Ukraine is in the “strongest possible position in the coming months, so that peace could be achieved through strength.”\nALSO READ: Panama Stands Firm As US Warns Of Action Over China’s Canal Influence","summary":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for intensified economic pressure on Russia, urging European leaders to strengthen collective actions to undermine Vladimir Putin’s war efforts in Ukraine.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/keir-starmer-urges-stronger-european-action-on-russia-citing-trumps-sanctions-threats/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/keir.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:24:21","author":"Sofia Babu Chacko","authors":["Sofia Babu Chacko"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.262},{"id":286419722,"title":"Musk brands USAID 'criminal' as civil service scrutiny grows","text":"Elon Musk attacked the U.S. Agency for International Development, calling it a \"criminal organization\" on Sunday, sparking fear over the intensity of President Donald Trump's unprecedented scrutiny of the work of the civil service.\n\nThe assault on the agency tasked with humanitarian relief overseas marks a significant new front in Trump's move to give unprecedented power Musk to upend government departments and counter what the two political allies consider wasteful official spending and overreach.\n\nSince Trump's inauguration Musk has addressed far-right groups in Europe, given an infamous raised-arm gesture compared to a Nazi salute, and attacked the Treasury for making authorized payments on the government's behalf.\n\n\"USAID is a criminal organization,\" Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX who has become the president's most powerful backer, wrote on his X platform, replying to a video alleging USAID involvement in \"rogue CIA work\" and \"internet censorship.\"\n\nIn a subsequent post, Musk doubled down and, without giving evidence, asked his 215 million X followers, \"Did you know that USAID, using YOUR tax dollars, funded bioweapon research, including COVID-19, that killed millions of people?\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on the allegations, which officials in the previous administration linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nTrump initially froze all aid spending for three months, and though he subsequently issued waivers for food and other humanitarian aid to continue, aid workers say uncertainty reigns with the future of the organization as an independent agency far from assured.\n\nUSAID, an independent agency established by an act of Congress, manages a budget of $42.8 billion meant for humanitarian relief and development assistance around the world.\n\nA senior official from a U.S.-based organization feared that the prioritization of \"emergency\" assistance was part of a broader plan in which Washington would discontinue funds for anything else.\n\nMusk has indicated he will give an update on the work of DOGE in a talk broadcast on his X platform at midnight Washington time.\n\nIt is unclear what will be covered in the event, but it could give further insight into the unchecked effort by Musk to map out government expenditure and operations.\n\nDOGE was founded as part of the so-called \"executive office of the president,\" as a temporary 18-month organization under the repurposed United States Digital Service.\n\nIt does not enjoy full status as a government department, which would require the approval of Congress, and Musk is neither federal employee nor a government official. It is unclear to whom DOGE is accountable.\n\nThere have been reports Trump wants to roll USAID into the State Department.

Mexico’s peso slid more than 2 per cent to 21.15 against the dollar. The euro also lost 1 per cent.\n\nUS stock futures also fell sharply, with contracts tracking the benchmark S&P 500 losing 1.8 per cent and those tracking the Nasdaq 100 sliding 2.6 per cent.\n\nTrading volumes are typically very thin early in the session, which can exacerbate price movements.\n\nThe steep declines came after Trump on Saturday imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10 per cent levy for Canadian energy, and new 10 per cent tariffs on imports from China. He also last week threatened new levies against the EU.\n\nEconomists have warned that the new tariffs are likely to accelerate inflation in the US, something that pushed up Treasury yields and the dollar following Trump’s election in November.\n\n“The clearest implication is a stronger dollar,” said Eric Winograd, chief economist at AllianceBernstein. “A long dollar position is the cleanest, clearest expression of the trade war that is now being launched.”\n\n“The currencies that will suffer the most are the ones against whom the tariffs are being imposed,” added Winograd, noting that “there’s a good case to be made that the equity market will suffer a little bit”.\n\nOil prices also climbed on Sunday evening, with international benchmark Brent crude climbing 1.5 per cent to almost $77 a barrel.\n\nGeorge Saravelos at Deutsche Bank said the tariff announcements were “at the most hawkish end of the protectionist spectrum we could have envisaged”, and that markets needed to “structurally and significantly reprice the trade war risk premium”.\n\nThe Mexican peso has whipsawed in recent weeks as traders have scrutinised the new Trump administration’s announcements for clues about how quickly and how extensive any new levies would be.\n\n“If the tariff stays on for several months the exchange rate will reach new historic highs,” said Gabriela Siller, chief economist at Mexico’s Banco Base, referring to the number of pesos per dollar. “If the tariff stays on it will be a structural change for Mexico . . . and Mexico could go into a profound recession that would take years to come out of.”\n\nBy comparison, BBVA Mexico analysts said they thought it was unlikely the tariffs would last long. However, if they did remain in place, he said they would have a “very negative” impact on investment in Mexico and its competitiveness.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the White House Watch newsletter for free Donald Trump’s tariffs shook&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Investor concerns over Donald Trump’s tariffs lead to decline in Canadian dollar and Mexican peso first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/investor-concerns-over-donald-trumps-tariffs-lead-to-decline-in-canadian-dollar-and-mexican-peso/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Canadian-dollar-and-Mexican-peso-slide-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:19:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":286418610,"title":"‘Disgraceful!’ Trump says Dems would oppose George Washington and Abraham Lincoln if he nominated them","text":"PALM BEACH, Florida – President Donald Trump went on a Truth Social posting spree Sunday evening, with one of his messages blasting Democrats in the U.S. Senate who are delaying confirmation of his nominees.\n\n“Democrats are purposefully delaying virtually all of my Nominees,” Trump began.\n\n“No matter how good and well qualified someone is, they are taking maximum time for approval – and laughing about it.

But the Democrats don’t understand, with what they’re doing, that their losses will only get greater. Republicans must GET TOUGH – AND MUST GET TOUGH VERY FAST.

'So we have some work to do as this salvage operation goes on, and we will absolutely stay here and search until such point as we have everybody.'\n\n'Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,' Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers added.\n\nCrew members are also scheduled to undertake a 'lifting operation' on Monday to remove the wreckage from the river. \n\nPortions of the aircraft will then be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation. \n\nMore than 300 responders are taking part in the recovery effort at any given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.\n\nBut the recovery efforts have proved to be challenging thus far, as Donnelly confirmed that a diver with the Metropolitan Police Department had to be transported to a local hospital for hypothermia.\n\nHe has since checked himself out of the hospital.\n\n'We're happy to report that he's doing fine, and that's the only injury we have today,' the chief reported.\n\nAn unidentified firefighter working the scene, however, told reporter Brian Entin he and others are 'emotionally wiped out after seeing the horror up close.'\n\nThe firefighter explained that the water is 'actually very clear' and with their flashlights, 'they saw horrible things when they arrived.'\n\nMeanwhile, family members of the victims gathered at the crash site on Sunday as they awaited news about their loved ones.\n\nDozens of people were seen arriving in 10 charger buses - with a police escort - to the banks of the Potomac River just outside Reagan National Airport, where the plane went down just before 9pm.\n\n'Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,' National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said of the grieving families. \n\n'They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.'\n\nIt has since been revealed that the Black Hawk helicopter it collided into may have been flying hundreds of feet outside air traffic control's predesignated, approved route for the international airport, just outside of the nation's capitol.\n\nThe Black Hawk was supposed to be following 'Route 4' - a known path at Reagan National that allows helicopters to fly at altitudes below 200 feet to avoid commercial jets arriving at the Virginia airport - sources told The New York Times. \n\nHowever, the military aircraft - which was marked as a PAT-25 - was flying above 300 feet and was at least a half-mile off course when it collided with American Airlines Flight 5342 on Wednesday evening, killing everyone onboard.\n\nAn experienced air traffic controller exclusively told DailyMail.com that the air traffic control (ATC) audio that emerged from the crash showed the operator's instructions to the helicopter were 'very ambiguous.'\n\nIn the nearly minute-and-a-half recording, ATC operators could be heard asking the helicopter if the commercial flight is in sight.\n\nThrough muffled audio, more commands and confirmations were made between ATC operators.\n\nOne air traffic controller said to the helicopter pilot: 'PAT 2-5, do you have the CRJ in sight?'\n\nSeconds later, the controller spoke again, requesting: 'Pat 2-5 pass behind the CRJ.'\n\nThe Black Hawk never responded and moments later, the two aircrafts would collide in a fiery explosion over the river. \n\nFive current and former controllers told The Times the controller should have instructed both aircrafts to fly away from each other rather than just asking one to move from the other. \n\nHowever, they recognized that it's harder to gauge distance at night and some wondered if the Black Hawk had mistaken a different plane in the busy airspace as AA 5342. \n\nIn addition, sources told The Times only one controller was dealing with both commercial planes and helicopters after one employee was sent home. \n\nIt is normal for one person to be in charge of both post-9:30 pm as airport traffic significantly decreases. However, the crash happened before 9 pm. \n\nA preliminary FAA report, obtained by The Times, states that Reagan's control tower staffing was 'not normal for the time of day and volume of traffic.' \n\nWhen contacted by DailyMail.com, the FAA said it 'cannot comment on any aspect of open investigations' and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - which is leading the investigation - will provide updates when it can. \n\nFederal investigators are now working around the clock to piece together exactly what went wrong.\n\n'This is a complex investigation,' investigator-in-charge Brice Banning said. 'There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.'\n\nFull investigations from the National Transportation Safety Board typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days. \n\nIn the meantime, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy posed a series of questions about the crash on morning television news programs Sunday.\n\n'What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed?' he asked on CNN. \n\n'The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?'\n\nThen on Fox News, Duffy announced that the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing at the control tower. \n\n'Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,' he lamented, as he promised that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with 'bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.'\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump repeated the claims that the Army helicopter was flying higher than allowed.\n\n'It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???' he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nWednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. \n\nThe crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.\n\nExperts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.","summary":"A dozen more victims of the deadly American Airlines and Black Hawk helicopter crash have been identified, authorities announced Sunday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14352887/Death-toll-rises-American-Airlines-plane-crash-Black-Hawk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/02/23/94783121-0-image-a-15_1738539188777.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/30/8422155181228932630/1024x576_MP4_8422155181228932630.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:06:37","author":"Associated,Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Associated","Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":286414742,"title":"Irish Examiner view: Split-second timing keeps our skies safe","text":"Both flights were cleared for take-off by air traffic control within two minutes of each other on intersecting runways at Cork Airport. A potential for collision was averted when the four-seater C-172 executed a hard right to take it away from the passenger jet. \n\nAlthough investigations are ongoing, and could take up to one year, some reports suggest the aircraft were less than 30m apart, an incident which has been logged as a “loss of separation” by the Air Accident Investigation Unit. This would breach international rules which specify minimum safe distances.\n\nThis news emerges in a week where there has been major focus on safety following allegations from US president Donald Trump that the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes of his predecessors contributed to making the skies less safe after the Potomac disaster when an army Black Hawk helicopter flew into a commercial jet with the loss of 67 lives. \n\nDEI is a set of policies, adopted by many corporations, which encourages workplace representation and participation of people of different genders, races, ethnicities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, and classes. \n\nMr Trump, who has produced no evidence, says that this has made standards more lax.\n\nWhile there is nothing of that sort at play in the Cork incident, speculation is limited by a general rule of omerta which applies to such occurrences until an official report is issued.\n\nThe operator of the C-172 flight, the Atlantic Flight Training Academy, said it was precluded from comment and pointed out the air industry operated under a ‘just culture’ philosophy. \n\nThis is another set of operational principles which has become prominent since the late 1990s, gaining currency within aviation, medicine, and the industrial world. The objective of ‘just culture’ is to ensure focus on what happens when things go wrong rather than making the allocation of blame the prime objective.\n\nAirlines, operating in an environment where customer confidence in safety is paramount, face a series of fine judgements about sharing information. \n\nOne of the striking moments in recent documentaries and dramas about the Lockerbie disaster was when it became apparent that government officials and their staff based overseas were provided with security warnings that were not on offer to the general public.\n\nHindsight might conclude that it is always best to over-compensate on disclosure when it relates to retaining the trust of the customer. \n\nNotwithstanding that, we are all well-served by reminders that air travel carries risks. Observing the number of passengers who routinely ignore pre-flight safety demonstrations, this can’t be stated too frequently.\n\nProtectionism tends not to end well\n\nThis is not the first time that the US has been keen on protectionism as an arm of foreign policy. But the precedents are not encouraging.\n\nHigh tariffs were first introduced after the American Civil War but they reached their apogee in the decade after the end of the First World War. \n\nInternational trade and economic co-operation was severely hindered. Markets became volatile. European countries could not export across the Atlantic to earn dollars to service their war debts.\n\nWe know how that ended. Poet WH Auden was sitting in a “dive on 52nd St” on September 1, 1939, “as the clever hopes expire of a low dishonest decade”.\n\nUS president Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China are due to be implemented at 12.01am Eastern time tomorrow. It will be “a shot heard around the world”. \n\nEurope will be the next target.","summary":"Reports of a near miss over Cork Airport remind us how busy our skies are, a truth to which we are often oblivious","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41566909.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8973/4486903_5_seoimage1x1_1686101_1686101.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:05:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":286420370,"title":"Behind Mitch McConnell's Supreme Court engineering","text":"When the longest-serving Senate leader in U.S. history stepped down at the end of the last Congressional term, the most significant legacy he left was not in the halls of the Capitol.Instead, Sen. Mitch McConnell's impact as leader of the Senate Republicans ripples throughout the judiciary. Under his leadership, the Senate confirmed three Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices and more than 200 lower-court judges, tilting the courts in favor of conservatives for a generation.In a recent interview with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl, McConnell said putting his focus on the judiciary was his way of attaining enduring influence.\"It's a lifetime appointment,\" McConnell said. \"The normal legislative activities we involve in, they take over, taxes go up. We take over, taxes go down. In other words, it's very hard to get any kind of lasting impact. I felt that the way to get lasting impact is to put the right kind of men and women on the courts who hopefully will be there for a while.\"What will likely also last a while is the controversy over how he did it. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, then-President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to fill the seat. But before Obama could even announce Garland's name, McConnell led Republican senators in saying they would refuse to even hold a hearing on any replacement. They claimed it was too close to the November election, nearly nine months away.But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg died just six weeks before the 2020 election, McConnell pushed through President Donald Trump's nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, in one of the quickest Supreme Court confirmations in modern history.At the time and again in his interview with Stahl, McConnell justified his actions by pointing to a speech former President Joe Biden gave in 1992. At the time, Biden was a senator, George H.W. Bush was president, and the election was only a few months away.In the 1992 speech, Biden suggested that a president should not nominate a Supreme Court justice during an election year. Then the chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden hypothetically proposed that, should a Supreme Court seat be vacated that year, the Senate wait until after the November election to allow the voters to decide on the next president before confirming a nominee. Biden's idea was moot: the Supreme Court did not have a vacancy until after the election. The next seat was vacated when Justice Byron White retired a year after Biden made his speech, a seat Ginsberg would eventually fill.In citing this so-called \"Biden rule,\" McConnell went on to argue that the 1880s were the last time a vacancy was created in a presidential election year and the Senate of a different party confirmed it.But Senate Republicans did not even allow Garland's nomination to get to a point where they could confirm or reject it. McConnell argues that he was legally allowed to do it â and to turn around and muscle through Barrett four years later. His justification came down to whether the party in power in the Senate was the same as that in White House. \"There's nothing unconstitutional about it. It doesn't break any rules,\" McConnell told Stahl. \"The majority decides whether to vote or not. And that's why in 2020 we were in the majority. The president was of our party. The vacancy occurred, and we filled it.\"In his biography of McConnell, author Michael Tackett called McConnell's blocking of Garland \"brutish\" and said the decision was an unusually impulsive one.\"This was the sheer exercise of power,\" Tackett said. \"That was a total concoction to give the gloss of authority for what he wanted to do.\" According to Tackett, McConnell and his wife were taking a vacation in the Caribbean when Scalia died. By the time McConnell was in his hotel room, Tackett said, he told his staff they had to put out a statement saying the seat would not be filled.\"He announces this rather impulsive decision,\" Tackett said. \"And then he realizes, 'We have to have a rationale for that decision.' So he tells his staff to, 'Look at the history books. Find us a rationale, find us some justification for this argument.'\"According to Lawrence Friedman, a professor of privacy and constitutional law at New England Law, McConnell's blocking of Garland went beyond a show of powerâit was \"arguably unconstitutional.\" According to Friedman, the blockade \"undermined both the letter and spirit of Article II, which states that the president 'shall have the power' to 'nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint â¦ judges of the Supreme Court.'\" In her conversation with McConnell, Stahl asked if the court he helped create is doing what he and his conservative allies hoped it would. McConnell said his motivation in creating a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court was reigning in the administrative state, which refers to government agencies that establish, implement, and interpret their own regulations.Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed the power of federal agencies, including Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which was decided last year. With Loper Bright, a majority of justices rejected the established principle known as the Chevron deference, which held that courts should typically give weight to government agencies when interpreting the laws they enforce.\"This new Supreme Court reversed that,\" McConnell said. \"And that's a message to Congress, that if you want us to do something, you better spell it out. And it's also a message to the private sector, that if you think this agency doesn't have the authority to do this, sue them and you might have a chance at winning.\" Another pivotal decision the Supreme Court has made recently was to overturn Roe v. Wade, and Stahl asked McConnell if that was one of his goals. The Kentucky senator responded that it did not matter what he thought. \"It's a new political process now.

We view ourselves as your neighbor, your closest friend, your ally, you know, a country whose citizens have fought and died with you around the world in defense of values that we share, who come to the aid of the Los Angeles fires, most recently, and I think are really perplexed by this move. So I don’t think anybody will need to tell Canadians what to do. I think that they will make their decisions on their own,\" she told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Trump signed an executive order authorizing the tariffs on Saturday, which will go into effect Tuesday, consisting of a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Stephanopoulos asked Hillman if the Canadian citizens felt betrayed. TRUMP TREASURY PICK: EXTENDING TRUMP TAX CUTS ‘SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ISSUE’ \"I think they’re confused. I don’t think they understand where this is coming from. I think they know the degree to which we have made every effort to address the president’s concerns, and so they just don’t understand where this is coming from, and probably there’s a little bit of hurt, right?\" she responded. Hillman said Canada and the U.S. had people who travel back and forth between the two countries and touted a partnership between them. \"We have 400,000 to 500,000 people that move back and forth between our two countries every day. Businesses, tourists, students, workers, and there’s a sense of partnership, of family, of being each other’s best, as I say, best customer, best friend. So I think that this is something that we really don’t, the Canadians don’t understand,\" Hillman added.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the tariffs were due to illegal fentanyl. \"The president will be implementing tomorrow a 25% tariff on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada, and a 10% tariff on China for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt told reporters on Friday. \"These are promises made and promises kept.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump's executive order for the tariffs said, \"Gang members, smugglers, human traffickers, and illicit drugs of all kinds have poured across our borders and into our communities.\" \"Canada has played a central role in these challenges, including by failing to devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate with United States law enforcement partners to effectively stem the tide of illicit drugs,\" the order continued.","summary":"Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman told ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; that citizens were perplexed and disappointed by President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs imposed on the country.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/canadian-ambassador-u-s-says-canadians-perplexed-disappointed-trump-tariffs","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/kirsten-hillman-this-week.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:00:55","author":"Hanna Panreck","authors":["Hanna Panreck"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.235},{"id":286414394,"title":"Why Trump is digging in his heels on huge tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China","text":"President Donald Trump is digging in his heels on tariffs — imposing sweeping duties on goods from Mexico, Canada and China on Saturday.\n\nThe tariffs will likely raise the price of everything from Super Bowl avocados to gasoline and cars, from maple syrup to iPhones, experts warned.\n\nThe backlash was instantaneous Mexico and Canada — who import more American goods than any other country — quickly responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own.\n\nCanadians, in particularly, seemed to be taking the news personally — giving a Bronx cheer to the “Star Spangled Banner” ahead of NHL games across the country Saturday night, and again at a Toronto Raptors home game on Sunday.\n\nTrump isn’t backing down. \n\n“This will be the golden age of America! Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!). But we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid,” Trump, 78, wrote on Truth Social Sunday in all caps.\n\nCiting a national emergency over their failure to curb the flow of deadly drugs and illegal immigrants into the US, Trump declared a 25% tariff would be imposed on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tariff on imports from China.\n\n“We have big deficits, as you know, with all three of them. And in one case they’re sending massive amounts of fentanyl, killing hundreds of thousands of people a year, with the fentanyl. And in the other two cases, they’re making it possible for this poison to get in,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\n“The extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl, constitutes a national emergency,” a White House statement said of Trump invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which empowered him to enact the tariffs.\n\nThe statement said Trump’s “bold action” in imposing the trade levies — dismissed by many during the presidential race as campaign bluster — was intended to hold the nations accountable.\n\nBut, he also suggested they were an attempt to level the playing field against three nations with which the US had a combined $450 billion trade deficit in 2023.\n\nTrump’s rationales for the tariffs\n\nMuch of the official White House statement justifying the tariffs positions illegal immigration and the opioid crisis as the prime drivers of the move.\n\n“Last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehended more than 21,000 pounds of fentanyl at our borders, enough fentanyl to kill more than 4 billion people,” the administration wrote, noting that federal officials are only able to seize “a fraction” of the deadly drug smuggled across the border.\n\nTrump blamed Mexico and Canada for being lax in their enforcement in letting fentanyl into the US, but also pointed a finger at China for failing to cut off the spigot of precursor chemicals used to manufacture the deadly drugs — and keep them from getting into the hands of cartels.\n\nThe tariffs are also meant to boost US coffers by addressing inherent imbalances in trade between the nations, which Trump says consistently give the US the short end of the stick.\n\n“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the ‘Stupid Country’ any longer,” Trump proclaimed.\n\nThe White House made clear that the Trump administration believes America’s biggest trading partners have a lot more to lose in a trade war than the US does. \n\n“Access to the American market is a privilege,” the White House said.\n\n“While trade accounts for 67% of Canada’s GDP, 73% of Mexico’s GDP, and 37% of China’s GDP, it accounts for only 24% of U.S. GDP. However, in 2023 the U.S. trade deficit in goods was the world’s largest at over $1 trillion.”\n\nIt’ll hurt you more than it’ll hurt us\n\nAdditionally — the trading relationship matters a lot more to Mexico, Canada and China’s economies than it does to the US. \n\nThe goods Mexico sells to the US make up 24% of the Mexican economy. For Canada, exports to the US are worth 18% of the economy. US exports to the Mexico and Canada are worth just 1% each to the American economy.\n\nRoughly 75% of Canada’s exports go to the US while only about 13% of American exports go to Canada. Meanwhile, about 80% of Mexican exports flow to the US, while 16% of US exports go to them. \n\nTrump has said Sunday that the US is “subsidizing” Canada by importing its goods rather than producing them domestically. He claimed that America’s northern neighbor would “[cease] to exist as a viable country” if the subsidy dried up.\n\nHe also repeated his idea — in more concrete terms — that all these problems would go away if Canada was simply made the 51st state.\n\n“Make your product in the USA and there are no tariffs!” he added in all caps. “Why should the United States lose trillions of dollars in subsidizing other countries, and why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for drugs and pharmaceuticals, as an example?” the president said on Truth Social.\n\nThe tranche of new levies also includes an additional 10% tax on Canadian energy exports.\n\n“We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use,” he said.\n\nThe tariffs will also do away with the so-called “de minimis” exemption for packages worth less than $800, which has allowed Chinese retailers like Alibaba, Temu and Shein to save hundreds of millions per year by shipping cheap clothes and gadgets directly to US consumers.\n\nCanada and Mexico fight back\n\nTrump saw big success in rattling the tariffs saber at Colombian president Gustavo Petro last week over his refusal to allow planes loaded with deported migrants to enter the country. After slapping the South American country with a 25% tariff, Petro quickly buckled, and even offered up the presidential plane to shuttle migrants back home.\n\nHowever, Canada, Mexico and China are so far not giving up without a fight.\n\nCanada and Mexico almost immediately hit US goods with a 25% counter-tarrifs. China, meanwhile, has announced plans to take the matter to the World Trade Organization over the new 10% Trump tariff.\n\nTrade between the US and those three countries is about $1.4 trillion annually, making up over 40% of US total imports. \n\nBloomberg Economics reported choppy economic seas could be ahead, estimating the budding trade war could raise the current average US tariff rate from just under 3% to a whopping 10.7%. They also warned US GDP could sink 1.2% while threatening to lift inflation by 0.7%.\n\nTrump’s tariffs will likely see US consumers see higher prices on goods like fruit, meat, gasoline, cars and electronics as retailers look to pass the increased costs along to customers.\n\nThe Tax Foundation has estimated that Trump’s tariffs will reduce GDP by about 0.4 percentage point and raise unemployment by about 344,000 jobs.\n\nIn the short term, the Tax Foundation is expecting the average US household would be paying $830 more in taxes to the federal government via tariffs on goods they buy.","summary":"Trump also suggested the tariffs were an attempt to level the playing field against three nations with which the US had a combined $450 billion trade deficit in 2023.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/02/us-news/why-trump-is-digging-in-his-heels-on-huge-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-and-china/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-i4ix8ru1x-1738538480704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1738520520&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/egY6NGMN-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:00:26","author":"Chris Nesi,Ryan King","authors":["Chris Nesi","Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":286420374,"title":"Sen. McConnell on plans amid President Trump's onslaught of executive orders","text":"Sen. Mitch McConnell, after stepping down from his Senate leadership position, bucked President Trump and was one of only three Republicans to vote against the president's nominee for defense secretary. With confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees ongoing, people are wondering just what McConnell will do next. The 82-year-old said he feels free to be more outspoken about what he cares about than he has in the past, but it seems unlikely that he'll be leading an opposition to the head of his party.\"I expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\" the long-serving Republican senator said. \"So, what happened in the past is irrelevant to me.\"McConnell's relationship with Trump\"What happened in the past\" between McConnell and Mr. Trump includes insults and heated arguments. To his biographer Michael Tackett, who interviewed the senator over the last three years, and in his oral histories, McConnell vented about the president, saying Mr. Trump is \"nasty,\" \"not very smart\" and a \"sleazeball.\"Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has called McConnell \"sullen\" and an \"unsmiling political hack.\"\"We do have to do something about Mitch McConnell. He's, he's a disaster. He's a disaster,\" Mr. Trump said during a March 2023 campaign rally in Davenport, Iowa. The president has also used a racial slur against McConnell's second wife, former U.S. Secretary of Labor and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, something McConnell said he never confronted Mr. Trump over.McConnell says he and Mr. Trump haven't spoken in a while. McConnell was very upset about what happened during the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, during which he was evacuated from the Senate while rioters banged on his office door with his staff inside, barricading the door with furniture. McConnell said the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was evidence of Mr. Trump's \"complete unfitness for office.\"\"President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,\" McConnell later said from the Senate floor.It's still the way he feels about it four years later and McConnell still considers Jan. 6 an insurrection. He said he believes pardoning the people who were convicted in connection to the events that day was a mistake.While McConnell's been critical of the president, he has almost always wound up retracting his claws. McConnell voted against convicting Mr. Trump at the Senate trial that took place after the president had just left office. A conviction could have disqualified Mr. Trump from running for re-election.McConnell thought that the criminal and civil justice system would be there to hold Trump accountable, biographer Tackett said.\"The court he created ended up being the court that helped to enable Donald Trump to not eventually face prosecution,\" Tackett said. \"It was the biggest miscalculation of his political career, and no doubt will be a stain on his legacy.\"McConnell and the Supreme CourtTackett said the most contentious thing McConnell did as Senate leader was to singlehandedly block then-President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"One of my proudest moments was when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy,'\" McConnell said at a political event in 2016. This was the first step in McConnell's engineering of a conservative super majority on the Supreme Court.\"I feel fine about it. I knew that if the shoe was on the other foot…,\" he said.His biographer has called it a \"brutish exercise of power.\" McConnell doesn't agree. The senator said he was focused on making sure people on the center-right have a voice.\"That was what I thought was the most important thing I could do,\" he said.A recent poll found that 70% of the American people think the Supreme Court justices are more influenced by ideology than by being fair arbiters. McConnell pointed the blame at Democrats, saying the Supreme Court's popularity is down because Democrats criticize them.\"Their job is not to seek public approval. It's to follow the law,\" he said of the Supreme Court.McConnell's actions shaping the Supreme Court are tied to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and affirmative action in college admissions, Tackett said.\"By changing the Court, changing the composition of the Court, he changed American life,\" Tackett said. McConnell's legacy and future in the SenateThough he's now on the backbench after an 18-year tenure as the Senate Republican leader, McConnell could continue to play a role in shaping American life outside of the courts. He said that he feels free to be more outspoken about what he cares about than he has in the past, which may come up during a vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who Mr. Trump picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.Kennedy has suggested that the polio vaccine killed more people than polio, but McConnell, who was diagnosed with polio as a child, believes that vaccines are critical.\"It's no surprise that it's a big deal with me,\" he said.McConnell said he also plans to speak out about the encroachment on the independence of the Senate.Mr. Trump has issued an onslaught of executive orders since his second term began. The president is also imposing tariffs, which McConnell does not back.\"It will drive the cost of everything up. In other words, it will be paid for by American consumers,\" McConnell said. \"I mean, why would you want to get in a fight with your allies over this?\"He may have his disagreements with the president, but McConnell acknowledged that the people chose Mr. Trump.\"I'm a Republican. I don't get to decide who gets to be president. The American people do,\" McConnell said. \"And you have to admit, they did. And he's back.\"","summary":"Sen.

Mitch McConnell: Yeah, well I—I--Lesley Stahl: So free for what? Free to do what?Sen. Mitch McConnell: Well, I-- I will be more outspoken about things that I particularly care about than I have been in the past.Particularly the resurgence of isolationism in today's Republican party. Sen. Mitch McConnell: America First-- that was what they used in the '30s. And I'm hopeful the new administration will understand and act, not with just language that says America First, but funding that underscores the nature of the threat. Look, what is the situation? North Korea, China, Russia, Iran. This is a huge threat, a fight between the autocrats and the democracies. And when it comes to the democratic world, only one country can lead, that's us.

Mitch McConnell: Well, that was-- those were private comments, and--Lesley Stahl: Well, but they're in your biography.Sen. Mitch McConnell: Yeah.He vented about Donald Trump to his biographer, Michael Tackett, who interviewed him over the last three years.Lesley Stahl: What's the most courageous thing he did as leader?Michael Tackett: The most courageous thing he did as leader was stand up for aid for Ukraine. It wasn't popular within his party; it wasn't popular with Donald Trump; it wasn't popular with JD Vance. But he did it anyway. Lesley Stahl: What's the most despicable thing he did?Michael Tackett: The most contentious thing he did was to block Merrick Garland, not simply from getting a vote in the Senate but from even having a hearing in the Senate.McConnell single-handedly blocked President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Sen.

I was gonna try to help right of center America have a voice and that was what I thought was the most important thing I could do.Lesley Stahl: Do you take any responsibility that the court has lost so much credibility? There's been a recent poll that says 70% of the American people think the justices are more influenced by ideology than by being fair and impartial.Sen. Mitch McConnell: Yeah, the reason their popularity is down is cause the Democrats are criticizing them all the time. Lesley Stahl: OK, but I'm not talking about popularity. I'm talking about credibility of a major institution.Sen. Mitch McConnell: But Lesley, their job is not to seek public approval. It's to follow the law.Lesley Stahl: So this is your beloved Senate. How do you feel about the Senate? Sen. Mitch McConnell: Glad to be in the majority.At 82, he has slowed down, looks frail. There've been questions about his health ever since he froze at the microphones in the Capitol over a year ago.He told us the freeze was caused by a concussion that he suffered from a fall. Seven months later-- Sen. Mitch McConnell: This will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.When he was leader, his trademark was inscrutability. Reporter: Any comments, Leader McConnell? How do you feel today went?Sen. Mitch McConnell: I'm— I'm not going to answer questions about when. He earned the nickname Darth Vader.Sen. Mitch McConnell: I'm suggesting that I'm not going to answer your question.Sen. Mitch McConnell: I want to control the message if I can. Lesley Stahl: Are you doing that right now?Sen. Mitch McConnell: Yeah.McConnell's has been a long and improbable journey. Born in 1942 in rural Alabama, he was stricken with polio at age two. His mother drove him to Warm Springs, Georgia, to the polio facility established by Franklin Roosevelt. The treatment: he wasn't allowed to walk for two years.Sen. Mitch McConnell: I was lucky to have a mother who was absolutely determined to do everything she could to get me back to normal.They moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and when Mitch was in high school, he found his niche in student government.Lesley Stahl: So he'd been developing his political skills and acumen from the youngest age.Michael Tackett: He was almost born 40 years old in a suit. I mean, he wanted to be in politics.McConnell mastered the inside game over his 40 years in the Senate, so much so that Tackett says he's the most impactful Senate leader since Lyndon Johnson.Michael Tackett: You can draw a straight line from what he did to shape the courts, to the overturning of Roe v. Wade, to the overturning of affirmative action. By changing the Court, changing the composition of the Court, he changed American life.But his job became more difficult as his party became more MAGA, and even worse after President Trump used a racial slur against his second wife, Elaine Chao.Lesley Stahl: Did you ever confront him about what he said about your wife Elaine?Sen. Mitch McConnell: No, I chose not to engage with him. Lesley Stahl: And today? You feel OK about that?Sen. Mitch McConnell: No, I don't feel OK about it.Lesley Stahl: How would you describe your relationship with President Trump?Sen. Mitch McConnell: Well, we haven't spoken for quite a while. I was very upset about what happened January 6. Lesley Stahl: You had to be evacuated from the Senate along with other leaders. Your staff was in your office. The rioters were banging on your door. Someone with a flagpole broke a window into your office.Sen. Mitch McConnell: Yeah. Well, my staff in the Capitol was putting furniture up against the doors.Lesley Stahl: To prevent them from coming--Sen. Mitch McConnell: To prevent the rioters from outside from breaking the doors and getting at them. And what was it about? To try to prevent the orderly transfer of government, which had never happened in our country. Lesley Stahl: Your staff, after the crisis was over, you went and spoke with them. You-- it was a highly emotional situation. You remember?Sen. Mitch McConnell: Oh, I remember well.Lesley Stahl: Do you remember what you told them?Sen. Mitch McConnell: That-- Yeah, I remember what I told them. That emotion turned to fury.Sen. Mitch McConnell: President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.Sen. Mitch McConnell: That's the way I still feel about it. Lesley Stahl: What are your views on President Trump and his supporters trying to change what happened on January 6? They're calling it a \"day of love.\" They called the rioters \"martyrs.\"Sen. Mitch McConnell: Yeah. No, it-- it was an insurrection.Lesley Stahl: What about the pardons for the people who stormed the Capitol that day? Sen. Mitch McConnell: I-- I think pardoning the people who've been convicted is a mistake.But while he has been critical of the president, he has almost always wound up retracting his claws. Take the impeachment battle – McConnell ended up voting against convicting Mr. Trump at the Senate trial that took place after he had just left office. A conviction could've disqualified the ex-president from running for re-election. Michael Tackett: McConnell thought that the criminal and civil justice system would be there to hold Trump to account for his actions. And as we know, it didn't happen.Lesley Stahl: And partly cause of him.Michael Tackett: The Court he created ended up being the Court that helped to enable Donald Trump to not eventually face prosecution. It was the biggest miscalculation of his political career, and no doubt will be a stain on his legacy.So now Donald Trump is president again, issuing an onslaught of executive orders and controversial nominees for his cabinet.McConnell was one of only three Republicans who voted against Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. And while he won't tip his hand on how he'll vote on the others -- Sen. Mitch McConnell: I don't have any news to make on that front.He did signal some reluctance about the nominee who would oversee the nation's health care system. Lesley Stahl: You're a polio survivor. There is one of the cabinet nominees, RFK Jr., who says that the polio vaccine killed more people than polio. What are your views about that?Sen. Mitch McConnell: Well, the Polio vaccine has been a huge success.Lesley Stahl: But what about all of them? Measles, mumps– I mean, chicken pox.Sen. Mitch McConnell: Oh! Vaccines are critically important to health, to having normal lives.Lesley Stahl: How important is that issue to you? You know, we're talking about things you would fight for. You're free at last. You're free to speak your mind. Sen. Mitch McConnell: Well, it's no surprise that it-- it's a big deal with me. So what will Mitch do now? Will he lead an opposition to the head of his party? Not likely.Sen. Mitch McConnell: I expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish. So, what happened in the past is irrelevant to me.Lesley Stahl: You said that January 6 was \"evidence of Donald Trump's complete unfitness for office.\"Sen. Mitch McConnell: I said, shortly after January 6, that if he were the nominee for president, I would support him.Lesley Stahl: Even if he's unfit for office?Sen. Mitch McConnell: (Overtalk) I'm—I'm-- I'm a Republican. I don't get to decide who gets to be president. The American people do. And you have to admit, they did. And he's back.Produced by Richard Bonin. Associate producer, Mirella Brussani. Broadcast associate, Aria Een. Edited by Matthew Lev.","summary":"Sen.

But concerns linger over whether Washington would truly act if Beijing escalates its claims to the Diaoyu Islands.\nTokyo’s Defence Minister Gen Nakatani confirmed in a call last week with newly appointed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth that the disputed islands – known in Japan as the Senkakus – are covered by Article 5 of the Japan-US Security Treaty, which obliges the US to defend Japan against armed attacks on territories it administers.\nJapanese governments routinely request such confirmations from incoming US administrations, but analysts say the urgency is greater this time. Trump’s transactional approach to foreign policy has raised doubts in Tokyo about his commitment to protecting the uninhabited islands, especially if he sees no direct benefit to the US.\n“If you are the minister of defence in Japan and you look at the incoming Trump administration, you will have very good reason to doubt the reliability of the alliance and the strength of the Japan-US security alliance,” said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo.\nHe told This Week in Asia that Japanese politicians and security experts were often troubled by the “bit of wiggle room in the wording of the treaty on whether the US is required to militarily respond to a contingency surrounding the Senkakus”.\n\nBeijing has steadily increased pressure on Japan over the islands in recent years. In 2024, Chinese ships patrolled just outside Japan’s territorial waters for a record 353 days, entering those waters 39 times, in what analysts see as a strategy to weaken Tokyo’s control over the area.\nAfter gaining Hegseth’s verbal backing, Nakatani announced that both sides had also agreed to strengthen the broader security alliance. During a press conference in Tokyo, he described the US commitment to defending Japan as “unwavering” and said the two men planned to meet in person soon, though no date has been set.\nTokyo’s unease is compounded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s lack of personal rapport with Trump, which contrasts with former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s close relationship with him during Trump’s first term.\nToshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of politics at Waseda University, described Japan’s approach as building “diplomatic defences”.\n“Japan is afraid,” he said. “Abe had a very good relationship with Trump during his first administration, and that helped to shield Japan from a lot of the pressures that were put on other countries.”\nIn Tokyo, Trump is seen as an unstable leader, and it is clear that he thinks transactionally\nToshimitsu Shigemura, international relations expert\nHe added that Trump’s transactional mindset was a source of anxiety for Japan. “In Tokyo, Trump is seen as an unstable leader, and it is clear that he thinks transactionally and only about what is going to directly benefit the US,” Shigemura said.\n“The worry here is that Trump could make a promise over something like the Senkakus, but then very easily break that promise.”\nStill, there may be a silver lining: Beijing is equally uncertain about how to navigate its relationship with Trump. Analysts suggest that China, facing its own challenges with Washington, has been working to ease tensions with Japan.\nNo further details emerged about the conversation between Hegseth and Nakatani on Friday, but Japan’s regional security concerns go beyond disputed islands, encompassing North Korea, Russia and enduring anxieties that Beijing will use force to seize Taiwan, which it considers an integral part of China.\nKingston said Ishiba’s government was bracing itself for Trump to demand a sharp increase Tokyo’s contributions for the 54,000 US troops stationed in Japan.\n\nIn his 2020 tell-all memoir The Room Where It Happened, former US national security adviser John Bolton revealed that Trump had previously called for Japan to quadruple its annual payment to US$8 billion.\nUnder a 2022 agreement signed during Joe Biden’s presidency, the figure rose to US$8.6 billion, but that deal expires in 2027.\nKingston warned that Japan has little bargaining power. “Japan has little choice but to comply because this is a pretty dangerous neighbourhood and Japan does need the US security umbrella,” he said, adding that Trump is also expected to pressure Japan and other allies to increase defence spending to 5 per cent of gross domestic product.\nJapan presently spends less than 2 per cent of its GDP on defence. The US, meanwhile, spends about 3.4 per cent of its GDP on its military.","summary":"Washington has confirmed its security treaty with Japan covers the disputed islets, but concerns remain about Trump’s commitment to the deal.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297001/japan-weighs-trust-trump-us-says-defence-diaoyu-islands-rock-solid","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/01/c018a0ec-8db0-4c95-badf-8ad1c51768c7_398f49ae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-03 00:00:11","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.121},{"id":286413928,"title":"Trump backer Pratt gave Albanese $1 million before PM attended Katy Perry party","text":"Familiar faces dominate the top echelon of political donors, with climate activists continuing to bankroll the teals and packaging king Anthony Pratt tipping $1 million into Anthony Albanese’s campaign fund around the time the prime minister attended a Katy Perry concert at Pratt’s house.\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission on Monday morning released data showing money raised and spent by Australian political parties and campaign organisations for the 2023-24 financial year.Investors Rob Keldoulis and Marcus Catsaras were the strongest backers of the teal movement last year, donating more than $1 million each to Climate 200, making them the joint-largest donors in the country.\n\nPratt, the Visy chief who has got behind US President Donald Trump’s campaign last year, gave $1 million to the Labor Party in January 2024.\n\nThe next month, he held a private event at his Raheen mansion at which Perry performed to a crowd of influential business and political leaders, including the prime minister.

(AP) — Families of victims of the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001 visited the crash site on Sunday and divers scoured the submerged wreckage for more remains after authorities said they’ve recovered and identified 55 of the 67 people killed.\n\nWashington, D.C. Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said officials are confident all will be found. Divers are working diligently to locate remains as crews prepare to lift wreckage from the chilly Potomac River as early as Monday morning, Donnelly said at a news conference.\n\nCol. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers said divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found. The “dignified recovery” of remains takes precedence over all else, he said.\n\n“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,” Pera said. “We’ve got teams that have been working this effort since the beginning, and we’re committed to making this happen.”\n\nDivers have high-definition cameras with feeds monitored on support boats, Pera said, putting “four or five sets of eyes” inside of the wreckage. Owing to the frigid conditions, one diver was treated at a hospital for hypothermia, Donnelly said.\n\nPortions of the two aircraft that collided over the river Wednesday night near Reagan Washington National Airport — an American Airlines jet with 64 people aboard and an Army Black Hawk helicopter with 3 aboard — will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for investigation.\n\nFamily members were taken in buses with a police escort to the Potomac River bank near where the two aircraft came to rest after colliding. The jet, en route from Wichita, Kansas, was about to land. The Black Hawk was on a training mission. There were no survivors.\n\nFederal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the collision.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board didn’t hold a press briefing on Sunday, but did release a photograph showing investigators on a small boat looking at wreckage and another of them examining a flight data recorder.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he wanted to give investigators space to conduct their inquiry. But he posed a range of questions on Sunday morning TV news programs.\n\n“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.\n\nArmy Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were in the helicopter.\n\nThe plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.\n\nThe NTSB said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the helicopter.\n\nInvestigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.\n\nData from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.\n\nThe discrepancy has yet to be explained.\n\nInvestigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box and planned to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.\n\n“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here.”\n\nBanning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.\n\n“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.”\n\nFull investigations typically take a year or more. Investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\n\nNTSB member Todd Inman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families.\n\n“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.”\n\nMore than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.\n\nInvestigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.\n\nAccording to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., as traffic slows.

Eighty-eight percent supported \"deporting immigrants who are here illegally and have criminal records.\" Large majorities of Democrats and Republicans agreed that the immigration system is broken.However, the policy has since sparked concerns about its impact on immigrant communities, families and the economy.What To KnowAs the Trump administration moves forward with its hard-line immigration agenda, immigration advocates across the country are mobilizing to protest and protect immigrant communities from potential raids and deportations.While immigrant rights advocates have been hosting workshops and sharing legal advice on social media with communities about knowing their rights, locals have begun organizing protests across the U.S. over the weekend.The most intense protests have occurred in California and Texas along the border and near halls of government, with demonstrations of civil disobedience.CaliforniaOn Sunday a large crowd gathered in downtown Los Angeles, California in response to the recent increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and deportations.According to the Los Angeles Times, demonstrators gathered near City Hall shortly before noon, blocking traffic at Spring and Temple streets as protesters blasted a mix of traditional and contemporary Mexican music from a loudspeaker.Sunday's protest follows several others as another protest took place on Wednesday that saw demonstrators with signs against Trump's immigration policies.TexasCalifornia is not the first state to see protests in response to Trump's immigration efforts: Texas has also seen several protests since Trump enacted his hardline approach to immigration.Hundreds gathered at Dallas City Hall Sunday afternoon in two protests to rally against arrests and raids by ICE. According to the Dallas Morning News, the protest is part of a nationwide movement advocating for \"Legalization for All and an end to unjust immigration policies.\"It comes after one of the biggest demonstrations so far that saw hundreds of people gathering at the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge in West Dallas on Jan. 26.Meanwhile, another protest took place in Conroe, Texas on Saturday, with people holding signs supporting immigrants' rights and protesting the Trump administration's new immigration policies, according to the San Antonio Express-News.However, in a Saturday night statement on social media, Conroe Mayor Duke W. Coon said several protesters \"became aggressive, disorderly and unlawful and assaulted a Conroe police officer.\"Mike Holley, Montgomery County's first assistant district attorney, confirmed to the Houston Chronicle Sunday morning that four individuals were arrested in connection with Saturday's protests.According to the Chronicle, the jail records for those Holley said were arrested stated that Ruby Meza, 19, of Conroe was accused of assault of a public servant; Anthony Richardson, 25, of Cleveland was accused of interfering with public duties; Duanterrius Hatchett, 24, of Conroe was accused of assault causing bodily injury; and Michael Green, 41 of Conroe is accused of assault causes bodily injury and terroristic threat. However, it remains unclear what led to each arrest.Other StatesProtests have also been seen in Arkansas, Missouri and Georgia. According to the local ABC News affiliate, demonstrators took to the streets in Northwest Arkansas over the weekend for the second week in a row to protest against Trump's immigration policies as protesters said they strongly oppose arrests in sensitive areas.Around 1,000 people took to downtown St. Louis streets on Saturday to protest against Trump's immigration policies, according to National Public Radio (NPR), with one protester chanting \"Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here.\" Another protester later yelled: \"No ICE. No KKK. No racist USA.\"In Georgia, hundreds of protesters gathered along Buford Highway in DeKalb County on Saturday as protesters marched in the street, shutting down a portion of the highway.What People Are SayingLaura Urias, Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef) program director, said in a statement: \"Detention separates families and exposes people to abuse and sometimes even death. California welcomes immigrants who come to our state seeking safety or to reunify with family, and those new residents strengthen our economy and our communities.\"The Trump administration's barrage of executive orders is meant to instill fear and sow chaos. When leadership fails us, we must build community power.California Senator Alex Padilla, a member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Safety said: \"All Americans will feel the impacts of Trump's anti-immigrant agenda, creating chaos and fear in communities across our country, while also driving up costs for businesses and consumers. We can all agree that we need a secure and orderly border; however, these executive actions only further complicate that effort—and many of them violate the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. So make no mistake: it won't be long before a policy of chaos costs the American people,\" Padilla said in a news release on Tuesday.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told her followers on social media, \"The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway. Promises made. Promises kept.\"Kimberly Perez, a protester from Springdale, told local ABC News affiliate: \"My parents fought for my future. They came to this country and left everything behind — their families, everything. They crossed borders and gave us the best life they could. Now, it's our turn to fight for them.\"Royer Rodriguez of Conroe told the Houston Chronicle, \"We were doing a peaceful protest for everybody that couldn't be there. We were there for them, trying to support what (Latinos) are for this country. I can't really say exactly what happened, but from what I've noticed there's always that one person that can do something that ruins it for everybody.\"What Happens NextICE raids and deportations are expected to continue under Trump's administration as immigrant communities, local governments and advocacy groups brace for the impact of the president's crackdown. Protests across the country are also expected to continue.","summary":"As the Trump administration moves forward with its immigration agenda, immigration advocates across the country are mobilizing to protest.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/protests-trumps-immigration-policies-erupt-country-2024913","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2579244/los-angeles-protest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 23:37:10","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.225},{"id":286413050,"title":"Fans at Raptors game continue trend of booing US national anthem at pro sporting events in Canada","text":"TORONTO -- Fans at a Toronto Raptors game continued an emerging trend Sunday of booing the American national anthem at pro sporting events in Canada.\n\nFans of the NBA's lone Canadian franchise booed the anthem after similar reactions broke out Saturday night at NHL games in Ottawa, Ontario, and Calgary, Alberta, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump made his threat of import tariffs on America's northern neighbor a reality.\n\nAfter initially cheering for the 15-year-old female singer, fans booed throughout \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" performance.

(AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that Americans could feel “some pain” from the emerging trade war triggered by his tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, and claimed that Canada would “cease to exist” without its trade surplus with the United States.\n\nThe trade penalties that Trump signed Saturday at his Florida resort caused a mix of panic, anger and uncertainty, and threatened to rupture a decades-old partnership on trade in North America while further straining relations with China.\n\n“Canadians are perplexed,” said the country’s U.S. ambassador, Kirsten Hillman. “We view ourselves as your neighbor, your closest friend, your ally.”\n\nBy following through on a campaign pledge, Trump may also have simultaneously broken his promise to voters in last year’s election that his administration could quickly reduce inflation. That means the same frustration he is facing from other nations might also spread domestically to consumers and businesses.\n\n“WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),” Trump said in a social media post. “BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”\n\nHis administration has not said how high that price could be or what improvements would need to be seen in stopping illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl to merit the removal of the tariffs that Trump imposed under the legal justification of an economic emergency. The tariffs are set to launch Tuesday.\n\n“If prices go up, it’s because of other people’s reactions to America’s laws,” his homeland secretary, Kristi Noem, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, which responded with retaliatory measures. Trump is placing a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, with a 10% tax on oil, natural gas and electricity. Canada is imposing 25% tariffs on more than $155 billion Canadian (US$105 billion) on U.S. products, including alcohol and fruit.\n\nTrump railed against Canada’s trade surplus with the United States: “We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use.”\n\nDespite Trump’s assertion that the U.S does not need Canada, one-quarter of the oil that the America consumes per day is from its ally to the north. He reiterated his false claim that America subsidizes Canada.\n\nTrump contended that without that surplus, “Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada — AND NO TARIFFS!”\n\nHillman, the ambassador, has said the U.S. had about a $75 billion Canadian ($51 billion) trade deficit with Canada last year, but noted that one-third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports and that there is a deficit when oil prices are high. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is encouraging Canadians to buy more Canadian goods, and says Trump’s moves will only cause pain across North America. More than 75% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Canada will first target alcohol, cosmetics and paper products; a second round later will include passenger vehicles, trucks, steel and aluminum products, certain fruits and vegetables, beef, pork, dairy products and more.\n\nCanada is the largest export market for 36 states and Mexico is the largest trading partner of the U.S.\n\nCanadians “just don’t understand where this is coming from … and probably there’s a little bit of hurt, right?” Hillman told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.\n\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, also announced new tariffs and suggested the U.S. should do more within its own borders to address drug addiction. She and Trudeau spoke after Trump’s announcement and agreed “to enhance the strong bilateral relations” between Canada and Mexico, according to the prime minister’s office.\n\nThe Chinese government said it would take steps to defend its economic interests and intends to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization.\n\nFor Trump, the open question is whether inflation could be a political pressure point that would cause him to back down. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly hammered Democrats over the inflation under President Joe Biden that resulted from supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic, the Biden administration’s own spending to spur the recovery and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrump said his previous four years as president had low inflation, so the public should expect the same if he came back to the White House. But he also said specifically that higher inflation would stagger the U.S. as a nation, a position from which he now appears to be retreating with the tariffs.\n\n“Inflation is a disaster,” he said at a Philadelphia campaign rally. “It’s a country-buster. It’s a total country-buster.”\n\nLarry Summers, treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, said the tariffs were “a self-inflicted wound to the American economy.”\n\n“Inflation might go up over the next nine months by as much … as 1%, just at a moment when we were trying to bring it down,” he told CNN’s “Inside Politics.”\n\nHe added that “on the playground or in international relations, bullying is not an enduringly winning strategy. And that’s what this is.” And the ultimate winner, Summers suggested, would be Chinese leader Xi Jinping because “we’ve moved to drive some of our closest allies into his arms” and “we’re legitimating everything he’s doing by violating all the international norms that we set up.”\n\nOutside analyses make clear that Trump’s tariffs would hurt the voters that he intended to help, meaning that he might ultimately need to find a resolution.\n\nAn analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows, if the tariffs were to continue, an average U.S. household would lose roughly $1,245 in income this year, in what would be the overall equivalent of a more than $1.4 trillion tax increase over the next 10 years.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in a Sunday analyst note, stressed that the tariffs go into effect on Tuesday, which means they’re likely to proceed “though a last-minute compromise cannot be completely ruled out.”\n\nThe investment bank concluded that because of the possible economic damage and possible conditions for removal that “we think it is more likely that the tariffs will be temporary but the outlook is unclear.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Rob Gillies in Toronto contributed to this report.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Cherry tomatoes from Canada. Cheap clothes from China’s Shein and Temu. Gasoline at the pump. And even America’s favorite beer.\n\nEconomists and market analysts are warning that Americans should brace for higher prices on a raft of everyday goods after President Trump announced 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada and 10% on imports from China.\n\nAnd these are just the things that are likely to go up quickly. \n\nManufacturers have been stocking up on parts and supplies for months in an effort to blunt the impact of Trump’s tariffs, but it’s harder to stockpile food and the latest electronics — meaning consumers are likely to see the results soon.\n\nTrump acknowledged that consumers could feel the pain of the tariffs — “maybe” — but said, “it will all be worth it” to stop the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US and boost American domestic production. \n\nExperts have also said that the tariffs are going to hit Canada and Mexico in particular much harder. For instance, Canada’s exports to the US make up 18% of Canada’s economy, but American exports north are just 1% of US GDP.\n\nHere are a few categories of products that could see price increases for American consumers.\n\nFood, and not just avocados \n\nShoppers should brace themselves for higher prices at the grocery aisles given that Mexico and Canada are both the largest suppliers of fruits, vegetables, grain, livestock, meats, and poultry to the US.\n\nThe US imports more than 80% of its avocados from Mexico at $3.1 billion, according to the US Agriculture Department, with the price of guacamole expected to shoot up by Super Bowl Sunday. \n\nCanada also happens to be the biggest supplier of cherry tomatoes and maple syrup in the US, with the cost of both expected to rise.\n\nThe hit at the supermarkets is expected to hit Americans’ wallets soon — since these things are imported on an ongoing basis.\n\n“You don’t stockpile avocados,” William Reinsch, a former US trade official, told the Associated Press. “You don’t stockpile cut flowers. You don’t stockpile bananas.’’\n\nBeer and liquor \n\nWhile liquor may often be touted as recession-proof, Chris Carey, a Wells Fargo equity analyst, previously estimated that the cost of popular beers from Mexico could spike by nearly 4.5% as a result of the tariffs.\n\nThat would be a huge blow to Americans who love Modelo, which became the best-selling beer in 2023, overtaking Bud Light following the Dylan Mulvaney controversy — with more than $5 billion worth of sales recorded in the US during the 2023-2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe latest on President Trump’s tariffs\n\nTrump says Canada, Mexico and China tariffs ‘will all be worth it’ — but may cause some ‘pain’\n\nTrump officially ushers in long-awaited tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China — here’s how it could affect ordinary Americans\n\nCEO of Canada’s 2nd biggest company defends Trump’s tariff demands, slams Trudeau for not stopping trade war\n\nCanada, Mexico strike back with retaliatory tariffs on American goods hours after Trump’s executive action\n\nHochul says Trump’s tariffs on Canada will hurt New York businesses: ‘Why are we doing this?’\n\nThe US also imports about $537 million worth of Canadian spirits a year, including $202.5 million worth of whisky.\n\nOn the flip side, Mexico and Canada are also two of the biggest importers of American booze — and their retaliatory tariffs are likely to hit sales of bourbon and wine. \n\nGas at the pump \n\nThe energy industry is set to take a hit following the White House’s call for a 10% tariff on Canadian crude oil, as America’s northern neighbor serves as the top exporter to the US with more than $97 billion worth of oil and gas imported last year.\n\nJohn LaForge, of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, warned that “someone is going to get kind of hurt” over the oil tariff. \n\nA total of 53% of America’s petroleum diet comes from Canada — despite the fact that the US is a net exporter of oil.\n\n“Any way you cut it, you’re looking at higher prices,” LaForge told Reuters.\n\nPavel Molchanov, an analyst at the Raymond James finance giant, warned that Americans would start to see an average increase of 10 cents a gallon at the pump, would the cost expected to go up from there and differ across states, Market Watch reports.\n\nTrouble at the dealership\n\nVehicles are also expected to see a surge in prices as America imported $87 billion worth of cars and another $64 billion in parts from Mexico last year, according to the US Commerce Department.\n\nCars were also the second-largest category of goods the US imported from Canada last year, with the US previously keeping the cost of business down by investing in production plants north and south of the border.\n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNN the new tariffs could effectively undo all the savings automakers enjoyed, leaving the sector fuming as there’s little recourse other than to raise prices at the consumer’s expense. \n\nElectronics and home appliances \n\nWhen it comes to the tariffs on China, consumers are likely to see prices increase for electronics, appliances and toys.\n\nChina is the top exporter of smartphones, laptops, TVs, gaming consoles and all the parts that comprise them, with Beijing bringing in $146 billion worth of such imports in 2023, according to the International Trade Commission\n\nChina’s business accounts for 78% of production of smartphones, 87% of video game consoles and 79% of laptops, according to the trade group the Consumer Technology Association\n\nThe iPhone, in particular, looks set for a big hit. Even as other companies have shifted production away from China, more than 95% of iPhones and other Apple products were still assembled in the communist nation as of 2023.\n\nMexico has also become the second-largest source for electronic products imported into the US, with the southern nation bringing in $103 billion in 2023 and making up nearly one-fifth of America’s total electronics import. \n\nThe toy tax \n\nThe US also gets more than 75% of all its imported toys from China, according to The Toy Association industry group. \n\nThe group called the tariffs “significantly harmful” as it urged its members to contact members of congress to express their concern over the expected blow to the industry. \n\nJennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City’s West Side Kids said that the tariffs will cause the prices of toys to rise “probably instantly.” \n\n“It would be heartbreaking,” she told CBS News. “It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me.\n\nCheap clothes from China and Lululemon leggings\n\nSince the tariffs have no exemptions, Trump did away with the so-called “de minimis loophole,” which allowed shipments of $800 or less to come into the United States tax-free.\n\nThe loophole allowed cheap e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu that ship directly to American consumers to thrive, but it also helped individuals and small businesses save money by relying on knock-off products from China.\n\nShein CEO Donald Tang declined to say whether or not the tariffs will force his company to raise prices on its popular but ultracheap products during an interview with CNBC last week.\n\nAnd it’s not just cheap clothes either, fashion blogger Antonio Padilla estimates that the tariffs will hit major clothing stores across the nation. \n\n“For example, Canadian-based brands like Aritzia and LuluLemon will likely see a 25% increase on their items once the new tariffs are implemented,” Padilla told the AP. \n\nAnd a whopping 99% of all shoes sold in the US are also imported, with more than half coming from China, according to the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, which represents Nike and other footwear brands.\n\nA blow to construction \n\nThe construction industry is also expected to suffer a blow from the tariffs as nearly a quarter of American steel comes from Canada and another 12% comes from Mexico, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.\n\nThe industry has warned that cutting off Canadian lumber, which accounts for 30% of what the US uses, could worsen the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\n\nExacerbating those worries are the fact that the components for drywall, lime and gypsum, overwhelmingly come from Mexico, which sent the $4568 million worth of the materials in 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nWhat comes next \n\nAlthough US farms have the potential to step up and soften the blow from the tariffs at the grocery store, economists predict that domestic producers will likely increase their prices to match the foreign imports, meaning the cost to the consumer will go up regardless and within days.\n\nPrices could further increase after Canada and Mexico waged their own tariff war on the US in response to Trump.\n\nCanada announced that it plans to levy a 25% tariff on $155 billion worth of US goods, including beer, wine and bourbon, fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Trump has yet to respond to his calls over the tariffs, nor has the president responded to his Mexican counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, who said she will announce her own retaliatory tariffs soon. \n\nDuring his first term in office, China retaliated against the tariffs by posing their own import levies on soybeans and pork, which hurt US farmers and forced the Trump administration to spend billions in taxpayer money to compensate Americans for the lost sales and lower prices. \n\nLee Wicker, the deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, said he hopes Trump will provide the safety net again should Canada and Mexico retaliate. \n\n“[We] trust him that he’s going to take care of anybody who’s hurt by the tariffs, and that’s really all that we can ask for,” he told the AP.\n\nWith Post wires","summary":"And these are just the things that are likely to go up quickly.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/02/us-news/whats-going-to-get-hit-by-trumps-tariffs-avocados-modelo-and-iphones/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/97768699.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wqACVLWI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-02 23:29:18","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":286411334,"title":"US strikes in Somalia kill 'key IS figures'","text":"The govt of Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region said Sunday that US military strikes in the Golis mountains on the previous day had killed \"key figures\" in the Islamic State group.

Our community is with you, and we'll keep showing up,' she added.\n\nSome passing motorists honked their horns in solidarity while protesters blasted a mix of traditional and contemporary Mexican music from a loudspeaker.\n\nThe demonstration was mostly peaceful, with some street vendors taking advantage to sell bacon-wrapped hot dogs, ice cream, churros, beer and even shots of tequila to the crowd. \n\n'I wanted to be here because it's important for my community to support and I wanted my son to be here as well because we come from immigrant families, and we need to be here for each other,' said Rocio Sarabia Cabrera.\n\n'I want to not welcome ICE, to protect our community, and continue being a sanctuary state,' she added.\n\nTensions have been boiling since Trump's return to office, with his administration touting a sharp increase in immigration arrests - nearly 1,000 daily. \n\nNew executive orders have expanded ICE's authority, allowing agents to target migrants at sensitive locations like schools and churches, a move that has stoked fear and anger among immigrant communities.\n\n'This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens - including murderers and rapists - who have illegally come into our country,' the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.\n\nThe decision has worried many migrants and advocates who fear children will be traumatized by seeing their parents arrested in the drop-off line at school or that migrants needing medical care won’t go to the hospital for fear of arrest. \n\n'Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest.'\n\nFor many in Los Angeles, a city with deep immigrant roots, the policies have sparked outrage and resistance.\n\nSchools have begun distributing 'Know Your Rights' cards, educating students and families on legal protections if confronted by ICE.\n\nThe Los Angeles School Police Department (LASPD) has since released a statement reaffirming its stance on providing a safe environment for all students, regardless of background. \n\nThere are an estimated 11 million to 15 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., including more than 2 million in California.\n\nThey include people who crossed the border illegally, people who overstayed their visas and people who have requested asylum.","summary":"Thousands of protesters flooded downtown Los Angeles, blocking the 101 Freeway in defiance of President Trump's harsh immigration policies.

The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board.

But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.\n\nData from the jet's flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet, plus or minus 25 feet, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.\n\nThe discrepancy has yet to be explained.\n\nInvestigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter's black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.\n\n\"That's what our job is, to figure that out,\" NTSB member Todd Inman said.\n\n\"This is a complex investigation,\" investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \"There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\"\n\nBanning said the jet's cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.\n\n\"The crew had a verbal reaction,\" Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \"the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\"\n\nFull NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\n\nInman said he has spent hours meeting with victims' families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.\n\n\"Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,\" Inman said. \"They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.\"\n\nMore than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.\n\nInvestigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.\n\nAccording to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called \"not normal.\"\n\n\"Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,\" Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump's administration would address shortages with \"bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.\"\n\nWith the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground.\n\nAlso Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.\n\n\"It was far above the 200-foot limit. That's not really too complicated to understand, is it???\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nWednesday's crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.\n\nExperts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.","summary":"Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of 55 of the 67 people killed in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/dc-midair-collision-remains-55-67-victims-crash-reagan-national-have-been-recovered-identified-officials-say/15857867/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15857888_AP25033590900109.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/020225-wls-n1-plane-crashes-5p-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-02 23:22:43","author":"David R.

He clarified that the presence of Chinese interests in the region does not pose a threat to Panama's control over the vital waterway.\n“The Panama Canal is operated by our country, and there is no doubt about its continued operation under Panama’s sovereignty,” Mulino told reporters. “Our sovereignty is not in question, and I explained to Secretary Rubio that I must preserve the Canal, as any other Panamanian would do in my position.”\nTrump Accuses Panama Of Treaty Violation\nThis meeting comes in response to US President Donald Trump’s recent statements, where he accused Panama of violating the treaty governing the Panama Canal by allowing China’s influence to grow in the region. Trump argued that the United States should reclaim control of the canal, calling it “the most expensive development we ever did.” He also raised concerns about Chinese-language signage at the canal, claiming it violated the terms of the agreement that transferred control of the canal to Panama in 1999.\nUS Issues Warning Over Chinese Influence\nThe US State Department issued a statement after the meeting, reinforcing Trump’s stance. Secretary Rubio informed Mulino that Trump had made a preliminary determination that the Chinese Communist Party’s influence in the canal area poses a threat and violates the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal. Rubio warned that, unless immediate changes were made, the US would take necessary actions to protect its rights under the treaty.\nDespite these tensions, Mulino emphasized that the situation remains under review by Panama’s technical bodies, with an audit by the Comptroller’s Office expected to provide further clarity. The Panamanian president also reassured his citizens, stating that there is no risk to the validity of the treaty or any possibility of military intervention from the United States.\nThe discussion between Mulino and Rubio also touched on regional issues, particularly the ongoing illegal migration crisis. Mulino expressed optimism that Panama’s joint repatriation program with the US would continue to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants through the Darien Gap. As the dispute over the Panama Canal unfolds, Mulino’s administration remains steadfast in asserting Panama’s control over the waterway, while the US continues to voice its concerns regarding China’s growing influence in the region.\nALSO READ: Did The Groundhog See His Shadow?

Rubio's decision to prioritize Latin America over the traditional first stops in Europe or Asia signals the White House's intent to refocus foreign policy, homing in on the region as immigration remains at the forefront of President Donald Trump's agenda.Panama is a significant starting point for Rubio's Latin American tour given the Trump administration's claims that the Panama Canal is controlled by China, despite Mulio's reassurance that China does not influence the canal's administration.Trump has repeatedly suggested that the U.S. take back control of the Panama Canal that was given to the Latin American country in 1999 thanks to two treaties signed by former President Jimmy Carter in 1977. One of those agreements was called the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal or the Neutrality Treaty. This treaty also guaranteed that all countries had fair access to the Panama Canal with nondiscriminatory tolls.What To KnowIn December 2024, Trump suggested that the U.S. could regain control of the canal from the Panamanian government if something is not done to curb the \"exorbitant\" shipping costs required for using the waterway. At the time, Mulino said in a statement, \"Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent area belong to PANAMA, and will continue to be.\"According to a statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, Rubio told Mulino and Foreign Minister Javier Martínez-Acha in a meeting on Saturday that Trump \"has made a preliminary determination that the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal area is a threat to the canal and represents a violation\" of the Neutrality Treaty.The statement continued: \"Secretary Rubio made clear that this status quo is unacceptable and that absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights under the Treaty.\"The statement also said that Rubio talked about the \"importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis\" and thanked Mulino for his support of a program that started under the Joe Biden administration that seeks to remove Panama nationals from the U.S. and repatriate them.What Are China's Ties to the Panama Canal?Panama is currently involved with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which funds infrastructure projects around the globe. Critics say the initiative leaves poor countries who accept the funding heavily indebted to Beijing. Mulino said Panama would not be renewing its agreement with the BRI once it expires, according to the Associated Press (AP).A subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports controls operations at two ports on either end of the Panama Canal. It is currently in a 25-year no-bid to run the ports. Mulino said the consortium controlling the ports and the suitability of its no-bid extension were being audited, the AP reports.What People Are SayingPanamanian President José Raúl Mulino told reporters on Sunday, per the AP, that Rubio made \"no real threat of retaking the canal or the use of force.\"Mulino called his meeting with Rubio \"respectful\" and \"positive,\" the AP reported. The Panamanian president also said he did not \"feel like there's a real threat against the treaty and its validity.\"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said late last month: \"China has not participated in the management and operation of the canal, has never interfered in the canal's affairs, has always respected Panama's sovereignty over the canal, and recognizes the canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"What Happens NextRubio's itinerary also includes visits to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic. His trip is expected to focus on mass migration, drug cartels and policies from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela as ongoing threats to stability, Rubio wrote in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal published Friday.","summary":"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Panama's President José Raúl Mulino that the \"status quo\" of the Panama Canal is \"unacceptable.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/marco-rubio-jose-raul-mulino-panama-canal-china-2024904","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2579231/marco-rubio.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 23:04:10","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.035},{"id":286409938,"title":"Mexican farmers, auto-parts makers urge dialogue with US","text":"Mexican agricultural and auto-parts producers called Sunday for \"dialogue\" to head off the trade war prompted by US President Donald Trump's decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum meantime said that she was waiting for a response from Trump to her proposal for talks and to form a working group on migration and drug trafficking.\n\nShe said she would detail her government's next steps by Monday.\n\nThe agriculture and auto-parts industries are expected to be among the hardest hit by Trump's action, which he says is designed to pressure the US's closest neighbors -- and partners in a trade accord -- to crack down on migration and drug trafficking.\n\nBoth Mexico and Canada have announced counter-tariffs.

Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said at a news conference that divers still need to find the bodies of 12 more victims and are committed to the dignified recovery of remains as they prepare to lift wreckage from the Potomac River as early as Monday morning.\n\n“Reuniting those lost in this tragic incident is really what keeps us all going,” said Colonel Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers. Portions of the aircraft will be loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for further investigation.\n\nThey spoke hours after families of the victims visited the crash site just outside Washington, D.C., walking along the banks of the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport to memorialize their loved ones.\n\nDozens of people arrived in buses with a police escort close to where an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided Wednesday, killing all 67 aboard the two aircraft. Federal investigators were working to piece together the events that led to the crash while recovery crews were set to pull more wreckage from the chilly water.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Sunday said he wanted to leave federal aviation investigators space to conduct their inquiry.\n\nBut he posed a range of questions about the crash while appearing on morning TV news programs.\n\n“What was happening inside the towers? Were they understaffed? … The position of the Black Hawk, the elevation of the Black Hawk, were the pilots of the Black Hawk wearing night vision goggles?” Duffy asked on CNN.\n\nThe American Airlines flight with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River after colliding.\n\nThe plane’s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.\n\nArmy Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O’Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.\n\nREAD MORE | 3rd Black Hawk soldier killed in DC midair collision identified\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.\n\nInvestigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet’s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.\n\nData from the jet’s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet, plus or minus 25 feet, when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet, the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.\n\nThe discrepancy has yet to be explained.\n\nInvestigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter’s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.\n\n“That’s what our job is, to figure that out,” NTSB member Todd Inman said.\n\n“This is a complex investigation,” investigator in charge Brice Banning said. “There are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.”\n\nBanning said the jet’s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.\n\n“The crew had a verbal reaction,” Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed “the airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.”\n\nFull NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.\n\nInman said he has spent hours meeting with victims’ families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.\n\n“Some wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,” Inman said. “They are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.”\n\nMore than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.\n\nInvestigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.\n\nAccording to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called “not normal.”\n\n“Staffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,” Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump’s administration would address shortages with “bright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.”\n\nWith the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground.\n\nAlso Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.\n\n“It was far above the 200-foot limit. That’s not really too complicated to understand, is it???” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nWednesday’s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.\n\nExperts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nARLINGTON, Va. &#8212; Authorities said Sunday they have recovered the remains of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Officials Confirm Identification of 55 Victims in Washington DC Midair Collision near Reagan Airport&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/officials-confirm-identification-of-55-victims-in-washington-dc-midair-collision-near-reagan-airport/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-02 22:59:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":286410908,"title":"State Democrats are looking for ways to advance their priorities without help from Washington","text":"Before President Donald Trump took office for his second term, Democrats in state legislatures across the country began preparing themselves for an onslaught of conservative-driven policies.As the new year began, Democrats in the states filed a flurry of bills addressing everything from minimum wage increases and price fixing to child poverty and medical leave to stave off Trump's expected initiatives.Despite the preparation, Democrats were still alarmed, however, when the administration last week sought to freeze billions in federal funding.Here's how state Democrats are seeking to advance their priorities against the prospect of federal funding fights.Trump's campaign success rested largely on the economy, rallying his base and even some longtime Democratic voters to the GOP over inflation.The potential of a funding freeze, however, could threaten critical housing assistance programs that have aided many Americans. The president's new tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico could also raise the cost of materials for construction, causing house prices to go up.So Democrats in the states are trying to pass a series of laws focused on housing affordability.In Colorado, legislative Democrats are debating a bill that would regulate rent-setting computer algorithms, which many lawmakers said have allowed housing prices to be artificially increased and, in turn, have provided more favorable rent prices to landlords.A report issued by the Biden administration in December found that renters in Denver paid $136 more each month to landlords who used the computer algorithms. (The report has since been taken down from the White House website.)Similar efforts are underway in California, New Jersey, and Virginia, which all have Democratic-controlled legislatures.In Wisconsin, legislative Democrats have also introduced a bill to broaden the homestead tax credit, which gives property tax relief to lower-income renters and homeowners.In 2021, congressional Democrats muscled through an expanded Child Tax Credit as part of then-President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan — which directed monthly payments of $250 to $300 per child from July through December of that year.However, an extension of the expanded Child Tax Credit failed to materialize due to opposition from then-Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.

[+] same day with counter-tariffs on America. (Photo by EuropaNewswire/Gado/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIn a move that experts warn could upend decades of cross-border labour mobility, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on February 1, 2025, imposing sweeping tariffs. Under the U.S. order, most Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff—except energy products, which will be taxed at a reduced rate of 10 percent. The U.S. has announced similar measures against Mexico, where a 25 percent tariff has been announced, and against China, where a new 10 percent tariff has been implemented. These moves signalled a dramatic shift in U.S. trade policy and, in particular, may have far-reaching implications for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the future of those with work visas under that agreement across North America.\n\nCanadian Response And The USMCA Risk\n\nIn response to the U.S. action, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately announced a series of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports. Speaking at a press conference in Ottawa, Trudeau declared that Canada would target American goods valued at approximately $155 billion, imposing an immediate $30 billion in tariffs, with an additional $125 billion scheduled to take effect within 21 days. Alongside these tariffs, the Canadian government unveiled non-tariff measures—including restrictions on procurement involving American bidders and a “buy Canadian” policy. Similar measures were announced by some Canadian provincial premiers who declared they would stop imports from the U.S., such as alcohol from “red states” and orange juice from Florida, for example.\n\nTrudeau characterized these actions as necessary countermeasures to what he described as “an aggressive unilateral move by the United States,” positioning the tariffs not merely as economic instruments but as a political protest. Pointing out that the illicit entry of undocumented migrants from Canada and fentanyl imports from Canada amount to less than 1 percent of such entries and imports to the United States, Trudeau expressed surprise at these stated reasons for the U.S. actions. Indeed, an added concern Canada could raise is the illicit importation of U.S. firearms smuggled northward into Canada. In short, U.S. statistics suggest there is room for America to do more homework on these problems before blaming them on other countries.\n\nUSMCA and Immigration Visa Uncertainty\n\nTrump’s executive order included a stern warning for Canada not to retaliate, a statement that could be a prelude to abrogating the USMCA. The escalating trade dispute could lead to a particularly alarming and unforeseen development: the potential cancellation of work visas held by Canadians and Mexicans under the USMCA. If Trump rescinds the agreement, it could cancel all Canadian work visas for professionals in the United States—specifically those under the TN, E, and L-1 categories. Equally, Mexican work visas could be cancelled, and American professionals working in Canada or Mexico under the same framework could also find their visas void. Decades of economic integration and labour mobility, hallmarks of the USMCA, now hang in the balance. The uncertainty could cast a long shadow over countless families, businesses, and communities between the two nations. The intersection of trade policy and immigration is now more than ever a critical flash point in the ongoing dispute.\n\nBroader Implications Amid USMCA Trade Tensions\n\nAs both nations implement these aggressive tariff measures, the coming weeks promise to be a period of high-stakes negotiations and significant economic uncertainty. The potential dismantling of the USMCA work visa program would have profound consequences—not just for the economies of the United States and Canada, but for the everyday lives of countless families whose livelihoods depend on the ease of cross-border employment. The stakes are enormous, with the potential collapse of the USMCA visa framework threatening to disrupt not only the economies of the countries but the lives, livelihoods, and the long-established economic bond between the United States and Canada, not to mention Mexico and the implications for other countries dealing with the United States including China.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns iPhone And Android Users—Stop Answering These Calls\n\nThe Fed Just Confirmed A Huge Crypto Game-Changer As Trump Sparks Bitcoin Price Crash Fears\n\nHow To Watch The 2025 Grammy Awards On Cable, Streaming And For Free\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

And he will tell allies to keep up military support to Ukraine, ensuring Volodymyr Zelensky is in the strongest position possible as Donald Trump’s return to the White House increases the prospect of a negotiated end to the war. \n\nBacking Mr Trump’s demands for Nato members to significantly boost their spending on defence, at Monday’s talks Sir Keir will say: “We need to see all allies stepping up – particularly in Europe.” \n\nThe PM has promised to raise Britain’s defence spending to 2.5 per cent of the overall size of the economy (GDP), but has come under pressure to set out a timeline of when the UK will reach the milestone. \n\nSir Keir added: “President Trump has threatened more sanctions on Russia and it’s clear that’s got Putin rattled. We know that he’s worried about the state of the Russian economy.\n\n“I’m here to work with our European partners on keeping up the pressure, targeting the energy revenues and the companies supplying his missile factories to crush Putin’s war machine.\n\n“Because ultimately, alongside our military support, that is what will bring peace closer.”\n\nOn the eve of his visit, the prime minister welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to his country residence in Buckinghamshire. He ruled out rejoining the EU trade bloc, but said he wanted to forge a closer relationship non defence, energy and trade.\n\nThe pair discussed Ukraine and the Middle East, according to Sir Keir’s spokesperson, with them both agreeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted the need to strengthen defences. \n\nSir Keir will become the first prime minister since Brexit to attend a dinner with EU leaders as he seeks to reset Britain’s relationship with the bloc. While talks are expected to focus on security and defence, the PM is under mounting pressure to strike a closer trading arrangement with Europe to revive Britain’s flagging economy. \n\nAnd pressure on Sir Keir to strengthen Britain’s trade ties with the bloc is mounting in the wake of Mr Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on the US’s nearest neighbours, with the threat of a global trade war looming. \n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said that Mr Trump is “tearing apart the rules from trade to security” and called for Britain to “step up and lead with our neighbours in Europe”. \n\nHe is urging chancellor Rachel Reeves to order an official analysis on the benefits of Britain agreeing a customs union deal with the EU. Labour has ruled out a return to the customs union as one of its so-called red lines in the ongoing reset. \n\nSir Keir on Monday will meet NATO general secretary Mark Rutte before attending a dinner of the 27 EU leaders at an informal meeting of the European Council. \n\nHe will pitch a defence and security partnership which would see the UK and EU boost cooperation on shared threats, as well as on tackling cross-border crime and illegal migration. \n\nSir Keir previously discussed his hopes for a defence and security pact with the EU in an interview with The Independent, detailing how it would complement Nato. \n\nAsked what this increased cooperation would look like in practice, the prime minister said it would involve coordination on defence capability, funding and training, pointing to British troops training in Norway and those stationed in Estonia as an example of how the UK could work with its allies.\n\nAhead of the talks, Downing Street said Putin is under mounting domestic pressure in Russia, with inflation and interest rates soaring due to the combination of sanctions and the billions being ploughed into the war effort. \n\nRussian oil and gas revenues fell by 29 per cent in 2024 compared to 2022, while sanctions have led to a spike in shipping costs and left many Russian vessels unable to trade. \n\nAnd Britain has sanctioned 2,100 individuals under its Russia sanctions regime, with 1,900 imposed since the war began.","summary":"At a meeting with EU heads of state in Brussels on Monday, the prime minister will challenge Britain’s European allies to ramp up their defence spending to keep the continent safe from Vladimir Putin’s ‘campaign of sabotage and destruction’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-brexit-reset-eu-putin-ukraine-b2690764.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/02/22/14/SEI238299278.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/kIg79Zty-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-02 22:40:07","author":"Archie Mitchell","authors":["Archie Mitchell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.255}]}
