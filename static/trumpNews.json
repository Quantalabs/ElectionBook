{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":14727,"news":[{"id":384022490,"title":"Bitcoin dips below $85,000 briefly in crypto rout","text":"Bitcoin and companies tied to cryptocurrencies extended a nearly two-month swoon Monday, tracking with a broader market sell-off in technology companies that many see as overvalued.Bitcoin slid 6.5% after being down nearly 12% earlier in the day, settling in just above $85,000. The most-traded cryptocurrency is down about 33% since hitting a record $126,210.50 on Oct. 6, according to crypto trading platform Coinbase. Bitcoin had soared since April in line with the stock market and driven partly by a more crypto-friendly tone in Washington.Companies that enable investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, as well as the growing number of companies who have made investing in bitcoin their main business focus, were hammered in Monday's sell-off.Coinbase Global fell 5.4% and online trading platform Robinhood Markets lost 4.4%. Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms dropped 2.8%.Strategy, the biggest of the so-called crypto treasury companies that raises money just to buy bitcoin, tumbled 10%. The company has reported holding 649,870 bitcoin. As of 1 p.m. ET Monday they were worth about $55 billion.American Bitcoin, in which President Donald Trump's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. hold a stake, fell 8.1% and is now down more than 41% since Sept. 30.Other Trump-related crypto ventures have seen declines as well. The market value for the World Liberty Financial token, or $WLFI, has fallen to about $4.14 billion from above $6 billion in mid-September, according to coinmarketcap.com And the price of a meme coin named for President Donald Trump, $TRUMP, is $5.67, a fraction of the $45 asking price just before his inauguration in January.One popular way of investing in bitcoin is through spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency. According to data from Morningstar Direct, investors pulled $3.6 billion out of spot bitcoin ETFs in November, the largest monthly outflow since the ETFs began trading in January 2024.Bitcoin futures are down nearly 24% in the past month. At the same time, gold futures are up almost 7%.Analysts point to a number of factors that have led to the sell-off in bitcoin and other crypto investments, including a broad risk-off sentiment that has gripped markets this fall, sending investors toward safer havens such as bonds and gold.In a research note to clients last week, Deutsche Bank analysts also attributed the recent declines in crypto to institutional selling, other long-term holders collecting profits and a more hawkish Federal Reserve. Stalled crypto regulation has also contributed to the uncertainty, Deutsche Bank said.“While volatility remains inherent, these conditions indicate Bitcoin’s portfolio integration is being tested, and raises questions of whether this is a temporary correction or a more prolonged adjustment,” the analysts wrote.On the regulatory front, the crypto industry received a boost in July when Trump signed into law regulations that set initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency.But a bill that creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency remains stalled in the Senate. The bill has been a top priority for the crypto industry since it spent heavily to elect Trump and install other allies in Washington.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-dips-below-85-000-briefly-in-crypto-rout-11764615996574.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market_2_1733466021722_1733466033367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 19:06:36","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":384022496,"title":"Trump health: White House shares update amid speculation about US President's MRI report—details here","text":"The White House, on Monday, shared an update on US President Donald Trump's health, stating that an MRI was performed for preventive reasons. It also stated that all of the POTUS' imaging reports were normal, and he remains in ‘overall excellent health.’ There was also no evidence of arterial narrowing.White House revealed the details of the reports after Trump, earlier in the day had said that he will make public the results of his MRI scan conducted in October. “If you want to have it released, I’ll release it,” the Republican president said during an exchange with reporters as he travelled back to Washington from Florida, AP reported.The POTUS had said that the results of the MRI were “perfect.” He was traveling back to Washington, DC, from Florida after spending Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago.Trump's comments about the “perfect” MRI result come after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, on Sunday, 30 November – told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Trump is \"fading physically\" and criticised his \"mental capacity.\" Walz further took to X to call on Trump to release his MRI results.Donald Trump was the oldest person to be inaugurated as president when he retook the White House in January. He is the second-oldest person to serve as president.Why Trump underwent MRI scan?Although detail of Trump's MRI reports were made public, the White House earlier declined to shed light on why Trump had an MRI during his physical examination in October or on what part of his body. The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said that the president received “advanced imaging” at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center “as part of his routine physical examination” and that the results showed Trump remains in “exceptional physical health.”Trump's healthWhile the White House PR team keeps promoting an image of Trump as unusually vigorous— the Republican appears to be slowing down, AFP reported.According to a report in The Times, Trump has significantly cut back on public events and domestic travel compared to his first term, generally keeping a public schedule from noon to 5:00 pm.Which health conditions has Trump already been diagnosed with?Earlier this year, the White House revealed that Trump had swelling in his lower legs and bruising on his right hand, after photos showed visibly swollen ankles and makeup covering the marks on his hand.Trump’s physician, Sean Barbabella, later explained in a letter that medical tests confirmed the swelling was caused by chronic venous insufficiency — a common and generally harmless condition, especially in people over the age of 70.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/white-house-shares-update-on-trumps-health-amid-speculation-about-us-presidents-health-mri-report-details-here-11764615405479.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/01/1600x900/USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-MEETING-0_1764616052601_1764616061871.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 18:58:58","author":"Sudeshna Ghoshal","authors":["Sudeshna Ghoshal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":384022482,"title":"US, UK seal zero tariff pharmaceutical deal as NHS pledges to pay more for drugs—Key points","text":"Britain's publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS) is set to pay about 25% more for innovative drugs in return for zero tariffs on exports of pharmaceuticals to the US as part of a new deal under Donald Trump's government, which was finalised on Monday, 1 December.According to a report by The Guardian, industry sources estimate it could cost about £3bn in higher spending on drugs over the next three years. However, they also noted that the deal could increase the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines for diseases such as breast cancer, asthma and motor neurone disease, where innovation is key.In return, UK will be exempted from hefty US tariffs imposed on pharma imports that entered force on October 1. It is the only country to reach such a deal as European Union and Switzerland continue to face pharma tariffs totalling 15%.US-UK zero tariff pharma deal: Key pointsThe accord aims to \"address long-standing imbalances in US-UK pharmaceutical trade,\" ending what US trade ambassador Jamieson Greer called an arrangement where “American patients have been forced to subsidise prescription drugs and biologics in other developed countries,” reported AFP.Here's a glimpse at the key highlights of the deal:Higher prices for US treatments: The National Health Service (NHS) will increase its prices for new US treatments by 25%.Zero tariffs: Britain is now the only country exempted from the hefty tariffs that took effect on 1 October. Prior to Monday's announcement, the Trump administration had announced tariffs of 100 percent on branded pharmaceuticals.Delay in tariffs for AstraZeneca: The White House, on Monday, also delayed the tariffs for three years with Pfizer and British group AstraZeneca after both agreed to invest in US manufacturing capacity.What the deal means for UK patients?British Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the US-UK pharma deal will ensure that UK patients get access to medicines faster.

Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been expected to attend, sources familiar with the matter said, as well as White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.The Oval Office meeting, which attendees began arriving for just before 5 p.m., comes as the United States has increased pressure on Venezuela with strikes on drug vessels and a military asset buildup in the Caribbean.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday that Trump was “meeting with his national security team on this subject and on many matters,” adding, “It’s part of his responsibility to ensure that peace is ongoing throughout the world.”(More to come..)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-convenes-emergency-white-house-meeting-as-us-ramps-up-pressure-on-venezuela-11764637636009.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/02/1600x900/logo/USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-MADURO-0_1764637689644_1764637707053.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 01:16:56","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.274},{"id":384085534,"title":"There’s an oil glut. That might not tank prices.","text":"How that news lands depends on where you sit. Consumers are helped by gasoline now priced $3 a gallon in more than half the U.S. states, according to the American Automobile Association. Investors, however, could see oil-related stocks pressured as the oil price moves lower, though that could create opportunities for value hunters later next year.\n\n Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded near $63 Friday morning, nearly $20 off its 2025 high set in January.\n\n Oil supply would need to fall by about a million barrels a day to match demand, said Dan Pickering, founder and CIO at Pickering Energy Partners.\n\n He sees two possibilities. One is “OPEC cuts, which seem unlikely given they have just been spending all this time bringing oil back,\" Pickering said. “Or we need lower U.S. supply, lower production from shale, which seems like it’s only going to happen with a price signal.\"\n\n Analysts have a tough job. Estimates of market surplus vary between one to four million barrels of oil a day in 2026. That makes forecasting prices tricky. Some see a scenario where oil prices could collapse into the $50s per barrel or lower.\n\n Another way to see all that supply is as a buffer against geopolitical disruption. Prices may stay steady despite risks to the energy markets, such as U.S. threats of military action in Venezuela.\n\n President Donald Trump said on social media this weekend that Venezuela’s airspace should be considered closed. That has analysts on alert for a potential military strike, though Trump said not to read into the closure.\n\n The market is also watching the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which could mean that now-sanctioned Russian oil barrels would return to the world market and add to the supply overhang. Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin Tuesday.\n\n The most likely scenario is that prices will fade below $60 toward $50 a barrel, but there is a low probability it will make an extreme move toward $40, said Ed Morse, senior advisor to Hartree Partners.\n\n Other actors could have a say on oil prices, including China. It has been making significant purchases of oil for its strategic petroleum reserves.\n\n A sharp falloff in prices could prompt action from the oil cartel OPEC and its allies.\n\n “If we do have this massive run-up in inventories, I think OPEC leadership does reserve the right to come back in. I don’t believe they are going to repeat 2015,\" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Prices in 2015 fell below $40 a barrel.\n\n OPEC+ has raised its output targets by 2.9 million barrels a day since April. It announced a 137,000 barrel a day increase for December. at the same time, it said it would pause returning more oil to the market during the first quarter of 2026.\n\n OPEC is waging a “long and shallow\" price war against U.S. and other producers, said Francisco Blanch, head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America. He expects Brent to average $60-$65 per barrel range for the next few months.\n\n He puts the market surplus at two million barrels a day. It could take 18 months before the market comes into better balance, he says.\n\n There still could be some slight growth from North American producers next year, as Guyana continues to add to global volumes.\n\n But Blanch doesn’t believe the price will crater soon. “There will be buyers and there will be China,\" said Blanch.\n\n Blanch expects China could buy another 200 million barrels in 2026.\n\n Geopolitics will keep the most bearish forecasts at bay, Croft said.\n\n For instance, Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine has some oil traders expecting a deal. That could allow Russia to sell oil to more buyers, effectively raising competition.\n\n But the European Union is reluctant to sign off on the peace plan, which would keep Ukraine out of the 27-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n Even if there is a deal forged by the U.S., “so much of the architecture of the sanctions on the Russian energy system has been done by the Europeans and we can’t just force 27 members to do what we want.\"\n\n Croft said there is also a bearish view that Venezuela’s oil will flood back into the market if Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is ousted.\n\n But it would take time for Venezuela to ramp up production. Its oil infrastructure in decline for decades, Croft said. Many Venezuelans who had worked in the industry left the country. Venezuela now produces about one million barrels a day, a third of what it had produced at its peak.\n\n All of this uncertainty could keep a floor under Brent.\n\n Write to editors@barrons.com.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/global/theres-an-oil-glut-that-might-not-tank-prices-11764637881442.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/02/1600x900/logo/TEXAS-OIL-12_1734739901576_1764638110196.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 01:16:19","author":"Patti Domm","authors":["Patti Domm"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":384086322,"title":"Trump warns Israel not to ‘interfere’ in Syria","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump warned Israel on Monday against destabilizing Syria and its new leadership, days after a deadly operation by Israeli forces in the south of the country.\n\n“It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump said he was “very satisfied” with Syria’s performance under former rebel President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who made a historic visit to the White House in November.\n\nTrump has been pushing for a security pact between Israel and Syria since Sharaa’s group coalition overthrew longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad a year ago.\n\nBut tensions have risen over hundreds of strikes by Israel on Syria.

election locked in tie","text":"The man Donald Trump hopes will be the next leader of Honduras is tied neck and neck with a rival, according to the latest election results.\n\nJust days after Mr Trump stunned many observers by pardoning a former Honduran president convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 45 years in a US jail, his party’s presidential candidate, Nasry “Tito” Asfura, is locked in a virtual tie with centrist Salvador Nasralla.\n\nA third candidate, Rixi Moncada, of the ruling Liberty and Refoundation Party, or LIBRE, was trailing the others.\n\nInitial results suggested Mr Asfura and Mr Nasralla were stuck at 40 per cent, with Mr Moncada at 19 per cent.\n\nAccording to a social media post by Ana Paola Hall, head of the National Electoral Council, Mr Asfura, 67, led 72-year-old Mr Nasralla by just 515 votes, making it a “technical tie” following the partial tally of Sunday’s election.\n\nMs Hall wrote: “Thanks to the Honduran people for going to the polls and helping us safeguard the electoral process.\n\n“Today, one day after the elections, we wake up in a country with peace, without acts of violence, and that is a victory for all of us who love Honduras.”\n\nShe said that as things currently stood, a difference of 515 votes separated the two leading candidates.\n\n“In the face of this technical tie, we must remain calm [and] have patience,” she added, announcing a manual recount.\n\nMr Trump said recently Mr Asfura, a former mayor of Tegucigalpa and a member of the right-wing National Party (PN), was the “the only real friend of freedom in Honduras”.\n\nHe wrote in a Truth Social post that Mr Asfura’s opponents were not to be trusted, alleging that Mr Moncada was a “communist” aligned with Nicolas Maduro and Cuba.\n\nHe said Mr Nasralla, a television host and member of the centre-leaning Liberal Party, “cannot be trusted”.\n\nMr Trump also said: “Tito and I can work together to fight the narco-communists, and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras.”\n\nTrump pardons former president\n\nWhile the US has frequently meddled in the internal politics of Latin America, from Chile to Guatemala, Mr Trump’s decision to involve himself in Honduras, a nation with a population of just 10 million, surprised many.\n\nDuring his first term, many Hondurans were part of so-called “caravans” that wound their way north through central America to the US’s Southern border, seeking to enter.\n\nGiven Mr Trump has made the fight against illegal drugs entering the country a key part of his second term – green-lighting as commander-in-chief more than 20 deadly strikes on vessels said to be carrying such materials, his pardoning last week of former president Juan Orlando Hernandez stunned a number of experts.\n\nThe 57-year-old was convicted last year on drug trafficking and firearms charges and sentenced to 45 years in jail.\n\nHis brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, a former congressman, is currently serving a life sentence in the US for manufacturing and smuggling 185,000 kilograms of cocaine.\n\nAsked about the decision to pardon the former president, Mr Trump said: “I was told – I was asked by Honduras, many of the people of Honduras, they said it was a Biden set-up.”\n\nHe added: “They basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country, and they said it was a Biden administration set-up, and I looked at the facts and I agree with them.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-favourite-win-honduras-election-005528209.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nb0XuZztgJnrdjQr4TQNkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNTAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/0b73cf045e47ba02bf60dfab250dcd05","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02

Fraud Scandal’ That Benefited Jihadists","text":"The Trump White House pithily stated the disquieting and disgraceful facts of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s (D) money-laundering scandal.\n\nCalling Walz “deeply disturbed,” the White House described the massive fraud scandal involving mostly Somali migrants that cost Minnesota taxpayers a billion dollars — and funded a terror group. Democrats are as corrupt as Hades, and failed vice presidential candidate Walz is one of the slimiest.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates, there was plenty of corruption and fraud involving taxpayer money. But the Somali-Walz scandal takes the cake, as the White House detailed:\n\nDemocrats allowed a $1+ billion heist to take place. Dozens of individuals — largely of East African descent — looted taxpayers out of over $1 billion that was intended for child food assistance in what amounted to the country’s largest pandemic relief fraud scheme.\n\nFor Our VIPs: Legal Immigrants Condemn Biden-Era Policies After D.C. Shooting\n\nAnd here’s where the part that Democrats most want to keep suppressed comes in. Somalia is a Muslim country and, by definition, the culture and values there are antithetical to the Judeo-Christian, liberal ethos of America. That came out in quite an expensive fashion in Minnesota:\n\nThe fraud involved a massive, complex network of nonprofits and affiliates, largely run through the Somali community. Nonprofits tied to the Somali community claimed to have fed tens of thousands of non-existent hungry children, claimed to have provided services to non-existent homeless, and claimed to have provided therapy for non-existent autistic Somali children. Kickbacks were paid, and money was sent overseas — some of it even allegedly funneled to a terror group.\n\nThat group would be Al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-linked Islamic jihadi entity. A network of clan-based money traders reportedly helped to funnel the money from Minnesota to the terrorists. As an unnamed confidential source said, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.” How inspiring.\n\nSo how is this Walz’s scandal? He is accused of deliberately turning a blind eye to the massive scandal, in yet another instance of Democrats trying to cover up the results of their Islamist sympathies and disastrous immigration policies.\n\nThe massive scandal unfolded on Walz’s watch — and he did absolutely nothing about it. All enforcement has been at the federal — not state — level. In fact, the state’s cowardly Democrat officials were “reluctant” to act — “tolerating, if not tacitly allowing, the fraud” and ignoring whistleblowers — to avoid “political backlash among the Somali community” and accusations of racism.\n\nDemocrats will sacrifice anything and anyone for the sake of their perverse ideology. They care more about avoiding a label than about holding terrorists accountable.\n\nDonald Trump plans to take on the monster that Walz created. The White House release promised:\n\nThe Trump Administration is terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somalis, indefinitely halting migration from third-world countries, reexamining green cards for every alien from every country of concern, pausing all asylum decisions, and more — all as part of its relentless effort to ensure migrants that remain are a net positive on our society.\n\nIt's time for Walz to leave office.\n\nNote: It's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/catherinesalgado/2025/12/01/white-house-sums-up-walzs-shocking-fraud-scandal-n4946613","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/163/c2203386-84c9-444c-9afd-1a77690d86b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:50:10","author":"Catherine Salgado","authors":["Catherine Salgado"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.587},{"id":384085436,"title":"Brazil does not believe in US attack on Venezuela — CNN Brasil","text":"RIO DE JANEIRO, December 2. /TASS/.

Shortly after the video was released, Trump posted on Truth Social: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reshared a post that said, “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”\n\nThe next day, Trump said he hadn’t actually threatened the Democratic lawmakers with death, but Slotkin said his words still carried significant weight.\n\n“Leadership climate is set at the top. So, when President Trump calls for me to be killed and hanged, many people take that as license to call my office and say even worse,” Slotkin wrote in her post.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to MS NOW’s request for comment on Slotkin’s post.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, another of the Democrats in the video, told reporters Monday that he and his wife — former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in 2011 as a member of Congress — are also receiving threats.\n\n“Gabby and I are no stranger to political violence,” he said.\n\nRep. Jason Crow of Colorado, another member of the group dubbed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the “Seditious Six,” said recently that he has received threatening messages as well.","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/elissa-slotkin-military-illegal-orders-trump-sedition","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1764627951/251201-elissa-slotkin-es/251201-elissa-slotkin-es.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:36:25","author":"Erum Salam","authors":["Erum Salam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":384084674,"title":"MRI shows Trump in 'excellent' cardiovascular health: Physician","text":"WASHINGTON: United States President Donald Trump has \"excellent\" cardiovascular health, his doctor said on Monday (Dec 1), citing an MRI taken during an unannounced hospital visit that ignited fresh scrutiny over his medical condition.\n\nThe Republican billionaire, who turns 80 in June, has long faced criticism for limited transparency around his health.

Mark Kelly Defies Trump: He's 'Trying to Silence Me' and 'Threatening to Kill Me'","text":"In a political climate where the line between rhetorical hyperbole and actual bloodshed has tragically evaporated, Senator Mark Kelly is refusing to blink. Standing before a backdrop of American flags, the Arizona Democrat delivered a blistering rebuttal to President Donald Trump, who has recently escalated his attacks from social media insults to accusations of treason punishable by death.For Kelly, a former astronaut and naval aviator, the President's latest salvo—calling for his arrest and execution—is not just another headline; it is a direct continuation of a career defined by intimidation.Why a Simple Message to Troops Triggered a Death ThreatThe firestorm began just over a week ago when Kelly, along with Senator Elissa Slotkin and other veterans in Congress, released a video with a stark but legally grounded message for U.S. service members: you have a duty to refuse illegal orders. The video was a response to growing concerns about the administration's use of the military, yet the reaction from the White House was explosive. President Trump accused the lawmakers of 'seditious behaviour' and explicitly suggested they should be 'hanged' and 'executed'.'This is pretty basic stuff,' Kelly noted, addressing the controversy. 'Everyone must follow the law. No one may break the law.' Yet, the President's response was anything but basic. By threatening to kill a sitting U.S. Senator for stating a legal fact, Trump has, in Kelly's view, shattered yet another democratic norm. 'Any other president would have responded... \"Of course\",' Kelly said. Instead, Trump sent his Secretary of Defence to target Kelly, a move the Senator describes as a desperate attempt to 'silence me' for 'saying what is true'.From Boardroom to Situation Room: A Legacy of IntimidationKelly did not mince words when diagnosing the root of the President's behaviour, drawing a direct line from Trump's past to his present. The Senator painted a portrait of a man who has only ever had 'one play' in his playbook: bullying opponents into submission. Kelly stripped away the veneer of the presidency to reveal the 'failed casino owner' underneath—one who 'bankrupted his properties and screwed over his contractors'.This pattern of intimidation, Kelly argued, transitioned seamlessly from the boardroom to The Apprentice, where Trump became famous for firing people, and finally to the Oval Office. 'He's done it as president who tries every day to intimidate people with no regards for the rights or well-being of the American people,' Kelly asserted. While this strategy of dominance may have served Trump well in the cutthroat world of New York real estate and reality television, Kelly vowed that it 'is not going to work' against him or the American people.When Political Rhetoric Turns Into Real-World BloodshedThe most sobering moments of Kelly's address came when he connected the President's violent rhetoric to the very real body count mounting across the nation. Kelly's own family is intimately acquainted with the cost of political hatred; his wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, was 'shot in the head and nearly died' while meeting with constituents. But Kelly warned that the violence has metastasised beyond isolated incidents.He listed a grim roll call of recent victims, highlighting a bipartisan crisis that the President continues to stoke. He pointed to the tragic murder of Melissa Hortman, the Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, and her husband in their home earlier this year. He reminded the press that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro had his house 'firebombed'.Perhaps most shockingly, Kelly referenced the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University—a venue Kelly himself visited weeks later with Republican Senator John Curtis. 'Faced with a wave like this, every other president we have ever had... would have tried to heal the country,' Kelly lamented. Instead, he argued, Trump uses every opportunity to 'divide us', fully aware that his words carry 'tremendous weight' and that his followers are listening.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sen-mark-kelly-defies-trump-hes-trying-silence-me-threatening-kill-me-1759532","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1772677/senator-kelly-defies-trumps-death-threats.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=bcd0a024b35fb2f6ef7a73984c66a1cb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:35:16","author":"Daniel Joshua Flores","authors":["Daniel Joshua Flores"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":384081636,"title":"Costco joins growing list of companies suing Trump for refunds if Supreme Court strikes down tariffs","text":"Costco has sued the Trump administration over its flagship tariffs policy, joining a growing list of companies vying in court to ensure they are refunded if the Supreme Court strikes those tariffs down.\n\nIn a complaint filed last week before the U.S. Court of International Trade, lawyers for Costco asked the Supreme Court to rule Trump's 'emergency' tariffs illegal and to order the full refund of all such tariffs it has already paid.\n\nOther companies which have brought such lawsuits include the American cosmetics titan Revlon and the Japanese motorbike and motor maker Kawasaki Motors.\n\nThree lower courts have already ruled against President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs on imports from across the world, and now the Supreme Court is hearing arguments for a final decision.\n\nBut if the nation's highest court also rejects the tariffs, lawyers for Costco — the nation's biggest warehouse club retailer and the third biggest retailer in the world — said it was \"not guaranteed\" that the company would get a refund for what it has paid so far.\n\n\"By any objective measure, the challenged tariff orders are 'of vast economic and political significance'.

Sign up for it here.\n\nFor the past few weeks, President Donald Trump has seemed uncharacteristically passive. His own Republican Party bucked him on the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein—in a movement partly led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who once seemed like his staunchest apostle. His U.S. House gerrymandering campaign faltered under opposition from the GOP in deep-red Indiana, of all places. He even seemed awed by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, in an Oval Office meeting.\n\nIn recent days, though, the president has posted a series of angry tirades, apparently determined to reclaim his role driving the news.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump seemed to sow the most chaos after hours on Twitter, when his advisers had gone home for the night. His second administration may have no more “adults in the room,” yet the timing, during a holiday when he had more free time and fewer constraints, seems noteworthy. The stretch began with an awful event Wednesday night—the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members, one fatal, in Washington, D.C., where Trump had deployed them. The suspect is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan man who worked with the CIA during the American war in his country before seeking refuge in the United States and receiving asylum this past April.\n\nIn volatile situations, Trump can almost always be relied upon to choose the most inflammatory response, and this was no exception. When reporters asked him whether he’d attend the funeral of Sarah Beckstrom, the slain West Virginia Guard member, he said he hadn’t thought about it yet and pivoted to extolling his own electoral performance in the state. Later, the president posted a picture of people fleeing Kabul after the U.S. withdrawal (“the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan,” as he put it), and announced that he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions.” He also suggested stripping citizenship from immigrants and declared, “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”\n\nWhat any of this means in policy terms is unclear, including what specifically Trump means by “Third World,” a term that doesn’t hold practical meaning now that the Cold War distinction of First and Second World countries has dissolved. Mostly, it seems to be a cleaned-up label for what he has previously called “shithole countries”: those whose residents are not white. (The administration has also been working to cut off refugees, except for white South Africans, as well as Europeans who oppose immigration—except, presumably, in their own case.)\n\nTrump was just warming up. On Thanksgiving Day, what began like a normal missive quickly went south. “A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at,” he wrote, before calling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously retarded” and attacking Representative Ilhan Omar, also of Minnesota, whom he described as “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab” and accused of entering the country illegally. (No evidence supports this.) Trump defended his use of the slur against Walz yesterday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted that he was “cancelling all Executive Orders” that President Joe Biden signed using an autopen, a remote-signature device that Trump has also employed. He threatened to try Biden for perjury if he claimed that he’d signed the documents. Again, the actual effects of such a statement are unclear. The most controversial application would be reverting Biden’s pardons and commutations, which Trump has alleged (without proof) that the former president was not aware of authorizing—though legal experts say these types of actions can’t be reversed.\n\nIf any grants of clemency are going to be reversed, a good candidate would be another one of Trump’s actions on Friday: the announcement of a pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras. The floridly corrupt Hernández was sentenced to 45 years in prison last year for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. Pardoning someone responsible for bringing literal tons of cocaine into the country makes no sense, especially given that Trump’s government is currently using likely illegal strikes to kill people it claims are trafficking small amounts in tiny boats. But Trump’s own experience as a convicted felon has apparently trained him to see convicted heads of state as victims of a political witch hunt. The president also recently commuted the sentence of David Gentile, a financier convicted in a $1.6 billion fraud scheme.\n\nSaturday morning, he posted again, saying that “THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA” should be considered “TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.” Trump has no authority to unilaterally declare a no-fly zone over Venezuela, a sovereign nation with which the U.S. is not (yet!) at war. Even if such a thing were wise, the United States does not appear to be prepared to enforce it: Neither the White House nor the Pentagon has provided any more details or explanations that back up the statement. Never mind: Within 35 minutes, Trump had moved on to claiming to have driven drug prices down “500%, 600%, 700%, and more,” a mathematical impossibility.\n\nIn the most immediate sense, Trump’s rampage worked: He’s back in control of the news cycle. Whether that improves his political position, however, is an open question. Public racism and the use of slurs may be accepted in Trump’s base, and may even excite some of his supporters, but nothing suggests these behaviors will be well liked by the rest of the country, including independents who voted for him in 2024. On Friday, Gallup released a new poll showing Trump at his lowest approval of this term. The president can still seize the spotlight, but notoriety and popularity are not the same thing.\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe People Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI\n\nBy Lila Shroff\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nRemember.

Not One - Kristi Noem urges Trump to impose ‘full travel ban’ on countries sending ‘killers' to US","text":"The political fallout from last week’s deadly shooting near the White House intensified sharply on Monday as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she had formally recommended that President Donald Trump impose a “full travel ban” on what she described as “every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.” Her comments come amid mounting scrutiny of the Afghan man accused of killing a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., and wounding another.Why is Noem calling for a full travel ban?Noem made the recommendation directly to the President and publicised the exchange on X, posting:“I just met with the President.I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom—not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS.WE DON'T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.\"Her remarks came days after she said the suspect in the White House-area shooting had been “radicalized” inside the United States rather than abroad.Was the suspect radicalised in the US?Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press and ABC’s This Week, Noem said investigators believe the accused gunman, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was already living in Washington state when he adopted extremist views.“We believe he was radicalized since he's been here in this country,” she told NBC News. “We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him, who were his family members.”Authorities say Lakanwal is suspected of ambushing two National Guard members just blocks from the White House, killing one and critically injuring the other in Wednesday’s attack.Noem added that US officials have received “some participation” from people who knew Lakanwal, and issued a stark warning:“Anyone who has the information on this needs to know that we will be coming after you, and we will bring you to justice,” she said.What is known about the suspect’s immigration history?Lakanwal entered the United States in 2021 as part of the Biden administration’s mass evacuation of Afghans who assisted American forces during the war. Although he arrived under President Biden, he was granted asylum in April under President Trump, according to a government file reviewed by Reuters.That detail complicates the Trump administration’s assertion that the attack resulted from inadequate vetting during the Biden era.Officials say Lakanwal previously served in a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan. Noem’s comments suggest investigators now believe any radicalisation occurred after his arrival in the United States.How is the Trump administration responding?President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that his administration could halt asylum admissions altogether.“No time limit, but it could be a long time,” he said. “We have enough problems. We don't want those people.”Following the attack, the administration froze processing of all asylum applications and is considering additional measures. Noem said immigration authorities will review every existing asylum claim and may deport individuals if they are deemed a security risk.“We are going to go through every single person that has a pending asylum claim,” she said.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/dont-want-them-not-one-kristi-noem-urges-trump-to-impose-full-travel-ban-on-countries-sending-killers-to-us-11764634727053.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/02/1600x900/logo/AP11-23-2025-000013B-0_1764634840000_1764634852793.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:30:16","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":384080672,"title":"Karoline Leavitt eviscerates New York Times reporter over 'unequivocally false' Trump hit piece","text":"Karoline Leavitt slammed New York Times reporter Katie Rogers over a shocking piece she wrote last week that claimed Donald Trump was showing 'signs of fatigue' in his second term. \n\nThe press secretary made an example of Rogers' piece about 79-year-old Trump's scaled back public appearances during Monday's White House briefing.\n\n'I will point out one fake news story over the weekend before I let you all go from The New York Times, that took about one-third of the president's daily calendar and his daily schedule and said that he's doing less than he did in his first term, or he might not be fit for the job,' Leavitt said.\n\n'That is unequivocally false, and it's deeply unfortunate that the story was written by the same outlet and the same reporter who wrote this: 'Biden is doing 100% fine after tripping while boarding Air Force One,' Leavitt continued. \n\nShe was referencing Rogers' 2021 story, written shortly after Biden tripped while boarding Air Force One.\n\n'Oh, same outlet, same reporter who wrote that President Trump is not fit for the job. Are you kidding me? You all see him almost every single day. He is the most accessible president in history. He is taking meetings around the clock,' said Leavitt. \n\nLeavitt singled out Rogers' piece as part of a new 'Media Offenders' portal of the White House website meant to shame what the White House considers the worst of the 'fake news' media. \n\n'I think it goes to our original promise on day one to hold the media accountable because, unfortunately, and we deal with this all day, every day around here, there are so many fake stories that are unfortunately written, that have inaccurate characterizations of meetings that took place,' Leavitt said. \n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Times continued to defend the story. \n\n'The Times's White House team, including Katie Rogers, the same reporter Ms. Leavitt singled out today, have reported without fear or favor across multiple administrations from both parties. Katie's reporting on President Biden was just as unflinching as it has been on President Trump, despite cherry-picked headlines attempting to prove something that simply isn't true.' \n\nTrump himself eviscerated the piece when it was published last week. \n\n'The Creeps at the Failing New York Times are at it again,' Trump told his followers on Truth Social on Wednesday morning. 'Radical Left Lunatics in the soon to fold New York Times did a hit piece on me that I am perhaps losing my Energy, despite facts that show the exact opposite.\n\n'They know this is wrong, as is almost every thing that they write about me, including election results, ALL PURPOSELY NEGATIVE. This cheap 'RAG' is truly an 'ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.\n\n'The writer of the story, Katie Rogers, who is assigned to write only bad things about me, is a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out.'\n\nTrump concluded his post by admitting that one day he will be 'low on energy' from old age - but that day is not today. \n\n'There will be a day when I run low on Energy, it happens to everyone, but with a PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST ('That was aced') JUST RECENTLY TAKEN, it certainly is not now! GOD BLESS AMERICA & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!'\n\nThe New York Times piece written by Rogers and Dylan Freedman claimed that Trump on average would start scheduled events at 10.31am during his first tenure, in 2017.\n\nHowever, this year, the President started attending events later in the afternoon, on average at 12.08pm. \n\nThe article claimed that the President's attempts to project 'round-the-clock energy, virility and physical stamina' were becoming difficult for him to maintain as he ages.\n\nHis packed schedule has included flying more than 12 hours nonstop to Israel to broker a Gaza cease-fire in October, attending dozens of public events each week and holding lengthy, energetic press conferences.\n\nThe overall number of Trump's official appearances at White House events has declined by 39 percent compared to his first term, according to the New York Times's analysis. \n\nThroughout Biden's time in the White House, Trump and his Republican allies slammed the Democratic leader over his old age, lack of public appearances, and cognitive ability. \n\nEarlier this year, pictures emerged from the Oval Office showing Trump with bruising on his hand, which was sometimes covered up by makeup. The White House claimed the bruising originates from the president shaking too many hands. \n\nAfter photos showed him with swollen legs and ankles, the White House revealed in July that he had been diagnosed with Chronic Venous Insufficiency - a condition where leg veins can't send blood back to the heart efficiently.\n\nTrump was also accused of closing his eyes during an Oval Office event about cutting the price of weight-loss drugs earlier this month. \n\nA White House spokesman said in response to the reports: 'The president was not sleeping; in fact, he spoke throughout and took many questions from the press.'\n\nTrump has certainly kept up his back-and-forth with the liberal-leaning press at the same rate in his second term. \n\nLast week, Trump sparked outrage when he called another female Bloomberg reporter a 'piggy' while aboard Air Force One after she pressed the president on his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nReporter Catherine Lucey appeared to ask Trump a question relating to Epstein before the President began waving a finger in her face.\n\n'Quiet, quiet piggy!' Trump snapped at the journalist while she stood off camera. \n\nThe insult sparked backlash from Democratic political operatives and media pundits. \n\nLeavitt said in response: 'He calls out fake news when he sees it and gets frustrated with reporters who spread false information.'\n\nTrump, who has long gone after journalists for questioning the state of his health, is set to become the oldest living president by the end of his second term. \n\nOn Sunday, the president delivered a brutal insult to a reporter who probed the president over his recent MRI scan. \n\nAs he and Melania returned to the White House on Air Force One, Trump addressed last month's MRI in a press briefing after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz demanded the results be released publicly.\n\nDuring the exchange with journalists, he was asked for his response to Walz's cries for transparency.\n\n'They were perfect like my phone call where I got impeached. Absolutely perfect.

Al-Shabaab is a Somalia-based Islamist terror organization.\n\n“Minnesota is drowning in fraud. Billions in taxpayer dollars have been stolen during the administration of Governor Tim Walz alone,” Rufo and Thorpe wrote. “Democratic state officials, overseeing one of the most generous welfare regimes in the country, are asleep at the switch. And the media, duty-bound by progressive pieties, refuse to connect the dots.”\n\nThe piece highlighted truly titanic fraud schemes involving various state welfare programs, including “Feeding Our Future,” a program that received hundreds of millions of dollars annually and was ultimately “being used to fund lavish lifestyles, purchase luxury vehicles, and buy real estate in the United States, Turkey, and Kenya.”\n\nThe report set off a firestorm.\n\nRufo was accused of being anti-immigrant and racist. Many on social media accused him of exaggerating the problem. But then The New York Times published a follow-up basically confirming that Minnesota’s social services were essentially eviscerated by Somali fraudsters under Walz’s watch.\n\nThere was a very important line in this piece provided by Ahmed Samatar, a professor at Macalester College. Samatar said, according to the Times, that “Somali refugees who came to the United States after their country’s civil war were raised in a culture in which stealing from the country’s dysfunctional and corrupt government was widespread.”\n\nThis sort of gets to the heart of why immigration policies have been so out of whack and destructive in Western countries for a generation, producing the current justified backlash.\n\nIt should be no surprise that in concentrated Somali communities, like the ones that exist in Minnesota, similar scams have taken place. One doesn’t need to be wholly against immigration to understand that. After all, Thomas Jefferson warned in his famed “Notes on the State of Virginia” about taking in too many people from “absolute monarchies” who will bring with them “the principles of the governments they leave imbibed in their early youth.”\n\n“These principles, with their language, they will transmit to their children,” Jefferson wrote. “In proportion to their numbers, they will share with us in legislation. Our laws and institutions must therefore be guarded with jealous attention; and in order to preserve them, we must incorporate our immigrants into the body of our people.”\n\nHe recommended essentially slowing our roll bringing in people from such places. That’s prudence, not nativism. \n\nWhat we’ve seen under President Joe Biden and Democrat governors like Walz, is the furthest thing from prudence. Instead, our country has been subjected to a reckless, cynical vote grab combined with the toxic empathy of modern leftism.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Sunday that the U.S. needs to stop taking people in from countries like Somalia where they have “virtually no government” and “then they come into our country and tell us how to run our country.”\n\nThe president is on to something here when talking about the Somalia issue. The war-torn nation typically ranks as one of the most corrupt on Earth. Theft of public money is commonplace.\n\nIn 2022 it was discovered that two-thirds of the five thousand civil servants in Somalia didn’t report to work and in many cases were likely “ghost employees” according to the Horn Observer.\n\nSomali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud groused about this issue.\n\n“There are more than 5,000 civil servants registered in our biometric system, but only 1,500 of them report to work every day,” he said, according to the Horn Observer. “Where are the rest? They do not exist or they do not live in the country. However, they are still paid. They are thieves and their superiors who accepted this scheme are also thieves. They are simply stealing public money.”\n\nHassan may be right, but it seems he doesn’t have a leg to stand on. He’s been accused of corruption related to public land sales.\n\nThere has been, no surprise, widespread problems with theft of international aid in Somalia too. The European Union had to temporarily suspend Somalia’s World Food Programme in 2023 because of widespread theft. Reuters reported how the program was supposed to send $130 a month to displaced persons in a refugee camp, but they would frequently only receive $65 after it was handled by the camp manager.\n\nIn 2024 the Minnesota Informer published an interesting piece about the corruption clearly taking place among Somalis in Minnesota. It was written by Kayseh Magan, a man with a Somali background who had worked as a fraud investigator in the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office.\n\nMagan explained that widespread fraud was common in the Somali community. He said that this crime problem is the classic case of when “desire meets opportunity.” Magan wrote that “Minnesota’s public programs don’t adequately guard against organized fraud.”\n\nPart of the issue: The fraudsters have exploited “the burgeoning political power of the Somali community, and the feckless fear that establishment politicians and state agencies show when confronted with charges of racism or Islamophobia.”\n\nIt’s here we see the crisis facing many Western governments playing out in the most extreme way in Minnesota. They’ve combined a generous welfare state with the near religious belief in mass immigration from developing, “third world” countries as Trump called them. To even question that system is to be ostracized as part of the wholly unacceptable “far right.”\n\nThe result in Europe, after years of evidence that the system isn’t working, is that governments literally silence people who disagree with unlimited immigration. The U.K. is conducting this Orwellian experiment in tyranny as I write this.\n\nWhat we are seeing in the United States is hopefully an immigration reset of sorts. More Americans now question the value that unlimited, unchecked migration from dysfunctional countries brings to ours. What is happening in Minnesota needs to stop. The country can’t afford it.","summary":"Fraudsters in the Somali community of Minnesota stole billions of dollars from American taxpayers over a period of years, and the state government did nothing...

Mark Green, who resigned in July to launch a new business.\n\nBut redistricting in 2020 made the 7th somewhat less rural than it had been, as statehouse Republicans tried to boost the party’s chances elsewhere.\n\nNow it’s anchored by Democrat-dominated Nashville and its suburbs, as well as the wealthy bedroom community of Franklin, one of the richest cities in America — and some recent polling shows Behn within striking distance.\n\nThat makes the race a “canary in the coal mine” for our national politics, says columnist Mark Pulliam.\n\nIt shouldn’t be. \n\nBehn is a former organizer for the George Soros-funded leftist “resistance” group Indivisible, and she has a propensity for saying, and doing, crazy things. \n\nShe has, for example, expressed contempt for Nashville, which she seeks to represent. \n\n“I hate this city,” Behn said in a recently resurfaced video. \n\n“I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music,” she railed. “I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘It city’ to the rest of the country.”\n\nYou’d think “I hate country music” would be the kiss of death all by itself. (Here in Tennessee, our views on bachelorettes and pedal taverns are more mixed.) \n\nBut that’s just the start of Behn’s bizarre ranting. \n\nShe’s publicly discussed her therapy sessions, and her “recurring dream” of “standing up in a cafeteria full of women . . . and saying ‘I don’t want children. I want power!’ And just screaming it at the top of my lungs.”\n\nWell, you can see why she won the Democratic primary. \n\nShe’s said that women who have children are supporting the “patriarchy,” and has encouraged “self-managed, at-home abortions” in states that ban the procedure. \n\nAnd a 2019 video showed her screaming and sobbing while state troopers dragged her out of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s office after she dashed in without authorization.\n\nWith views and behavior like this in a district that voted for President Donald Trump by 22 percentage points, she should be dead in the water. \n\nBut she’s polling better than she has any right to. And she just might win.\n\nThe reason is that Republican voters in Tennessee, as in many other comfortably red states, are complacent. \n\nThey turn out in big numbers for presidential elections, but in special elections and local elections, they don’t bother. \n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are insanely angry and motivated, desperate for any kind of a win. \n\nDemographers like to say the future belongs to those who show up. Elections do too.\n\nVotes must be cast to get counted, and listless voters just stay home. \n\nIn low-turnout elections — which special elections usually are — the side demonstrating greater emotional intensity has a better chance of winning. \n\nThat’s definitely Democrats this time around.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tennessee GOP apparatus has appeared as limp as its voters.\n\nThe party has done little to build a turnout operation — something Democrats here have been working very hard at — and seems to think that slamming Behn for her past outrageousness is all it will take to beat her.\n\nThis should sound familiar to New Yorkers. \n\nZohran Mamdani’s socialist, antisemitic statements gave his opponents plenty of ammunition to use against him.\n\nNone of it dampened leftist voter intensity.\n\nNot long ago it would have been unimaginable for New York City to elect a far-left Muslim mayor with open sympathy for terrorist groups after 2,976 people were killed, and thousands more injured, in Islamic terror attacks on the World Trade Center. \n\nBut New Yorkers — at least those who turned out to vote — did just that last month.\n\nLikewise, Tennessee might soon have a congresswoman who will make AOC look like a dignified stateswoman. \n\nWell, we’ll see. Another truism about special elections is that pundits tend to treat them as more significant than they really are. \n\nBut if Democrats do pull off a win this week, it will be a deadly warning to Republicans about the dangers of complacency. \n\nEither way, the scare should be a lesson ahead of next year’s midterms: Play hungry, if you want to win.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"Aftyn Behn's far-left views and outrageous comments should kill her election chances in a district that voted for Trump by 22 points — but she’s polling better than she has any right to.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/01/opinion/tennessee-vote-a-gop-warning-damning-the-left-isnt-enough/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/democratic-congressional-candidate-state-rep-116400356-e1764630506429.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:10:26","author":"Glenn H.

This report, which earned the offense category 'Lie,' was co-authored by female reporters Michelle Boorstein and Tara Copp.\n\nThe White House maintains that 'every order President Trump has issued has been lawful' and argues that reporting implying otherwise misrepresented his actions. Visitors to the site are also encouraged to sign up for a newsletter promising weekly updates on the 'truth.'\n\nIs Trump Targeting Female Reporters?\n\nAlongside institutional criticism, Trump has made repeated personal attacks against female journalists.\n\nOn 14 November, when a Bloomberg reporter asked him a question aboard Air Force One, he responded, 'Quiet, piggy.'\n\nLater in the week, he called an ABC reporter 'a terrible person and a terrible reporter', while describing her network as 'fake news.'\n\nShortly after, he referred to a New York Times reporter as 'a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out' and called a CBS News reporter 'a stupid person' in response to questions about government vetting of Afghan refugees.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the President's remarks at a briefing, saying he's only confronting journalists directly. This defence failed to acknowledge the gendered nature of several high-profile insults, which included derogatory comments about physical appearance and intelligence directed specifically at women.\n\nBased on the full list of reporters provided, 22 individual female reporters and 25 individual male reporters were named. However, when considering the institutional listings where the staff is cited as a group (e.g., 'The BBC Staff'), the focus on individual women for specific offenses remains stark.\n\nOf the 47 individual journalists named, 22 are female (approximately 47%). Here is the breakdown of the female reporters named and the alleged offense categories for the reports they contributed to:\n\nThe female reporters singled out on the site were often targeted for reports related to immigration, health, and policy disputes. For instance, Associated Press reporters Ali Swenson and Lauran Neergaard were cited for 'False Claim, Lie, and Malpractice' for a report on the President's claims about Tylenol and vaccines.\n\nABC News political commentator Ana Navarro was listed under 'Left-wing lunacy' for comments about 'Alligator Alcatraz,' while CBS News reporter Gabriela Vidal was cited for 'Bias' for describing a deported illegal alien with two dozen arrests as a 'Colorado Grandfather.'\n\nHistory of Derogatory Remarks Against Journalists\n\nTrump's pattern of targeting journalists has continued throughout his Presidency, and by extension, the White House.\n\nSo far, the administration has criticised major outlets, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal. While the website initially included Fox News, the page was removed after the network objected to a reporter being misattributed.\n\nSeth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, commented on the move, 'People understand the obvious conflict inherent in a presidential administration appointing itself the arbiter of media bias, and I expect that after the initial wave of publicity, few Americans will be paying attention to this latest stunt. The gimmick is wearing thin.'\n\nStern also emphasised that Trump's objections appear focused less on media bias and more on 'journalists not flattering him and regurgitating his lies.'\n\nWhile the initiative targets both institutions and individuals, the focus on female reporters has drawn particular attention. Experts argue that such attacks may discourage women, who happen to be the first responders to Trump's policies, from engaging in investigative reporting or asking challenging questions.\n\nThe White House did not provide further comment on the page beyond its launch.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"The White House has launched a 'Hall of Shame' listing media outlets and journalists it claims 'misrepresented President Trump', with most of them being female reporters.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-launches-hall-shame-white-house-website-name-shame-female-reporters-he-disagrees-3791771","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4635815/white-house.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:10:13","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.002},{"id":384078854,"title":"WSJ Editorial Board Says Trump Will 'Lose' If He Doesn't Oust Venezuela's Maduro","text":"The Wall Street Journal's editorial board said President Donald Trump will \"lose\" if his administration's pressure campaign against the Venezuelan regime doesn't end up with the ousting of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nIn an op-ed published on Sunday, the board said that if Maduro manages to stay despite the U.S. sending 25% of the Navy's deployed warships to the area, F-35 fighters and thousands of Marines \"merely to blow up drug boats,\" he will have won.\n\nConsidering the issue's standing in the geopolitical scenario, recalling the flotilla means the \"world will see that he was able to stand up to American power in the Yankee's backyard.\" Moreover, countries in the region that have actively sided with the U.S., like Trinidad and Tobago, could \"become new targets for Cuban disruption\" considering the country's influence in the Caracas regime.\n\nIn this context, if Maduro doesn't leave as a result of the administration's ramped up rhetoric and threats, Trump \"may have to take direct military action to oust the dictator,\" the borad added, noting that \"if this includes special forces raids or other boots on the ground, American casualties are possible.\"\n\n\"This is a much higher domestic political risk than cruise missile strikes or B-2 bomber raids.

The agency, which promised to deliver trillions in savings, was dissolved eight months ahead of schedule, marking a deeply humiliating end to a short and controversial tenure.\n\nMusk, who briefly headed the initiative, has since dismissed the failure with a strange analogy, suggesting that waste and fraud are simply disguised by sympathetic causes. His comments came just before the formal winding down of the department was reported.\n\nElon Musk's Bizarre 'Save the Baby Pandas' Analogy\n\nDuring an interview on the WTF Is podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, Musk provided a highly unusual explanation for the difficulty of cutting federal spending. He was defending DOGE's controversial cuts, denying that the agency targeted essential payments, particularly those destined for needy people in Africa. He contended that those perpetrating fraud invariably use causes that evoke maximum public sympathy to obscure their illicit activities.\n\n'Fraudsters necessarily will come up with a very sympathetic argument. They're not going to say, 'Give us the money for fraud,' Musk explained. He then offered his unusual analogy, stating, 'It's going to be like the Save the Baby Pandas NGO, which is like, who doesn't want to save the baby pandas? They're adorable.'\n\nMusk's main contention was that even the most appealing causes can serve as a front for corruption and the misuse of taxpayer money.\n\n'But then it turns out no pandas are being saved in this thing, it's just corruption, essentially,' he continued. He dramatically demonstrated the lack of accountability by posing a rhetorical question to the supposed fraudsters, saying, 'And you're like, 'Well, can you send us a picture of the panda?' They're like, 'No.' OK. Well, how do we know it's going to the pandas?\n\nMission Goals Slashed as DOGE Dissolves\n\nThe bizarre justification for the perceived failure of DOGE follows a pattern of overpromise and significant under-delivery by the controversial department. The department's original mandate was to continue working until the middle of 2026, but its dissolution was reported just weeks after Musk's interview was recorded, and less than a year of chaotic operations.\n\nThe initial goal for DOGE was staggering, with Musk suggesting the department could save American taxpayers $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) in its first year alone. This figure was quickly reduced to $1 trillion (£800 billion), and then, at a Cabinet meeting in April, expectations were once again lowered to a mere $150 billion (£125 billion) in savings over the next fiscal year.\n\nWhile the DOGE website, known as the 'Wall of Receipts,' claimed to have saved approximately $214 billion (£177 billion), this figure has been widely contested by external analysts. Specifically, a report found that DOGE had relied on 'faulty math,' incorrectly claiming tens of billions of dollars in savings from cancelled federal contracts.\n\nWhat Was DOGE?\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was a controversial initiative established by executive order during the second Trump administration, primarily tasked with modernising federal technology, maximising productivity, and cutting regulations and spending across the government.\n\nIt was created by reorganising and renaming the existing United States Digital Service (USDS) and was widely associated with tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who briefly served in a leadership role. DOGE's official goal was to identify and eliminate 'waste, fraud, and abuse,' with initial claims of saving trillions of dollars, but it faced widespread criticism for its lack of transparency, controversial mass layoffs, and reports of unverified savings before being quietly disbanded in late 2025.\n\nMusk left his role as special advisor to DOGE in late May, just before his high-profile public falling-out with Donald Trump escalated. Despite the drama and the dissolution, Mr Musk attempted to downplay his involvement as an 'interesting side quest,' where he 'just got to see a lot of the inner workings of the government, and there's been quite a few efficiencies.'\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Elon Musk defended his failed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) by comparing fraud to a 'Save the Baby Pandas NGO' that featured no actual pandas.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/elon-musk-likens-failed-doge-save-baby-pandas-ngo-before-its-shutdown-3791762","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4635806/elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-02 00:07:52","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.488},{"id":384084656,"title":"US Senator Chuck Schumer receives bomb threats at three offices in New York  - Jamaica Inquirer – Daily","text":"The top Democrat in the United States Senate, Chuck Schumer, has said that three of his New York state offices were targeted with emailed bomb threats alleging the “2020 election was rigged”.\n\nIn a statement on social media, Schumer said that local law enforcement on Monday received bomb threats referencing his offices in Rochester, Binghamton and Long Island with the email subject line “MAGA”.\n\n“Local and federal law enforcement responded immediately and are conducting full security sweeps,” Schumer said on X.\n\n“Everyone is safe, and I am grateful for their quick and professional response to ensure these offices remain safe and secure for all New Yorkers.”\n\nA law enforcement source confirmed to the Associated Press news agency that police in Suffolk County on Long Island responded to Schumer’s area office, but could not confirm the details of the threat.

SCOTUS has not yet issued a ruling, though Business Insider reported Monday that the administration is likely to fall back on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 in the event SCOTUS rules against Trump.\n\nCostco has not said publicly how much it has paid in tariffs, though Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said a third of the company's sales are from imported goods. Costco's most recent financial statement at the end of the 2025 fiscal year showed the company posted nearly $270 billion in total revenue. Assuming Millerchip's figures are accurate, Costco paid tariffs on roughly $90 billion worth of goods sold this year. This means a full refund of all tariffs paid could potentially number in the billions given that tariffs on major exporters like China were in excess of 100 percent as recently as October.\n\nIn an earnings call with investors earlier this year, Millerchip maintained that it had mostly eaten the cost of Trump's tariffs, saying that it sought to keep prices stable on imported food items \"to make sure that we're protecting the member.\"\n\n\"We continue to work closely with our suppliers to find ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including moving the country of production where it makes sense and consolidating our buying efforts globally to lower the cost of goods across all our markets,\" Millerchip said in September.\n\nIn addition to Costco, several other companies have filed lawsuits seeking tariff refunds including cosmetics manufacturer Revlon, eyeglasses maker EssilorLuxottica, motorcycle manufacturer Kawasaki, canned foods seller Bumble Bee and Japanese auto supplier Yokohama Tire. Other smaller companies have filed similar suits.\n\nMany of the new trade duties the administration put in place were imposed under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act of 1977. (IEEPA) However, two separate federal courts have agreed with plaintiffs that Trump does not have the power to unilaterally impose new tariffs under the IEEPA, and that regulating imports is the job of Congress, rather than the president. \n\nClick here to read NBC's report in full.","summary":"President Donald Trump is now being hit with a new lawsuit by membership-based warehouse retail chain Costco, which is demanding a full refund of all tariffs paid that the president imposed earlier this year.\n\nNBC News reported Monday that Costco is laying claim to tariff-related expenses in the event that the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) upholds lower court rulings that have deemed the vast bulk of his tariffs illegal. SCOTUS has not yet issued a ruling, though Business Insider reported Monday that the administration is likely to fall back on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 in the event SCOTUS rules against Trump.\n\nCostco has not said publicly how much it has paid in tariffs, though Costco Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said a third of the company's sales are from imported goods.
