Both will focus on Latin American corporate debt. At least 13 people — spanning traders, salespeople and analysts — have joined Deutsche Bank’s desks in New York and London as the firm rebuilds its emerging-markets business, with a particular focus on Latin America. More hires are expected, potentially bringing the total to around 25, people familiar with the plan said. The hiring spree is part of efforts led by executives including Chris Leonard, co-head of fixed income and currencies for the Americas, who pitched the expansion to senior management, the people said. A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. The bank had largely wound down its emerging-market credit desk in New York since around 2019, during a time when it was scaling back in several areas to focus on core businesses following a long period of scandals and losses. On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank was raided by German authorities as part of a money laundering probe. Public prosecutors are looking at past dealings by staff with firms linked to the now-sanctioned Russian financier Roman Abramovich, according to people familiar with the matter.Deutsche Bank’s renewed commitment to emerging markets has come at a good time. The sector has been on a tear for months, spurred by President Donald Trump’s trade war and a rush to diversify and hedge exposure to the US, as well as growing confidence around many developing economies. Demand from yield-hungry investors drove one of the best years on record for emerging-market bond sales in 2025, a trend that has continued into this year.The rebuilding efforts turned heads across Wall Street last year when the firm lured away star emerging-markets trader Justin Weinberg from Jefferies Financial Group Inc. — who took three colleagues with him. The defections roiled Jefferies, leading to the removal of one of the co-heads of emerging markets. The other departed.After completing so-called garden-leave periods, Weinberg and his team spent weeks on the road last fall meeting clients and explaining the revamp. Now they’re starting to see a pickup in flows, according to people familiar, trading developing-world credits with large shops.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/deutsche-bank-deepens-emerging-market-rebuild-adds-two-traders-11769626293185.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_4_1733465206851_1733465215415.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 18:51:32","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.187},{"id":397068236,"title":"UK Examines Whether Trump Has Power to Derail Chagos Deal","text":"The UK government is seeking to determine whether Donald Trump has the power to derail its plans to hand over sovereignty of a strategically vital island to Mauritius, after the US president called into question a deal he previously backed.Ministers are also trying to establish if the US administration intends to veto the deal over the Chagos Islands, according to a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity speaking about a diplomatically sensitive topic. They said that if the US does change its long-held position, it would likely be enough to unravel the agreement.Under the deal brokered by Keir Starmer’s government, Britain will lease back a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia from Mauritius for 99 years. After supporting the agreement last year, Trump last week called it an “act of total weakness” and “great stupidity.” That’s despite his own previous support and Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s description of the deal as a “monumental achievement.” The fallout over the Chagos islands highlights the tricky balancing act Starmer faces as he seeks to honor an agreement reached with Mauritius after two years of negotiations without angering Britain’s most important ally. Starmer’s administration has said the deal is key to enable the continued legal use by the UK and US of what is a vitally strategic air base.Trump Flips Position to Attack UK’s Starmer Over Chagos DealConversations between UK and US officials have taken place in recent days in an attempt to ease the White House’s concerns. Even so, Starmer’s spokesman, Geraint Ellis, on Wednesday couldn’t say whether the US has the power to unravel the deal. “The UK and US have worked closely together in developing the treaty, which will secure the joint base on Diego Garcia that’s vital to our national security,” he said. “We continue to work closely with the US to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place for the future operations of the base.”The State Department declined to comment, pointing to Trump’s Truth Social post.The Times on Wednesday reported that ministers are increasingly concerned that Trump could pull the deal and that Starmer did not raise the issue during a call with the President on Saturday.Starmer, however, said he’s discussed Chagos with Trump a number of times, and the issue has been raised with the White House as recently as this week. “When the Trump administration came in, we paused for three months to give them time to consider the Chagos deal, which they did at agency level,” he told reporters on his way to China. “Once they’d done that, they were very clear in the pronouncements about the fact that they supported the deal.”Starmer last week told the House of Commons that Trump’s volte-face over Chagos “expressly intended to put pressure on me to yield on my principles” over Greenland after the British premier had criticized Trump’s attempts to take control of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.Britain is now seeking to ease US concerns over Diego Garcia without drawing the issue back onto Trump’s radar while he’s distracted by Iran and domestic controversies. UK opposition parties with links to the White House are seeking to do the reverse. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch discussed her opposition to the Chagos deal with House Speaker Mike Johnson the evening before Trump’s social media post. She’s also discussed it with US ambassador Warren Stephens, her office said. Trump ally Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK Party, meanwhile, discussed Diego Garcia with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month.While the UK has already signed the treaty with Mauritius, a bill to implement it is yet to complete its passage through Parliament, with ministers disputing several amendments passed in the Lords. Last week, the government postponed a Lords debate after the Tories tabled an amendment to ensure the deal doesn’t breach a 1966 UK-US treaty, which confirms British sovereignty of the islands. The government accused the Tories “irresponsible” and “reckless” behavior and said they would reschedule the debate soon.However, Marc Weller, Director of Chatham House’s international law program, said in a blog post this week that the 1966 agreement “was no oath of eternal UK sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, or Diego Garcia” and that international law recognizes that circumstances can change.The government confirmed on Monday that updating that UK-US agreement was a pre-requisite to enable it to ratify the Chagos Treaty. The UK has “made excellent progress toward finalizing an updated UK-US agreement,” foreign office minister Stephen Doughty told the House of Commons on Monday. He said it wasn’t unusual as it has been updated five times previously, the latest in 1999.“We remain engaged with the US on a daily basis on matters relating to our national security and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter,” he said, adding that Britain aims to “allay any concerns, as we have done throughout this process.”The Chagos Islands and the Diego Garcia base are almost 2,000 miles from the coast of East Africa. The US and UK military facility there allows those nations to more easily carry out missions from the Middle East to Asia. Britain’s concerns aren’t isolated. “We will see what happens,” Mauritius’ attorney general, Gavin Glover, told private radio on Saturday. “We are close to the goal. Let us dare to hope that we will be able to complete the treaty in the forthcoming weeks.”With assistance from Alex Wickham, Kamlesh Bhuckory, Lucy White, Will Standring and Eric Martin.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/uk-examines-whether-trump-has-power-to-derail-chagos-deal-11769625801534.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/28/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1769625813650.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 18:43:20","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":397068224,"title":"Minneapolis shooting: ICE agents involved in Alex Pretti's killing put on administrative leave amid outrage, says report","text":"Federal immigration agents involved in the killing of 37‑year‑old US citizen Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday have been placed on administrative leave amid public outrage, MS NOW reportedHis death came less than three weeks after Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was also killed on January 7 by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.The shooting has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum in the United States and led to demonstrations in Minneapolis, adding to weeks of rising tension over aggressive actions by masked and heavily armed officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US Border Patrol.On Tuesday, Democratic ex-president Joe Biden said the incident “goes against our fundamental American values\". Former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also commented on the situation.Centrist Democratic Senator John Fetterman called Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem “grossly incompetent” and said she should be removed from her position. “The entire community is just horrified by all of this.

Although Pretti did have a permit to carry a firearm, video captured during the encounter does not show him holding the weapon at any moment before he was shot, according to AFP.Trump after Pretti's shooting in MinneapolisThe intense backlash over Pretti’s killing and early remarks from administration that appeared to blame him led President Donald Trump to say on Tuesday that his administration would “de-escalate” its actions in the city in hopes of calming tensions.Trump defended his embattled Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who had labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist\", saying she was doing a “very good job” and would not resign.However, he was more cautious in his remarks about Bovino, a Border Patrol official known for his aggressive, media-focused immigration operations, who had also emphasised the idea that Pretti was dangerous. Trump told Fox, “Bovino’s very capable, but he’s a bit extreme.

He said Trump's renewed tariff warnings felt like a betrayal to many South Koreans and criticized the government for opposing parliamentary ratification procedures, arguing major commitments should be handled through proper legislative channels.\n\nSeveral People Power Party lawmakers pressed the government over the effectiveness of its communication channel with Washington, mocking earlier claims that a high-level \"hotline\" had been established and questioning whether Seoul had meaningful leverage if tariff threats resurfaced so quickly.\n\nRep. Ahn Cheol-soo said the government's claim that negotiations were so successful they did not require a joint statement was not credible. He argued that if talks had been truly successful, the two sides would have presented the outcome publicly through a joint briefing.\n\nRuling party lawmakers countered that Trump's unpredictability is well known and that repeated focus on ratification could slow Seoul's ability to respond diplomatically and economically. They urged swift deliberation and passage of a special bill tied to U.S. investment commitments, saying similar memorandums and fact sheets with partners are often handled without full treaty-style ratification.\n\nThe dispute comes as South Korea moves to implement a bilateral memorandum and related measures that had been linked to tariff levels, while Seoul says it has not received an official U.S. notice of any change.\n\n-- Reported by Asia Today; translated by UPI\n\n© Asia Today.

Wood is nothing more than fuel. These people are building themselves back into a giant pool of risk. Sometimes I get sick to my stomach walking down the street.”\n\nCalligar also warned that Governor Gavin Newsom’s six-year freeze on most changes to building codes, intended to speed rebuilding, is actually preventing stricter safety standards.\n\n“Building resilience takes more time and money, and saves on energy, maintenance and insurance,” he said. “I think there’s going to be a lot of regret.”\n\n“The mayor, she hasn’t done anything. And that’s the worst thing ever.”\n\nMore than a year after flames tore through Pacific Palisades, real estate broker Jacqueline Chernov says the rebuilding process has become almost as punishing as the disaster itself.\n\nNeither of her houses are close to being rebuilt. One stalled due to surging construction costs. Another remains half-finished, with construction frozen, after insurance delays collided with mortgage requirements.\n\nMore than $1 million in insurance proceeds, she said, are still being withheld, leaving her bank unwilling to release additional construction funds.\n\nWhat she expected would be a relatively straightforward claims process has turned into a bureaucratic maze. Insurance payouts are broken into rigid categories, each requiring documentation, receipts and repeated explanations. Even debris removal became a sticking point.\n\n“They told me I needed to divide the debris between the house, the garage and other structures,” she told The California Post. “But it’s all ash. How do you divide ash?”\n\nShe’s also living in fear of even more spiraling costs when the insurance payments covering her rent end.\n\n“I have insurance money to rent a home now, but then that’s going to run out. And that’s my concern. And I think it’s a concern for lots of people,” she said.\n\n“A lot of people had in their policies one to two years of loss of use, which means they’re paying the rent. The insurance company is paying my rent right now. But once that’s up, if my house isn’t built or they decide they’re not going to pay me the money, then I’m selling a half-built house.”\n\nChernov is one of the few actually contemplating a return to her fire ravaged homes. According to an extensive report from the Pacific Palisades Community Council released in January, only one in four residents whose homes were badly damaged have returned. And just over half expecting to be living in Pacific Palisades in 10 years time.\n\nPer the same report, few have confidence in the government to effectively manage rebuilding efforts.\n\nChernov herself is deeply critical of Mayor Bass’s lack of efforts to help residents, calling out much delayed action to attempt to freeze the mansion tax still currently applied to fire-damanged homes.\n\n“The mayor, she hasn’t done anything,” she said. “And that’s the worst thing ever. Because it’s not a tax on the rich. It’s a tax on the people coming to buy the houses, and it just adds that to the purchase price.\n\n“So it’s the homeowner that’s paying, which isn’t fair, and it’s hurting the community from being built back up again because people don’t want to come in.”\n\nCrashing prices\n\nThe delays in rebuilding have destroyed property prices in the area too. \n\nThe shocking Realtor.com report on the state of California’s real estate, exclusively for The California Post, also reveals that homes damaged by the wildfires have on average plummeted 50% in value — comparing pre-fire purchase price to final sales price.\n\nAnd this trend is one that Chernov has observed herself, as a realtor as well as a homeowner.\n\nShe just listed a smoke-damaged house at 737 El Medio Ave., at an ambitious $4.9 million. “You have to get the price at a certain point or all the values in the area will be lost,” she said.\n\n“Some people would rather get into a smoke-damaged house and remediate it themselves than rebuild,” she said. \n\n“Rebuilding is daunting and time-consuming. People don’t know how hard it is.”\n\nShe estimated that, even with ambitious pricing, listing values are down by 30 to 35% on pre-fire times. For example, she said that the 3,800-square-foot dwelling for $4.9 million would list for closer to $6 million undamaged.\n\nThose who plan to sell tend to be retirees or young couples with children — who are generally not interested in dealing with the headache of construction, said Chernov.\n\nA market for a “bargain” that will change the area forever\n\nDespite the widespread destruction, some buyers do want the fire damaged lots, with exclusive Realtor.com data showing that Pacific Palisades homes classified as destroyed averaged 73 days on the market — not far above the 66 days for all single-family residences.\n\nBut industry experts warn that those buying in will fundamentally change the region’s demographics. When the dust settles, an area of staggering wealth — one with perfect weather and spectacular views — will end up even wealthier, pushing more and more of Los Angeles’ middle class out.\n\nDownload The California Post App, follow us on social, and subscribe to our newsletters \n\nNot every home in the area was as lavish as an 18-bedroom mansion that appeared on “Succession,” which sold for $83 million in 2021 and burned down. There were dwellings in the $2 to $3 million range — but now with many owners listing their vacant lots, the new builds stand to be far more luxurious — and out of reach for most.\n\n“Places like Malibu and the Palisades remain uniquely compelling,” said Carl Gambino of the Gambino Group at Compass. “Scarcity ultimately drives demand.”\n\nAs for the many vacant lots for sale, some of which are unlisted, a typical “dirt value” is around $2 million.\n\nOne $2 million lot just north of Sunset Boulevard is advertised as presenting “a remarkable chance to build your dream home. . . with debris removal finished and the site ready for development, you can create anything from a forever residence to a tranquil coastal retreat.”\n\nBut, buyers be warned, because the listing also notes that they “should verify all rebuild feasibility, permits, utilities and lot lines with the City of Los Angeles and the appropriate agencies.”\n\nAn increasingly tall order, it seems, in the slightly-less-golden state.","summary":"The homeowners have detailed they how the lost millions of dollars in fires that left large swathes of the Palisades and Altadena looking like “post-war Hiroshima.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/28/real-estate/la-fire-victims-reveal-nightmare-scenario-of-red-tape-and-financial-ruin-one-year-on/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/palisades-comp-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yD2nBOpu-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:33:58","author":"Joyce Cohen,Mary K.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy ALISON BOSHOFF, EDITOR AT LARGE \n Published:00:57 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:29 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Hana Cross has backed out of plans for a tell-all interview about her time with him – and his family – after receiving 'mean messages'.\nHana, 27, was considering at least two offers to talk about what it was like to be a part of 'Brand Beckham'.\nShe and Brooklyn dated for nearly a year between 2018 and 2019 and she sat on the front row at Victoria Beckham fashion shows wearing Lady Beckham's designs.\nShe also went to family events, and was embraced by Gordon Ramsay and his family, who are close to the Beckhams.\nShe and Brooklyn split their time between their own wing of the family's barn in the Cotswolds and the former staff quarters at their home in Holland Park, London.\nPosh praised her on social media, and Hana posted pictures of Brooklyn's sister Harper bringing her Nutella pancakes in bed and called Cruz 'little bro'.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex-girlfriend Hana Cross has backed out of plans for a tell-all interview about her time with him, and his family, after receiving 'mean messages'\n\nThe model dated the chef for nearly a year between 2018 and 2019, sat on the front row at Victoria Beckham fashion shows and mimicked some of Victoria's best looks (pictured 2019)\nBut behind the scenes there were apparently serious issues both in her 'toxic' relationship with Brooklyn and between her and Brooklyn's family, as well as between Brooklyn and his family.\nA source says: 'Brooklyn was the black sheep of the family and that would have been her story. There were problems with him and the family even back then.\n'Hana wanted to tell her story but she had some heavy messages from the Brooklyn side warning her about being indiscreet, so she thought better of it.'\nThe story which she could tell would raise the possibility that the family schism isn't just due to a personal dislike between David and Victoria Beckham and Brooklyn's wife Nicola Peltz, which is what Brooklyn said in his explosive Instagram post.\nInstead it's thought that she would say that the Beckhams had issues with her and with Brooklyn long before Nicola came on the scene.\nWhen they split up, it was said that one source of friction was that Brooklyn had refused to get his girlfriend to sign a non-disclosure agreement or NDA, but that his parents had wanted her to do so.\nShe and Brooklyn appear to have met through the fashion business. At the time he was a budding fashion photographer, having dropped out of a course at the renowned Parsons School of Art in New York.\nShe had been modelling for five years and won a competition run by the cheap and cheerful clothes store New Look. From there, her star rose exponentially, with friendships formed with influential figures including the then-Vogue boss Edward Enninful.\n\nBehind the scenes there were apparently serious issues with her 'toxic' relationship with Brooklyn and his family\n\nDuring her relationship with Brooklyn, Hana supported Victoria at one of her fashion shows (the family are pictured alongside Anna Wintour)\n\nHana had previously copied many of Victoria's outfits during her romance with Brooklyn \n\nA source said: 'Hana wanted to tell her story but she had some heavy messages from the Brooklyn side warning her about being indiscreet, so she thought better of it'\nAn admiring profile in Glamour magazine (pre Brooklyn) noted that she had 'arguably the best brows in Britain'.\nShe says that if she ever has a 'down day' about herself she uses the mantra:' I am loved, I love my job, and tomorrow is another day.'\nShe told the mag that she left her 'naturally wild' eyebrows alone to 'do their own thing' and said she would never consider lip fillers or any other cosmetic tweaks.\nShe and Brooklyn were first spotted together in December 2018 at the British Fashion Awards afterparty. She spent Christmas and New Year hanging out with the Beckhams.\nBrooklyn and Hannah were at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park with Brooklyn's Cousin Libby Adams in February 2019.\nBut in March they had a bust-up after going to watch the English rock musician Yungblud perform at the Camden Assembly in North London.\nA witness said: 'Brooklyn had sunk a few beers and ended up getting into a row with Hana.\n'It had been a bit of a wild night out and it got a bit messy.\n'Brooklyn got really upset and ended up storming into the street. Hana read him the riot act and told him she didn't like it when he was acting up and drinking too much.'\nOn Valentine's Day in 2019, Brooklyn and Hana took a trip to Paris.\nBrooklyn shared a picture of the couple at the Eiffel Tower with caption: 'Me and my girl. Luckiest man in the world. Love you baby.' Hana followed suit writing : 'Thank you for making me the happiest girl in the world. I love you! Happy Valentine's Day xx' They also went to Victoria's fashion show.\nShe was Instagram pals with the whole Beckham bunch, including Gordon Ramsay's children and actress Liv Tyler, then the wife of David Beckham's best pal and bag carrier Dave Gardner.\nShe went with the Beckham children - and their security - to Coachella.\nIn an interview with Tatler magazine in 2019 Hana Cross said of Victoria Beckham: 'We talk about everything.' She was the only non-family member at Mrs Beckham's birthday that year.\nIn April there was an apparent row outside a restaurant, with Brooklyn's brother Romeo, then 16, putting his hand on her shoulder to try and calm things down.\nThe young couple adopted a Pomeranian puppy, Soho, but after rows at the Cannes film festival in May, finally split in July 2019.\nIt was reported that Victoria and David were delighted and that they had quietly suggested he end the relationship months earlier.\nBrooklyn reportedly had a fling with Rita Ora after they split.\n\nThe young couple adopted a Pomeranian puppy, Soho, but after rows at the Cannes film festival in May, finally split in July 2019 (pictured at the festival)\n\nWhile Hana tried to put on a friendly front with the Beckham clan, it was alleged in 2019 the family were thrilled when she and Brooklyn split\n\nIt raises the possibility that the family schism isn't just due to a personal dislike between the Beckhams and Brooklyn's wife Nicola Peltz (pictured), after the chef's bombshell statement\nMs Cross later released a single which appeared to refer to the relationship. She sang: 'I wish that someone told me you had a habit for dishonesty - though you break my heart, I want to stay.'\nAfter the split she dated Jude Law's son Rafferty and Jack Whitehall. In 2023 she wrote on Instagram: 'Sometimes you have to take a step back before you can move forward. I've been suffering with bad anxiety over the past few years and this is truly a place that has helped me mentally reset and grow.'\nBorn Hana Mahmood in Leeds, her mother, Sarah, nee Clamp, is the daughter of a retired salesman. She was working as a shop manager when she married Khalid Mahmood in November 1994.\nOn the wedding certificate, Khalid, then 37 and divorced, gives his occupation as 'shop proprietor'.\nAt the time of the wedding, he and Sarah were living together in Leeds in a modest three-bedroomed house which is currently said to be worth a modest £91,000.\nThey then moved to Huddersfield and as a young girl, daughter Hana attended the private Mount School in Huddersfield.\nLater the family - including older brother Haris - moved to Chipping Campden in Glos, where she went to the local state school from 2012 to 2016.\nShe left after GCSEs, it seems, to pursue her dreams of modelling stardom.\nBy the time she turned 21, Hana was a big enough noise to throw a birthday party for herself and her pals in a private room at Soho House.\nGordon RamsayHana CrossVictoria Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn's ex Hana Cross was 'pressured' into backing out of exposé on her year with the Beckhams amid family rift\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Starmer will also hold meetings on Thursday with Premier Li Qiang and China's top legislator, Zhao Leji.\n\nStarmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with China one of his priorities in the hope it can yield business opportunities.\n\nThe visit to China, the first by a British prime minister since 2018, comes amid tension between Britain and its longstanding close ally the United States over President Donald Trump's recent remarks, including threats to take control of Greenland.\n\nKerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King's College London, said he expected that a number of deals between Britain and China would be announced to show how their relationship has improved. \n\n\"This must look like it’s been a success,” he said. “For both sides, they don’t want a meeting which is going to be arguing about things they disagree on.\" \n\nEuropean and other Western countries have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy with China as they hedge against unpredictability from the United States under Trump.\n\nStarmer's visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, drawing Trump's ire.\n\nSEEKING A \"MATURE\" RELATIONSHIP\n\nStarmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after relations deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments when London restricted some Chinese investment over national security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.\n\nSpeaking to a delegation of business leaders hours after arriving in the country on Wednesday, Starmer said it was time for a “mature” relationship between Britain and the world’s second-biggest economy. \n\nIn a sign of how the countries can work together, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce that Britain and China would work together to tackle the gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants. \n\nThe deal will be focused on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats being used to transport people across Europe to claim asylum. \n\nBritish and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street.\n\nStarmer told reporters on the plane to China that he will “raise the issues that need to be raised” on human rights with Xi when asked if he will bring up the case of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes.\n\nBut the presence of more than 50 business leaders accompanying Starmer and his itinerary shows the priority for this trip is economic ties.\n\n\"Everything you're doing here, everything I'm doing here is focused on how do we benefit people at home,\" he told the business leaders on Wednesday.

Wednesday. The bloc is actively looking at taking more from Canada, Qatar and North African countries, he said.Trump’s promise to “own” Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, and his threats to countries that try to impede his efforts have forced Europe to reassess its ties to the US across a range of sectors, including defense and energy.

That tariff threat was later dropped, but it left many Europeans unsettled and anxious about the future of Transatlantic trade.\n\nU.S. officials remain frustrated that the EU has not enacted the tariff reductions it promised as part of a framework ⁠trade deal reached with Washington in July.\n\nThose concerns were heightened this week when Mr. Trump raised duties on imports from South Korea to 25% ​from 15%, citing slow moves by the country's parliament to implement a framework trade agreement reached ⁠with Washington last year.\n\nMr. Bessent defended Mr. Trump's action, saying it was \"helpful to get things moved along\", adding that the South Korean parliament needed to ratify the trade deal.\n\nMr. Trump on Tuesday (January 27) said he expected the United States ​and South Korea to work out a solution, but he did not elaborate. South Korean officials are ⁠due to arrive in Washington on Wednesday (January 28) for talks with trade officials.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bessent-says-disappointed-by-eu-india-deal-south-korea-must-ratify-trade-deal/article70563645.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/44ou54/article70563653.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_88404.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:19:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":397162534,"title":"Israel buries the last captive recovered from Gaza","text":"The last Israeli captive ​recovered from Gaza has been buried at a funeral attended by hundreds of mourners which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ended a \"painful\" chapter in ⁠Israel's history. Ran Gvili, an off-duty police officer, was killed fighting Hamas militants who attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023. His remains were taken back to the Gaza Strip by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, Israeli officials say. Of the about 250 people abducted that day, Gvili was the last to be released either dead or alive, and he was buried in his hometown of Meitar in southern Israel on Wednesday, local time. His casket was driven ‌to the funeral ​in a procession beginning in Camp Shura, a facility where Israel identified victims of the October 2023 attack. Police and ‍civilians carrying Israeli flags lined parts of the route. \"The burial of Ran Gvili brings an end to the painful reality of the existence of Israeli hostages in the Gaza Strip, all of them, living and fallen,\" Netanyahu said in a eulogy at the funeral. Israeli President Isaac Herzog also delivered a eulogy at the funeral. He said the entire nation mourned Gvili, who was 24 when he died, and \"the shattered fragments of our hearts can slowly ​begin to gather toward healing and repair\". Gvili's aunt Harel Plachinsky saw the return of her nephew's remains and burial as a moment of closure. \"This is some kind of ending the ‍war ... and I think that the seventh of October is ending today,\" she said. Gvili was one ‌of about 1200 people killed in the attack, which set off the war in Gaza. Palestinian health authorities say Israel has killed more than 71,000 Palestinians during the conflict. Many of ​the hostages were released during two short ceasefires, but dozens died in captivity. Under the terms of an October deal brokered by US ‍President Donald Trump, Hamas and other groups agreed to return the remaining hostages, alive or dead, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. The return of the last hostage and his burial marks a moment of national healing for Israelis. The Hamas ​attack, ​the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely ​seen as the most traumatic event in the nation's history. It also completes ​a core aspect of the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war. The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier in January, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel will reopen the border crossing in both directions, allowing Palestinians to enter and leave the territory after nearly two years of closure. Netanyahu did not say when the Rafah crossing would open, but did say it would be limited to foot traffic and not be used for cargo, adding Israel won't \"prevent anyone from leaving\". He said his focus was now on disarming Hamas and destroying its remaining tunnels, and there would be no reconstruction in Gaza without demilitarisation. \"As I agreed with President Trump, there are only two possibilities: either it will be done the easy way or it will be done the hard way,\" he said at a news conference. \"In any case, it will happen.\" Netanyahu also reiterated his stance that Turkish and Qatari soldiers will not be allowed to participate in an international security force in Gaza and his opposition to a Palestinian state. He vowed that Israel would retain permanent security control from the Jordan border to the Mediterranean Sea.

A key test for further gains will be the path for interest rates after the Fed's latest policy decision, which refrained from signaling any imminent resumption of rate cuts amid a solid economy.“The Fed song remains the same — lower interest rates may be coming, but investors will have to remain patient,” said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “With signs of stabilization in the labor market and inflation holding steady, the Fed is in position to play the wait-and-see game.”The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.24% in early Asian trading after Fed Chair Jerome Powell refrained from signaling any imminent resumption of rate cuts amid a solid economy.The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 to hold the benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 3.5%-3.75%. Governors Christopher Waller and Stephen Miran dissented in favor of a quarter-point reduction.Just two dissents underscored how tight the consensus is, which means any new Fed Chair that comes in after Powell's term is up will have a hard time convincing other officials that rates need to go much lower, according to Sonu Varghese at Carson Group.“The message: the Fed is comfortable on pause at 3.5% to 3.75% and could stay there for a while as it looks to confirm that the labor market is in the process of stabilizing, police the tariff-driven inflation peak still to come and assess the impact of fiscal stimulus from coming tax refunds,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.Elsewhere, President Trump's pick to chair the Fed could be announced “in the next week or so,” Bessent said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.Corporate Highlights:Microsoft's spending surged to a record high and cloud sales growth slowed, sending the shares down amid investor concerns that it could take longer than expected for the company's AI investments to pay off.Meta's robust advertising business, which boosted its current-quarter outlook above estimates, is making it possible for the company to invest at record levels on artificial intelligence this year.Samsung's chip unit blew past expectations with a more than five-fold profit gain in the December quarter, boosted by an artificial intelligence boom, and announced a $2.5 billion buyback.Amazon.com Inc. is cutting 16,000 corporate jobs in an effort to remove layers of bureaucracy and “increase ownership,” becoming the latest company to target managers for layoffs in recent years.Tesla Inc. revealed plans to invest $2 billion into Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, while reporting higher-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter.Home Depot Inc. is cutting jobs across several teams and requiring corporate staff to return to the office, as the world's largest home-improvement retailer contends with a slowdown in business caused by the frozen housing market.StocksS&P 500 futures fell 0.3% as of 9:04 a.m. Tokyo timeHang Seng futures fell 0.9%Japan's Topix fell 0.7%Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.6%Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 1%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%The euro rose 0.2% to $1.1972The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 153.10 per dollarThe offshore yuan was little changed at 6.9419 per dollarThe Australian dollar fell 0.1% to $0.7032CryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 0.3% to $89,014.76Ether fell 0.5% to $3,001.7BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.24%Australia's 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.77%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.5% to $63.52 a barrelSpot gold rose 1.2% to $5,482.86 an ounce","url":"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/global-stock-market-news-january-29-dow-jones-nikkei-hang-seng-s-and-p-500-nasdaq-10903725","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-01/8r9m1g6_stock-market-1_625x300_29_January_26.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1080,height=607","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:18:29","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":397158140,"title":"Trump-appointed acting cyber chief uploaded sensitive files to public version of ChatGPT","text":"Washington, DC [US], January 29 (ANI): The interim head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) uploaded sensitive contracting files into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering automated security alerts designed to prevent the disclosure of government material, Politico reported, citing four Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials familiar with the matter.According to Politico, the incident involved acting CISA director Madhu Gottumukkala, who sought special approval from the agency's Office of the Chief Information Officer to use ChatGPT shortly after joining CISA in May, at a time when the tool remained blocked for most DHS employees.Although none of the documents were classified, officials said the material included contracting files marked \"for official use only\", a designation applied to sensitive government information not intended for public release.Cybersecurity monitoring systems later detected the uploads in August, with multiple alerts recorded during the first week alone, Politico reported. Following the detection, senior DHS leadership initiated an internal review to assess whether the disclosures had compromised government security, though the outcome of that review remains unclear.After the activity was flagged, Gottumukkala met senior DHS leaders to review what had been uploaded. Politico reported that then-acting DHS general counsel Joseph Mazzara and DHS chief information officer Antoine McCord participated in evaluating potential risks to the department. Gottumukkala also held meetings in August with CISA CIO Robert Costello and chief counsel Spencer Fisher regarding the incident and the proper handling of sensitive material.In response to the episode, CISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said in a statement emailed to Politico that Gottumukkala \"was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place\", adding that \"this use was short-term and limited\". She also said the agency remained committed to \"harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernisation and deliver on\" Trump's executive order aimed at removing barriers to US leadership in artificial intelligence.\n\nMcCarthy further stated, \"Acting Director Dr Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorised temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA's security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.\"Politico reported that any information entered into the public version of ChatGPT is shared with OpenAI and may be used to help generate responses for other users. By contrast, AI tools approved for DHS staff, including the agency's internal chatbot DHSChat, are configured to prevent data from leaving federal systems.One official told Politico, \"Gottumukkala forced CISA's hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it.\"Federal employees receive training on handling sensitive material, and DHS policy requires investigations into the \"cause and affect\" of any exposure of official-use documents, including whether disciplinary action is warranted. Measures can range from retraining to more serious consequences such as suspension or revocation of security clearance, officials said.Gottumukkala, currently the most senior political official at CISA, has led the agency in an acting role since May, following his appointment by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Politico noted that Donald Trump's nominee to permanently lead CISA, Sean Plankey, remains stalled after his confirmation was blocked last year.The report also detailed that Gottumukkala's tenure has been marked by controversy. Earlier this summer, at least six career employees were placed on leave following an \"unsanctioned\" counterintelligence polygraph that Gottumukkala requested. During Congressional testimony last week, he told Rep. Bennie Thompson that he did not \"accept the premise of that characterization.\"Separately, Politico reported that Gottumukkala attempted to remove Costello from his post last week, a move that was halted after intervention by other political appointees at the agency.

He was later revealed to be a serial killer.\nNow, Helen has opened up about being made to film 'sexualised' scenes with a 'much older man' while she was so young. \n'Was it morally right that I was expected to parade about in my knickers like some mad nymphomaniac when I was still just a teenager?' she told The Mirror. \n\nCorrie star Helen Flanagan has criticised the soap for making her 'parade around in knickers like a mad nymphomaniac' and 'kiss a much older man' aged just 16 years old (Seen in 2024)\n\nWhen Helen was 16, her then-15-year-old character Rosie was groomed by teacher John Stape (Graeme Hawley), before being kidnapped and held hostage by him (Pictured on the soap)\n'Alison King, who plays Carla Connor, once kicked off in the green room, saying how disgusting it was that they were sexualising me when I was a young girl. \n'I didn't fully comprehend what she was talking about at the time - I do now, I get it.

I'd come back, but they obviously haven't,' she told The Sun.\nEarlier this year, Helen teased an epic return to the ITV soap and has even hinted at her first storyline. \n\nNow, Helen has opened up about being made to film 'sexualised' scenes with a 'much older man' while she was so young (pictured in 2008 aged 18)\n\nThe former Coronation Street actress, 35, who is best known for playing Rosie Webster on the cobbles, made her first appearance in 2000 (Seen in 2003)\n\nHelen said: 'Alison King, who plays Carla Connor (Pictured right), once kicked off in the green room, saying how disgusting it was that they were sexualising me when I was a young girl'\nCorrie fans are desperate to know if the actress would ever return, and she told The Mirror: 'I would love to go back to back to Coronation Street.' \nShe explained that being based in Bolton would mean that she would be able to work around her kids - Matilda, nine, Delilah Six, and Charlie, three. \nThe actress has even thought up a storyline that Rosie could take part in if she did make a comeback. \n\n Helen Flanagan says she is ready to make a Coronation Street return seven years on from soap exit \nHelen said: 'A single mum with a real storyline, with two kids that she dumps with Sally to have her Rovers return play out an iconic barmaid role.' \nHelen's comments come after she lifted the lid on her 'throuple' with David Haye.\nShe grabbed headlines after lifting the lid on her 'throuple' with the former heavyweight boxer, 45, in her upcoming book.\nHelen and David enjoyed a brief romance after she split from her ex-fiancé Scott Sinclair, 36, with whom she shares three children - Matilda, 10, Delilah, seven, and Charlie, four. \nThe pair first met when they both appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2012, but did not reconnect for a decade.\n\nThey crossed paths again when Helen bumped into David at an awards ceremony in autumn 2022, before he later reached out after seeing a lingerie shoot she had done for Ann Summers. \nHelen's revelations about her throuple with David come after she recently hit out at footballer Scott for failing to attend their son's nativity, despite the fact that she spent Christmas apart from her three children. \nRecent reports also revealed Helen reportedly told David to dump his girlfriend, Sian Osborne, for her during their toxic relationship.\nA source told The Sun on Sunday: 'Helen wanted David to leave Sian for her. She was mad about David and desperately wanted him to herself.\n'But David cares deeply for Sian, and he was simply never going to leave her for Helen.

Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the central bank announced its decision that the economy's outlook “has clearly improved since the last meeting” in December, a development that he noted should boost hiring over time. The Fed also said in a statement that there were signs the job market is stabilizing. With the economy growing at a healthy pace and the unemployment rate appearing to level off, Fed officials likely see little reason to rush any further rate cuts. While most policymakers do expect to reduce borrowing costs further this year, many want to see evidence that stubbornly-elevated inflation is moving closer to the central bank’s target of 2%. ALSO READWhy did Europe ignore India tariffs?: Bessent says US very disappointed over ‘mother of all deal’ US Federal Reserve keeps rates at 3.6% as Powell highlights tariff impact According to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation was 2.8% in November, slightly higher than a year ago. Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said that Powell kept the door open for further rate cuts this year, “when they get enough evidence inflation is decelerating.” Powell suggested in his remarks that the impact of tariffs, which have pushed up the cost of many goods such as furniture, appliances and toys, will peak in the middle of this year and inflation will fall after that. In a sign of the unprecedented situation in which the Fed finds itself in Trump’s second term, Powell was asked to address a number of issues not directly tied to monetary policy but that could very well decide how the Fed implements its policy going forward. Two officials dissented from Wednesday's decision, with Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller preferring another quarter-point reduction. President Donald Trump appointed Miran in September, and he had dissented at the three previous meetings in favor of a half-point cut. Waller is under consideration by the White House to replace Powell, whose term ends in May. The Fed’s decision to stand pat will likely fuel further criticism from Trump, who has relentlessly assailed Powell for not sharply cutting short-term rates. A reduction in the Fed's key rate tends to lower borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing, though those rates are also influenced by market forces. A key issue facing the Fed is how long it will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee has been split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring. ALSO READWho is Madhu Gottumukkala? Indian-origin US cyber defence head uploaded sensitive docs on ChatGPT Powell suggested that there may not be that many more rate cuts needed. The economy's solid 4.4% annual growth rate in the July-September quarter, the most recent data available, is a sign that interest rates aren't so high that they are noticeably slowing growth, he added. ‘Economy Surprised Us’: Fed holds rates, Powell points to tariffs and jobs In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee's meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year. Most economists forecast the Fed will cut twice this year, most likely at the June meeting or later.One issue still overhanging the Fed's decision-making is the administration's trade policy and the tariffs it has imposed on many U.S. trade partners. When asked if the impact of tariffs had already moved through inflation, Powell said “a lot of it has,” and added that the Fed generally sees the import taxes as a one-time price increase.“The expectation is that we will see the effects of tariffs flowing through goods prices peaking and then starting to come down, assuming there are no new major tariff increases,” Powell said. Fed officials met this week in the shadow of unprecedented pressure from the Trump White House. Powell said Jan. 11 that the Fed had received subpoenas from the Justice Department as part of a criminal investigation into his congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion building renovation. Powell in an unusually blunt video statement said the subpoenas were a pretext to punish the Fed for not cutting rates more quickly. On Wednesday, Powell declined to add anything to that earlier statement. And last week, the Supreme Court took up Trump's attempt from last year to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed’s 112-year history. The justices at an oral argument appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved. When asked why he decided to attend the Supreme Court hearing, Powell said, “I would say that that this case is perhaps the most important legal case\" in the Fed’s history. \"And as I thought about it, I thought, it might be hard to explain why I didn’t attend.”When asked by reporters if he was confident the Fed can retain its independence, Powell said, “Yes,” and added, “I’m strongly committed to that and so are my colleagues.”Trump has suggested he is close to naming a new Fed Chair, to replace Powell once his term ends in May. The announcement could come as soon as this week, though it has been delayed before. The president’s efforts to pressure the Fed may have backfired, economists say, as Republicans in the Senate have voiced support for Powell and threatened to block Trump’s replacement chair. Powell has the option of remaining as a Fed governor beyond May but told reporters he hadn’t made a decision about whether to stay or leave. The chair was also asked if he had any advice for his successor. “Don’t get involved in elected politics,\" he said. “Don’t do it.” As for interest rates, Wall Street expected the Fed to hold steady at least until June. Twelve of the 19 members of the Fed's rate-setting committee have a vote, including all seven members of the board of governors, the president of the New York Fed, and a rotating group of four presidents from the regional Fed banks. This year, Beth Hammack, president of the Cleveland Fed; Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed; Lorie Logan, president of the Dallas Fed; and Anna Paulson, president of the Philadelphia Fed, will vote on rate decisions. All have recently expressed some skepticism of the need for further cuts in the immediate future.With businesses barely adding jobs, consumers remain gloomy about the economy. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence dropped to an 11-year low in January, the business research group said Tuesday. Powell noted that while consumers are pessimistic in surveys, they are still spending at a healthy pace, helping propel the economy.\"The economy has once again surprised us with its strength,\" Powell said. “Consumer spending, although it’s uneven across income categories, (the) overall numbers are good.\"","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/key-takeaways-from-the-fed-meeting-what-powells-comments-mean-for-rate-cuts/4122779/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/Powell-Reuters_20251225115849.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:16:19","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":397162662,"title":"John Cornyn’s Campaign Uses Very Tactic He Called ‘Phony’ The Same Day","text":"Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn criticized the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in campaign advertising on Monday — the same day his campaign rolled out an AI-fueled attack ad of its own.\n\nTexas’ GOP Senate candidates are turning to AI to knock their opponents ahead of the fast-approaching March 3 primary with Attorney General Ken Paxton’s campaign releasing an attack ad using AI-generated images of Cornyn on Jan. 16. When asked by CBS Texas about Paxton’s AI-powered ad on Monday, Cornyn called the fake content “absolutely silly” and “pathetic” while suggesting the presence of AI in campaign advertising undermines a candidate’s message. (RELATED: John Cornyn Unveils Legislation To Slap Penalties On Anti-ICE Agitators Following Renee Good Protests)\n\n“If people see a phony ad made by artificial intelligence, what that means to me is they must think well, the whole thing’s phony, including the message,” Cornyn told the outlet.\n\nHowever the same day, the Cornyn campaign unveiled a 30-second digital ad — filled with AI-generated content — torching Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt, the third Republican candidate in the race.\n\nIn Cornyn’s video, a fake rendering of Hunt — who is running an insurgent campaign against the incumbent — is seen accompanying an AI-generated Pomeranian in various scenes created by AI. Included in the digital ad are several claims that Hunt is insufficiently conservative with the spot’s narrator repeating the catchphrase “that dog won’t hunt.”\n\nThere is no disclaimer that AI-generated content appears in the 30-second video.\n\nAsked to respond to Cornyn’s comment suggesting that AI-generated ads are “phony,” the Cornyn campaign repeated many of the talking points bashing Hunt that appear in the video.\n\n“The only thing phony is Wesley Hunt claiming to be a MAGA Republican despite his record showing voting for Hillary in 2008, refusing to vote for Trump in 2016, consistently supporting DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] policies on two nonprofit boards, and a recent report showing his Chief of Staff spending $500/night for hotel rooms at taxpayer expense,” Cornyn campaign spokesman Matt Mackowiak said in a statement.\n\nMackowiak’s statement referred to prior DCNF reporting probing Hunt’s membership on multiple boards that advanced DEI and gender ideology policies prior to his congressional career. Hunt has been a staunch opponent of “woke” issues during his two terms in the House.\n\nHunt, 44, told the DCNF he found the use of AI in most ads to be “pretty entertaining.”\n\n“I would actually encourage Senator Cornyn to start using more AI, as it’ll help him,” Hunt added. “For the first time in years, it makes him look younger.”\n\nCornyn, 73, is running for a fifth Senate term. Hunt officially entered the primary in early October after teasing a run for months. Paxton, 63, has been campaigning for the seat since April 2025.\n\nAI-generated attack ads are becoming increasingly commonplace in major races, though videos using AI content usually come with a disclaimer. However, campaigns in Texas are under no legal obligation to label AI-generated content.\n\nPaxton’s 39-second spot depicts fake renderings of Cornyn and Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who is trailing in her own Senate primary, as dance partners while performing the “Senate Swing” and the “Washington Waltz.” The AI-generated video is interwoven with real comments Paxton’s opponents have made complimenting each other, though Cornyn has repeatedly criticized Crockett.\n\nThe Paxton ad includes a message in minuscule font at the end stating, “Certain video content depicted in this advertising was generated by artificial intelligence and is satire that does not represent real events.”\n\nThe Republican primary has grown increasingly nasty with just over a month until election day. With no candidate polling close to 50%, the three-way primary contest is expected to head to a May run-off election during which the top two vote-getters would advance. President Donald Trump, whose endorsement can often sway the results of GOP primaries, has yet to back a candidate in the race.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The killing came just weeks after another federal agent fatally shot a mother of three, Renee Good, in the same city.\nThe Overfelt Folklorico La Raza dance group performs as Overfelt High School students and some community members protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the corner of South King Road and Story Road in San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026.

Meyer/Bay Area News Group) \nHolding signs reading “No one is illegal on stolen land,” and “ICE melts in California,” hundreds of Overfelt High School students in San Jose walked out of school Wednesday afternoon, many of them chanting “No ICE! No wall! Free the families, free them all.”\nNearby residents stood outside the front of their homes in shows of support as the walkout proceeded to the intersection of King and Story on San Jose’s east side, with drummers accompanying them. Some attendees waved American or Mexican flags.\n\nFootage from ABC7’s helicopter also showed hundreds of students staging a walkout on Hesperian Boulevard in San Leandro.\nKeyontae Slayton, a 16-year-old Overfelt student, said railed against the tactics used by ICE of late, and decried the shooting of Pretti over the weekend.\n“What’s happening with ICE right now is not right at all,” Slayton said. “It really is truly, really bad that people are actually accepting this and thinking this is right.”\nOverfelt High School students and some community members leave the high school as they protest U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Jose, Calif., on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JOHN SIDDLE \n Published:00:50 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:13 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nA lottery winner battered his girlfriend on their first holiday abroad to celebrate his £3.6million jackpot - then posed poolside with a bottle of fizz just hours after being convicted.\nSean Henderson attacked Suzanne Childs in a drunken rage at a luxury Tenerife hotel booked to celebrate his life-changing win last month.\nThe carpenter, from Ilfracombe, Devon, grabbed Ms Childs, 42, by the arm, hurled her against a wall and forced her to the ground during the attack at the five-star GF Gran Costa Adeje resort.\nA Spanish court heard Ms Childs was left with painful bruising to her arm and knee, as well as injuries to her head and face in the attack last Thursday.\nOn Monday, Henderson was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay compensation.\nIncredibly, after being spared jail on his birthday, the woman-beater shared a Facebook post clutching a bottle of sparking wine poolside, captioned: 'Happy 40th to me!!'.\nThe brazen post was cryptically set to a cover of The Rolling Stones track 'I'm Free'.\nMs Childs, a designer who has three daughters from a previous relationship, said the assault had left her fearing for her life.\n\nSean Henderson attacked Suzanne Childs in a drunken rage at a luxury Tenerife hotel booked to celebrate his life-changing win last month\n\nThe carpenter, from Ilfracombe, Devon, grabbed Ms Childs, 42, by the arm, hurled her against a wall and forced her to the ground during the attack at the five-star GF Gran Costa Adeje resort\n\nA Spanish court heard Ms Childs was left with painful bruising to her arm and knee, as well as injuries to her head and face in the attack last Thursday\n 'I honestly thought he was going to kill me,' she said.\n'When he first got off the sofa I could see how angry he was and I knew I needed to run straight away.\n'He caught me, grabbed my arm and threw me head-first into the wall.\n'I was absolutely petrified. The force of my head hitting the wall made me fear I'd fractured my skull or suffered brain damage.\n'There was blood and broken glass everywhere, I practically crawled out of the room.'\nThe couple had travelled abroad together for the first time to celebrate Henderson's National Lottery Set For Life win, which he landed on December 23.\nThe jackpot means the remorseless thug will receive £10,000 a month for the next 30 years.\nMs Childs said: 'When he won, I thought, \"this is amazing - what a great life we're going to have together\".\n'But it was like a switch flipped and the real Sean came out.\n'His behaviour changed, his attitude towards me changed. It felt like the money fed his ego and he didn't need me anymore.\n\nOn Monday, Henderson was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay compensation\n\nAfter being spared jail on his birthday, Henderson shared a Facebook post clutching a bottle of sparking wine poolside, captioned: 'Happy 40th to me!!'\n'He was verbally horrible the first night. Then two days later it turned physical.\n'We'd been drinking and he was very drunk. He was saying horrible things for ages - like I was a scrounger who was only with him for the money.\n'I got out of bed and went over to try and calm things down. Some water from my glass splashed on him and he just exploded.\n'I saw how angry he was and started running away, but he chased me, grabbed my arm and threw me head-first into the wall.\n'There were no apologies, no sorries. He just said, \"I didn't mean to do that.\" He doesn't give a s***.\n'I could have fractured my skull.'\nHenderson appeared at the Violence Against Women Section of the Court of First Instance of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. \nCourt documents state that on January 22 at around 9.30pm in Room 286 of the hotel, Henderson seized Ms Childs by the arm, threw her against the wall and to the ground, striking her head, knee and upper lip.\nShe was left with a painful bruise on the inside of her right arm, a bruise over her left kneecap and facial injuries. She also suffered a cut to her thumb.\nMs Childs managed to flee the room and reach the lift, where another couple came to her aid.\nHotel staff called police and an ambulance, and Henderson was arrested.\nHe spent 48 hours in custody before appearing in court, where he confessed to 'gender-based assault' - the equivalent of domestic violence in the UK.\n\nThe jackpot means the remorseless thug will receive £10,000 a month for the next 30 years\nProsecutors had demanded an immediate nine-month jail term, but Henderson was given suspended sentence - common in Spain where prison sentences of two years or less are normally deferred for first-time offenders.\nAuthorities also imposed a restraining order preventing him from returning to the hotel, coming within 500m of Ms Childs or travelling on the same flight home.\nShe returned to Britain alone on January 27.\nMs Childs, also from Ilfracombe, has since reported the assault to Devon and Cornwall Police.\nVideo recorded shortly before the assault shows Henderson unleashing a foul-mouthed tirade at Ms Childs, calling her a 'vile c***', branding her a 'scrounger' and telling her 'I've paid for every f***ing thing'.\nHe also drunkenly sneered: 'You can't win the money and not be a c***,' and told her: 'Go and find someone else who you think is amazing.'\nMs Childs revealed there had been warning signs earlier in the relationship, including shouting and hurtful comments, but this was the first time he had been physically violent towards her.\nShe said: 'Winning the money just seemed to set him off. It boosted his ego into the stratosphere.'\nHenderson had recently spoken publicly about his lottery win, telling how he only bought the winning ticket after being unable to park at Lidl and popping into a Co-op instead.\nThe father said at the time that the prize had 'changed my life forever', adding that he planned to celebrate with the five-star Canary Islands holiday, buy a house, treat his son to a PlayStation 5 and enjoy meals out with family.\nHe also said he intended to keep working as a carpenter, but with more flexibility.\nMs Childs said she had no hesitation in ending the relationship.\nShe added: 'There's not enough money in the world to stay with someone who's abusive. I'd rather be with someone dirt poor and kind than rich and violent.\n'Sean's ego was already there. Then the cash arrived and it sent his narcissism into overdrive.\n'I just want people to know what a nasty person he is.\n'Hopefully it will stop this happening to another woman who might be drawn in by his wealth.'\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLottery winner battered his girlfriend in a drunken rage on Tenerife holiday to celebrate him scooping £3.6million jackpot\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy ASHLEIGH GRAY \n Published:00:24 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:10 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nPaul Dano has finally reacted to the swipe Quentin Tarantino made about his acting abilities.\nIn December 2025 the 62-year-old director appeared on an episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast and described Dano, 41, as a 'flaw' in 2007's Oscar-winning movie There Will Be Blood.\nHe went on to say that the actor is 'just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy.'\nAnd when host Ellis reasoned that Daniel Day-Lewis' performance may have simply 'overshadowed' Dano's, Tarantino doubled down: 'So you put him with the weakest male actor in SAG? The limpest dick in the world?'\nAt the Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday, Dano shared how he felt about various famous actors coming to his defense in the wake of the unflattering comments.\n'I was incredibly grateful that the world spoke up for me so I didn't have to,' he said, per Variety.\n\nPaul Dano has finally reacted to the swipe Quentin Tarantino made about his acting abilities; pictured on January 13\n\nIn December 2025 the 62-year-old director appeared on an episode of The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast and described Dano, 41, as a 'flaw' in 2007's Oscar-winning movie There Will Be Blood\nDano's Little Miss Sunshine co-star Toni Collette was by his side on Wednesday as she also gave her unfiltered reaction to Tarantino's unsavory remarks. \n'F**k that guy!' the 53-year-old actress said. 'He must've been high. It was just confusing. Who does that?'\n\n George Clooney blasts Quentin Tarantino's 'cruel' insults of 'weak' Paul Dano, Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson \nOf Collette coming to his defense, Dano said, 'That was really nice.'\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Dayton labeled Tarantino's takedown – which extended to actors Matthew Lillard and Owen Wilson – an 'embarrassment.'\nHe mused: 'I can only think that his rawness of his performance made Tarantino uncomfortable.'\nAnd Little Miss Sunshine co-director Valerie Faris said, 'You know, what was interesting was the people coming out to defend Paul. There was immediately… he is loved by so many. He is so smart.'\nDano has earned a spot among the most distinguished stars in entertainment, appearing in The Fabelmans, The Batman, Prisoners, and Love & Mercy among others. \nHis accolades include a BAFTA Best Supporting Actor nod for There Will Be Blood, a Golden Globe nomination and two Emmy nominations.\n\nTarantino said the actor, pictured with Daniel Day Lewis in 2007, is 'just such a weak, weak, uninteresting guy' \n\nDano's Little Miss Sunshine co-star Toni Collette was by his side at Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday as she also gave her unfiltered reaction to Tarantino's unsavory remarks, saying, 'F**k that guy!'; pictured in December\n\nDay-Lewis came to the defense of his There Will Be Blood co-star Dano following Tarantino's criticism.\nAfter a fan-run Daniel Day-Lewis Instagram account posted, 'Paul Dano is one of the best and most talented actors of his generation,' a rep for the retired star told The Guardian he 'endorsed the sentiment.'\nThe Batman director Matt Reeves joined the conversation, declaring on X in December: 'Paul Dano is an incredible actor, and an incredible person.'\nAnd Escape at Dannemora director Ben Stiller used the app to add: 'idk man i think paul dano is an incredible actor.'\nTarantino added during the controversial podcast appearance: 'I'm not saying he's giving a terrible performance. I'm saying he's giving a non-entity [performance]. \n'I don't care for him. I don't care for Owen Wilson, I don't care for Matthew Lillard.'\nSundance Film FestivalQuentin Tarantino\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPaul Dano FINALLY addresses Quentin Tarantino's 'weakest actor' jibe amid mass Hollywood backlash\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 19\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Josh Shapiro said that in his view, Vice President JD Vance has “offered comfort” to people on the right who espouse anti-Jewish views, as the Republican Party navigates an ongoing intra-coalition feud over antisemitism. Vance faced criticism for not mentioning Jews in a post on X commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day. “Today we remember the millions of lives lost during the Holocaust, the millions of stories of individual bravery and heroism, and one of the enduring lessons of one of the darkest chapters in human history: that while humans create beautiful things and are full of compassion, we’re also capable of unspeakable brutality,” Vance wrote. The post included photos of him standing beneath Hebrew words translating to “Never Forget” during a visit last year to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany, where he was given a tour by a 97-year-old Holocaust survivor. “And we promise never again to go down the darkest path.” Shapiro, a 2028 Democratic presidential contender, said in an interview Tuesday that he had not yet seen Vance’s post. But he also said he did not think it was surprising that Vance’s post did not explicitly include Jews given his handling of the issue of right-wing antisemitism. “Remember that the reason why we memorialize the Holocaust on this day, really, essentially, is to never forget,” said Shapiro, a practicing Jew who has centered his faith in his public life. “And the reason you want to never forget is so that we never live through that atrocity again. Part of never forgetting is making sure that the facts of what happened are recited, are remembered. The fact that JD Vance couldn’t bring himself to acknowledging that 6 million Jews were killed by Hitler and by the Nazis speaks volumes. “It is not a surprise to me, however, given the way in which he has openly supported the AfD party, given the way he openly embraces neo-Nazis and neo-Nazi political parties, given the way in which he has offered comfort, really, to the antisemites on the right who are infecting the Republican Party,” Shapiro continued. “So it’s not a shock to me that he would omit that, but it’s a sad day that the vice president of the United States on Holocaust Awareness Day couldn’t address that.” Shapiro is on a book tour for his newly released memoir, “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” published this week. It is the latest example of his taking sharp aim at Vance, like a number of other potential Democratic presidential contenders who could face Vance in the 2028 election. Shapiro has described Vance as a “sycophant” who “does whatever he thinks his boss wants him to do.” Critics on the left and the right took aim at Vance’s comments for not specifically mentioning the Jewish lives lost. Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered about 6 million Jews across Europe during the Holocaust, roughly two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population, in addition to hundreds of thousands of Roma, disabled people and political dissidents. Tablet Magazine, a conservative-leaning publication focused on Jewish issues, said on X that Vance offered a “unique commemoration of the Holocaust that manages to avoid mentioning Jews or condemning Nazis.” Halie Soifer, CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, wrote that it “takes effort” on Vance’s part “to issue a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement like this without any mention of six million Jews lost, the Jewish people, Nazis, or the issue of antisemitism.” And Laura Loomer, a close ally of President Donald Trump whom Vance criticized last week, when he accused her of stoking division on the right, said on X: “6 million Jewish lives.” Vance allies, including Sam Markstein, national political director for the Republican Jewish Coalition, came to his defense, saying critics were reading too much into his post. Others pointed to Shapiro’s own X post recognizing Holocaust remembrance, which made note of rising antisemitism but did not explicitly mention Jewish lives lost, a leading criticism of Vance’s post. “This is an insane standard and a BS attack,” wrote Alex Brusewitz, a former Trump campaign official. “The Vice President literally posted a photo of himself [and] the Second Lady at Dachau. He has been an incredible friend to both the Jewish community and Israel.” In the early days of his first term in the White House, Trump was also criticized for having issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day statement that did not explicitly mention Jews. Trump’s White House statements every year he has been in office since then have done so, including Tuesday’s. The issue of antisemitism has roiled the right in recent months, with Vance facing pressure to take a strong stand. Some leaders, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have warned of a rise in antisemitism within the Republican Party’s coalition, singling out younger conservatives and right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson, a close Vance ally, for having hosted a Holocaust denier on his podcast. Vance says there is not such a buildup. “Do I think that the Republican Party is substantially more antisemitic than it was 10 or 15 years ago? Absolutely not,” he told NBC News last year. “In any bunch of apples, you have bad people. But my attitude on this is we should be firm in saying antisemitism and racism is wrong. ... I think it’s kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic.” In an interview with UnHerd, Vance said Nick Fuentes, a right-wing activist known for espousing antisemitic views, “can eat s---,” adding, “Antisemitism, and all forms of ethnic hatred, have no place in the conservative movement.” In the same interview, he said Fuentes’ influence is “overstated by people who want to avoid having a foreign-policy conversation about America’s relationship with Israel.” Vance’s office declined to comment for this article. For Shapiro, observance of his Jewish faith is a through line in his memoir, and he writes about its playing a significant role in his upbringing and throughout his political career. “Throughout my life, it has always been central to who I am,” Shapiro said in the interview, adding: “I’m as proud of my faith and who I am as I was when I was a little boy. I know that things have changed around me. I know that antisemitism is on the rise, but it certainly has not changed how I go about being the person that I am every day, how Lori and I raise our four children and our commitment to our faith.” Shapiro, who recently announced his re-election campaign, has focused on combating political violence in recent months, after the assassination attempt on Trump in his state in 2024 and, last year, the firebombing of his official residence hours after his family gathered for a Passover seder. Cody Balmer, who pleaded guilty to committing the attack, dialed 911 soon after the fire and said he was angered by Shapiro’s stance on Israel and Gaza. Shapiro wrote extensively about that episode in his memoir, detailing a call he got from Trump. Shapiro wrote that during the call, Trump “cautioned that I shouldn’t want to be president, given how dangerous it had become to hold the office now.” At an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City on Tuesday and in his interview with NBC News afterward, Shapiro addressed whether the country was ready for a Jewish president. “I don’t believe, as some have suggested, that a woman can’t be president, a gay person can’t be president, a Jewish person can’t be president,” he said. “I think what the American people want is just someone who’s going to be on their side and fight for them and deliver for them, regardless of what their particular characteristic is. I think the American people are good and they’re decent, and they just want elected leaders who are going to fight for them every day, regardless of what they look like or who they love or who they pray to.” At the earlier event, Shapiro discussed the need for leaders in politics, the media, business and beyond to stand firm against antisemitism. As governor, he has expanded Holocaust education in Pennsylvania. “And let me be very, very clear,” he said. “There is antisemitism and hate on the political left and on the political right.” Shapiro also addressed the part of his memoir in which he revealed that during the vice presidential vetting process in 2024, an attorney working for Kamala Harris’ campaign asked whether he had ever been an agent of Israel. He wrote that he told the attorney the question was “offensive.” CNN later reported that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Harris selected as her running mate, was asked whether he had ever been an agent of China, a question prompted by his visits to the country. Shapiro has made multiple visits to Israel throughout his life. Asked whether he believed the question was standard based on past travel to foreign countries, Shapiro said: “I don’t know why they asked the question. “But I respect their right to ask that question,” he continued. “I agreed to be a part of that process. They asked the question, and I was expressing in this book not an opinion on what I think of them, but simply how it made me feel.” Shapiro also said he believes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection “need to be reformed and they need to be reconstituted” after federal officers killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota this month. But he said the problems in Minnesota come from the very top. “The issue with Minnesota is this mission is compromised, and the mission needs to be terminated because they’ve received a direction from the president of the United States that is outside the bounds of the law,” Shapiro said. “It is unconstitutional. It is violating people’s rights. That’s the problem here. It’s the direction that’s coming from the top.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/josh-shapiro-accuses-jd-vance-giving-comfort-right-wing-antisemitism-rcna256261","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260127-Josh-Shapiro-aa-1013-688277.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:08:48","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":397161830,"title":"AS, Iran digesa utamakan diplomasi, elak konflik lebih besar","text":"KUALA LUMPUR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat (KEADILAN) menggesa Amerika Syarikat (AS) dan Iran supaya mengutamakan diplomasi dan menahan diri susulan ketegangan yang semakin memuncak antara kedua-dua negara berkenaan, yang dibimbangi boleh mencetuskan konflik berskala besar di Asia Barat. \n\nPengerusi Biro Hal Ehwal Antarabangsa KEADILAN, Dr Maszlee Malik, berkata parti itu menyokong sepenuhnya pendirian Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, yang memberi amaran bahawa peningkatan kehadiran aset ketenteraan serta penggunaan retorik keras telah mengecilkan ruang untuk kebijaksanaan dan penyelesaian secara aman. \n\nMenurut beliau, komuniti antarabangsa tidak mampu membiarkan ketegangan berkenaan berkembang menjadi peperangan terbuka kerana sebarang konfrontasi secara langsung antara Washington dan Tehran berpotensi membawa kesan buruk yang besar terhadap kestabilan serantau dan global. \n\n\"Konflik sedemikian bukan sahaja mengancam Asia Barat yang sedia rapuh, malah berisiko mencetuskan konflik proksi yang lebih meluas, menjejaskan keselamatan laluan perairan penting serta mengakibatkan kejutan ekonomi global. \n\n\"Seperti yang ditekankan oleh Perdana Menteri, tiada kepentingan strategik boleh menghalalkan penderitaan manusia dan kemusnahan besar yang bakal berlaku,\" katanya dalam satu kenyataan. \n\nAnwar sebelum ini menyuarakan kebimbangan terhadap peningkatan ketegangan antara AS dan Iran yang dilihat berisiko mencetuskan konflik terbuka dalam suasana geopolitik global yang semakin rapuh. \n\n Amalkan tahan diri\n\nBeliau menegaskan keadaan di rantau berkenaan sudah sedia tegang dan semua pihak perlu mengamalkan penahanan diri bagi mengelakkan situasi menjadi lebih buruk. \n\nWashington sebelum ini dilaporkan tidak menolak kemungkinan campur tangan ketenteraan baharu di Iran susulan tindakan keras negara itu terhadap protes, yang menurut kumpulan hak asasi manusia telah mengorbankan ribuan nyawa dalam tempoh beberapa hari. \n\nKapal pengangkut pesawat AS yang diketuai USS Abraham Lincoln dilaporkan tiba di perairan Asia Barat kelmarin, manakala Iran memberi amaran akan bertindak balas terhadap sebarang serangan oleh Washington. \n\nBagaimanapun, Presiden AS, Donald Trump, dilaporkan berkata beliau percaya Iran masih berminat untuk berunding dengan Washington dan memeterai satu perjanjian. \n\nMengulas lanjut, Maszlee menegaskan sekali lagi bahawa tiada kepentingan strategik boleh mengatasi nilai nyawa manusia dan kemusnahan besar yang bakal tercetus sekiranya konflik berlaku. \n\n\"Sehubungan itu, KEADILAN menyeru semua pihak yang terbabit supaya segera berundur daripada ambang konflik dan memanfaatkan sepenuhnya semua saluran komunikasi sedia ada bagi mengelakkan salah tafsir dan salah perhitungan yang boleh memburukkan keadaan,\" katanya. \n\nDalam pada itu, KEADILAN turut memuji peranan negara-negara berkecuali seperti Oman yang memainkan usaha pengantaraan secara konstruktif bagi memudah cara dialog antara pihak-pihak berkepentingan. \n\n\"Justeru, kami menyeru semua negara yang mempunyai pengaruh supaya menggunakan setiap saluran diplomatik dan politik untuk menggalakkan penyaheskalasi serta mengamalkan penahanan diri demi kestabilan serantau dan antarabangsa,\" katanya.","summary":"KUALA LUMPUR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat (KEADILAN) menggesa Amerika Syarikat (AS) dan Iran supaya mengutamakan diplomasi dan menahan diri susulan ketegangan yang semakin memuncak antara kedua-dua negara berkenaan, yang dibimbangi boleh mencetuskan konflik berskala besar di Asia Barat.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2026/01/1502823/iran-digesa-utamakan-diplomasi-elak-konflik-lebih-besar","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH29MASLI_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1769649554.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:06:52","author":"Noor Atiqah Sulaiman","authors":["Noor Atiqah Sulaiman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":1},{"id":397155190,"title":"Omar Criticizes Trump’s ‘Hateful Rhetoric’ After Attack; Suspect Had Made Pro-Trump Posts Online","text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday’s attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn’t work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House’s aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country’s threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday’s event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nPhotos of the syringe, which fell when the man was tackled, show what appears to be a light-brown liquid inside. Authorities haven’t publicly identified the substance.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt’s unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county’s chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn’t been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar’s safety has been an issue for years. After Trump’s initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers face rising threats\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/omar-criticizes-trumps-hateful-rhetoric-after-attack-suspect-had-made-pro-trump-posts-online/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ΟΜΑΡ-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:06:48","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":397160232,"title":"We bought our dream clifftop home for £165,000 a decade ago, now it's been left to fall into the sea by a council who couldn't care less","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Jan 29th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlex Pretti spits at ICE agents and smashes federal SUV's tail light in shocking footage taken 11 days before he was shot dead\n\nTragic Noah Donohoe, 14, fell off his bike and was seen undressing in the street on the day he went missing, witnesses say - but he didn't seem to have a head injury that would explain how he ended dying naked in a storm drain\n\nIran tells Trump 'our fingers are on the trigger': Tehran warns it will 'respond like never before' if US carries out military strikes after president warned of 'major destruction'\n\nStacey Solomon's 'ruthless' behaviour with Essex's mumfluencers exposed: From the Style Sisters to Mrs Hinch and now Money Mum, insiders tell 'there's only so much money to go around', her 'uncanny' habit... and reveal 'frenemy' drama\n\nA renovation left me £20,000 in debt.

Email caitlin.leng@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAITLIN LENG \n Published:00:54 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:01:04 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nAn elderly couple forced to evacuate their clifftop home with only days' notice have told of their heartbreak after it was left to crumble into the sea by a council that didn't 'really seem to care.'\nGlenda and Michael Dennington, both in their 80s, were ordered to leave their home in Hembsy, Norfolk, on January 6 by the local council, because it was at risk of collapse due to rapid coastal erosion.\nEarlier this week, the retired husband and wife wrote to the Daily Mail about how let down they feel by authorities and insurers who they claim have failed to help residents losing their homes on Britain's fastest-eroding coastline.\nIn a heartbreaking letter, they said: 'We were given one day's notice to get out, then a further two days to clear the property. Volunteers helped us or we would have lost everything.\n'The local council have given very little assistance to people losing their homes. The insurance company doesn't want to know.\n'We feel like second-class citizens, yet have always worked and paid our taxes. Now we and our neighbours have been thrown on the scrapheap.'\nThe retired husband and wife were told they needed to evacuate just one day after Michael, 82, was discharged from hospital following a hip replacement, and as Storm Goretti struck.\nMrs Dennington was left in tears as they packed up their belongings and left the property, which she described as their 'final resting home'. The bungalow now stands empty and is due to be demolished this week. \nThe couple bought their home for £165,000 in August 2012 after visiting and being endeared by the 'friendly' community, with no concerns or warnings about erosion when they first bought the property.\n\nMichael (left), Glenda (right) and their dog Rusty were forced to leave their home with only a couple of days' notice as it was at risk of collapse due to rapid erosion\n\nThe couple said the experience had been 'devastating' and accused authorities of failing to help those losing their homes in this way\n\nThe couple lived at the property (pictured) in Hemsby, Norfolk since 2012 and were not told of any risks concerning erosion during its survey\nMrs Dennington, 80, said: 'We moved to Norfolk 14 years ago after retiring because we love it here. We had a full survey on it before we moved in, no one mentioned erosion.\n'We had never heard of any erosion until 2013, when other houses were lost to sea after the storm surge that December.\n'2018 was really sad. We watched houses disappear into the sea. That is when the local council began having meetings about the erosion problem – Michael and I went to every meeting.'\nIt was then, Mrs Dennington said, erosion became a concern for Great Yarmouth Borough Council, who regularly held meetings with residents to discuss planning and funding to manage the coastline's disappearance at an accelerating rate. \nA total of 36 properties have been lost to the sea or demolished because of erosion since 2013, and 14 homes were were at risk of collapsing into the sea in Hemsby earlier this year because of Storm Goretti. \nThis was not something, however, that Mrs Dennington believed would ever affect her and her husband, with both of them believing they had found their 'forever home'.\n\n Footage shows dramatic effect over 30 years at village with 'Britain's most eroded coastline' \nShe said: 'When we moved there, we could barely see the sea. It was in the distance. And as I say, erosion was never mentioned in the survey.\n'We never dreamed this would happen. The property was utopia, really. We have had many happy memories here.\n'Just after we moved there my sister was diagnosed with cancer. She spent many happy hours looking out in the garden.\n'When she was feeling down, she used to come here. She unfortunately passed away in 2016.'\nThe heartbreak of saying goodbye to their home was made even harder by seeing the demolition process unfold online.\n'I saw on Facebook our home being taken apart, quarter by quarter,' Mrs Dennington said.\n'The front has been removed, and the bathroom and the utility room. At the back of the house, the conservatory has been removed. It is as if it's being cut quarter by quarter.\n'It's heartbreaking to see this happening on social media. I still can't get my head around it – neither of us can. We are devastated.'\n\nGlenda (left) and Michael (right) recalled the happy memories they shared with family in the property over the years\n\nThe property (pictured) sat on the Norfolk coast, an area increasingly impacted by erosion across the last decade\nMrs Dennington described how she and her husband were 'more of less told to get out' of the home they'd shared for over a decade by Great Yarmouth Borough Council.\nShe said: 'On January 6 we had a knock at the door from the council. They gave us notice that we needed to get out of the property by Thursday night because of the storm.\n'I told them Michael was not up to such a move after his operation – he was on morphine for pain. So, we were able to extend the evacuation to the Sunday.\n'I was told to \"just go and have a cup of tea,\" think about the situation and then sort out the forms.\n'It was unbelievable. It felt like they wanted me to sell my home away – they barely gave notice, and they more or less told us that we we've got to get out.\n'We didn't sleep that night. On Saturday, we just couldn't believe it was our last night in that bed. It was heartbreaking and still doesn't feel real.'\nThe couple, who live with their youngest son Gary and pet dog Rusty, left their home on January 8 and stayed in temporary accommodation at a nearby holiday chalet before moving into their current rental property.\nThroughout the moving process, Mrs Dennington said, the council offered minimal to zero support.\nShe said: 'Our youngest son, who lives with us, has health problems. He suffers with a heart problem and he's also got a back problem, and when we were trying to pack our stuff, he did a lot of lifting and it ended up that he couldn't do much at all.\n'He looked after his dad while I was out 10 or 11 hours a day, trying to sort out clearing the home. Nobody came from the council to help. They did nothing to help us move – nothing at all.\n\nIn this aerial view properties stand next to rapidly eroding cliffs, on January 19, 2026 in Hemsby, England\n\nRusty pictured with Glenda and Michael's son, Gary, in their former home\n'Michael was not up to moving, he was still on morphine. It was just an absolute nightmare.'\n'The council initially suggested a B&B for us to go to because they could accommodate us and our dog, Rusty, or if not, we should foster Rusty out or give him to family to look after.\n'But there was no way we were going to leave the dog somewhere unfamiliar, and because of Michael's operation a B&B simply was not viable.\n'We also were not eligible for a council property because of our savings. We ended up rushing the lease for our current place, which our elder son found, in a day. If not, we would have had nowhere to go.'\nHowever, the lease on their new rental is only for six months - leaving both worried and in a tricky financial situation. Mrs Dennington said the couple have spent a large portion of their savings on rent.\nAnd, as revealed in yesterday's letter to the Daily Mail, their insurance company has told them that they will not cover coastal erosion, leaving them with no financial safety net.\nShe continued: 'We had saved for retirement, but at the end of the day with the extra costs of this move and now because we have to pay private rent; we're probably going to have to go on benefits.\n'Our savings are going to disappear. We've paid for six-months rent on this new property and I think we've spent about £10,000 pound and there's nothing to show for it.\n'Financially, I don't think we we're going to be able to buy another place. Until things have settled down, we just don't know where we are financially.'\n'I want to see a future for us. At the minute, I don't see a future for us because I keep thinking, we've moved ourselves into here with a few belongings, but in the end, we've got to start again in another five and a half months.\n'We've got to go through it all again, and we've got to sort out where we're going to.'\nThe coastline of Hembsy has changed significantly in five decades, once being protected by rolling sand dunes with rows of homes set safely behind them.\nNow those dunes have disappeared, and dozens of properties have been lost to the sea. In the past month alone, 14 homes have been demolished, with rubble removed by the local lifeboat station.\nHemsby is not alone. Homes are also being demolished at Thorpeness in Suffolk, where several more remain at risk.\nExperts have warned that undefended coastal villages like Hemsby may have no long-term future, with this stretch of the Norfolk coast described as among the fastest-eroding in northern Europe.\nA spokesperson for Great Yarmouth Borough Council said: 'Following the loss of more than 10m of cliff in Hemsby at the start of January, and with Storm Goretti fast approaching, a number of properties were assessed by experts as being at imminent risk of dangerously collapsing. \n'The council's priority is the safety of its residents and the family was visited on January 6 and advised to leave the property before the storm hit because the property was extremely close to the cliff edge. \n'The options available were fully explained and advice and support around housing was offered. Temporary accommodation was made available, but in this case was refused and the family made its own arrangements. \n'It is extremely traumatic for anyone who faces the prospect of having to leave their home because of coastal erosion and the council is working to support those affected at what is an incredibly difficult time for them.' \nStorm Goretti\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWe bought our dream clifftop home for £165,000 a decade ago, now it's been left to fall into the sea by a council who couldn't care less\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Yang, who ran in the 2020 Democratic primary, made the claim in excerpts from his upcoming book, \"Hey Yang, Where’s My Thousand Bucks?\", which were provided to the U.K.-based outlet, The Times, on Wednesday. According to Yang, Harris' team blocked him from engaging with the campaign after he urged former President Joe Biden to step out of the race following his debate with then-candidate Donald Trump. ANDREW YANG BLASTS DEM STRATEGY OF BOOSTING 'EXTREME' GOP PRIMARY CANDIDATES: 'AMERICANS SHOULD BE ANGRY' \"Kamala Harris’s campaign had put me on a list of people not to use or refer to, due to the fact that I’d ‘crossed the line’ in my disrespect of Joe Biden,\" Yang wrote. \"So dumb. I was kind of glad, to be honest, because if they’d asked me to do something, I would have felt honor bound to comply, but I don’t know how convincing I would have been.\" Despite this, Yang went on to endorse Harris for president, though he called her campaign's decision to avoid him \"a sign of a culture problem\" within the party. \"If you’re trying your best to win, who cares what I said four weeks ago?\" Yang wrote. \"Use anyone who might move votes.\" JOSH SHAPIRO ACCUSES HARRIS' VETTING TEAM OF MAKING DISRESPECTFUL COMMENTARY TOWARD HIS WIFE Yang pointed out that Harris and other members of the Democratic Party similarly ousted Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from their ranks despite their previous support for liberal candidates after they did not follow party orthodoxy. Kennedy, Yang noted, considered endorsing Harris for president before ultimately backing Trump after Harris' team rejected him. Yang also argued that a similar mindset existed in liberal media, claiming that his job as a CNN contributor was rescinded in 2021 after he registered as an independent. KAMALA HARRIS SAYS SHE 'NEEDED MORE SUPPORT' FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DURING HER 2024 CAMPAIGN \"[T]he news came out that I was no longer a Democrat,\" Yang wrote. \"My agent called me during this time and said, ‘Hey, CNN is rescinding its offer to you. Apparently, they don’t want to be seen as supporting a third party.’\" \"I responded, ‘Wouldn’t that make me more valuable to them, not less, in that I’d be an objective voice that isn’t tied up in one party or the other?’\" Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office and CNN for comment.

Speaking with the CNN journalist Kaitlin Collins, who caught up with Trump as he traversed the hallways of Davos, the 47th president of the United States proudly announced he had reached a “framework” deal on Greenland on Wednesday, though he hesitated to provide concrete details. \n\n“It’s a long-term deal,” Trump told Collins. “It’s the ultimate long-term deal. It’s infinite. There is no time limit. It’s a deal that’s forever.”\n\nThough Trump had spent much of the lead-up to Davos beating his chest and sharing wild memes on Truth Social that suggested his administration would gain full ownership of Greenland, the president dodged questions about whether the U.S. would gain full ownership of the island. \n\n“It’s a little bit complex but we’ll explain it down the line,” Trump told CNBC in the moments following the speech in which he told world leaders that the U.S. would settle for nothing less than complete ownership of the island. \n\nA statement issued by the NATO spokesperson Allison Hart confirmed that Rutte had a “very productive meeting” with Trump during which the pair “discussed the critical significance of security in the Arctic region to all Allies, including the United States.” \n\nHart said that discussions regarding Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, will focus on ensuring Arctic security so that “Russia and China never gain a foothold—economically or militarily—in Greenland.”","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2026/01/28/the-art-of-trumps-concept-deal-in-greenland-n3811293","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 01:00:00","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":397159044,"title":"Oil prices hover around four-month high","text":"NEW YORK: Oil prices rose to their highest since late September on Wednesday after a winter storm disrupted US crude production while a weak US dollar and continued Kazakh outages lent further support. Brent crude futures were up 43 cents, or 0.64percent, to USD68 a barrel at 11:40 a.m. ET (1640 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude was up 53 cents, or 0.85percent, at USD62.92.\n\nBoth grades were headed for their biggest monthly rises in percentage terms since July 2023, with Brent set to rise around 12percent and WTI around 10percent.\n\nBoth benchmarks had climbed about 3percent on Tuesday. On the supply side, a winter storm has been sweeping across much of the US, straining energy infrastructure and power grids. Over the weekend, exports of crude oil from US Gulf Coast ports tumbled to zero before rebounding on Monday, ship-tracking service Vortexa said. Oil prices were also supported by a surprise storage draw.\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday the country’s crude oil inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels to 423.8 million barrels in the week ended January 23, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.8 million-barrel rise.\n\n“The story of this report is solid demand,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group. “We can see the beginning of the impact of the cold weather and we will see more of that in next week’s report with distillate inventories and decline in production,” he added.\n\nA weak US dollar kept the prices elevated. The greenback is hovering near four-year lows against a basket of other currencies, making dollar-denominated commodities such as oil cheaper for those holding other currencies. The US Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady in a decision later on Wednesday. Lost production in Kazakhstan is also underpinning the price rally, though the OPEC+ member hopes that output at the Tengiz field might resume gradually within a week. Sources, however, have said this might take longer.\n\nMeanwhile, pipeline operator CPC, which handles about 80percent of Kazakhstan’s oil exports, has restored full loading capacity at its Black Sea terminal after maintenance at a mooring point hit by drones, sources said. On the supply side, the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies is set to keep its pause on oil output increases for March at a meeting on February 1, OPEC+ delegates said.\n\nElsewhere, US officials are working to issue a general licence that would lift some sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector, sources said, which could weigh on prices.\n\nA US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, US officials told Reuters, adding to President Donald Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action against Iran, which has increased concerns of supply disruptions from OPEC’s fourth-biggest crude producer.","summary":"NEW YORK: Oil prices rose to their highest since late September on Wednesday after a winter storm disrupted US crude production while a weak US dollar and continued Kazakh outages lent further support.

now tactics could hurt Republicans in midterms","text":"President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration agenda, a key force behind his return to the White House in 2024, is increasingly showing signs of becoming a liability, threatening Republican prospects in the November midterm elections.\n\nWhat was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown, including the targeting of US citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.\n\nIllegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election. Now, opinion polls show a growing number of Americans, including key independent voters, are unhappy with Trump’s handling of both, putting Republicans on the defensive ahead of the midterms.\n\nThe polling shows most Republicans still back Trump’s push for mass deportations, but a sizeable minority are uneasy with a heavy-handed approach by federal immigration agents, which led to the shooting deaths of a mother of three and a nurse in Minneapolis this month.\n\nJust 39% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, the lowest since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone “too far” in their crackdown.\n\nIf those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president’s agenda.\n\n“This was one of the president’s number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him,” said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. “The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it’s not just about the base, it’s about swing voters.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration’s approach to immigration.\n\n“President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti,” she said in a statement.\n\nDubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.\n\nTrump has taken steps in recent days to ease tensions in Minneapolis, dispatching his border czar to oversee the operation and signaling a willingness to work with state officials.\n\nIt remains unclear whether these moves reflect a recognition of the political risks to Republicans in November midterms, or are simply an effort to regain control of an operation that has produced daily images of masked federal agents responding aggressively to protesters confronting them in the streets.\n\nTrump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers about how to recalibrate his immigration strategy, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks. The discussions included a possible reduction of agents deployed to Minnesota and narrowing the focus there to deportations rather than broad enforcement operations, the sources said.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration agenda, a key force behind his return to the White House in 2024, is increasingly showing signs of becoming a liability, threatening Republican prospects in the November midterm elections.\n\n\nWhat was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown, including the targeting of US citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.\n\n\nIllegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election.

While the first lady is standing by the project, defending to “The Five” hosts that the documentary will show the public how she “works” and “communicates,” the film doesn’t currently appear to be a big draw for the box office.\n\nAs TheWrap reported earlier on Wednesday, “Melania” is projected for an opening of around $3 million this weekend. A notably low sum given the doc from Amazon MGM is set to arrive in about 1,500 theaters and had a $35 million marketing campaign.\n\nThe new documentary follows Melania Trump in the days leading up to her husband’s second inauguration.\n\n“History is set in motion during the 20 days of my life prior to the U.S. Presidential inauguration,” the first lady previously said of the film. “For the first time, global audiences are invited into theaters to witness this pivotal chapter unfold—a private, unfiltered look as I navigate family, business and philanthropy on my remarkable journey to becoming First Lady of the United States of America.”\n\nOn the decision to have controversial filmmaker Brett Ratner direct “Melania” years after his #MeToo cancellation, FLOTUS said the director was “very talented” with a great box office track record.\n\n“We had other suggestions … but he was the one,” she said on “The Five.” “I said, the most important [thing] is that he puts out my idea of what I have and [a] cinematic film that I want to achieve. So, he was the best one and he was great to work with.”\n\nWatch Trump’s “The Five” interview above.\n\n“The Five” airs weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on Fox News.","summary":"\"That's the problem, right?

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy RICHARD SIMPSON \n Published:00:56 GMT, 29 January 2026 |Updated:00:56 GMT, 29 January 2026 \n\nUS chat show host Ellen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is on the brink of sale after she secretly slashed an astonishing £4.5 million off its asking price, the Daily Mail can reveal.\nWhen Kitesbridge Farm near Burford was put up for sale last July, baffled local estate agents described the asking price - 50 per cent more than what she bought it for a year earlier - as 'absolutely crazy'.\nSince it went on the market it has continued to be plagued by flooding with the River Windrush, a tributary of the Thames which runs through its 43-acre Oxfordshire spread, often breaking its banks.\nMeanwhile Ellen herself - and her wife actress Portia De Rossi - bought a further £15 million home, significantly on a hilltop, near the celebrity enclave of Chipping Norton which is half an hour north due in part to the persistently high flood waters at Kitesbridge Farm.\nThen, various reports before Christmas claimed Ellen and Portia were so fed up with long British winters (this being their second) that they were packing up and moving back to sunny Montecito in California (albeit perhaps temporarily) to catch up with old friends.\nUnhelpfully also, Rachel Reeves' budget at the end of November also compounded the problems selling Kitesbridge Farm, when she announced houses of this price would be subject to a £7,500 annual 'mansion' tax.\n\nEllen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is OFF the market with rich American buyer poised to snap it up after she secretly slashed £4.5million off the £22million asking price\n\nSince it went on the market it has continued to be plagued by flooding with the River Windrush often breaking its banks (pictured during a flood in November 2024) \nInterest in the farm is thought to have ground to a halt at the end of last year, at which point, Sotheby's International started, on Ellen's instruction, quietly putting the word out to interested parties that she was slashing its price from £22.5 million to £18 million - a £4.5 million price cut.\nThe Daily Mail have gone to Ellen's representatives for comment. \nA source familiar with the sale explained its complex nature to the Daily Mail: 'There is firm interest at the moment in Kitesbridge which is why it has vanished from the website for the moment. \n'We have an American buyer lined up and are going through the motions. Its disappearance from the website is part of the agreement between the vendor and the buyer. \n'So it appears as 'no longer available' just while try and sort out final terms etc etc. The situation will be clearer in the next few days.'\nThe source continued: 'It has been widely publicised and it's no secret that the current owners (Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi) bought the property at £15 million. \n'They then spent £7.5million on re-doing it both externally and internally. They then curated with their interior designer all the furniture which is included in the price. \n'So that is where the initial £22.5 million price came from. It was felt that at least there was a need to recover the owner's financial position.\n'Then more recently, the price was reduced to £18 million but that was not publicized. We were just able to mention that to people as and when they called. \n\nA source familiar with the sale explained to the Daily Mail: 'There is firm interest at the moment in Kitesbridge which is why it has vanished from the website for the moment'\n\nExclusive pictures of the property show it was still flooded in November 2025 \n\nThe colossal price rise for an estate which had a well-publicised flooding concern seemed back then to be baffling to local Cotswolds estate agents \n'It was an unusual strategy but sometimes adverse publicity can affect the business of certain clients. There was no pressure on the client to sell (Ellen and Portia are worth £400 million).'\nAnd indeed in recent days, interested parties enquiring about Kitesbridge Farm on estate agents Sotheby's International's website have been met with the prompt: 'This property is no longer available'.\nEllen unusually decided to do a one-women show in Cheltenham in July of last year during which she announced to a surprised audience that the initial Cotswolds farmhouse in Asthall near Burford was now up for sale. \nA day later - on July 11 - it emerged that she had put the property on the market with Sotheby's International estate agents for £22.5 million, which represented a 50 per cent price hike.\nThe colossal price rise for an estate which had a well-publicised flooding concern seemed back then to be baffling to local Cotswolds estate agents.\nOne estate agent, who was familiar with the initial sale to Ellen back in June of 2024 simply said: 'Well, £22.5 million is an absolutely crazy price. \n'I know Ellen has had some interior decorating work done, and there has been a small amount of landscaping too. But she bought the place for £15 million 12 months ago. \n'And even then she paid £2.5m million over the asking price which was just £12.5 million. So £10 million has been added to what it was being marketed at 12 months ago. \n'Good luck to her of course. A house is worth what someone will pay for it.'\nTop end estate agents Sotheby's International Realty started marketing the seven-bedroomed home back in July as a 'A Landmark Country Estate in the Heart of the Cotswolds'\nThe agent described how the farm is 'Discreetly set at the end of a long private driveway, and has been beautifully reimagined over the past year to an exceptional standard. \n'The estate blends period character with sleek, modern design across 43 acres of rolling Cotswold countryside. The main house unfolds around a central landscaped courtyard, a lovely focal point that brings light and flow to the interiors. \n\nThe for-sale price of £22.5million is a 50 per cent increase on the £15million asking price\n\nEllen had interior decorating work done on the home and there was also some landscaping\n\nVarious reports before Christmas claimed Ellen and Portia were so fed up with long British winters that they were packing up and moving back to sunny Montecito in California\n'A series of generous reception rooms overlook this space, creating a seamless link between indoors and out. Designed for both grand-scale entertaining and relaxing, the layout combines sharp architectural detail with a contemporary eye for volume, proportion and finish.'\nThe lavish description continues: 'At the heart of the house is a vast kitchen and breakfast room, anchored by bespoke cabinetry and elegant natural materials. \n'The ground floor also holds the principal suite, a beautiful space with two dressing rooms, a marble-clad ensuite and French doors leading to a private garden. \n'Upstairs are five further bedrooms, alongside a large sitting room offering flexible family accommodation. \n'Beyond the main residence, a charming two-bedroom guest cottage provides private accommodation for extended family, visiting friends or staff, with its own kitchen and sitting room. \n'There is also a converted granary building with a heated five-car garage, a kitchenette, and, upstairs, an impressive party barn with its own pub, ideal for entertaining on a generous scale. \n'Leisure and wellness are superbly catered for: A purpose-built suite features a heated indoor swimming pool, gym, shower facilities and changing room, while a separate helicopter shed offers further potential, with scope for conversion into an indoor padel court, artist's studio, or private office.\n'The gardens and grounds have been thoughtfully landscaped to frame the house and its surrounds. \n'There are formal lawns, a kitchen garden, sculpted paddocks, and a series of outdoor living areas, including a covered dining space within the inner courtyard. \n'The estate enjoys complete privacy yet remains wonderfully connected, just moments from the postcard-pretty village of Asthall, home to an award-winning, and within easy reach of Estelle Manor, Soho Farmhouse and The Club by Bamford.'\nCaliforniaEllen DeGeneres\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEllen DeGeneres' flood-cursed Cotswolds farmhouse is OFF the market with rich American buyer poised to snap it up after she secretly slashed £4.5million off the £22million asking price\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It appeared to be the most public step by law enforcement to pursue Trump’s claims of a stolen election, grievances rejected time and again by courts and state and federal officials, who found no evidence of fraud that would have altered the outcome.\n\nIt also unfolds against the backdrop of FBI and Justice Department efforts to investigate perceived political enemies of Trump, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump has for years focused on Fulton, Georgia’s most populous county and a Democratic stronghold, as a key example of what he claims went wrong in the 2020 election. His pressure campaign there culminated in a sweeping state indictment accusing him and 18 others of illegally trying to overturn the vote.\n\nFBI agents secured an area around the large warehouse building that houses the county elections hub with yellow tape and could be seen loading boxes from the building into trucks. FBI spokesperson Jenna Sellitto confirmed that the boxes contained ballots. Among the 2020 election documents sought are ballots, tabulator tapes from the scanners used to tally the ballots, electronic ballot images and voter rolls.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said agents were “executing a court authorized law enforcement action” at the county’s main election office in Union City, just south of Atlanta. The spokesperson declined to provide any further information, citing an ongoing matter.\n\nState and county Democratic officials expressed concern about the search and ballot seizures.\n\n“We don’t know why they took them, and we don’t know where they’re taking them to,” county Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts said.\n\nThe Justice Department had no immediate comment. FBI Co-Deputy Director Andrew Bailey and U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard were seen onsite.\n\nTrump’s focus on Fulton County\n\nTrump has long insisted that the 2020 election was stolen even though judges across the country and his own attorney general said they found no evidence of widespread fault that tipped the contest in Democrat Joe Biden’s favor.\n\nThe president has made Georgia, one of the battleground states he lost in 2020, a central target for his complaints about the election and memorably pushed its secretary of state to help “find” enough votes to overturn the contest.\n\nLast week, in reference to the 2020 election, he asserted that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.” It was not clear what in particular he was referring to.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in August 2023 obtained an indictment against Trump and 18 others, accusing them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. That case was dismissed in Novembe r after courts barred Willis and her office from pursuing it because of an “appearance of impropriety” stemming from a romantic relationship she had with a prosecutor she had hired to lead the case.\n\nThe FBI last week moved to replace its top agent in Atlanta, Paul W. Brown, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a non-public personnel decision. It was not immediately clear why the move, which was not publicized by the FBI, was made.\n\nDOJ lawsuit\n\nThe warrant is a criminal document, but the Justice Department last month sued the clerk of the Fulton County superior and magistrate courts in federal court seeking access to documents from the 2020 election in the county. The lawsuit said the department sent a letter to the clerk, Che Alexander, but that she had failed to produce the requested documents.\n\nAlexander has filed a motion to dismiss the suit. The Justice Department complaint says that the purpose of its request was “ascertaining Georgia’s compliance with various federal election laws.” It also says the attorney general is trying to help the State Election Board with its “transparency efforts under Georgia law.”\n\nA three-person conservative majority on the State Election Board has repeatedly sought to reopen a case alleging wrongdoing by Fulton County during the 2020 election. It passed a resolution in July seeking assistance from the U.S. attorney general to access voting materials.\n\nThe state board sent subpoenas to the county board for various election documents last year and again on Oct. 6. The October subpoena requested “all used and void ballots, stubs of all ballots, signature envelopes, and corresponding envelope digital files from the 2020 General Election in Fulton County.” A fight over the state board’s efforts to enforce the 2024 subpoena is currently tied up in court.\n\nThe Justice Department sent a letter to the county election board Oct. 30 citing the federal Civil Rights Act and asking for all records responsive to the October subpoena from the State Election Board. Lawyers for the county election board responded about two weeks later, saying that the records are held by the county court clerk. They also attached a letter the clerk sent to the State Election Board saying that the records are under seal in accordance with state law and can’t be released without a court order.\n\nThe Justice Department said it then sent a letter to Alexander, the clerk, on Nov. 21 requesting the documents and that she failed to respond.\n\nThe department is asking a judge to declare that the clerk’s “refusal to provide the election records upon a demand by the Attorney General” violates the Civil Rights Act. It is also asking the judge to order Alexander to produce the requested records within five days of a court order.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/search-warrant-fbi-served-at-elections-office-near-atlanta-seeks-records-tied-to-the-2020-elections/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Georgia-Elections-Investigation-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 00:54:51","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":397157970,"title":"Springsteen releases Minneapolis protest song","text":"Springsteen said he wrote Streets of Minneapolis on Saturday, January 24, the day Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot dead by US Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\nRenee Good, 37, a mother of three, was shot dead by an ICE agent on January 7.\n\n\"It’s dedicated to the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbours and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good,\" the singer wrote in a social media post.\n\nIn Streets of Minneapolis the 76-year-old star sings of the immigration crackdown in the Minnesota city where residents like Pretti and Good have followed federal agents to record their operations and confront officers.\n\nThe song lauds Minnesotans for resisting \"smoke and rubber bullets\" and using \"whistles and phones\" against \"Miller and Noem's dirty lies.\"\n\nStephen Miller is President Donald Trump's Homeland Security Advisor and Kristi Noem is US Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nA chorus joins him on the line \"ICE out now!\"\n\nFollowing Pretti's shooting, Noem said Pretti had brandished a gun and Miller called him an \"assassin\" who tried to murder federal agents.

But unlike previous years, there won’t be anything to compare it to, because the Trump administration has not released yet last year’s figures. The effort, called the “Point in Time” count, has taken place since at least 2005 and is conducted by armies of volunteers on one night at the end of January. It’s statutorily required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in order to allocate funding to homeless services across the country. The last homeless count, from 2024, showed homelessness had reached a historic high of 771,480 people, which was an almost 20% increase from the year prior. “There is no standard timeline for the release of the Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR), as precedent shows. The 2021 AHAR was released in February 2022, while the 2020 report was released in March 2021,\" a HUD spokesperson said. \"HUD is on pace to produce a thorough and comprehensive AHAR to provide the best data in addressing America’s homelessness problem.\" In 2025, cities and counties released the results of their local homeless counts, but HUD never released the national picture. Some local counts show the number of homeless people declined. In Boston, the figure went down by 4%, and in Chicago the homeless population dropped dramatically, by 60%. “The current lack of information from HUD on the numbers of homeless Americans adds to the uncertainty and untrust Americans will build with this administration. This is more than a lack of transparency; this is malpractice,” said homeless advocate Donald Whitehead, who serves as the executive director at the National Coalition for the Homeless. Whitehead says he has repeatedly called HUD Secretary Scott Turner to ask about the holdup and has not received an explanation. He said homeless organizations usually work in a collaborative effort to analyze homelessness trends regardless of the administration. “It is incredibly concerning that our government is unwilling to share the scope of homelessness in our country,” said Jeff Olivet, who now serves as senior adviser to the Initiative on Health and Homelessness at Harvard's School of Public Health. While the Biden administration did release the figures in 2024, it was done quietly, between Christmas and New Year’s, almost a year after the count occurred.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-2025-homelessness-data-hud-census-rcna256322","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260128-homelessness-gk-d787a7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-29 00:52:39","author":"Harbani Kohli,Laura Strickler","authors":["Harbani Kohli","Laura Strickler"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203}]}
