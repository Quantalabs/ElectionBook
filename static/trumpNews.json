On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the statement said.\n“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” it added.\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump wished Biden a fast and successful recovery.\n“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” said Trump on Truth Social.\nFormer US Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Douglas Emhoff also hoped for a full and speedy recovery.\n“Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time,” Harris said.\n“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery,” she added.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/joe-biden-diagnosed-with-aggressive-form-of-prostate-cancer-trump-wishes-fast-recovery-9342488.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/01/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-2025-01-c24fca1e3a401132277241cf9458e69b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 01:24:22","author":"Anushka Vats,News18","authors":["Anushka Vats","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":322694858,"title":"MAGA Immediately Turns Biden’s Cancer Into Another Conspiracy","text":"Donald Trump Jr. and MAGAworld quickly pounced on the news of Joe Biden’s cancer diagnosis with rampant speculation about a “cover-up” of the true state of the former president’s health.\n\nHours after Biden’s office announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with a “more aggressive form” of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, Trump Jr. boosted a conspiracy that had already been making rounds among MAGA influencers and pundits.\n\n“What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???” he wrote on X.\n\nJust before he asked the question, Trump Jr. wrote in another X post that he “agreed 100%” with an image that read: “Politics aside, we wish him a speedy recovery!”\n\nMany others in MAGAworld speculated that Biden and the Democratic Party had long been aware of the cancer diagnosis but chose to cover it up. Right-wing influencer Benny Johnson branded it “the most dangerous cover-up in the history of the presidency.”\n\n“You’re telling me that the best doctors and testing on earth did not find Biden’s cancer in all these years of testing? Was every medical report a lie? For how long? Bullshit,” he wrote. “Absolute scandal. They knew. They lied. They hid it. For power. People need to be held accountable for this. Evil.”\n\nTexas Rep. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump’s former White House physician, said it was “unbelievable” that Biden’s medical team missed the cancer.\n\n“Care at the White House should be second to none,” he said. “The truth is, his physician was more concerned about assisting with the political cover-up than providing world-class medical care.”\n\nFar-right activist Laura Loomer, who has enjoyed a direct line to President Donald Trump in recent months, said she saw the news coming, claiming that “Biden has been terminally ill for a long time. It’s just been kept a secret.”\n\n“He won’t be alive much longer in my opinion,” she said. “He and his family are announcing this now to make people feel bad since there’s a book coming out about his mental decline and the cover-up of how sick he has been these last four years.”\n\nConservative podcaster Tim Pool mused that it was unlikely that Biden’s doctors missed the cancer if he enjoyed “best medical care and screenings for four years.”\n\n“They’d have found it and it means he’s likely had it since before dropping out,” he said. “Democrats knew.”\n\nSean Davis, CEO and co-founder of conservative news outlet The Federalist, pointed out that Biden was “under constant medical surveillance by the most sophisticated medical team on earth.”\n\n“After all the lies we were told about his health, we’re supposed to believe they just plum didn’t notice he had cancer that metastasized to the bone until now?” he said.\n\nTrump superfan Bill Mitchell claimed that Biden “has likely had prostate cancer for four to six years.”\n\n“Is it possible that they knew the whole time and the plan was for Biden to be elected then step down for health reasons, placing Kamala in the White House?” he asked.\n\nCollin Rugg, co-owner of conservative news website Trending Politics, reposted a July video of Biden struggling to climb up the stairs to an airplane.\n\n“We were called conspiracy theorists who posted ‘cheap fakes’ when we shared videos like this of Biden barely being able to walk by himself,” he said. “Are we supposed to believe that this aggressive cancer was just found and wasn’t covered up by the Biden admin / media?”\n\nBut a separate camp of conservatives, led by Trump himself, struck a more sensitive tone following the announcement of Biden’s diagnosis.\n\nThe president took a break from his usual Truth Social tirades against his predecessor to send his well wishes.\n\n“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” Trump said. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”\n\nMAGA firebrand Marjorie Taylor-Greene offered up prayers for Biden, noting that her own father succumbed to cancer in 2021.\n\n“I’m sorry to see this news,” she said on X. “Cancer is truly awful.”\n\nConservative pundit Piers Morgan blasted “vile cr-p flying around” that he said were “mocking, celebrating, or playing partisan politics with Joe Biden’s health news.”\n\n“The man has served his country for 50 yrs and is fighting for his life,” he said. “Show some bloody respect.”\n\nRight-wing influencer Meghan McCain also shut down her own base’s speculations of a “cover-up.”\n\n“I don’t want to hear anything else about Biden’s health coverup, tell all’s, interviews with staff etc,” she wrote. “Let the Biden family be in peace right now.

Those concerns were underscored on Sunday as the former president announced a diagnosis of an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer with metastasis to the bone.\n\nBiden’s party is truly in the wilderness after the 2024 election cycle. High-profile Democrats tied to the Obama administration and Harris campaign both have unleashed hell on the Biden family for insisting that the president would run for re-election and not, as many thought he’d indicated, serve one term before endorsing a successor.\n\nMany are also worried that the coalition patched together by Barack Obama and his then-running mate, Joe Biden, in 2008, is on the brink of shattering in the wake of his disastrous 2024 campaign. Experts point to declines in turnout among Black voters and inroads made by Republicans among Hispanic communities as a sign that the Democratic base is splintering.\n\nParty officials could look to western Pennsylvania as a way to make sure it doesn’t, elected Democrats from the region argue.\n\nThe state was one of seven battlegrounds lost by Kamala Harris in November. Worse, Democrats lost a key Senate seat with Bob Casey’s defeat and two members of the state delegation in the House of Representatives lost to Republicans as well. The vice president bet big on the Philadelphia metro area, only to lose three wards to Donald Trump, which Biden had won in 2020 — her campaign then traded insults with Bob Brady, a longtime Philly Democratic power broker.\n\nDemocrats held their own out west, gaining ground in the suburbs surrounding Pittsburgh and the city itself. Rep. Summer Lee, the state’s first Black congresswoman, won a second term with ease and ever-so-slightly drove up her margin over two years prior. Chris DeLuzio won a second term in the 17th district, one of the state’s most important battleground districts.\n\nSo what do those Democrats say about where the party goes from here?\n\n“If the people want to fight, they're going to want leaders that want to fight,” says Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey.\n\nThe first Black mayor of the largest city in the region, Gainey spoke to The Independent on Saturday ahead of a tight Democratic primary fight’s conclusion on Tuesday. The mayor laid out a vision for what he described as a “multi-racial, multi-generational coalition” that mirrored the demographics that propelled Democrats to victory in three presidential elections since the 2000s.\n\nGainey said his goal was to “unite the people behind a common message of making sure that we're speaking up for the working-class families, families that have been attacked.“\n\nFacing the son of a former mayor, Corey O’Connor, Gainey is betting that the voters who turned out for Harris to keep her afloat across the city, including Black voters, younger Democrats and progressives, will see him to victory. His campaign has focused on issues including affordable housing, while he’s pledged to continue rejecting any cooperation with Donald Trump’s deportation authorities.\n\n“That type of coalition led to, you know, Congresswoman Summer Lee being the first African-American congresswoman elected throughout the state,” Gainey told The Independent. “Then from there, we were able to step up and make Sarah Innamorato the first woman to be county exec.”\n\n“I think that momentum running, you know, going into Kamala Harris's campaign, just kept up, and we were able to make sure that that coalition delivered for her,” he said. “A lot of the metro areas, they didn't see the same thing.”\n\nAlex Wallach Hanson, the executive director of the left-leaning group Pennsylvania United, said that such a coalition “doesn't exist by accident.” His group focuses on organizing voters around progressive causes across the state, including calling for investigations into the tax-exempt status of the state’s largest employer, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC).\n\n“People around the country are looking at what happened, what's happening here in Allegheny County,” said Hanson. “Why is it that this is one of the few cities in the country where Kamala Harris did nearly as well as Biden did in the 2024 election?”\n\nLocal leaders, including Lee and Gainey, have run “rooted in the identities and the stories of this multiracial, multi-generational working class coalition,” he said, “and then have brought those people into government, to help shape how government delivers for people in a really material way.”\n\nGainey spoke passionately in his interview about why seeing leaders from every community in government was important for younger Americans, explaining how politics seemed an impossible future when he was a child.\n\n“Growing up, I never met a politician,” said the mayor.\n\nNow that he’s older, he says: “I get it. I get the fact that at the end of the day, the fact that I’d never seen a politician until I got to college, how that impacted me. I get why I got into this business. Because I wanted to see something that I didn't see as a child, a city where we can use…our political instruments as a way of lifting people up.”\n\nPittsburgh is the fastest-growing city in the state, and is home to a growing tech industry. Under Gainey, it dealt with a bridge collapse while the mayor fought to address a number of familiar urban issues, including rising homelessness and a lack of affordable housing. The city has also struggled to address police staffing issues, though it has recovered from a Covid-era violent crime spike that hit many metropolitan areas.\n\nWith their party in the minority in the House and Senate, a number of Pennsylvania Democrats have taken to pressing the offensive against Trump and the GOP in town hall meetings and other events, while Republicans struggle to push the president’s first legislative priority, a budget bill, over the finish line. Gainey, Lee and DeLuzio are among them — hosting events and town halls together aimed at drawing attention to Republican threats of cutting Medicaid benefits and rolling back rights for visa holders and immigrants.\n\nDeLuzio appeared recently at an event headlined by Sen. Bernie Sanders as part of the latter’s massively popular Fighting Oligarchy speaking tour. Gainey and Lee also held an event with Conor Lamb, a former congressman rumored to be plotting another bid for office. John Fetterman, the state’s senior senator, remains plagued by reports of his erratic behavior and hasn’t held a public event in months.\n\n“We need unprecedented unity right now,” Gainey, standing beside Lee, said at one town hall event in April. “This is the time where if you don't know other communities, get to know them. Don't judge them, know them.”\n\nFor his party, the mayor also offered a simple prescription: do not back away from the communities responsible for your past wins.\n\n“Cutting things back and being conservative is not going to empower anybody. We need to be about the business of empowering people,” he said. “That's the message we should be pushing: ‘We are here to protect your civil rights.’”\n\nHe added: “And again, I'm gonna bring it back to the local. That's why in these metro areas that we're talking about, it is so important for mayors to stand up and speak out and talk about exactly what we're doing.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/people-want-fight-western-pennsylvania-225132890.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e414e59a3ca4807cac8c1542d1def7e2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:48:18","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":322693742,"title":"Polish centrist's narrow presidential lead leaves pro-EU path in balance","text":"Warsaw - Polish liberals performed worse than expected in a presidential election on Sunday, exit polls showed, as Rafal Trzaskowski from ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) scraped to victory, setting up a close fight for Warsaw's pro-European path.Trzaskowski placed first with 31.1% of the vote, ahead of Karol Nawrocki, the candidate backed by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, who had 29.1%, according to an Ipsos late poll.

Audiences recognised the uneasy truth: the flight of thousands of Nazi party members to Argentina after the Second World War remains \"an extremely uncomfortable period\" in the country's history.\n\nArgentina has not been good at \"reckoning with its past as a haven for war criminals\". President Javier Milei, however, \"appears to have changed tack\". On 29 April, he released 1,850 documents from the national archives containing details, said the Buenos Aires Herald, of \"prominent Nazi criminals who escaped to Argentina\" – including Josef Mengele, the notorious Auschwitz doctor known as the \"Angel of Death\".\n'A haven for Nazis'\nMost of the documents, a mix of police and intelligence agency files, were declassified in 1992 but \"remained almost impossible to access\", said The Times. They were only viewable \"by appointment, in a single designated room\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

And the documents, now viewable online, confirm \"a long-known dirty secret\": the \"ease\" with which senior Nazis lived in Argentina. \"At one point,\" said defence minister Luis Petri, \"Argentina became a haven for Nazis\".\n\nMengele, \"notorious\" for his inhumane experiments on prisoners, arrived in 1949 and lived under \"various aliases\", said The Times of Israel. The documents include \"nearly 100 pages detailing his time in Argentina\" and show, for the first time, that he filed a request to travel from Argentina to West Germany in 1959, using his real name, according to German public broadcaster MDR. This means \"several countries likely had more accurate information on Mengele than previously thought,\" said historian and Nazi expert Bogdan Musial.\nThere are also several files on Adolf Eichmann, another SS officer and one of the principal architects of the \"Final Solution\". He arrived in Argentina in 1950 under an alias.\nThe Supreme Court in Buenos Aires has also discovered Nazi material among its archives, reported The Associated Press on Sunday. An anonymous judicial authority said the court had come across boxes of photos, postcards and propaganda \"intended to consolidate and propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology\" in Argentina during the Second World War. The court's president, Horacio Rosatti, has ordered \"a thorough analysis\".\nExposing the 'ratlines'\nThe Nazi officials who fled to Argentina may be \"long dead\" but \"their hunters insist their work is not done\", said The Times. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a US-based human rights organisation, wants to \"expose\" the so-called \"ratlines\" – the networks, individuals and institutions that helped Nazis flee Europe and start new lives in South America. For nearly 20 years, the NGO has petitioned successive Argentine governments to release the files.\nIn January, the US Senate Judiciary Committee released two reports into Swiss bank Credit Suisse, concluding that \"70 Argentine accounts with plausible links to Argentina-based Nazis\" were opened with the bank after 1945. And, the report claimed, one of these accounts was still active as recently as 2022.\nA previous investigation had found also \"significant connection\" between Credit Suisse and individuals who ran the ratlines, said Le Monde. \"Money is not innocent,\" Ariel Gelblung, the Latin America director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, told the paper. Credit Suisse, which was taken over by the UBS Group in 2023, has pledged to provide \"all necessary assistance\". And after meeting with representatives from the Simon Wiesenthal Center earlier this year, Milei ordered the release of the documents.\nIn a 1999 report by the Commission of Enquiry into the Activities of Nazism in Argentina, historian Holger M. Meding \"identified the facilitators of Nazi exfiltration to Argentina\" as the Catholic Church and the Red Cross, said Le Monde. But the role of then-President Juan Perón was \"decisive\". Perón had \"a preference for all things German\", wrote Meding.\nIt might have been this that spurred Milei's decision to release the files, said The Spectator's Meadows. The president has \"made no secret of his hatred of Peronism\", and these documents could lead to \"further scrutiny\" of Peron's role.\n\nExplore More\n\nSouth America\nSecond World War\nLatin America\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHarriet Marsden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nHarriet Marsden is a writer for The Week, mostly covering UK and global news and politics.

The British gave us the Resolute Desk,” Scott Bessent said on CNN’s State of the Union. “I’m not sure they asked for anything in advance.”\n\nHost Jake Tapper responded by pointing out that the statue was not for the personal use of a president, unlike the plane, which is set to be moved to Trump’s presidential library upon his departure from the White House.\n\n“I think this plane would be a gift to the American government,” Bessent said in response.\n\nThe optics of the Qatari government’s gift of a palatial upgrade to the current, aging Air Force One is not lost on many, including in the GOP congressional caucuses. Others have tripped up attempting to avoid answering.\n\nRand Paul, a Kentucky Republican senator, warned on Sunday that the president risked undermining his own message by accepting the gift.\n\n“I think my fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East, which is a good thing, particularly amidst all the protectionism and directing away from trade that we’ve had going on,” Paul said on ABC.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, also urged the president to reconsider during a separate interview on NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\nPro-Trump commentator Ben Shapiro, on his podcast this past week, told listeners: \"I think the technical term is 'skeezy.’”\n\nOn Friday, the president lashed out at a Fox News reporter for asking him about the growing unease over Qatar’s gift.\n\n“I just want to say, it was a radical left story,” Trump told Fox’s Bret Baier. “I made a good deal.”\n\n“This goes to the United States Air Force for whoever is president, and at some point, it’ll be like Ronald Reagan. It’ll be decommissioned, because they won’t want it,” he added.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/french-gave-us-statue-liberty-003720734.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9308e4da53b34a2ad1b266e051051af9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:37:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":322695188,"title":"After the crisis","text":"IT may be too early to fully assess the multiple dimensions of the India-Pakistan crisis but some conclusions can be drawn. Never before had the two countries attacked each other’s mainland with missile and air strikes as well as deployed new generation technology and weapons including drones. And never before had they edged so close to all-out war after becoming nuclear-wea-pon states. The rapid escalation in the military confrontation went beyond the traditional battleground of occupied Kashmir and much further than previous crises to test deterrence. This was unprecedented but the way the crisis was defu-sed — by third-party intervention — followed a well-rehearsed path and mimicked the past.\n\nThe military, diplomatic and international dimensions of the crisis need to be carefully examined to make an assessment about the future. Predictably, both countries have drawn very different conclusions from the crisis. The Indian claim, voiced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is that a ‘new normal’ against terrorism has been established by India’s military actions, and that in future any terrorist attack will be deemed an act of war and responded to militarily by this ‘new’ doctrine. \n\nPakistan sees its kinetic response in the crisis to have demonstrated that conventional deterrence worked as it prevented India from escalating to an even bigger conflict and thwarted India’s effort to expand space for conventional war under the nuclear overhang. India’s loss of several Rafale aircraft symbolised the costs imposed by Pakistan’s retaliation. That and its ability to strike at multiple targets in the Indian mainland showed its conventional capabilities were able to force a ceasefire and neutralise India’s aims of ‘limited war’.\n\nThe reality is that India failed to achieve its military objectives in the conflict in spite of Modi’s unsubstantiated assertions of having destroyed “terrorist infrastructure”. It miscalculated the consequences of its actions. Its resort to a military ‘solution’ for a terror attack backfired. The claim that a new norm has been created by India flies in the face of facts. The assertion that henceforth India would respond militarily if there is another terror attack is easier said than done, given the unedifying outcome of the latest crisis for New Delhi. With the credibility of Pakistan’s conventional deterrence re-established if not strengthened, the costs for India could be even higher the next time around for it to consider similar action. India got a new normal but not the one it wanted. \n\n An uneasy truce prevails between India and Pakistan with dim prospects of any diplomatic re-engagement.\n\nAs both countries have drawn sharply conflicting conclusions and lessons from their military confrontation this heightens the risk for miscalculation and creates uncertainty ahead, especially if sustained communication is not established between them. Contact between the DGMOs after the ceasefire has been important but the communication channel has to go beyond a technical or tactical level. There is little immediate possibility of this. This continues to make the situation fraught and unpredictable especially as Modi has declared India has “only suspended” military operations.\n\nThe diplomatic costs of the crisis were even greater for India than the military costs. By its reckless military actions, New Delhi lost significant international ground as global attention shifted from terrorism to the danger of a full-fledged war with India climbing up the escalatory ladder. This showed how poorly the Modi government assessed the international environment. The clash brought global attention back to Kashmir, to the Modi government’s discomfiture. In the biggest blow to New Delhi, President Donald Trump in announcing the ceasefire offered to mediate on Kashmir. While this will be rejected by India, it catapults Kashmir to the global stage. India also failed to elicit any international support for its decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty. Even the US asked India to observe the treaty in private conversations with Indian officials. \n\nMoreover, US intervention to defuse the crisis and Trump’s statements after the ceasefire re-hyphenated India and Pakistan, which India has tried so hard over the years to delink. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran acknowledged to the Financial Times that the crisis set back New Delhi’s efforts to dissuade countries from treating India and Pakistan “on a par, and relations with each as interlinked”. “That hyphenation is now back,” he added. If a top Indian geopolitical goal is to join the world’s big league this crisis has produced the opposite outcome for New Delhi. \n\nThe Modi government also misjudged the evolving American position, assuming it would receive unequivocal support from Washington for its military action to avenge the Pahalgam terror incident. But the Trump administration sought to defuse the crisis from its very onset, urging restraint on New Delhi (and Islamabad) both publicly and privately. As the crisis escalated, US diplomatic intervention intensified. This was reflected in multiple phone calls made by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to top leaders in both countries and finally Vice President J.D. Vance’s intercession with PM Modi when the crisis looked like spinning out of control. \n\nThis led to the ceasefire President Trump announced and claimed credit for. The Indians neither publicly welcomed his announcement nor acknowledged the US role in ending the crisis. Modi made no mention of this in his post-ceasefire speech. Later, Indian officials refuted the US role. This contrasted sharply with the synchronous communication and close understanding between Pakistan and China throughout the crisis including in vital intelligence cooperation. \n\nAs for the political ramifications of the crisis, this provided a contrasting picture. The outcome divided India while uniting Pakistan. Modi came under mounting domestic pressure to explain what he achieved by Operation Sindoor. His right-wing base was furious at the truce. With his strongman image dented, the opposition said Modi had much to answer for while the Congress president criticised the government for “strategic missteps”. In Pakistan there was jubilation at the outcome, rallying of national unity and renewal of national confidence while the public standing and reputation of the armed forces went up exponentially. \n\nAn uneasy truce now prevails between India and Pakistan with a fragile ceasefire that is being implemented in phases. Confidence-building measures are being taken to reduce military tensions and the “level of alertness”. But it will be a mistake to conclude that ‘normalcy’ will return anytime soon. The outlook remains troubled and fraught with uncertainty. \n\nThe writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2025","summary":"IT may be too early to fully assess the multiple dimensions of the India-Pakistan crisis but some conclusions can be drawn.

It means that the US must run trade and fiscal deficits to supply global liquidity, which hollows out its manufacturing sector. If the US cuts deficits, global trade suffers due to a lack of dollar liquidity as the US is buying less from abroad, thereby impacting world growth.\n\nIn other words, countries must use the US dollar as a settlement and reserve currency to conduct international trade. And because there is demand for the dollar, countries have to stock the US currency earned through exports.\n\n The US must run trade and fiscal deficits to supply global liquidity, which hallows out its manufacturing sector, but if the deficits decrease, global trade suffers due to a lack of dollar liquidity \n\nOn the other hand, as the US supplies dollars, if it wants to safeguard its position as the world’s dominant currency, it will have to export dollars by running a trade deficit. For so long, its currency and related financial products have remained the primary US export. This has enabled Washington to run both trade and fiscal deficits without any major drag on the economy.\n\nIn theory, the dominance of the US currency hinges on the stability of the dollar, requiring America to maintain a balance of payments surplus. However, these two objectives of domestic stability and global monetary supremacy as the world’s reserve are structurally contradictory and paradoxical, as explained by the Triffin dilemma.\n\nHence, Trump’s tariff plans — which aim at pushing ‘re-industrialisation’ of the US not just to narrow its international trade deficit but also to achieve a balanced trade or a trade surplus — inadvertently but inherently run the risk of being hugely consequential for global dollar dominance in the longer run. The current push for re-industrialisation underscores a seismic shift in US economic policy as Washington seemingly quits the cause of globalisation.\n\nEven though no other country wants the structural burdens of replacing the dollar, as it requires chronic deficits, the narrative that the dollar’s reserve currency status is being eroded has gained momentum lately.\n\nA JP Morgan report from October points out that, “Some signs of de-dollarisation are evident in the commodities space, where energy transactions are increasingly priced in non-USD currencies. For example, Russian oil products exported eastward and southward are being sold in the local currencies of buyers or in currencies of countries that Russia perceives as friendly. Elsewhere, India, China and Turkey are all either using or seeking alternatives to the greenback.”\n\nNatasha Kaneva, head of global commodities strategy at JP Morgan, further explained in the same report, “Most of the world’s oil still sells for dollars. But with Russia, the world’s second largest exporter of oil, selling its petroleum exports in the local currencies of its customers, other producers might find themselves following suit.”\n\nIn addition, central banks, especially those in emerging markets, are increasing their gold holdings in a bid to diversify away from a USD-centric financial system. According to JP Morgan, central banks collectively bought a net 1,136 tonnes of gold in 2022, the highest annual demand on record, and another 1,037 tonnes in 2023.\n\n“This reduces their need for precautionary reserves of US dollars and US Treasuries, which in turn frees up capital to be deployed in growth-boosting domestic projects,” it said. Globally, new payment systems are also evolving rapidly and facilitating cross-border transactions without the involvement of US banks.\n\nFor instance, Project mBridge is a multi-central bank digital currency platform that connects central and commercial banks across China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia without relying on the dollar.\n\nSimilarly, the US dollar’s share of foreign exchange reserves, the most commonly analysed barometer of dollar dominance, has decreased, notably in emerging markets. Central bank reserves are typically held in dollars, but they are now being supplanted by other currencies. “All in all, while global trade and foreign exchange reserves have flatlined, the dollar still retains its influence in this space, especially when taking into account other factors including dollar-denominated bank deposits, foreign exchange volumes and trade invoicing,” the report said.\n\nThough these developments underline the diminishing influence of the US in the international monetary system, the dollar hegemony remains intact for now. None of this means the dollar will disappear overnight. It remains deeply embedded in global finance, though its gravitational pull is weakening.\n\nNonetheless, the dollar dominance in the international monetary system will be undermined if Trump’s re-industrialisation project effectively impedes the export of its currency to provide liquidity to meet growing global demand.\n\nAs pointed out recently by Han Heyuan, Senior Research Fellow and Vice-Chairman of Guangdong Association of Productivity Science, in an article, “The US has to choose between implementing its re-industrialisation strategy and safeguarding the dollar hegemony: if the US picks the former, this implies that dollar hegemony will crumble — the country will no longer be able to export dollars via international trade deficits and current account deficits. If the US chooses the latter, it must accept the fact that its manufacturing sector will continue to weaken, because that is how the dollar can be exported.”\n\nThat said, Trump’s re-industrialisation plans would also likely meet other impediments. “Manufacturing does not occur in a vacuum. It requires infrastructure, capital – and above all, labour. And herein lies the first, glaring inconsistency in America’s re-industrial dreamscape. The country simply does not have the workforce it needs to realise this vision,” points out an op-ed published by The Brussels Morning Newspaper.\n\nThe possibility of the dollar’s retreat affords an opportunity for diversification of reserve currencies should other economic powers like the European Union and China seize it. This would potentially free the Global South from the deep economic impacts of the volatility of the American currency.\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 19th, 2025","summary":"The overriding objective of President Donald Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs — most of which remain suspended until July while the White House renegotiates trade deals with dozens of countries running trade surpluses with America — is to re-industrialise America and bring blue-collar jobs back by rebuilding its manufacturing base.\n\n\n\nBut that will not be possible for him without severely impairing — even if not completely knocking down — the very foundations that have for decades underpinned the US’s global economic dominance: the hegemony of the dollar in the international monetary system.\n\n\n\nHerein lies the US’s Triffin dilemma, which explains the burdens of being a reserve currency issuer.

He noted that currently about 70 per cent of its toys and other consumer and industrial goods were sold to the US.\nHe said that the company’s contracts with American clients stipulated that any such costs for goods that had left mainland Chinese ports would be borne by importers.\nThe business was also facing urgent orders from US importers looking to take advantage of the 90-day pause, he said, adding production could take as little as 45 to 50 days.\nChan said the company would press ahead with setting up a new factory in Indonesia later this year and would expand to other markets, such as Europe and the Middle East.\nHe added the 145 per cent tariffs could lead to a 30 to 40 per cent decline in the company’s sales target this year, but being able to ship again during the pause would help alleviate the impact.\nJoan Collar, chief commercial officer at Marsh McLennan Asia, a professional services company specialising in risk, strategy and people, said diversification was once again key to survival for businesses.\n“Seeking alternative markets, understanding the supply chain exposures and protecting against them with the right level of insurance tools, and finally, supporting the talent labour will be key in Greater China, and certainly Hong Kong, to ride through the tariff wave,” she said.","summary":"Industry veterans say they are urgently pressing ahead with plans to diversify production locations to mitigate geopolitical risks.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3310834/us-importers-urging-hong-kong-manufacturers-bypass-levies-amid-trade-war","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/18/6e182b2e-9b99-41ec-b7a7-f9c17014802c_b84876e8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:30:12","author":"Denise Tsang,Lam Ka-sing","authors":["Denise Tsang","Lam Ka-sing"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":322692850,"title":"Illinois Officials React to Former President Joe Biden’s Prostate Cancer Diagnosis","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — Political figures and officials from Chicago and Illinois swiftly reacted on Sunday to the announcement of former President Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis.\n\nBiden’s office made the announcement in a statement, saying he is facing an “aggressive” form of the disease that has spread to his bones.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7.

This is good country.’ There is no bad or good. We're all human beings, and we just have to support each other. We need to find ways to, let's say, negotiate things. Find ways to agree on things, you know? Because from my experience, there is always, you know, a gold medal, I'm calling it — like, there's always the right path.”\n\nShwartzman was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, and raised in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He began racing go-karts when he was 4 years old, and eventually, his budding career in motorsports took him to Italy and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nHe's a former member of the Ferrari Driver Academy and served as a Formula 1 reserve driver until just last year.\n\nIn November, he was hired by Italy-based Prema Racing as one of two drivers for its nascent IndyCar program. He'd never raced on an oval before arriving at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds can reach up to 240 mph on the straightaways, and he was considered an afterthought to qualify anywhere near the front of the prestigious Indy 500.\n\nShwartzman was surprised by the raucous cheer he received upon winning the pole — and really, the reception he has had among American racing fans throughout the month — given the way he was treated by many fans in Europe.\n\n“Here, I feel really good with the fans. In my couple years in Europe, it was a bit more tense for me, I have to admit,” Shwartzman said. “Some fans supported me but some were against me. There were very tough moments in my life where I didn't do anything bad. I didn't support anything. I generally support people from my country, but all people with respect, and some people were saying bad things just because of where I was born.”\n\nPerhaps those experiences were one of the reasons why Shwartzman was so vocal in asking for peace on Sunday.\n\n“I really hope that at the end of the day, everything’s going to be good in the world. It’s going to be all calm,” he said. “From my side, I try to just, you know, represent my country and do my best, let people know that I’m here and that I’m giving it all.”\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing","summary":"Israeli-born IndyCar driver Robert Shwartzman won the pole for the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, then used his platform to ask for peace in both the Middle East and Eastern Europe","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/indianapolis-middle-east-indycar-israeli-ukraine-b2753463.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/19/01/IndyCar_Indy_500_Auto_Racing_59755.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:26:53","author":"Dave Skretta","authors":["Dave Skretta"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.156},{"id":322694412,"title":"Former US President Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' form of prostate cancer","text":"The GuardianMorning Mail: Israel launches new Gaza assault; NSW police ‘extraordinary’ search power; Biden’s cancer diagnosis‘Extensive’ operation planned by Israeli forces in Gaza; Teams app took students biometric data; Labor eyes productivity reforms\n\nThe IndependentTrump ‘saddened’ to hear about Biden’s cancer diagnosis and sends ‘warm wishes’ from him and Melania‘We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,’ Trump says\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nHuffPost UKNearly Half Of Brits Feel Like 'Strangers In Their Own Country', New Poll RevealsFindings come after Keir Starmer sparked a row by saying the same thing last week.\n\nCNNWatch Pope Leo XIV’s inaugural Mass in St. Peter’s SquarePope Leo XIV called for a “united Church” in his inauguration homily from St. Peter’s Square where approximately 100,000 people had gathered at the start of the Mass, according to authorities.\n\nThe HillVance greets Pope Leo XIV in Vatican CityVice President Vance and second lady Usha Vance met Pope Leo XIV while in Vatican City for the pontiff’s inauguration mass on Sunday.

Portugal's third general election in three years dashed hopes that the ballot could end the worst spell of political instability for decades in the European Union country of 10.6 million people. Also Read | NSA Ajit Doval Holds Talk With Iran's NSC Secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian, Affirms India's Interest in Expanding Bilateral Ties. Also, an increasing wave of support for Chega (Enough), a populist party which may yet claim second place with its focus on curbing immigration and cracking down on corruption, added further uncertainty to Portugal's political climate. With 99.2% of votes counted, the Democratic Alliance captured at least 89 seats in the 230-seat National Assembly, Portugal's Parliament. It had been in power for less than a year when it was ousted in a confidence vote in March. It collected 80 seats in last year's election and served as a minority government.

Democratic Alliance leader Luis Montenegro, the incumbent prime minister, indicated he would be open to political deals with opposition parties. \"We all have to be able to speak to each other and put the national interest first,\" he said in a post-election speech to supporters. Seven smaller parties also won seats. Without a majority of seats the Democratic Alliance, led by the Social Democratic Party, can try to recruit support from smaller parties, currently seen as unlikely, or take office as a minority government as it did during its last term. That leaves it at the mercy of opposition parties combining to bring it down, as happened two months ago. Public frustration with Portugal's main parties has brought an increasingly fragmented political landscape and defied efforts to unite behind policies on pressing national issues such as immigration, housing and the cost of living. In a dramatic demonstration of the changing complexion of Portuguese politics, support for the populist party Chega surged once again. It collected at least 58 seats, up from 50 seats last year, and is challenging the center-left Socialists as Portugal's second-biggest party. Chega competed in its first election just six years ago, when it won one seat, and has fed off disaffection with the more moderate traditional parties. Campaigning under the slogan “Save Portugal,” it describes itself as a nationalist party and has drawn on the popularity of its leader, lawyer and former soccer pundit Andre Ventura. “This is my moment,” Ventura said. “It's a great victory for Chega.” He opened the door to an understanding with the Democratic Alliance, saying the country needs stability. For the past 50 years, the Social Democrats and the Socialist Party have alternated in power. The Socialists were contemplating possibly their worst result since 1987, also gaining 58 seats. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced he was standing down, saying: “These are tough, difficult times for the Socialist Party.” The center-right alliance led opinion polls The Democratic Alliance, which also includes the smaller Popular Party, lost a confidence vote in parliament in March after less than a year in power, as opposition lawmakers teamed up against it. That triggered an early election, which had been due in 2028. The confidence vote was sparked by a political storm around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Social Democratic Prime Minister Luís Montenegro's family law firm. Montenegro has denied any wrongdoing and is standing for reelection. Corruption scandals have dogged Portuguese politics in recent years. That has helped fuel the rise of Chega, whose leader Ventura says he has “zero tolerance” for misconduct in office. But Chega has recently fallen foul of its own lawmakers' alleged wrongdoing. One is suspected of stealing suitcases from the Lisbon airport and selling the contents online, and another allegedly faked the signature of a dead woman. Both resigned. Immigration and housing are key issues Chega owes much of its success to its demands for a tighter immigration policy that have resonated with voters. Portugal has witnessed a steep rise in immigration. In 2018, there were fewer than a half-million legal immigrants in the country, according to government statistics. By early this year, there were more than 1.5 million, many of them Brazilians and Asians working in tourism and farming. Thousands more lack the proper documents to be in Portugal. The outgoing government announced two weeks before the election that it was expelling about 18,000 foreigners living in the country without authorization. Though such a step is routine, the timing drew accusations that it was trying to capture votes from Chega. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, who is also standing for prime minister, described the move as a “Trumpification” of Portuguese politics, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's focus on immigration policies. A housing crisis has also fired up debate. House prices and rents have been soaring for the past 10 years, due in part to an influx of white-collar foreigners who have driven up prices. House prices jumped another 9% last year, said the National Statistics Institute, a government body. Rents in and around the capital Lisbon, where around 1.5 million people live, last year saw the steepest rise in 30 years, climbing more than 7%, the institute said. The problem is compounded by Portugal being one of Western Europe's poorest countries. The average monthly salary last year was around 1,200 euros ($1,340) before tax, according to the statistics agency. The government-set minimum wage this year is 870 euros ($974) a month before tax.

The renminbi has always been held up as one of the possible alternatives, and it’s growing.”\nBut to push back against the dollar, China must “deepen” its financial markets so foreigners can better access yuan-denominated stocks, bonds and other assets, Khor said. New yuan-backed asset classes would also help, he added.\nHe cited, as a model, China’s existing “connect” schemes with Hong Kong, through which foreign investors can buy mainland Chinese bonds and stocks without special licences.\nConvertibility remains another concern among investors outside the mainland, he added.\n“You can probably open it up more,” Khor said. “If you’re going to encourage people to hold your currency, you need to have assets to back it up, and it needs to be convertible.”\n\nBeijing, though it limits capital outflows, has long sought to turn the yuan into a global currency to help foster an environment for its economic development.\nThe dollar experienced a sell-off last month as US President Donald Trump’s government imposed import tariffs on much of the world, particularly China, before suspending most.\nAsia has girded itself against crises by fully preparing its now 25-year-old Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) currency swap, Khor said.\nThe US$240 billion CMIM scheme, which covers the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), China, Japan and South Korea, offers emergency help to countries facing balance-of-payments issues and short-term liquidity problems.\nThe initiative has already weathered 15 tests, Khor said, bolstering its capacity to lend as much as US$11 billion with just a few weeks’ notice and without International Monetary Fund approval.\n“We are waiting for the right moment when one of the members decides they would like to take advantage of this,” he said.\nNo one has used the scheme yet, Khor said. Even during the pandemic when containment measures hurt Asian economies, he said, no one needed a hand.\n\nEast Asian economies, including China, will get by even if Trump’s tariffs resume after 90-day pauses that are due to end in July, the economist said.\nThat is because the United States accounts for just 15 per cent of global trade, he said, while most other players are “committed to a rules-based system” that would exclude sudden, sweeping tariffs.\n“I think the system is bigger than Trump,” Khor said. “Although the US is big, it’s not that big. I think [the system] can survive, but in the short term, there’s a lot of disruption, and countries have to deal with it.”\nTrump’s tariff pauses have reduced pressure on Asian exporters to dump goods into non-US markets, the economist added.\nMoving forwards, Khor said, Asian countries should look into trading more among themselves, especially in services such as healthcare and finance.\nBut as the US negotiates with many exporting Asian countries over tariffs during the 90-day pauses, he said, most Asian governments will downplay their role in the transshipping of made-in-China goods to the American market. He expected producers to raise the localised content of exports so that the US would not label those goods as Chinese.\nAsean members Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand have attracted a slew of Chinese manufacturing investment since Trump’s first term in 2018 to avoid tariffs targeting China.\nWhen tariff pauses end in July, Khor said, it will “hopefully [be] a positive shock”.","summary":"‘US exceptionalism is over – the beginning of the end,’ Singapore-based economist warns while weighing in on how China can internationalise its currency.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3310638/chinas-yuan-fit-rival-us-dollar-global-currency-if-more-accessible-economist","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/16/affe49cd-9c64-4b12-8257-22b3da7f6def_0531eabc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-19 00:00:14","author":"Ralph Jennings","authors":["Ralph Jennings"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":322691504,"title":"How US Crypto Firms Navigate Trump’s New Playbook","text":"Photo by MLADEN ANTONOV/AFP via Getty Images\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nCrypto has long thrived in the gray zone between innovation and oversight. As US policymakers push for structure, the industry faces a moment that could unlock scale, capital, and global relevance.\n\nFollowing multiple conversations with industry leaders and perspectives from my work with the Crypto Council for Innovation, a global alliance of leading crypto industry organizations dedicated to advancing innovation and advocating for responsible, inclusive regulation of digital assets worldwide, there is a turning point: upcoming frameworks that will guide crypto’s next phase.\n\nReframing US Crypto Policy toward Regulatory Clarity\n\nThree days into his second term, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order. The January 23 “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” order rescinds a 2022 directive issued under President Joe Biden. It overturned a 2022 Biden-era directive, replacing a primarily enforcement-led posture with a new strategy focused on proactive governance. In an unprecedented move on March 6, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Funded with seized Bitcoin from criminal cases, the reserve won’t be sold but held as a long-term strategic asset.\n\nThe SEC reorganized its crypto oversight efforts into the “Cyber and Emerging Technology Unit,” a pivot toward long-term rulemaking, and launched a task force to develop a “comprehensive and clear regulatory framework.” SEC Chair Hester Peirce said the goal is to allow businesses the “freedom to experiment and build interesting things”. In April, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche ordered the immediate disbanding of the Department of Justice’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET). The decision, outlined in a four-page memo titled “Ending Regulation By Prosecution” on April 7, marks a clear break from the previous administration’s approach.\n\nThe GENIUS Act, proposed first in February 2025, is Washington’s first serious attempt to bring stablecoins—the “digital dollars” quietly powering crypto markets—under a clear, federally backed regulatory framework (US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 2025). At the time of writing, roughly $243 billion in stablecoins were circulating globally, over 90% dollar-denominated. The bill proposed strict reserve, audit, and transparency standards for stablecoins, banning claims of government backing. Though the GENIUS Act didn’t pass in May 2025, it sparked rare bipartisan momentum and paved the way for future consumer-focused crypto legislation.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Do Not Reply To These Messages\n\nSamsung Makes New Free Offer To Millions Of Galaxy Phone Buyers\n\nBitcoin Price Suddenly Soars As Congress Predicted To ‘Make History’\n\nSo far, the impact has been palpable, and the crypto market saw a burst of deal activity and renewed investor enthusiasm. A headline example: the $3.6 billion merger between bitcoin firm Twenty One Capital and a SPAC led by Brandon Lutnick, son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, captures the mood: confident, opportunistic, and ready to scale. Companies are moving quickly to capitalize on a climate ripe for innovation, public listings, and growth in digital assets.\n\nThis shift in tone hasn’t gone unnoticed: it’s already transforming how firms approach infrastructure, legal strategy, and institutional trust.\n\nRegulatory Clarity Breathes New Life into Infrastructure Expansion\n\nThis adjustment in policy tone has already triggered tangible change on the ground. Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov sees the SEC’s updated stance on proof-of-work mining as a catalyst: “The SEC's clarification that certain proof-of-work mining activities are not subject to securities regulations could reduce compliance burdens for miners. This shift and the broader approach to crypto regulation have opened new opportunities to accelerate the most ambitious parts of our roadmap.”\n\nFor Hydyrov, establishing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve is a major catalyst. “Establishing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve signals growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, potentially encouraging further investment in mining infrastructure.”\n\nStill, Hydyrov is not abandoning caution. “We are scaling targeted investments, particularly in regions that previously carried higher regulatory risks. However, we maintain a disciplined approach: regulatory cycles are inherently unpredictable... We view the current climate not as a reason to slow down or become complacent, but as an opportunity to expand thoughtfully while preparing for potential shifts in global policy.”\n\nLegal Realignment and Equitable Access\n\nAs the regulatory fog lifts, the legal frameworks governing market participation are also being redefined. Frank Hepworth, founder of Yieldschool and former regulatory attorney, sees the policy pivot as a structural green light for decentralized models: “It's a signal. On-chain businesses do not want their tokens to trade on SEC-regulated platforms... the administration is giving the nod for any competitive advantage to go ahead and run in the market. Consequently, with the risk of punishment being lessened, we can expect more businesses to be going on-chain now.”\n\nAnd that shift, he argues, is upending the traditional regulatory complex. “Several notable crypto attorneys like Gabriel Shapiro have commented that this administration is BAD for their profession, but a strong net positive... I agree with this.”\n\nBut Hepworth’s sharpest critique targets outdated access rules: \"Voluntary compliance is healthy... But mandating the regulation leads to the unequal outcomes that define US wealth inequality.\" His vision? “It should be crypto-led and crypto-native in its design.”\n\nSo, as legal structures open up and on-chain innovation accelerates, the next barrier becomes psychological: institutional trust. That’s where the industry is now, setting its own standards.\n\nTransparency as a Hedge Against Uncertainty\n\nEven as regulation becomes clearer, it hasn’t yet become complete. And in that interim space, trust must be actively built. GT Protocol, led by Peter Ionov, navigates that very edge. “Yes, the deregulatory trend has sent mixed signals to the market. On one hand, loosening regulatory control is often seen as a green light for innovation... On the other, the lack of clear regulatory frameworks raises concerns among institutional players.”\n\nIonov says investor responses split along familiar lines: “It largely depends on the type of investor. More agile, risk-tolerant entities... may see this as an opportunity window. In contrast, traditional financial institutions... tend to remain cautious, awaiting more clarity.”\n\nRight now, the market-led approach to confidence-building enables responsible innovation, especially in sectors looking to modernize legacy systems: “The industry is shifting toward transparency as a core trust-building mechanism... Companies are open-sourcing code, publishing audit reports, and collaborating with licensed providers.”\n\nLighter Regulation as a Catalyst for Economic Evolution\n\nWith transparency strengthening investor confidence and access expanding through legal innovation, the stage is set for the next phase: scaling bold ideas. For Construct Koin, that means using AI and blockchain to transform real estate finance. Co-founder Chris Baldrey-Chourio explains: “Lightening the regulatory load doesn’t mean abandoning rules. It means creating space for real-world solutions to scale.”\n\nBut with global competitors—like the EU and Singapore—accelerating their own crypto strategies, he offers a warning: “America’s got the lead now, but that edge won’t last without action,” he adds, citing growing global momentum around central bank digital currencies and stablecoin standards.\n\nHe’s cautious about overreach but sees reduced enforcement as a catalyst for experimentation, if paired with collaboration. “We need regulators and builders at the same table,” he says. “That’s how you protect consumers and still let breakthroughs happen.”\n\nAnd that dialogue must be grounded in shared principles and ethics, not just shared interests.\n\nCentering Ethics Amid the Policy Whiplash\n\nBringing the conversation in full circle, Andrea Perlak, CPA and founder of Crypto Accounting Group, contends, “Organizations and industries within the Web3 industry are, and have been, focused on high ethical standards since inception... Unethical behavior within the industry is reviled, and in a small industry, a bad reputation has a lasting impact.”\n\nShe rebuts the myth that decentralization means chaos. “Decentralization and accountability are not mutually exclusive concepts... Through transparency, multiple layers of governance, and incentives, these systems thrive.”\n\nThe narrative of deregulation misses the mark, as Perlak points out, “The concept that the crypto industry is being deregulated is a misnomer... 'Regulation by enforcement' was rampant under the prior administration... Once proper legislation exists, the industry will sigh relief.”\n\nFinally, with real frameworks on the horizon, the industry isn’t dodging oversight—it’s ready to meet it on solid ground.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTogether, these voices reflect a growing sector moving from confusion to shared standards, and from closed systems to open, ethical innovation. If the industry seizes this window to lead with transparency, ethics, and inclusivity, not because it's required but because it's right, it could redraw the blueprint of modern finance\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Crypto has long thrived in the gray zone between innovation and oversight.

More progress will be reversed if automotive trade negotiations result in a roll back of safety standards.\nGlobal NCAP\n\nCurrent disputes over tariffs and trade in automobiles could have an adverse impact on well-established global vehicle safety standards that could put everyone on the world’s roads at risk – including pedestrians and children – making them victims of trade wars.\n\nThat devastating scenario motivated twenty-three regional, national, and international road safety organizations to address how progress will be reversed if automotive trade negotiations result in a roll back of safety standards.\n\n“We believe that it is extremely important not to confuse well-established global regulations with alleged ‘unfair’ trade practices,” the safety experts wrote in a joint letter to Juan Carlos Muñoz, president of the International Transport Forum (ITF), a Paris-based intergovernmental organization with 69 member countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe letter was sent to Dr. Muñoz, who is also minister of transport and telecommunications for Chile, to share with fellow transport ministers from around the world, at the ITF’s annual summit “Transport Resilience to Global Shocks” in Leipzig, Germany, from Wednesday, May 21 through Friday, May 23.\n\nDavid Ward, president emeritus of the Global New Car Assessment Program (Global NCAP), a nonprofit based in London and one of the signatories of the letter, answered questions for Forbes. His responses were edited for clarity and length.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nFBI Warns iPhone, Android Users—Do Not Reply To These Messages\n\nSamsung Makes New Free Offer To Millions Of Galaxy Phone Buyers\n\nBitcoin Price Suddenly Soars As Congress Predicted To ‘Make History’\n\nForbes: What’s the goal of the letter?\n\nWard: To encourage transport ministers to push to maintain existing regulatory standards and make better use of the UN’s global framework for vehicle regulations, which both promote safer cars and cross-border trade.\n\n(For example, the letter stated, requirements for front and side crash tests, pedestrian protection, and electronic stability control, now commonly applied to passenger cars around the world, have for decades “delivered huge economies of scale, making safety affordable in markets around the world.”\n\nHow did the letter come about?\n\nMostly provoked by President Donald Trump’s claims that the so-called ‘bowling ball’ test is an unfair trade practice followed by threatened imposition of tariffs on many car producers. This concern was raised by leading European safety groups in a letter to the Financial Times on 31st March: President Von der Leyen urged to reject US vehicle standards in trade negotiations - ETSC. The latest joint letter is expressing similar sentiments, but from a global perspective.\n\n(In a recent post on his organization’s website, Mr. Ward quoted President Trump’s remarks made at the White House on April 7, 2025 : “It’s not only tariffs. It’s non-monetary tariffs. Its tariffs where they put things on that make it impossible for you to sell a car. It’s not a money thing. They make it so difficult, the standards and the tests. They drop the bowling ball on the top of your car from 20 feet up in the air and if there's a little dent they say no, I'm sorry, your car doesn't qualify.”)\n\nWhere do things stand currently regarding tariffs and trade disputes in the automotive industry? Is there any indication that these negotiations might impact safety standards?\n\nIt is too early to say and the trade disputes are on-going. The UK has stuck a deal involving autos with quotas that have cut the threatened US tariffs from 25% to 10%. It is not clear what kind of market access this will give US car makers, but the problem remains that they do not apply pedestrian protection standards that are required in the UK.\n\nWhat’s the worst case scenario and how would this impact well-established global vehicle safety standards?\n\nThe most vulnerable regulatory standard – because it is not applied in the US – is the pedestrian protection test requirements, which are now applied in China, India, the European Union (27 member states), Japan, South Korea and the UK. Another risk is that countries are discouraged from using the UN framework of vehicle regulations out of fear that it will provoke US retaliation.\n\n(From the letter: “Recently, Donald Trump, the President of the United States (US), criticized the pedestrian protection regulation claiming that it was being used to block trade in US made cars. In fact, the test – available since 2008 as a UN regulation– aims to soften the bonnet hood and bumper area to reduce the risk of injury to head, chest and leg of a pedestrian struck by a car.”)\n\nThe letter mentions the importance of leveling up vehicle safety standards. How would that positively impact international import and export trade in automobiles from the US's perspective?\n\nIf the US applied the pedestrian protection regulation, it could no longer be used as a way to block US car imports. In principle, greater harmonization of global regulatory standards improves cross-border trade and boosts economies of scale so that safer cars are more affordable.\n\nThe US is a lone wolf among major car producing countries for not yet applying the pedestrian protection regulation to reduce the risk of injury to head, chest and leg in a crash. Is the proposed action to apply the standard in the US at risk, and if yes, how would that likely impact trade in US made cars?\n\nWe are waiting to see if US Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is going to roll back on the pedestrian protection proposed rule making introduced by his predecessor. It will also be interesting to see if pedestrian protection is retained in the upgraded specification for the US NCAP tests scheduled for 2026.\n\n(From the letter: \"Unfortunately, the US stands alone as the only major car producing country that does not yet apply this well-known standard. However, this was about to change. Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed action on pedestrian protection, introducing a draft federal rule and including the test in the US New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) from 2026. The easiest way, therefore, for the US to improve market access for its cars is for the NHTSA to implement the pedestrian protection standard already applied by its major competitors.”)\n\nThe signatories recommended several actions to the ITF transport ministers, such as refraining from including vehicle safety standards in their negotiations over tariffs and trade, to ensure automotive trade negotiations will not compromise safety and endanger the public.\n\nNegotiations, the safety groups stressed, have the potential to improve both road safety and international trade in automobiles.\n\nTo learn more and read the full letter, click here.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

Email: john.james@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM BEDFORD \n Published:00:46 BST, 19 May 2025 |Updated:00:51 BST, 19 May 2025 \n\nA retired beautician has lost her house after being forced to pay her neighbour's legal bills in a bitter dispute over a £300 garden fence.\nMuriel Middle, 79, who worked for Selfridges and Boots, expected that one day her £200,000 home would pass to her only daughter Sam.\nBut Sam, a firefighter, has been forced to step in and buy the two-bedroom property to save her mum from potential bankruptcy.\nWidow Muriel lived happily at the mid-terrace house in Pontyclun, South Wales, for 20 years.\nThen businessman Alexander Miles moved in next door and started making renovations. He built an extension in his back garden and removed part of a fence between the two properties so he could access a drainpipe.\nThe row started when Mrs Middle argued that the drainpipe was on her land and she brought in contractors to replace the missing fencing panels.\nThe fence feud became so bitter that police were called to calm the angry neighbours who almost came to blows over the garden fence.\nMr Miles, who owns a pillow factory, argued that the fence was his and the replacement panels didn't match in colour or size.\n\nA retired beautician has lost her house after being forced to pay her neighbour's legal bills in a bitter dispute over a £300 garden fence\n\nMuriel Middle, 79, has faced potential bankruptcy over the row and was forced to rely on her daughter for help\n\nBusinessman Alexander Miles moved in next door and started making renovations including removing a section of their fence \n\nMr Miles, who owns a pillow factory, argued that the fence was his and the replacement panels didn't match in colour or size\nThe ownership dispute was heard at the Cardiff Civil Justice centre last summer where Mrs Middle and her daughter had no legal representation because they couldn't afford it.\nThe case was partially upheld in Mr Miles's favour and Mrs Middle was ordered to pay £15,000 of his legal costs.\nThat amount has now grown to £20,000 and Mrs Middle, a widow since the age of 39, has been taken back to court.\nHer statement given to the hearing said: 'How I find myself in court defending myself I do not understand. I have done nothing wrong and broken no laws.\n'I've not had the easiest life. My first daughter and my husband died and I was left to raise my remaining daughter on my own.\n'As devastating as that was, I can honestly say I have never encountered the stress this has put me under.'\nIt has made life more difficult for Mrs Middle living next door to the man who she says 'ruined my life'.\nClose to tears she said she would have never got through the ordeal without the support of her only daughter.\nSam, a firefighter with South Wales Fire and Rescue service, said: 'This has absolutely crushed us. It has left my mother needing to sell her home after working hard all her life.\n'She is too old to remortgage so she had to sell the house to me to free funds to be able to pay this debt. None of this should ever have happened.'\nThe remortgage was completed last week and the mother and daughter are now planning to sell the property to get away from their neighbour.\n\nThe row has split the neighbours down the middle in more respects than their boundaries \n\nNow Muriel's daughter Sam has been forced to step in and buy the two-bedroom property to save her mum\nMrs Middle told Mail Online: 'I don't think I'm going to last much longer after going through this for the last couple of years. I just feel ill all the time.\n'I tried to get a loan and equity release, the only way to do it was to gift the property to my daughter so she could get a mortgage to pay the debt off.\n'I feel like I've had no justice whatsoever. It's so far-fetched it's hard to believe.\n'This man next door has made my life a living hell, the only thing I did was to replace a portion of the fence, 11 planks of wood, and he took out an injunction against me because it was the wrong colour.\n'If you replace wood panels you're not going to get the same colour, the existing ones will always be faded.\n'I couldn't afford legal representation and because I don't know how to use a computer I feel as if I've been discriminated against.'\nMrs Middle said a judge described Mr Miles's original legal fees of £45,000 as 'extortionate' and knocked them down to £15,000.\nShe added: 'At my age I thought I'd be able to relax a bit. But this worry has been hanging over me and even taking the drastic step of Sam getting a mortgage on the property it hasn't gone away.\n'I can't afford anything at all, not even a cup of coffee if I go to the shops.'\nMr Miles declined to comment. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI've lost my home after a war with my neighbour over our £300 garden fence… now I can't even afford a cup of coffee - I'm crushed\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Generally, the higher the score, the more aggressive the cancer is.\n\nTo determine a Gleason score, doctors examine prostate tissue samples collected during a biopsy and assign a grade from one through five to the two most common patterns of cancer cells they find.\n\nThe physicians then add the two numbers up to determine the Gleason score.\n\nLower scores, those of six or below, suggest the cancer is spreading slowly; while a score of seven indicates an intermediate risk of an aggressive cancer.\n\nHigher scores – those eight and above – suggest the cancer will spread rapidly and present more complications.\n\nThe scores help doctors determine the most appropriate treatment plan for each patient and can help predict the likelihood of survival.\n\nHowever, doctors also take into account other factors – like the patient’s overall health. \n\nIn Biden’s case, a score of nine indicates doctors found two of the most aggressive cancer cells in his pancreas.\n\nWhat does it mean that Biden’s cancer is a Grade Group of 5?\n\nIn recent years, some physicians have moved away from the Gleason score in favor of the Grade Group method.\n\nGrade Groups range from one – meaning the cancer is the most likely going to grow and spread slowly throughout the body – to a five – meaning that it is the most likely to grow and spread quickly.\n\nWhat does it mean that the cancer has spread to his bones?\n\nIf prostate cancer has metastasized to the bones, it means that the cancer cells have detached from the original tumor and spread through the blood stream or lymphatic system to one’s bones.\n\nThere, the cancer cells form new tumors.\n\nThat can create its own set of problems – causing significant bone pain and weakening the bones, which would increase the risk of fractures, the Cleveland Clinic notes.\n\nIf the cancer winds up spreading to the spine, it can also compress the spinal cord – which can lead to nerve damage and potentially even paralysis.\n\nBone metastasis can also cause the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream, which can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting and confusion.\n\nBone metastasis is considered an advanced form of prostate cancer. \n\nSo why does the fact that Biden’s cancer is hormone-sensitive provide some hope?\n\nWhen prostate cancer is described as being ‘hormone-sensitive’ that means that the growth and spread of the cancer are being fueled by male hormones called androgens that are primarily testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.\n\nThe prostate cells possess androgen receptors, which the androgens bind to and promote the expression of genes that stimulate cell growth and proliferation. In patients with prostate cancer, though, the androgens promote cancerous cell growth.\n\nHormone-sensitive prostate cancers are therefore dependent on these androgens to grow and survive – which makes it a target for hormone therapy, also called androgen deprivation therapy. \n\nThe therapy aims to reduce androgen levels or block their action, effectively stopping the cancer cells from growing.\n\nHowever, many prostate cancers eventually develop a resistance to the therapy and continue to grow despite the low androgen levels.\n\nIn that case, second-line therapies like chemotherapy, targeted treatments and radiopharmaceuticals may help keep the cancer at bay. \n\nHow common is prostate cancer?\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death among men in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. \n\nThe organization estimates one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetimes, though the risk of developing the cancer may depend on their age, race, ethnicity and genetic predisposition to the disease.\n\nMen over the age of 50 have a higher chance of being diagnosed, though the American Cancer Society says more than half of the diagnoses are found in men over the age of 65. \n\nSmoking, diet and chemical exposures can also increase the chance that a male develops prostate cancer.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of prostate cancer?\n\nEarly symptoms of prostate cancer include blood in the urine or the semen, and bladder problems like needing to urinate more frequently or having difficulty doing so.\n\nIn later stages, men may experience back and bone pain, erectile dysfunction, limb weakness and weight loss, the American Cancer Society says.\n\nWhat is the prognosis?\n\nThe overall prognosis for prostate cancer is among the best of all cancers thanks to modern treatments that can shrink or control the cancer, relieve pain and prevent complications, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. \n\nIn fact, five years after a diagnosis the average prostate cancer patient is as likely as someone without prostate cancer to still be alive. \n\nSome men can even live more than 15 years after a diagnosis, particularly if the cancer responds well to the treatment, they are in good overall health and they start treatment early.\n\nHowever, when the cancer has metastasized – like Biden’s has – the average five-year survival rate is 28 percent. \n\nWhat can I do to catch the cancer early? \n\nDoctors recommend men get prostate cancer screening tests beginning at the age of 50 – though those with increased risk factors are encouraged to get screened earlier.\n\nProstate exams can include prostate-specific androgen blood tests or rectal exams. \n\nHow are people reacting to Biden’s diagnosis?

The election also comes at a fraught moment for Europe as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drags on, ties with Washington are under strain and far-right populists make electoral gains.\n\nThe far-right in Poland was no exception, with its two candidates, Eurosceptic multi-millionaire entrepreneur Slawomir Mentzen and ultra-nationalist MEP Grzegorz Braun, tipped to receive 21.6 percent between the two of them.\n\n“This is the greatest success in the history of our political camp,” Mentzen said.\n\nWojciech Przybylski, head of the Res Publica foundation, said the far-right’s strong showing “means that Trzaskowski can’t be absolutely sure of winning.” \n\n“The runoff result will depend on turnout and mobilization among youths who voted for Mentzen” and leftist candidate Adrian Zandberg, he told AFP. \n\nWojciech Kuras, 44, said he did not vote for Trzaskowski but might in the runoff. \n\n“It will be hard for Rafal Trzaskowski. This is such a difficult result because if others join together it can be equal,” said the entrepreneur from Sandomierz. \n\n‘All or Nothing’ \n\nPrime Minister Tusk said an “all-or-nothing” battle had begun.\n\n“It will be a tough fight for every vote. These two weeks will decide the future of our homeland,” he said on social media. \n\nPolitical scientist Ewa Marciniak said the electoral campaign would be “brutal”. \n\n“Each candidate will try to discredit his rival at all costs, by any means necessary,” she told AFP. \n\nSo far, the electoral campaign in the EU and NATO member largely revolved around foreign policy, showcasing a clash of philosophies over Poland’s engagement with the EU and the United States.\n\nBut social issues have also played a part.\n\nTrzaskowski, 53, has promised to support abortion and LGBTQ rights.\n\n“These elections are about rights for women and minorities... They are about security in the European Union,” said Anna Rusztynska-Wolska, a 69-year-old doctor, after voting.\n\nThe former ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which backs Nawrocki, was frequently at odds with Poland’s Western allies and EU institutions in Brussels over rule-of-law concerns.\n\nNawrocki, 42, is an admirer of US President Donald Trump. He said Trump told him “You will win” when they met at the White House earlier this month.\n\nThe key to the election could be whether supporters of Mentzen, the far-right candidate who came third in the exit poll with 15.4 percent, back Nawrocki in the second round.\n\nMentzen is a Euro-skeptic libertarian staunchly opposed to abortion and migrants. \n\nHe has accused the country’s one million Ukrainians of taking advantage of Poland.\n\nHigh stakes for Europe \n\nThe governing coalition is hopeful a Trzaskowski victory would enable it to carry out undelivered campaign pledges.\n\nTusk’s administration has been prevented from easing Poland’s stringent abortion laws by the president’s power of veto.\n\nPoland’s head of state is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, steers foreign policy and can introduce and veto legislation. The stakes are high for Europe. Under Tusk, Poland has grown more important on the continent, reinforcing its position as a key voice on NATO’s eastern flank against Russia.","summary":"A victory for the mayor would boost the centrist government led by former EU leader Donald Tusk.

Joe Biden, 82, was seen last week by doctors after urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Sunday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone. A spokesperson for Biden said on Sunday said: \"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” READ MORE: Joe Biden cancer explained: What is a Gleason score of 9 and how is it treated The shock diagnosis comes after the 82-year-old was admitted to hospital last week for the investigation of a \"prostate nodule\", news which, at the time, raised few eyebrows as doctors planned to conduct \"further evaluation\". Officials confirmed yesterday that the anomaly was grade 5 prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9 that had metastasised to the ex Commander-in-Chief's bones. Writing on Truth Social, Trump said: \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden ’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\" Trump’s fellow Republicans also commented on the news of Biden’s diagnosis. Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins said she was “saddened to hear of President Biden’s cancer diagnosis and am wishing him and his family well as he begins treatment.” North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis said he was “praying for his full recovery.” Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she was “sorry to see this news. Cancer is truly awful. My Dad passed away in 2021 with cancer. Prays for Joe Biden and his family.” Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, Biden's medical team has noted that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which could open up effective treatment options. Hormone therapy, often combined with other treatments like radiation or surgery, can be successful in managing such cases. Biden and his family are currently consulting with his healthcare team to determine the best course of action This latest diagnosis follows an earlier health update in 2023, when a cancerous skin lesion was successfully removed without requiring further treatment. As the former president navigates this difficult diagnosis, the nation watches anxiously, hoping for a positive outcome.

Technology names were some of the hardest hit with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling as much as 24% from recent highs.\n\nSector-specific concerns also hurt recent winners like artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NVDA 0.28%) and AI server provider Dell Technologies (DELL 3.08%). The fears about declining investments to build AI infrastructure may have been premature, though. The result could be a surge in stocks like Nvidia, Dell, and another under-the-radar AI play as the year progresses.\n\nAI investments grow\n\nOptimism is spreading as President Donald Trump has already rolled back some tariffs previously announced, including slashing tariffs on China from 145% to 30% for at least a 90-day negotiating period. That optimism should help companies continue to commit capital to build AI infrastructure.\n\nSome big tech names have already said they expect to maintain or even grow investments this year. One insider who believes data center usage will continue to grow is Blackstone president and chief operating officer Jonathan Gray. That private equity company has a unique perspective as it invests in a diverse range of technology companies.\n\nGray stated: \"I think this trend is powerful. I think it will continue,\" commenting on data center investments in a recent CNBC interview. He added that, \"overall, we still see a ton of demand.\"\n\nMuch of that demand is for Nvidia's advanced chips and AI software stacks. That view was reinforced when Nvidia announced a new major customer in Saudi Arabia. Humain, a newly launched Saudi Arabian AI company owned by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, plans to buy 18,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell chips along with Nvidia networking and the Omniverse cloud platform.\n\nThat's just the first phase of a projected 500 megawatt-capacity data center powered by hundreds of thousands of Nvidia GPUs over the next five years. That's just the latest example of Nvidia's long runway for growth.\n\nBenefiting along with Nvidia\n\nOrders such as that will also boost the future earnings of server providers like Dell Technologies. Dell isn't a pure AI play as it also sells personal computers, traditional servers, and provides a wide variety of technology products and services.\n\nIts growth driver, though, is from its AI-optimized server shipments. Those sales exploded to $2.1 billion in the latest quarter from $800 million in the year-ago period. Dell said it had a $4.1 billion AI backlog exiting the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter ended Jan. 31.\n\nDell is also returning capital to shareholders. It boosted its annual dividend by 18% in fiscal 2025 after a 20% increase in 2024. The current dividend represents a forward yield of nearly 2%, even after Dell shares have soared by more than 50% since early April. Its next quarterly earnings report is due on May 29, and investors might hear enough of an optimistic forecast from management to set the stock up for more gains in the back half of 2025.\n\nSharing the wealth with shareholders\n\nCuriosityStream (CURI 8.09%) isn't as well known to investors. As of this writing, it is still a small-cap company with a market capitalization of about $320 million.\n\nInvestors might wonder how a media and entertainment company like CuriosityStream could be an AI stock. The company was founded by John Hendricks, who also created and led The Discovery Channel's parent. CuriosityStream's mission is similar to that more well-known documentary cable channel: \"To satisfy humanity's enduring curiosity about our world with premium factual content that informs, enchants, and inspires.\"\n\nYet it has a catalog of factual content that is not just desired by consumers for entertainment, but also in high demand for AI large language model (LLM) training. The licensing revenue for CuriosityStream's content is now the growth story.\n\nRevenue growth prospects were good enough for management to initiate a dividend last year. It has since raised that payout several times and announced a one-time special dividend after reporting its first net profit in the first quarter. The balance sheet had $39 million in cash and equivalents along with no debt as of March 31, allowing CuriosityStream to deliver excess cash back to shareholders.\n\nManagement sees revenue continuing to increase in the second quarter with the midpoint of guidance implying 33% year-over-year growth. Adjusted free cash flow should also keep rising, allowing it to continue sharing leftover cash after investing in the business with shareholders. Its forward dividend yield was a healthy 5.7% at its recent price of $5.62 per share, not including the one-time payout coming in June.\n\nEach of these three stocks is benefiting greatly from rising AI spending. Nvidia may be the least risky of the three with so much business seemingly locked in for months and years to come. Investors have more recently caught on to CuriosityStream's story. Shares have doubled in just the last month. Some of its AI-related gains are already built in. But more risk-tolerant investors might still see it as an intriguing growth story as it should report increasing licensing revenue growth through the back half of the year.","summary":"One small media and entertainment stock has been soaring thanks to AI licensing.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/18/3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-that-may-soar/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F816801%2Fai-brain-on-computer-chip.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 23:30:00","author":"Howard Smith","authors":["Howard Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.143},{"id":322687248,"title":"‘Hands Across Chicagoland’ Rally: 30-Mile Protest Linking Aurora to Chicago via Ogden Avenue Opposes President Trump’s Policies","text":"LA GRANGE, Ill.

Deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers on the House Budget Committee in voting against reporting the measure to the full House. Five Republicans voted no, one on procedural grounds, the other four voicing concerns about the bill's impact on federal budget deficits.

Johnson expressed confidence the bill will advance out of the committee and be on the House floor by the end of the week. “This is the vehicle through which we will deliver on the mandate that the American people gave us in the last election,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” Also Read | Earthquake in Pakistan: Quake of Magnitude 4.7 on Richter Scale Jolts Swat, No Casualties Reported. The Republicans who criticized the measure noted that the bill's new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. For example, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill. “We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the committee. “Something needs to change, or you're not going to get my support.” Johnson said the start date for the work requirements was designed to give states time to “retool their systems” and to “make sure that all the new laws and all the new safeguards that we're placing can actually be enforced.” Roy was joined in voting no by Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia. Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania switched his vote to no in a procedural step so it could be reconsidered later, saying after the hearing he was confident Republicans would “get this done.” Johnson said talks to deal with their concerns were continuing Sunday. Remarkably, the vote against advancing the bill came after President Donald Trump had called on Republicans in a social media post to unite behind it. “We don't need GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party,\" Trump posted. \"STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!” At its core, the sprawling package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump's first term, in 2017, and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade. Democrats are overwhelmingly opposed to the measure, which Republicans have labeled “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act.\" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it, “one big, beautiful betrayal” in Friday's hearing. “This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told CNN's \"State of the Union' on Sunday. “There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that's what is happening here.” Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his conference. He's also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much large state and local tax deduction. As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what's currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year. Rep. Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers. If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult. Johnson said: “The package that we send over there will be one that was very carefully negotiated and delicately balanced, and we hope that they don't make many modifications to it because that will ensure its passage quickly.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the statement said.\n\nIt continued, “While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.”\n\nBiden, 82, and his family “are reviewing treatment options with his physicians,” the statement said.\n\nThe news comes days after a spokesperson for Biden said the former president was recently evaluated for a “small nodule” discovered on his prostate.\n\nProstate cancers can be assigned a grade, known as a Gleason score, based on what the cells look like under a microscope. A Gleason score of 9 “means it’s the most aggressive form of prostate cancer,” Dr. Benjamin Davies, a professor of urologic oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who is also not involved in Biden’s case, said in an email.\n\nBiden is at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, this weekend according to a source familiar. CNN has inquired about where the former president is being treated.\n\nBiden faced concerns over health during 2024 race\n\nConcerns about age and health dogged Biden, the oldest president in US history, throughout his time in office and came into sharper focus following his halting debate performance against Donald Trump last June.\n\nIn February 2024, Biden underwent a physical at Walter Reed National Military Center overseen by his physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor, who at the time said there were “no new concerns” with the president’s health and he was “fit for duty.”\n\nA new book written by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson describes how the president had been showing signs of decline that aides ignored or explained away, even before Biden’s disastrous debate that led to his decision to exit the 2024 election three weeks later.\n\nBiden has maintained a relatively low profile since leaving the White House but has slowly started to reemerge on the public stage. He appeared alongside his wife, Jill Biden, earlier this month on ABC’s “The View,” where he pushed back on suggestions he experienced cognitive decline in his final year in office.\n\n“They are wrong,” Joe Biden said. “There is nothing to sustain that.”\n\nThe former first lady added, “The people who wrote those books weren’t in the White House with us, and they didn’t see how hard Joe worked every single day. He’d get up, he’d put in a full day and then at night, I’d be in bed reading my book, and he was still on the phone, reading his briefings, working with staff.”\n\nTrump has continued to criticize Biden, even after Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, and claim the former president suffered from cognitive decline. During Trump’s trip to the Middle East last week, he largely ignored the long-held presidential norms of avoiding criticizing domestic political opponents while traveling abroad, personally attacking his predecessor multiple times. But Trump put his feelings aside Sunday as he expressed well wishes for the former president.\n\n“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,” he posted on Truth Social.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris, who took over the Democrats’ campaign after Biden dropped out, also wished the former president a speedy recovery and added that “Joe is a fighter.”\n\n“Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time,” Harris wrote on X. “Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.”\n\nCancer is ‘very serious,’ but there ‘is some good news,’ experts say\n\nBesides the Gleason score, factors such as blood prostate-specific antigen levels, imaging tests and biopsy findings are important in determining how the cancer might behave and what treatment options would be best.\n\nEven patients with high-risk prostate cancer “can live a pretty normal life and have a good quality of life, as long as the cancer is treated,” Brahmbhatt said. That treatment is personalized to each patient and might come in several forms, such as hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nIt could take “a few weeks” to see which direction Biden’s treatment goes, Brahmbhatt said. “Some of the treatments can affect memory, mood, quality of life, so you have to be very careful about what you end up doing, because you don’t want to be overly aggressive.”\n\nCancer has affected the Biden family before\n\nCancer has long been a personal issue for Biden, whose son Beau, an Iraq War veteran, died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.\n\nBiden established the “Cancer Moonshot” initiative in the wake of Beau’s death. The program, founded while Biden was vice president, was reestablished in 2022 with the goal of “ending cancer as we know it.”\n\nCNN’s Arlette Saenz, Kit Maher, Julia Benbrook and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Friday, with the cancer cells having spread to the bone.\n\n“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,\" his office said. \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”\n\nProstate cancers are given a score called a Gleason score that measures, on a scale of 1 to 10, how the cancerous cells look compared with normal cells. Biden’s office said his score was 9, suggesting his cancer is among the most aggressive.\n\nWhen prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it often spreads to the bones. Metastasized cancer is much harder to treat than localized cancer because it can be hard for drugs to reach all the tumors and completely root out the disease.\n\nHowever, when prostate cancers need hormones to grow, as in Biden’s case, they can be susceptible to treatment that deprives the tumors of hormones.\n\nOutcomes have improved in recent decades and patients can expect to live with metastatic prostate cancer for four or five years, said Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Brigham Cancer Center.\n\n“It’s very treatable, but not curable,” Smith said. “Most men in this situation would be treated with drugs and would not be advised to have either surgery or radiation therapy.”\n\nMany political leaders sent Biden their wishes for his recovery.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a longtime political opponent, posted on social media that he was saddened by the news and “we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.”\n\nBiden's vice president, Kamala Harris, said on social media that she was keeping him in her family's “hearts and prayers during this time.”\n\n“Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,” Harris wrote.\n\nThe health of Biden, 82, was a dominant concern among voters during his time as president. After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking reelection, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term. Harris became the nominee and lost to Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nBut in recent days, Biden rejected concerns about his age despite reporting in the new book “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that aides had shielded the public from the extent of his decline while serving as president.\n\nIn February 2023, Biden had a skin lesion removed from his chest that was a basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer. And in November 2021, he had a polyp removed from his colon that was a benign, but potentially pre-cancerous lesion.\n\nIn 2022, Biden made a “cancer moonshot” one of his administration's priorities with the goal of halving the cancer death rate over the next 25 years. The initiative was a continuation of his work as vice president to address a disease that had killed his older son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\nHis father, when announcing the goal to halve the cancer death rate, said this could be an “American moment to prove to ourselves and, quite frankly, the world that we can do really big things.”","summary":"Former President Joe Biden's office says he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.","url":"https://www.stltoday.com/news/nation-world/article_aa494139-f52d-535a-ab95-c73c6bd168fb.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/a4/aa494139-f52d-535a-ab95-c73c6bd168fb/682a4451601f0.preview.jpg?crop=954%2C501%2C474%2C422","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 23:15:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":322685654,"title":"Pope Leo XIV greets President Zelensky and JD Vance after inauguration mass","text":"POPE Leo XIV meets Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday after the pontiff’s inauguration mass.\n\nThe bells of St Peter’s Basilica earlier rang out as Chicago-born Leo waved from the popemobile that slowly went round the square\n\nGuests at the mass also included Prince Edward and US Vice President JD Vance.\n\nVance paid his respects at the late Pope Francis's tomb upon arriving in Rome late on Saturday before heading to the US delegation honouring Chicago-born Leo.\n\nThe pope, 69, has publicly criticised Vance, previously sharing an article condemning the Republican’s comments about a hierarchy of who you love in Christianity on a social media account under his name.\n\nBoth the United States and Peru get front-row seats at the historic event due to Leo’s dual citizenship as well as strict diplomatic protocol.\n\nCatholic convert Vance -

Luckey sold it to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014, but was fired by Facebook two years later.\"Everyone's got a different story, but it boils down to I gave $9,000 to a political group that was for Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton,\" Luckey said. \"To be a Trump supporter in 2016, you know, this was at the height of the election insanity and derangement in Silicon Valley. And so I think that a lot of people thought back then that you could just fire a Trump supporter.\"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who attended President Trump's most recent inauguration, has denied that Luckey was fired for his political views. In 2017, Luckey says he left Silicon Valley, with hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank and a chip on his shoulder.\"My gears were ground,\" he said. \"I really wanted to prove that I was somebody, that I was not a one-hit wonder, and that I still had it in me to do big things.\"Luckey says he thought about starting companies to combat obesity or fix the prison system, but ultimately decided to break into the defense industry.\"Everyone in the military has seen 'James Bond' movies and they all like Q,\" Luckey said. \"I'm the wacky gadget man. I'm the guy who types on the computer and pushes up my glasses, and then gives them a strange thing to help them accomplish their mission.\"What Luckey sees as the future of warfare For decades, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman have dominated the defense industry. Typically, the companies present an idea to the Pentagon. If the Pentagon buys it, the government pays for the company to develop it, even if it goes over budget or over schedule.Luckey started Anduril to flip that procurement structure on its head. \"The idea behind Anduril was to build not a defense contractor, but a defense products company,\" he said. The difference, he explains, is that contractors are paid to do the work whether or not it succeeds. \"A products company has a very different mentality. You're putting in your own money. You're putting in your own time,\" Luckey said. His vision was to show up with a working product, not with a presentation describing how taxpayers would foot his bills for developing a product. Luckey argues a lack of innovation in the defense sector means a Tesla has better AI than any U.S. aircraft and a Roomba vacuum has better autonomy than most of the Pentagon's weapons systems. He wants to change that.Part of Luckey's philosophy is that autonomous weapons ultimately promote peace by scaring adversaries away.\"My position has been that the United States needs to arm our allies and partners around the world so that they can be prickly porcupines that nobody wants to step on, nobody wants to bite them,\" he said. Luckey does not believe the U.S. should be sending its military to other countries. Instead, he says, American-made products should go overseas. \"I think that that's one of the reasons that autonomy is so powerful. Right now there are so many weapon systems that require manning,\" he said. \"You know, if I can have one guy command and controlling 100 aircraft, that's a lot easier than having to have a pilot in every single one. And it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk.\"\"Autonomy\" does not mean remote controlled; once an autonomous weapon is programmed and given a task, it can use artificial intelligence for surveillance or to identify, select and engage targets. No operator needed.What Anduril is making Luckey's approach seems to be working for Anduril. The company says it will have secured more than $6 billion in government contracts worldwide by the end of the year. Some of Anduril's systems are already being used by the U.S. military and in the war in Ukraine. Right now, Anduril is working on the Roadrunner: a twin turbo-jet powered drone interceptor that can take off, identify and strike a drone. If it doesn't find a target, it can land and try again. Anduril also makes headsets that allow soldiers to see 360 degrees in combat. And there's an electromagnetic warfare system that can be programmed to jam enemy systems, knocking out drone swarms.The weapons can be synchronized on Anduril's AI platform, Lattice, Luckey said. The platform collects data from various sensors and sources — including satellites, drones, radar and cameras — allowing the AI to analyze, move assets and execute missions faster than a human. \"It's the AI onboard all these weapons that makes it possible to make it so easy,\" he said. The largest weapon in Anduril's arsenal, a submarine called the Dive XL, works autonomously. A version 60 Minutes saw is the size of a school bus.\"It's not remote-controlled by this computer,\" Luckey said. \"It's doing it on the brain, on the submarine itself. So if I told it to go off and perform some mission that's monthslong, like, 'Go to this target, listen for this particular signature, and if you see this signature, run; if you see this one, hide; if you see this one, follow it,' it could do that all on its own without being detected, without communicating with it.\"Anduril says the Dive XL can travel 1,000 miles fully submerged. Australia has invested $58 million in the subs to help defend its seas from China.Anduril's most anticipated weapon, an unmanned fighter jet called Fury, has no cockpit, stick or rudder because there's no pilot.\"The idea is that you're building a robotic fighter jet that is, you know, flying with manned fighters and is doing what you ask it to do, recommending things be done, taking risks that you don't want human pilots to take,\" Luckey said.Fury represents a big turning point for the company. Anduril was viewed by some inside the defense industry as a \"tech-bro\" startup until it beat out several of the prime defense contractors to make an unmanned fighter jet for the Air Force. Fury is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer. If the Pentagon awards Anduril a production contract for Fury it, like all of the company's products, will be made in the U.S.The ethics of autonomous weapons The secretary general of the United Nations has called lethal autonomous weapons \"politically unacceptable and morally repugnant.\" Some international groups have referred to lethal autonomous weapons as killer robots.\"If I am gonna argue with them, I usually poke it,\" Luckey said. \"I'm like, 'OK, so do you think that NATO should be armed with squirt guns or slingshots?'\"Luckey notes that all of Anduril's weapons have a \"kill switch\" that allows a human operator to intervene if needed. And while some find the idea of autonomous weapons scary, Luckey argues they're less scary than weapons systems without any level of intelligence. \"There's no moral high ground to making a land mine that can't tell the difference between a school bus full of children and Russian armor,\" he said. \"It's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons. It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons.\"As with many AI systems, some people also worry about what happens if artificial intelligence goes rogue. \"I would say that it is something to be aware of. But in the grand scheme of things, things to be afraid of, there's things that I'm much more terrified of,\" Luckey said. \"I'm a lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than AI deciding that it's gonna wipe us all out.\"","summary":"Palmer Luckey made Oculus headsets.

Luckey says for too long, the U.S. military has relied on overpriced and outdated technology. He argues a Tesla has better AI than any U.S. aircraft and a Roomba vacuum has better autonomy than most of the Pentagon's weapons systems.So Anduril is making a line of autonomous weapons that operate using artificial intelligence. No human required.Some international groups have called those types of weapons killer robots.But Palmer Luckey says it is the future of warfare.Palmer Luckey: I've always said that we need to transition from being the world police to being the world gun store.Sharyn Alfonsi: Do we want to be the world's gun store?Palmer Luckey: I think so. I think we have to.Sharyn Alfonsi: Says the guy who sells weapons.Palmer Luckey: See, I-- I agree it sounds self-fulfilling. But you have to remember, I also got into this industry because I believe that.Palmer Luckey isn't your typical defense industry executive. His daily \"uniform\" – flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt – is more suited for Margaritaville than the military.But the 32-year-old billionaire is the founder of Anduril, whose line of American-made autonomous weapons looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie and whose slick marketing videos wouldn't be out of place in one.There's the Roadrunner – a twin turbo jet-powered drone interceptor that can take off, identify, and strike. If it doesn't find a target, it can land and try again.Anduril also makes headsets which allows soldiers to see 360 degrees in combat.And there's this – it's an electromagnetic warfare system that can be programmed to jam enemy systems, knocking out drone swarms.It's not some futuristic fantasy. Anduril's systems are already being used by the U.S. military and in the war in Ukraine.Palmer Luckey: We shouldn't be sending our people to stand in other countries, putting our men and women, our sons and daughters at risk for the sovereignty of other nations. Sharyn Alfonsi: So you'd rather have an American-made product in their hands than our soldiers over there?Palmer Luckey: Absolutely. Every time. And I think that that's one of the reasons that autonomy is so powerful. Right now, there are so many weapon systems that require manning. You know, if I can have one guy command and con-- controlling 100 aircraft, that's a lot easier than having to have a pilot in every single one. And it puts a lot fewer American lives at risk.To be clear, \"autonomy\" does not mean remote controlled.Once an autonomous weapon is programmed and given a task, it can use artificial intelligence for surveillance or to identify, select and engage targets. No operator needed.Sharyn Alfonsi: It's a scary idea to some people.Palmer Luckey: It's a scary idea, but, I mean, that's the world we live in. I'd say it's a lot scarier, for example, to imagine a weapons system that doesn't have any level of intelligence at all. There's no moral high ground to making a land mine that can't tell the difference between a school bus full of children and Russian armor. It's not a question between smart weapons and no weapons. It's a question between smart weapons and dumb weapons. Luckey showed us how those so-called \"smart weapons\" can be synchronized on Anduril's AI platform. It's called Lattice.Lattice collects data from various sensors and sources, including satellites, drones, radar and cameras. Allowing, he says, the SI to analyze, move assets and execute missions faster than a human.Palmer Luckey: If you were having to require the human operator to actually map every single action and say, \"Hey, do this. If that, then this.\" It would take so long to manage it that you would be better off just remotely piloting it. It's the AI onboard all these weapons that makes it possible to make it so easy.Sharyn Alfonsi: There are lots of people who go, \"Oh, AI. I don't know. I don't trust it. It's gonna go rogue.\"Palmer Luckey: I would say that it is something to be aware of. But in the grand scheme of things, things to be afraid of, there's things that I'm much more terrified of and I'm a lot more worried about evil people with mediocre advances in technology than AI deciding that it's gonna wipe us all out. Luckey says all Anduril's weapons have a \"kill switch\" that allow a human operator to intervene if needed.But the secretary general of the United Nations has called lethal autonomous weapons, quote \"politically unacceptable and morally repugnant.\"Sharyn Alfonsi: When people say to you, \"Look, it's evil.\" How do you respond to that?Palmer Luckey: I usually don't bother because, if I am gonna argue with them, I-- I usually poke it. I'm like, \"Okay, so do you think that NATO should be armed with squirt guns or-- or slingshots? How 'bout sternly worded letters? Would you like that? Would you like it if-- if NATO just-- they just have a bunch of guys sitting at typewriters, a thousand monkeys writing letters to Vladimir Putin begging him to not invade Ukraine?\" Our entire society exists because of a credible backstop of violence threatened by the United States and our allies all over the world. And thank goodness for it.It might sound flip but part of Palmer Luckey's philosophy is that autonomous weapons ultimately promote peace by scaring adversaries away.Palmer Luckey: My position has been that the United States needs to arm our allies and partners around the world so that they could be prickly porcupines that nobody wants to step on, nobody wants to-- to bite them. Sharyn Alfonsi: In your mind, is it enough just to have all these things as deterrents? Or do they have to be deployed and used.Palmer Luckey: They have to believe that you can use them. By the end of this year, Anduril says it will have secured more than $6 billion in government contracts worldwide. Sharyn Alfonsi: When you first came into this space, and you're a t-- a tech guy in-- a Hawaiian shirt, and you're walking into the Pentagon maybe in flip-flops, I don't know. Were you welcomed with open arms?Palmer Luckey: There were a very small number of people who welcomed me with open arms, and everyone else thought that I was nuts.Nuts, because there hasn't been a new company in the defense industry – in a significant way – since the end of the Cold War. For decades, five defense contractors, called \"the primes,\" have dominated the industry.Typically, the \"primes\" present an idea to the Pentagon. If the Pentagon buys it, the government pays for the company to develop it. Even if it's late or goes over budget.Luckey started Anduril to flip that procurement structure on its head.Palmer Luckey: The idea behind Anduril was to build not a defense contractor but a defense products company.Sharyn Alfonsi: What's the difference?Palmer Luckey: Contractors in general are paid to do work. Whether or not it succeeds. A products company has a very different mentality. You're putting in your own money. You're putting in your own time. My vision was to build a company that would show up not with a PowerPoint describing how taxpayers are gonna pay all my bills but with a working product where all the risk has been baked out. It will work for enough things that you can save our country hundreds of billions of dollars a year.It may not surprise you that Palmer Luckey's father was a car salesman. His mother took on the role of homeschooling him and his three sisters.Luckey says he was fascinated by electronics and spent a lot of time tinkering in his parents' garage in Long Beach, California.By age 19, his tinkering turned into Oculus, the virtual reality company. And at 21, Palmer Luckey fulfilled every young founder's dream when he sold Oculus to Facebook for $2 billion. \"The wonder-kid\" graced the covers of magazines, but two years later, he was fired from Facebook.Sharyn Alfonsi: Why did you get fired?Palmer Luckey: Well, you know, everyone's got a different story, but it boils down to I gave $9,000 to a political group that was for Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton. To be a Trump supporter in 2016-- you know, this was at the height of the election insanity and derangement in Silicon Valley. And so I think that a lot of people thought back then that you cou-- you could just fire a Trump supporter. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied that Luckey was fired for his political views.Sharyn Alfonsi: What do you think now when you see those tech leaders, Mark Zuckerberg, lined up behind President Trump now at his inauguration?Palmer Luckey: I am inclined to let every single one of them get away with it. Look--Sharyn Alfonsi: What do you mean get away with it?Palmer Luckey: Coming around to a point of view that is more aligned with the American people broadly I think is good for the country. I think it is not good for you to have techno-corpo elites that are radically out of step with where the American people are.In 2017, Luckey says he left Silicon Valley, with hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank and a chip on his shoulder.Palmer Luckey: I was fired at the height of my career, you know, my gears were ground, and I really wanted to prove that I was somebody, that I was not a one-hit wonder, and that I still had it in me to do big things. He says he thought about starting companies to combat obesity or fix the prison system but ultimately decided to break into the defense industry.Sharyn Alfonsi: Have you run into any people who don't take you seriously because you were never in the military?Palmer Luckey: I-- I don't think so. I think I owe that to the James Bond franchise. Everyone in the military has seen James Bond movies and they all like Q, right? I'm the wacky gadget man. I'm the guy who types on the computer and pushes up my glasses, and then gives them a strange thing to help them accomplish their mission. And this is his laboratory. Anduril's 640,000 square foot headquarters in Costa Mesa, California.It's a mix of high-tech carpentry and robotic engineering. A sign on the floor pokes fun at the boss's shoe choice.But Luckey wanted to show us something off campus. We hopped in his 1985 Humvee.The billionaire told us he also owns a decommissioned Black Hawk helicopter, a 48-crew submarine, and a Navy speedboat.In Dana Point, we took a ride 15 minutes off the coast to see the largest weapon in Anduril's arsenal: this submarine. It's called the Dive XL. It's about the size of a school bus and works autonomously. Palmer Luckey: It's not remote-controlled by this computer. It's doing it on the brain, on the submarine itself. So if I told it to go off and perform some mission that's months-long, like, \"Go to this target, listen for this particular signature, and if you see this signature, run, if you see this one, hide, if you see this one, follow it.\" It could do that all on its own without being detected, without communicating with it.Anduril says the Dive XL can travel 1,000 miles fully submerged. Australia has already invested $58 million in the subs to help defend its seas from China.But Anduril's most anticipated weapon has been closely guarded until this month. Hidden inside this hangar, Anduril's unmanned fighter jet called \"Fury.\" There is no cockpit, or stick or rudder because there's no pilot.Palmer Luckey: The idea is that you're building a robotic fighter jet that is, you know, flying with manned fighters and is doing what you ask it to do, recommending things be done-- taking risks that you don't want human pilots to take.Fury represents a big turning point for the company. Anduril was viewed by some inside the defense industry as a \"tech-bro\" startup until it beat out several of the prime defense contractors to make an unmanned fighter jet for the Air Force.Fury is scheduled to take its first test flight this summer. If selected by the Pentagon it, like all Anduril products, will be produced in the U.S.Palmer Luckey: The war games say we're gonna run out of munitions in eight days in a fight with China. If we have to fight Iran, and China, and Russia all at the same time, we are screwed.Sharyn Alfonsi: If we go to war, right--Palmer Luckey: Yep.Sharyn Alfonsi: --your version of what Anduril's place is in-- in a conflict--Palmer Luckey: Yep.Sharyn Alfonsi: --how do you view it? Palmer Luckey: I think what we're gonna be doing is first connecting a lot of these systems that otherwise would not have been talking to one another.We're gonna be making large numbers of cruise missiles, large numbers of fighter jets, large numbers of surface and subsurface systems. I guess I would hope that Anduril is making most of the stuff that's being used on day nine, day 10, day 11, day 100. I think a lot of that is gonna be coming out of our factories ever-- after everything else has run dry.Produced by Lucy Hatcher. Associate producer, Jessica Kegu. Broadcast associate, Erin DuCharme.

Further analysis confirmed a Gleason score of 9, considered one of the most serious categories of the disease.\n\nWhile Joe has not yet commented publicly, the news has touched a chord across the nation and among his political peers, including some unlikely voices of support.\n\nDonald's reaction\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 78, took to his Truth Social platform to issue a statement that struck a notably compassionate tone.\n\n\"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,\" he wrote. \"We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\"\n\nKamala Harris' voice of support\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who served alongside President Biden during his time in office, also shared a heartfelt message via X (formerly Twitter), writing: \n\n\"Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis. We are keeping him, Dr Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. Joe is a fighter, and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.\"\n\nThe announcement came just five days after President Biden was examined by doctors due to ongoing urinary symptoms. According to a spokesperson, it was during this check-up that the prostate nodule was first detected.\n\n\"On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,\" the official update read. \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\"\n\nThe medical team has not yet confirmed whether the President will undergo surgery, radiation therapy, or hormone treatment, but sources close to the White House indicate that Biden remains in good spirits and is continuing to carry out his duties while he weighs his options.\n\nJoe's hardship\n\nBehind the scenes, family remains central to his strength.\n\nThis isn’t the first time President Biden has faced immense personal hardship. He lost his first wife, Neilia, and their baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972. In 2015, he tragically lost his son Beau to brain cancer. That journey, one marked by unimaginable grief, has shaped Biden’s public image as a man who leads with empathy.\n\nDr Jill Biden, 72, has yet to comment publicly, but she has been at her husband’s side throughout his presidency, often calling their relationship \"a partnership rooted in love and respect.\"\n\nPublic health experts have noted that prostate cancer, while serious, is treatable, particularly if detected early and if it responds to hormone therapy. According to the American Cancer Society, over three million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer today. The survival rate for localised cases is extremely high, though metastatic cases, such as Joe’s, are more complex to manage.","summary":"President Donald Trump, 78, took to his Truth Social platform to issue a surprising statement  following the news that former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/832663/donald-trumps-surprise-reaction-to-joe-bidens-aggressive-cancer-diagnosis-revealed/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c882f86e17af-gettyimages-2210784282.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 23:13:21","author":"Faye James","authors":["Faye James"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":322685806,"title":"Trump budget would cut ocean data that bar pilots, fishing boats, weather service rely on","text":"Capt. Ed Enos makes his living as a harbor pilot in Hawaii, clambering aboard arriving ships in the predawn hours and guiding them into port.\n\nHis world revolves around wind speeds, current strength and wave swells. When Enos is bobbing in dangerous waters in the dark, his cellphone is his lifeline: with a few taps he can access the Integrated Ocean Observing System and pull up the data needed to guide what are essentially floating warehouses safely to the dock.\n\nBut maybe not for much longer. President Donald Trump wants to eliminate all federal funding for the observing system’s regional operations. Scientists say the cuts could mean the end of efforts to gather real-time data crucial to navigating treacherous harbors, plotting tsunami escape routes and predicting hurricane intensity.\n\n“It’s the last thing you should be shutting down,” Enos said. “There’s no money wasted. Right at a time when we should be getting more money to do more work to benefit the public, they want to turn things off. That’s the wrong strategy at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.”\n\nMonitoring system tracks all things ocean\n\nThe IOOS system launched about 20 years ago. It’s made up of 11 regional associations in multiple states and territories, including the Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington state, Michigan, South Carolina and Southern California.\n\nThe regional groups are networks of university researchers, conservation groups, businesses and anyone else gathering or using maritime data. The associations are the Swiss army knife of oceanography, using buoys, submersible drones and radar installations to track water temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, wave speeds, swell heights and current strength.\n\nThe networks monitor the Great Lakes, U.S. coastlines, the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the Gulf of America, the Gulf of Alaska, the Caribbean and the South Pacific and upload member data to public websites in real time.\n\nMaritime community and military rely on system data\n\nCruise ship, freighter and tanker pilots like Enos, as well as the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, use the information directly to navigate harbors safely, plot courses around storms and conduct search-and-rescue operations.\n\nThe associations’ observations feed into National Weather Service forecasts. The Pacific Northwest association uses tsunami data to post real-time coastal escape routes on a public-facing app. And the Hawaii association not only posts data that is helpful to harbor pilots but tracks hurricane intensity and tiger sharks that have been tagged for research.\n\nThe associations also track toxic algal blooms, which can force beach closures and kill fish. The maps help commercial anglers avoid those empty regions. Water temperature data can help identify heat layers within the ocean and, because it’s harder for fish to survive in those layers, knowing hot zones helps anglers target better fishing grounds.\n\nThe regional networks are not formal federal agencies but are almost entirely funded through federal grants through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The current federal budget allocates $43.5 million for the networks. A Republican bill in the House natural resources committee would actually send them more money, $56 million annually, from 2026 through 2030.\n\nCuts catch network administrators by surprise\n\nA Trump administration memo leaked in April proposes a $2.5 billion cut to the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA, in the 2026 federal budget.\n\nPart of the proposal calls for eliminating federal funding for the regional monitoring networks, even though the memo says one of the activities the administration wants the commerce department to focus on is collecting ocean and weather data.\n\nThe memo offered no other justifications for the cuts. The proposal stunned network users.\n\n“We’ve worked so hard to build an incredible system and it’s running smoothly, providing data that’s important to the economy. Why would you break it?” said Jack Barth, an Oregon State oceanographer who shares data with the Pacific Northwest association.\n\n“What we’re providing is a window into the ocean and without those measures we frankly won’t know what’s coming at us. It’s like turning off the headlights,” Barth said.\n\nNOAA officials declined to comment on the cuts and potential impacts, saying in an email to The Associated Press that they do not do “speculative interviews.”\n\nNetwork’s future remains unclear\n\nNothing is certain. The 2026 federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1. The budget must pass the House, the Senate and get the president’s signature before it can take effect. Lawmakers could decide to fund the regional networks after all.\n\nNetwork directors are trying not to panic. If the cuts go through, some associations might survive by selling their data or soliciting grants from sources outside the federal government. But the funding hole would be so significant that just keeping the lights on would be an uphill battle, they said.\n\nIf the associations fold, other entities might be able to continue gathering data, but there will be gaps. Partnerships developed over years would evaporate and data won’t be available in a single place like now, they said.\n\n“People have come to us because we’ve been steady,” Hawaii regional network director Melissa Iwamoto said. “We’re a known entity, a trusted entity. No one saw this coming, the potential for us not to be here.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The alarming news was shared in a statement from Biden's office today after the 82 year old sought medical help last week due to urinary symptoms. A prostate nodule was detected, and by the end of the week, Biden had received the grim news of a Grade 5 advanced prostate cancer showing rapid progression. Yet, the sombre health update has sparked fierce online debate, especially among right-wing personalities. On X, Infowars, previously managed by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but no longer under his ownership, declared: \"It's Official - The 2020 Election Was Stolen, Joe Biden Was Never Legitimately President! And Now, Right On Time, He's Diagnosed with Aggressive Cancer! Alex Jones is LIVE, Exposing the Truth, Breaking Major News and Covering the Latest Shocking Developments.\" Bill Mitchell, conservative pundit and host of YourVoice America, pondered why the cancer wasn't discovered much sooner, commenting: \"Here's my question. If this prostate cancer is so advanced it has spread to his bones, how did his White House physician not diagnose and treat it earlier? Early diagnosis and treatment is key to survival. Joe Biden has likely had prostrate cancer for 4 to 6 years!\", reports the Mirror . Tim Pool, host of Timcast IRL and The Culture War Podcast, also weighed in, suggesting that the Democrats were aware of Biden's illness prior to his presidency. Pool tweeted: \"Joe Biden has Cancer with metastasis to the bone. This is considered advanced. If he had the best medical care and screenings for 4 years they'd have found it and it means he's likely had it since before dropping out. Democrats knew.\" Regarding Biden's cancer, former US President Trump expressed his sympathy on his Truth Social platform, stating: \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\" Although Biden's cancer diagnosis appears severe, there is a glimmer of hope. The disease is reportedly \"hormone-sensitive,\" which could make treatment more effective. According to a statement released by Biden's office: \"Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms.\" It continued: \"On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. \"The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" It is unclear if anyone knew Biden had cancer before his presidency. Biden, who held the presidency from 2020 to 2024, opted not to run for a second term, handing over the reins to Vice President Kamala Harris. His choice was influenced by growing scrutiny over his age and health, especially in light of a potential rematch with Donald Trump. Although Biden's personal doctor confirmed he was \"fit to serve\" after a February 2024 check-up at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, doubts persisted. A new book is about to offer more insight. Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, set for release on Tuesday (May 20), is penned by CNN presenter Jake Tapper and Axios journalist Alex Thompson. The book reportedly discloses that Biden's team once considered the possibility of him needing a wheelchair for a second term. This internal worry followed several public stumbles and falls, including a widely shared incident in June 2023 when Biden tripped during a commencement address at the US Air Force Academy and required assistance from Secret Service agents to stand. Social media users and medical professionals have pointed out Biden's slower movements and frequent falls, hinting at potential neurological or spinal conditions. What has the White House said regarding Biden's health? White House staff have tended to minimise these episodes as typical signs of ageing, but Biden's eventual withdrawal from the 2024 election came after extensive discussions within the party. His departure opened the way for Kamala Harris, though some in the Democratic Party feel it was too tardy. Over the weekend, Senator Amy Klobuchar remarked: \"We needed a real debate about the future of the country. Instead, we were stuck in a waiting game.\" As the ex-president tentatively re-engages with public life, he and wife Jill Biden made an appearance on The View last week, eliciting a polarised reaction from Democrats regarding his level of participation in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. Biden visited a Philadelphia hospital last Friday for additional tests on what has been described as a \"small nodule\" – a concerning development that necessitates \"further evaluation,\" a representative stated.
