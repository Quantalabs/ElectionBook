Homeland Security has released criminal records and mugshots of more than 20 illegal migrants it apprehended recently. They have been accused of serious crimes, including murder, pedophilia, fentanyl trafficking, sexual assault and armed robbery, the agency said. The arrests were made when anti-ICE protesters were rioting in the city earlier this month. The wild and ugly scenes saw rioters attack law enforcement with rocks and Molotov cocktails while others burned vehicles and other property. Some of the agitators waved the flags of foreign nations as they carried out their crimes. ICE RAMPS UP ARRESTS OF CONVICTED CRIMINALS AS RIOTS RAGE IN BLUE CITY: 'YOU WILL NOT STOP US' Some of those arrested by immigration officials for deportation include Mexican national Cesar Zetina-Michua, who was convicted of attempted murder after entering the U.S. illegally, and Cuban national Daniel Ofarril, who was arrested for murder, armed robbery and drug trafficking, including a conviction of possessing crack cocaine with intent to sell. Alleged Salvadorian MS-13 gang member Oscar Juventino Ardon Landaverde, who is on the Terrorist Screening Dataset and reentered the U.S. multiple times, was also arrested, as were several drug traffickers who peddle cocaine and fentanyl. Agents also collared multiple convicted sex offenders, like Efran Omar Rosales-Serrano, who attempted to molest a child under 12, and Juan Diego Euan, who was convicted of sexually penetrating a minor under 16. CALIFORNIA SHERIFF SAYS NEWSOM ‘ENCOURAGED’ LA RIOTS AS ICE ARRESTS VIOLENT ILLEGAL ALIENS Others include predators convicted of sexual crimes against minors or incapacitated victims. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin slammed those trying to stand in the way of immigration officials carrying out lawful immigration enforcement. \"Under the Trump administration, 70% of illegal aliens arrested have been convicted or charged with a crime beyond illegally entering our country,\" McLaughlin said. \"As bad-faith politicians attempt to demean and vilify our brave law enforcement, we will only double down and ramp up our enforcement actions against the worst of the worst criminals.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Large-scale immigration raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sparked widespread protests that escalated into violent confrontations. President Trump activated the state’s National Guard and about 700 Marines despite pushback by LA Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, which helped quell the riots. Also arrested in the recent operations were Hung Nguyen, of Vietnam, who has convictions for 22 crimes, including indecent exposure, theft and domestic violence, and Cristian Vasco-Echeverry of Colombia, who has a history of drug trafficking and served more than 10 years in a Colombian prison.","summary":"Homeland Security released criminal records and mugshots of more than 20 illegal migrants it apprehended recently.

The move marks a dramatic shift in talks that had shown signs of improvement in recent weeks, as both countries worked toward a resolution on US tariffs affecting Canadian exports. Also Read: India-US Trade Deal: Trump Says Talks On 'Full Trade Barrier Dropping' Ongoing With India What is the Digital Services Tax (DST) Canada’s Digital Services Tax (DST), set to take effect June 30, would impose a 3% levy on revenue earned from Canadian users by large multinational tech firms - most of which are American, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb. The measure is retroactive, meaning companies could owe as much as $2 billion in back taxes. “We’re going to stop all negotiations with Canada right now until they straighten out their act,” Trump said. When asked what Canada could do to appease him, Trump was clear: “They will [remove the tax]. They do most of their business with us. When you have that circumstance, you treat people better.” Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, who met with Trump at the G7 summit last week, had agreed to try to resolve the trade dispute within 30 days. Speaking to reporters earlier Friday, Carney said he had not spoken to Trump that day but added, “We’ll continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interest of Canadians.” Trump expressed his frustration in a post on social media earlier in the day, threatening possible blanket tariffs on Canadian goods. He also criticised the tax as unfair and claimed, without evidence, that Canada has long imposed excessive tariffs on US dairy imports. “We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with... has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,” Trump posted. Also Read: Nimes, France: Mass Shooting Leaves Multiple Injured - What We Know So Far The Business Council of Canada has called on Ottawa to withdraw the tax in exchange for tariff relief from the US, but the federal government has not indicated it plans to do so. The DST has long been a sticking point in Canada-US relations. Though discussions on a global digital tax regime are underway among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, Canada moved forward unilaterally last year, citing the need to modernise its tax system. Trump’s decision to walk away from talks comes despite recent signs of progress. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc had said earlier Friday that Canada’s team remained “optimistic about the constructive tone” of talks. Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand had also defended the tax and Canada's approach.

Asked by reporters how close a ceasefire was in Gaza, Mr. Trump said, “We think within the next week, we’re going to get a ceasefire.” Earlier, the U.S. announced it would begin funding the initiative with $30 million approved. “We’re supplying, as you know, a lot of money and a lot of food to that area. We’re involved because people are dying. And look at those crowds of people that have no food, no anything,” Mr. Trump said Friday (June 27, 2025).\n\nProtests erupt across Kolkata over gang rape of law student; Opposition flays Mamata government\n\nProtests erupted across Kolkata on Friday (June 27, 2025) after one of the prime accused in the alleged gang rape of a student at the South Calcutta Law College campus, Monojit Mishra, was identified as a Trinamool Congress student leader. Left-backed student groups laid siege to the Kasba Police Station where the case was registered. Opposition parties have also slammed the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government, alleging a nexus between ruling party leaders and criminal elements. In response, the Trinamool leaders have gone into damage-control mode. The two other accused in the case, Zaib Ahmed and Pramit Mukhopadhyay, are students at the same college. Mr. Mishra, 31, had passed had out from the same institute. All three have been arrested and are now in a four-day police custody.\n\nAdani indictment case: U.S. SEC updates court on efforts to serve legal documents\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a status update with a federal court in New York, detailing its ongoing efforts to serve legal documents to billionaire Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar in connection with a civil securities case filed last year. In a June 27 letter submitted to Magistrate Judge James R. Cho of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), the SEC said it is continuing to pursue formal service of the summons and complaint under the provisions of the Hague Service Convention. U.S. SEC has to serve the summons to Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar in the alleged $265 million payoffs to win lucrative renewable power supply contracts through proper diplomatic channels, as it has no jurisdiction to summon a foreign national directly.\n\nIndia trying for U.S. trade deal by July 8 deadline\n\nA team of negotiators from India is in the U.S. for at least a two-day trip to conduct final negotiations for a ‘mini trade deal’ before the July 8, 2025 deadline elapses, The Hindu has learnt. The top items on the agenda, and the main hindrances to an agreement, are the entry of genetically modified crops and cow milk into India and the removal of the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S. This comes soon after U.S. President Donald Trump on June 26 hinted at a “very big” deal coming up with India. July 8, 2025, marks the last day of the 90-day pause Mr. Trump had allowed on the ‘Liberation Day’ higher tariffs he had imposed on imports from other countries, including India.\n\nIndia ‘categorically rejects’ Court of Arbitration’s ‘supplemental award’ on Kishenganga, Ratle hydropower projects\n\nIndia on Friday (June 27, 2025) “categorically rejected” the “supplemental award” by the Court of Arbitration on Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, saying that it “never recognised” the Court of Arbitration, which is a “serious breach” of the Indus Waters Treaty which has been put “at abeyance” after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam. “India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) after the World Bank’s Court of Arbitration gave a “supplemental award” on Kishenganga and Ratle projects in Jammu and Kashmir. \n\nOpposition slams RSS leader Hosabale after his comment on ‘secularism’, ‘socialism’\n\nOpposition parties sharply criticised Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale’s comment that the words “secular” and “socialist” in the Preamble of the Constitution should be reviewed, with the Congress on Friday (June 27, 2025) alleging that the RSS “never accepted” Babasaheb Ambedkar’s Constitution. In a Facebook post, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi claimed that the “mask” of the RSS has come off again. “The Constitution hurts them because it talks about equality, secularism and justice. The RSS-BJP does not want the Constitution but Manusmriti. By snatching their rights, they (BJP-RSS) want to make the poor and the Bahujans slaves again. Their real agenda is to snatch away a powerful weapon like the Constitution from them,” Mr. Gandhi said, adding his party “wont let that happen”.\n\nMPs across party lines in parliamentary panel support forward-looking policy for Bangladesh\n\nAt a special interaction between four leading experts and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, MPs cutting across party lines displayed a desire to “move ahead” with India’s relation with Bangladesh, it has been learnt. The Hindu had earlier reported that the interaction between the Congress MP Shashi Tharoor-led parliamentary committee and four experts was scheduled for Friday (June 27, 2025) afternoon, where the MPs were expected to be briefed on the latest developments in Dhaka and what India can do to recover the lost ground. “All Members of Parliament displayed pathos and understanding of the issues between India and Bangladesh and there was a real desire among the MPs to mend the bilateral ties and take things forward,” said a source on condition of anonymity.\n\nFirst batch of pilgrims visit Mansarovar, appeal for more yatra slots to be opened\n\nAs the first batch of Indian pilgrims since 2020 visited the Mansarovar Lake, preparing to begin their return journey on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, they expressed the hope that India and China could agree to allow more yatris to make the trek in future years. This first batch of pilgrims left Delhi on June 15 and arrived this week at Darchen to begin the Parikrama or circular route around Mount Kailash. They will head back on Saturday (June 28, 2025), and cross over into India on July 1, completing a route by road of about 2,000 km, trekking an uphill and rugged terrain of about 52 km on foot. As they touched the pristine blue waters of Mansarovar Lake, the world’s highest freshwater lake at 4,588 metres, they burst into meditational chants.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court curbs power of individual judges to block Donald Trump\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court handed President Donald Trump a major victory on Friday (June 27, 2025) by curbing the power of lone federal judges to block executive actions. In a 6-3 ruling stemming from Mr. Trump’s bid to end birthright citizenship, the court said nationwide injunctions issued by district court judges “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts”. The top court did not immediately rule on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s executive order seeking to end automatic citizenship for children born on American soil. But the broader decision on the scope of judicial rulings will remove a big roadblock to Mr. Trump’s often highly controversial orders and reaffirm the White House’s power.\n\nCourt rejects Netanyahu's call to postpone graft trial hearings\n\nAn Israeli court on Friday (June 27, 2025) rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request to postpone giving testimony in his corruption trial, after U.S. President Donald Trump said the case should be cancelled. The Jerusalem district court said in a judgement published online that “in its current form, (his request) does not provide a basis or detailed justification for the cancellation of the hearings”. Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyer, Amit Hadad, promptly submitted a fresh request for the next two weeks’ hearings to be scrapped, in a filing seen by AFP.\n\nSaved Khamenei from ugly death, says Trump; warns further attacks by U.S. or Israel\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday (June 27, 2025) scoffed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s heated warning to the U.S. not to launch future strikes on Iran, as well as the Iranian supreme leader’s assertion that Tehran “won the war” with Israel. Mr. Trump, in remarks to reporters and later in an extended statement on social media, said Khamenei’s comments defied reality after 12 days of Israeli strikes and the U.S. bombardment of three key nuclear sites inflicted severe damage on the country’s nuclear programme. The U.S. President spoke out a day after Mr. Khamenei insisted Tehran had delivered a “slap to America’s face” by striking a U.S. air base in Qatar and warned against further attacks by the U.S. or Israel on Iran. “I saved him from a very ugly and ignominious death, and he does not have to say, ‘Thank you, President Trump!’ ” wrote Mr. Trump.\n\nPraggnanandhaa wins UzChess Cup Masters, becomes top-ranked Indian\n\nGrandmaster R. Praggnanandhaa became India’s top-ranked chess player in the live ratings after winning the UzChess Cup Masters 2025, in Tashkent on Friday (June 27, 2025). The win took Praggnanandhaa’s live rating to 2778.3, making him World No. 4 — up three places — as he achieved his highest career ranking. The 19-year-old leapfrogged world champion D.

But granting the US unfettered access to the country's mineral wealth is unpopular with many in the DRC, upset that the country's resources have failed to provide a better life for its citizens.\n\nAs to the key questions of whether Rwandan forces will withdraw from eastern DRC, the US position is that once the Hutu-led FDLR, which Rwanda says is backed by the DRC and aims to overthrow the Rwandan government, is dismantled, then Rwanda will also row back on its \"defensive measure\". \n\nThis appears to be an oblique reference to the presence of Rwandan armed forces in eastern DRC. \n\nIf the US is able to convince the Rwandans to do this in earnest, it would be a big victory for Washington and Kinshasa. \n\nRwanda has repeatedly denied its troops are on the ground in eastern DRC, despite credible reports they've actively supported groups like M23 in the region.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dgjn7p24vo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a522/live/3054cb80-53a8-11f0-82c8-0d8b6dd00803.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:52:14","author":"Mayeni Jones","authors":["Mayeni Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":336009344,"title":"Trump Says He is Ending Canada Trade Talks Amid Tech Tax Dispute","text":"Washington: President Donald Trump said Friday that he's suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called a direct and blatant attack on our country.Trump, in a post on his social media network, said Canada had just informed the US that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.

He also plans to visit South Korea.\n\nTOKYO - Iranian ambassador to Japan Peiman Seadat has urged Tokyo to stand against U.S. and Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities in his nation after President Donald Trump's remark likening the U.S. attacks to the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe ambassador said in a recent interview with Kyodo News that the comment is an \"insult\" not only to Iran, but also to Japan, the world's only country to have suffered atomic bombings.\n\nU.S. tariff rate hits historic level of 25.9%: Japan trade report\n\nTOKYO - The effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports rose to as high as 25.9 percent under President Donald Trump, surpassing levels not seen since the protectionist policies of the Great Depression, the Japanese government's annual trade report showed Friday.\n\nThe U.S. tariff measures as of early April, including an increase in the levies on China to 145 percent, reached a \"historic scale,\" the Japanese trade ministry said, adding that frequent changes in Trump's trade policy are creating \"heightened uncertainty.\"\n\nTOKYO - Private sector imports of tariffed rice to Japan in May were 3.5 times the total volume brought in during all of fiscal 2024, revised government trade data showed Friday, as soaring prices of domestic rice have spurred demand for cheaper alternatives.\n\nAccording to the Finance Ministry's trade statistics, revised from a preliminary report issued earlier this month, 10,605 tons of tariffed rice were imported in May, a sharp increase from 115 tons in the same period last year.

I’m a mom and a daughter. Do you think I would leave what I love the most to come here to fight without a reason? \n\n— Words on a placard affixed to a tarpaulin shelter at the CNTE teachers’ union protest camp in the historic center of Mexico City.\n\nA tent city spreads across the Zócalo, the political and cultural heart of Mexico, and for more than three weeks in May and June the site of a massive teachers’ sit-in. Just off Mexico City’s main square a stench emanates from a row of portable toilets, an olfactory indication of just one of the hardships of extended protest.\n\nA group of young men partially block Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s most famous boulevard, after having traveled almost 1,000 kilometers to the capital from the southern state of Chiapas, where their teachers’ college classmate was allegedly shot dead by state police.\n\nProtest is a constant in Mexico City, the seat of the federal government and thus a focal point for angry, disgruntled and dissatisfied citizens from around the country. As the National Palace — the seat of executive power and now the president’s residence as well — is located opposite the Zócalo, the central square is the most popular place for demonstrations, and many protest marches end there after commencing in other central parts of the capital.\n\nEvery day, early in the morning, the Mexico City government publishes a roundup of the protests it knows will take place that day. It often lists 10 or more, but inevitably fails to mention them all.\n\nThat’s no surprise given that there are around 3,000 protests and road blockades annually in Mexico City, according to the city government, equating to an average of more than eight organized expressions of disgruntlement every single day of the year. Indeed, protests are as much a part of the fabric of life in the capital as taco stands and traffic-clogged streets.\n\nOf course, marches and street blockades don’t make traffic flow any easier, but rather add to the frustrations of the millions of daily motorists and public transport users in the greater Mexico City area.\n\nThe snarling of traffic is just one of the ways that protests disrupt everyday life in the capital.\n\nBut given the frequency with which they occur, many residents reluctantly accept them — what else can they do? — as just another unavoidable tax on their time, and in some cases, on their income as well.\n\nOne day of protest in Mexico City \n\nOn the morning of Friday June 6, I caught the metro into the historic center of Mexico City and walked over to the Zócalo, where thousands of teachers from various states around Mexico had been sleeping in tents since May 15. That Friday turned out to be the final day of the CNTE teachers’ union sit-in, as the many maestros who descended on the central square in May to express their various grievances finally packed up their tents on Saturday June 7 and left, without their demands having been met, but vowing to continue to fight.\n\nI spoke to a number of teachers, who enumerated their complaints, chief among which is their vehement discontent with the 2007 ISSSTE Law, which changed their pension system and will leave them — they say — considerably worse off in retirement. Their anger with President Claudia Sheinbaum — who during the 2024 presidential election campaign pledged on numerous occasions to repeal the 2007 ISSSTE Law — was palpable.\n\nMy visit to the teachers’ protest camp came the morning after a group of CNTE members broke into the Mexico City headquarters of the rival SNTE teachers’ union, set a fire alight in the building and carried out other acts of vandalism. During their lengthy stay in Mexico City, some CNTE-affiliated teachers used other violent tactics as they sought to get their message across. On May 21, for example, CNTE members allegedly attacked journalists who were trying to get into the National Palace to attend Sheinbaum’s morning press conference. Earlier this month, a group of teachers vandalized the headquarters of the federal Interior Ministry.\n\nA faction of the CNTE from Guerrero is especially known for being radical. But on June 6, all the teachers I met from that state, and others, were polite, friendly, soft-spoken and even shy in some cases.\n\nThey spoke about their concerns that they won’t have enough money in their retirement. They told me about the difficulties they face now to support themselves and their families on monthly salaries of just 5,000 to 7,000 pesos (US $265-$370) after tax and other deductions (including union dues). They complained about their inability to access medical treatments at public healthcare facilities that their ISSSTE health insurance is supposed to cover. And they spoke about their overwhelming disappointment with Sheinbaum, who was supported by teachers — including CNTE members — in large numbers at last year’s presidential election.\n\nAll the teachers I spoke to were clear with their convictions and steadfastly committed to their collective cause.\n\nBut they did not deny that they had faced a range of challenges camping out in the Zócalo for three weeks during the annual rainy season: smelly and dirty toilets, no ready access to showering facilities, leaky tents, difficulty maintaining a healthy and balanced diet.\n\nA couple from the Montaña region of Guerrero spoke about missing their young children, who they left with relatives to join the Mexico City protest.\n\nDespite the hardships, the protesting CNTE teachers’ union members believe that their struggle is worth it, that they have to stand up for what they know is right. They believe — they know — they have to resist.\n\nOf course, they are not alone in thinking that way — not in Mexico, not in the world. The recent protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, and the “No Kings” protests on June 14, captured the zeitgeist of millions in the United States, providing one example of discontent about countless issues around the world.\n\nIn Mexico City’s central core, disaffection is on display in a variety of ways.\n\nAfter I left the Zócalo on the first Friday in June, I walked to the Alameda Central, the large public park adjacent to the striking orange and yellow-domed Palace of Fine Arts. Lining the sidewalk at the park’s perimeter were female vendors, their various wares laid out next to or below posters and banners denouncing “economic violence” against women.\n\nOn boarding in front of the Benito Juárez Hemicycle — erected to protect the monument from vandalism by passing protesters — art calling for a “stop to the genocide” in Palestine and describing and depicting Donald Trump as a “colonialist, genocidal, coup-plotting pig” was on display. When I got to the intersection of avenues Júarez and Balderas, I saw a protest march approaching — judicial workers calling for a pay rise.\n\nAfter passing countless protest messages scrawled on walls and the facades of buildings, I reached the intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and Insurgentes Avenue, Mexico City’s longest street. A huge banner accusing Chiapas Governor Eduardo Ramírez of being a “murderer of students” greeted me.\n\nI approached a group of young men and asked them exactly what they were protesting. Their classmate, 22-year-old Jesús Alaín, who had almost completed his studies to become a primary school teacher, was shot dead by state police during a protest in Tuxtla Gutiérrez on May 15, they told me. Have any police officers been arrested? None, they said.\n\nThe young normalistas, as students that attend teacher training colleges called Escuelas Normales are known, had been camping at the Paseo de la Reforma-Insurgentes intersection for four days when I spoke to them. They said that authorities hadn’t made any serious attempt to dislodge them, but neither had they granted their requests to discuss the contested circumstances of the alleged murder in Tuxtla.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the still-grieving young men want justice for their deceased classmate and friend, who will never get the opportunity to teach this generation, or any generation, of chiapaneco children as a fully qualified teacher.\n\nIn a country with sky-high levels of impunity, clamoring for justice is an unfortunate reality for millions of other Mexicans as well.\n\nA short history of protest in Mexico City \n\nProtest in its various forms — some of them extremely violent — dates back hundreds if not thousands of years. The Peasants’ Revolt in England in the late 14th century. The Evil May Day xenophobic riot in London in 1517. The Boston Tea Party in 1773.\n\nIn Mexico, there were Indigenous uprisings during the Spanish colonial period, a riot in Mexico City in 1692 due to food shortages and racial resentment, and a groundswell of discontent that led to a revolt against Spanish rule in the Mexican War of Independence.\n\nIn the early 20th century, there was significant unrest as Porfirio Díaz’s already long-running presidency continued. Examples of this included the Cananea strike in Sonora in 1906, in which Mexican copper miners protested against poor working conditions and salaries that were lower than those received by their American colleagues, and the Río Blanco textile workers’ strike in Veracruz the following year. There was significant violence linked to both strikes.\n\nA few years later, Díaz’s fraudulent re-election in 1910 was the catalyst for the commencement of the Mexican Revolution.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, student protesters were violently repressed — and killed — by government forces controlled by the-then ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.\n\nOn October 2, 1968, just 10 days before the start of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, the military opened fire on student protesters in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in the Tlatelolco neighborhood of the capital, killing hundreds.\n\nLess than three years later, another state-sponsored massacre of student demonstrators occurred in Mexico City. Known as “El Halconazo” (The Hawk Strike), as it was perpetrated by a government-trained paramilitary group called Los Halcones, the massacre claimed the lives of scores of students on June 10, 1971. It is briefly depicted in the award-winning 2018 film Roma.\n\nBoth the Tlatelolco massacre and El Halconazo (also known as the Corpus Christi massacre) are considered part of the Mexican Dirty War, an internal conflict from the 1960s to the 1980s in which successive PRI governments violently repressed left-wing student and guerrilla groups.\n\nDuring this period, students and many other Mexicans participated in countless demonstrations against PRI authoritarianism. The students who participated in the 1968 protests had a range of demands, including the release of political prisoners and compensation for victims of police brutality and other state-sponsored repression. A march from Tlatelolco to the Zócalo commemorating those who lost their lives in 1968 takes place annually on Oct. 2.\n\nIn the first quarter of the 21st century, protest has remained a major facet of life in Mexico City.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent protest movement of the first decade of the century was that led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) after his defeat at what he claimed was a fraudulent presidential election in 2006. AMLO led huge rallies in the Zócalo after the election won by Felipe Calderón, and set up a protest camp that extended kilometers down Paseo de la Reforma and remained in place for almost seven weeks.\n\nHe even had himself sworn in as Mexico’s “legitimate president” during a ceremony in the Zócalo in November 2006.\n\n“The losing leftist candidate for president swore himself in on Monday as ‘the legitimate president of Mexico’ before a huge crowd of his avid fans, ignoring rulings by federal electoral authorities and the courts that he narrowly lost the election last July,” The New York Times reported at the time.\n\nThe following decade, massive protests broke out in Mexico City, and other parts of the country, after the disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, on Sept. 26, 2014.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people descended on the historic center of the capital during a series of protest marches in late 2014 that called for the ouster of then-president Enrique Peña Nieto. “Fue el estado” (It was the state) and “Vivos se los llevaron, vivos los queremos” (They were taken alive, we want them back alive) became national catchphrases. In the almost 11 years since the 43 young men disappeared, large numbers of Mexicans, including the parents of the abducted and presumably murdered students, have continued to protest, including on the 10th anniversary of the still unresolved crime.\n\nAmong the other large protests that have taken place in Mexico City in recent years are ones led by Mexico’s madres buscadoras, or searching mothers; marches every year on International Women’s Day; an anti-AMLO camp in the Zócalo; and demonstrations in defense of the National Electoral Institute.\n\nWhile most protests are peaceful, some are marred by violence, usually perpetrated by a minority of protesters. Some protesters use very different techniques to attract attention to their cause, such as farmers from Veracruz who, in years gone by, bared (almost) all on numerous occasions while in Mexico City.\n\nWhile Mexico City draws protesters from around the country, there are also a lot of smaller protests revolving around local issues in the capital, as is the case with residents of the Benito Juárez borough fighting to save a 115-year-old laurel tree known as “Laureano.”\n\nAll protests, whether big or small, are guaranteed by the Mexican Constitution, which states that “the right to peacefully associate or assemble for any licit purpose cannot be restricted.”\n\nIt also states that “only citizens of the Republic may take part in the political affairs of the country,” meaning that foreigners are officially barred from participating in political protests.\n\nOf course many of the protests in Mexico City and elsewhere fail to achieve their aims. The CNTE teachers haven’t yet gotten what they want. No one has been convicted of involvement in the abduction and murder of the 43 Ayotzinapa students. Peña Nieto wasn’t forced out of office before the completion of his six-year term.\n\nBut even so, to protest is to do something; to not accept the status quo; to defy a feeling of helplessness; to demonstrate opposition; to resist.\n\nIn the words of Martin Luther King: “Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest.”\n\nPermanent protest: Mexico City’s ‘anti-monuments’ \n\nWhether as sit-ins, hunger strikes, marches or the signing of petitions — to name just four — protest, as noted above, comes in various forms.\n\nIn Mexico City, there is a form of permanent, defiant and (almost) unmovable protest as well: the “anti-monument.”\n\nThere are a number of these antimonumentos — essentially sculptures of various kinds — in the capital, most prominently on Paseo de la Reforma.\n\nAn anti-monument calling for justice for the 43 abducted students. An anti-monument denouncing the 1971 “Halconazo.” An anti-monument inscribed with the message “No more femicides.” And various others.\n\nThe Mexico City anti-monuments “aren’t just a protest,” The Washington Post reported in 2024.\n\n“Mexico’s leaders have long tried to control the historical narrative to legitimize their rule — from the Mexican-American War of the 1840s to the Revolution starting in 1910. Now, a movement of artists, grieving families and feminists is trying to wrest that narrative away.”\n\nDisruptions and the financial cost of protests \n\nAt their heart, protests are about people — their grievances, their demands, their heartbreak, their quest for justice. While authorities are often the primary target of protesters’ frustration and anger, the residents of Mexico City frequently become collateral damage.\n\nMotorists and public transit users, as mentioned above, are among the capital-dwellers who are affected the most.\n\n“What is the most frustrating thing about the traffic,” a Televisa reporter recently asked a taxi driver in Mexico City, a metropolis ranked as the “most congested” city in the world on the 2025 Tom Tom traffic index.\n\n“The marches, when they close [streets],” he responded, adding that traffic congestion at such times becomes “unbearable.”\n\nWith their camp at the intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Insurgentes, the protesting normalistas from Chiapas prevented buses running on Line 1 of the Metrobús system from continuing on their normal route. Much to their annoyance, passengers traveling to the north or south of the city along Line 1 were forced to alight and walk a considerable distance to the next stop on the other side of the protest.\n\nBack in the historic center of the capital, business owners incurred losses of 250 million pesos (US $13 million) due to lost sales during the three weeks of the CNTE teachers sit-in, according to an estimate from the Mexico City chapter of the National Chamber of Commerce, Services and Tourism (Canaco).\n\nIn a shopping plaza opposite the Zócalo that is filled with jewelry stores, several business owners and employees told me that their sales had declined while the teachers were camping out. They cited drop-offs in sales ranging between 50% and 80%.\n\nThe presence of the teachers’ camp is a “great annoyance,” one jewelry store owner told me, explaining that the area around the Zócalo is not such a pleasant place to visit or shop when tents fill the square as well as nearby streets and sidewalks. Tourists hoping to stroll around the large square while taking in nearby sites including the Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace were simply unable to do so in the second half of May and early June.\n\nAccording to Canaco president Vicente Gutiérrez Camposeco, almost 17,000 businesses were affected by the CNTE protest. He explained that restaurants, hotels and stores were among those that suffered during the 23-day period the teachers remained in the Mexico City downtown.\n\nWhile the CNTE union members no longer occupy the Zócalo, protests in the central square, and indeed all over this sprawling capital city, will in all likelihood remain an ongoing recurrence as long as humans continue to live here.\n\nBeing held up by one — as will inevitably happen if you spend any length of time in the capital — is a Mexico City experience every bit as authentic as chowing down on a plate of tacos al pastor, floating through the canals of Xochimilco on a trajinera or watching the lucha libre with thousands of other michelada-guzzling fans.\n\nText and photographs by Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"The recent tent city that sprang up in the Zócalo is just the latest in a centuries-long and legally protected tradition of protest in Mexico City.\n\n\nThe post Street protests in the capital: A timeless feature of life in Mexico appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/street-protests-in-mexico-city/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Teachers-camp-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:44:25","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.005},{"id":336009728,"title":"Trump pertimbang bom Iran sekali lagi, kekalkan sekatan","text":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump, melemparkan kritikan dan ancaman keras terhadap Pemimpin Tertinggi Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBeliau dilaporkan mengancam menggugurkan rancangan menarik balik sekatan ke atas Iran dan akan mempertimbangkan untuk mengebom Iran sekali lagi jika Tehran didapati memperkayakan uranium ke tahap membimbangkan.\n\nTrump mendakwa beliau sudah menyelamatkan nyawa Khamenei.

the War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law requiring the president to consult with Congress “in every possible instance” before deploying US forces into hostilities.In a letter to Congress earlier this

But she's been holding off over concerns that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would swiftly detain him and try to deport him again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys are now asking the judge to continue to detain him following statements by Trump administration officials \"because we cannot put any faith in any representation made on this issue by\" the Justice Department.\n\n\"The irony of this request is not lost on anyone,\" the attorneys wrote.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a construction worker who had been living in Maryland, became a flashpoint over Trump's hard-line immigration policies when he was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March. Facing mounting pressure and a Supreme Court order, Trump's Republican administration returned him this month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"preposterous.\"\n\nIn a response to the request by Abrego Garcia's attorneys on Friday, acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire agreed to delaying Abrego Garcia's release. He reiterated his stance that Abrego Garcia should remain in jail before trial and that he lacks jurisdiction over ICE, stating that he has no way to prevent Abrego Garcia's deportation.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond directly to a question from The Associated Press regarding its plans for Abrego Garcia. A DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement that \"he will never go free on American soil.\"\n\nJustice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin told The Associated Press on Thursday that the department intends to try Abrego Garcia on the smuggling charges before it moves to deport him, stating that Abrego Garcia \"has been charged with horrific crimes, including trafficking children, and will not walk free in our country again.\"\n\nHours earlier, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn told a federal judge in Maryland that the U.S. government plans to deport Abrego Garcia to a \"third country\" that isn't El Salvador. Guynn said there was no timeline for the deportation plans.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys on Friday cited Guynn's comments as a reason to fear he would be deported \"immediately.\" They accused the Trump administration of bringing Abrego Garcia back \"to convict him in the court of public opinion\" with the intention of deporting him before he has a chance to defend himself at trial.\n\n\"In a just world, he would not seek to prolong his detention further,\" his attorneys wrote.\n\nAbrego Garcia's attorneys have asked the judge to delay his release until a July 16 court hearing, which will consider a request by prosecutors to revoke Abrego Garcia's release order while he awaits trial.\n\nAbrego Garcia pleaded not guilty on June 13 to smuggling charges that his attorneys have characterized as an attempt to justify his mistaken expulsion to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nWhen the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia in March, it violated a U.S. immigration judge's order in 2019 that barred his expulsion to his native country. The immigration judge had found that Abrego Garcia faced a credible threat from gangs that had terrorized him and his family.\n\nThe human smuggling charges pending against Abrego Garcia stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee, during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers without luggage.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville wrote in a ruling Sunday that federal prosecutors failed to show that Abrego Garcia was a flight risk or a danger to the community.\n\nDuring a court hearing Wednesday, Holmes set specific conditions for Abrego Garcia's release that included him living with his brother, a U.S. citizen, in Maryland. But she held off on releasing him over concerns that prosecutors can't prevent ICE from deporting him.\n\nFinley reported from Norfolk, Va.","summary":"Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge in Tennessee on Friday to delay his release from jail because of \"contradictory statements\" by President Donald Trump's administration over whether or not he'll be deported upon release.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/kilmar-abrego-garcia-case-news-lawyers-ask-tennessee-federal-judge-keep-jail-deportation-concerns/16866326/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16847859_062525-wls-abrego-garcia-latest-4pvo-vid.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/062725-wls-abrego-garcia-430p-vo-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:36:50","author":"Ben Finley And Travis Loller","authors":["Ben Finley And Travis Loller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.483},{"id":336013320,"title":"Gavin Newsom Shrugs Off Fox News Claim He’s Suing to ‘Chill Free Speech,’ Says On-Air Lies Are ‘Smoking Gun’ | Video","text":"Gavin Newsom shrugged off Fox News calling his new lawsuit against them an effort to “chill free speech.”\n\nWhile talking with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen on Friday, Newsom was read Fox News’ response to his defamation lawsuit that called for $787 million in damages, a retraction and formal apology from Jesse Watters after saying the governor lied about a recent phone call with President Trump.\n\n“Governor Newsom’s transparent publicity stunt is frivolous and designed to chill free speech critical of him,” Fox News’ statement read. “We will defend this case vigorously and look forward to it being dismissed.”\n\nCohen asked for Newsom’s response and the governor pointed out that “it’s almost verbatim what they said in the Dominion case.” He is suing for the same amount Dominion Voting Systems did in their lawsuit against the network.\n\n“They knew they had lied in that original statement against Dominion,” he said. “They’re lying in this case. I mean, look at the chyron you just put up says, ‘Gavin Lied About Call [With] Trump.’ Period. Full Stop. I mean, I don’t know what more smoking gun you need.”\n\nNewsom continued: “And so look, this organization, it needs to be held to account. I think what’s so frustrating, I think for all of us is they learned no lessons from that defamation case as it relates to Dominion. Nothing, they continue the practices that led to that record-breaking settlement.”\n\n“That’s why this needed to be filed and that’s why we felt compelled to make this case and to assert ourselves. Look, if they want to apologize, they can apologize, and if they want to hide behind these lies, they’ll pay a price.”\n\nAccording to the governor’s lawsuit obtained by TheWrap, he last spoke to the president on June 7 for about 16 minutes; the call came a day after President Trump sent 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to counter protesters amid the anti-ICE demonstrations that happened in the city.\n\nLater, on June 10, Trump said he spoke to Newsom “a day ago,” which Newsom pushed back against. Watters then asked on air, “Why would Newsom lie and claim Trump never called him?” while flashing a screenshot of Trump’s June 7 call with Newsom on the screen, which had been obtained by Fox News reporter John Roberts. That move, according to Newsom’s attorneys, fits the legal standard for defamation. \n\n“If Fox News wants to lie to the American people on Donald Trump’s behalf, it should face consequences — just like it did in the Dominion case,” Newsom said in a statement to TheWrap when the lawsuit was filed. “I believe the American people should be able to trust the information they receive from a major news outlet. Until Fox is willing to be truthful, I will keep fighting against their propaganda machine.”\n\nYou can watch Newsom’s interview in the video above.","summary":"\"If they want to apologize, they can apologize, and if they want to hide behind these lies, they’ll pay a price,\" the governor adds\n\n\nThe post Gavin Newsom Shrugs Off Fox News Claim He&#8217;s Suing to &#8216;Chill Free Speech,&#8217; Says On-Air Lies Are &#8216;Smoking Gun&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/gavin-newsom-shrugs-off-fox-news-lawsuit-response/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gavin-Newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:33:17","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":336008172,"title":"Senate votes down resolution to block Trump's ability to strike Iran without authorization","text":"Democratic efforts in the Senate to prevent President Donald Trump from further escalating with Iran fell short Friday, with Republicans blocking a resolution that marked Congress' first attempt to reassert its war powers following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nThe resolution, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, aimed to affirm that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran. Asked Friday if he would bomb Iranian nuclear sites again if he deemed necessary, Trump said, \"Sure, without question.\"\n\nThe measure was defeated in a 53-47 vote in the Republican-held Senate. One Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joined Republicans in opposition, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor.\n\nMost Republicans have said Iran posed an imminent threat that required decisive action from Trump, and they backed his decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites last weekend without seeking congressional approval.\n\n\"Of course, we can debate the scope and strategy of our military engagements,\" said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. \"But we must not shackle our president in the middle of a crisis when lives are on the line.\"\n\nDemocrats cast doubt on that justification, arguing the president should have come to Congress first. They also said the president did not update them adequately, with Congress' first briefings taking place Thursday.\n\n\"The idea is this: We shouldn't send our sons and daughters into war unless there's a political consensus that this is a good idea, this is a national interest,\" Kaine said in a Thursday interview with The Associated Press. The resolution, Kaine said, wasn't aimed at restricting the president's ability to defend against a threat, but that \"if it's offense, let's really make sure we're making the right decision.\"\n\nIn a statement following Friday's vote, Kaine said he was \"disappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress\" should be a part of a decision to go to war.\n\nDemocrats' argument for backing the resolution centered on the War Powers Resolution, passed in the early 1970s, which requires the president \"in every possible instance\" to \"consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces.\"\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor ahead of Friday's vote, Paul said he would back the resolution, saying that \"despite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure.\"\n\n\"It is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran's nuclear aspirations,\" said Paul.\n\nTrump is just the latest in a line of presidents to test the limits of the resolution - though he's done so at a time when he's often bristling at the nation's checks and balances.\n\nTrump on Monday sent a letter to Congress - as required by the War Powers Resolution - that said strikes on Iran over the weekend were \"limited in scope and purpose\" and \"designed to minimize casualties, deter future attacks and limit the risk of escalation.\"\n\nBut following classified briefings with top White House officials this week, some lawmakers remain skeptical about how imminent the threat truly was.\n\n\"There was no imminent threat to the United States,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, after Friday's classified briefings.\n\n\"There's always an Iranian threat to the world. But, I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago,\" Himes said.\n\nDespite Democratic skepticism, nearly all Republicans applauded Trump's decision to strike Iran. And for GOP senators, supporting the resolution would have meant rebuking the president at the same time they're working to pass his major legislative package.\n\nKaine proposed a similar resolution in 2020 aimed at limiting Trump's authority to launch military operations against Iran. Among the eight Republicans who joined Democrats in approving the resolution was Indiana Sen. Todd Young.\n\nAfter Thursday's classified briefing for the Senate, Young said he was \"confident that Iran was prepared to pose a significant threat\" and that, given Trump's stated goal of no further escalation, \"I do not believe this resolution is necessary at this time.\"\n\n\"Should the Administration's posture change or events dictate the consideration of additional American military action, Congress should be consulted so we can best support those efforts and weigh in on behalf of our constituents,\" Young said in a statement.\n\nTrump has said that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now in place. But he and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have verbally sparred in recent days, with the ayatollah warning the U.S. not to launch future strikes on Iran.\n\nWhite House officials have said they expect to restart talks soon with Iran, though nothing has been scheduled.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Leah Askarinam contributed to this report.","summary":"Senate Republicans did not agree to push forward a resolution on Friday that would block Trump's ability to use additional military force against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/senate-votes-down-resolution-block-trumps-ability-use-more-military-force-iran-without-authorization-congress/16866053/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16866327_TN-trump-iran-war-powers.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:32:11","author":"Joey Cappelletti","authors":["Joey Cappelletti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":336013290,"title":"Nicholas Hoult reveals 'worryingly' dangerous hobby that leaves film bosses terrified for the Superman star's safety","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jun 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe day Jackie Kennedy told Marilyn Monroe: 'You'll marry Jack, move into the White House.

It's going around the corners, that's when things can go wrong'\n\nNicholas often shares his love for racing to Instagram alongside snaps of himself posing alongside numerous Ferrari supercars\n\nNicholas is wed to stunning model Bryana Holly, 31, and together the fiercely private couple share son Joaquin, six, and another child born in 2022\nIf this record pace continues, it could be even higher, as fans have continued to express their excitement on social media all day on Wednesday after the new trailer dropped.\nThe trailer begins with a massive skyscraper falling and Superman (David Corenswet) swooping in to stop it from hitting the ground as we hear Lex Luthor (Nicholas) detailing his plan to destroy the Man of Steel.\nLuthor and his minions are seen destroying Superman's Fortress of Solitude, while we also see Superman/Clark Kent making out with Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), along with shots of his parents (Pruitt Taylor Vince, Neva Howell).\n\n Superman fans go wild over first look of David Corenswet in the blue superhero suit \nDroids are seeing picking up a battered Superman and taking him to the Fortress, along with shots of Superman in battle with Luthor's various henchfolk.\nOne particular shot fans have been cheering for shows Superman and his beloved dog Krypto the Superdog battle an enemy, literally punching his teeth out and hitting the camera lens, breaking the proverbial 'fourth wall.' \nSuperman is also see clashing with the abrasive Green Lantern character Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), who challenges him to, 'make a move, big blue.'\nMore shots show people all over the world rooting for Superman, which infuriates Luthor, who says, 'They chose him, let them die.'\nAn exhausted Superman is also seen on the ground during a battle, as Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi) tells him, 'Hey, quit messing around!'\nSuperman responds playfully (and tiredly), 'I'm not messing around, I'm doing important stuff,' another line that has clearly resonated with fans on social media.\n\nWarner Bros. released a new trailer for Superman earlier this month, as fans flocked to pick up their tickets just as they went on sale (Nicholas pictured in the movie) \n\nThe trailer begins with a massive skyscraper falling and Superman (David Corenswet) swooping in to stop it from hitting the ground as we hear Lex Luthor's (Nicholas) evil plans\n\nThe final shot shows Superman using his eyeball lasers to take out a slew of enemies, which fans have praised as well, such as @UpToTASK, who said, 'YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO this is hard AF #Superman.'\nAnother fan dubbed @DCUSuperboy said in all caps, 'I GENUINELY DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS AND NOT BE HYPED FOR #SUPERMAN.'\nOf course, not everyone was as excited, with many like @agamelift still praising director Zack Snyder for his previous DCEU films. \n'The #Superman blueprint is @ZackSnyder. This movie looks like complete garbage - Guardians of the Galaxy with Superman while copying major elements of Man of Steel and doing them worse. Yes, clearly the plot leak a few months back was legit,' he said.\nOthers like Aaron Fischer blasted the movie for its comedic elements, stating he has, 'lost all hope for this film,' adding it will be, 'stupid and silly.'\nStill, many were so excited they bought tickets immediately, like @SupermanOnFilm, who said, 'I’ve already bought 8 tickets for opening weekend #Superman.'\nNicholas Hoult\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicholas Hoult reveals 'worryingly' dangerous hobby that leaves film bosses terrified for the Superman star's safety\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.\n\nThe war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1200 people and taking 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nGaza’s health ministry says Israel’s post-October 7 military assault has killed over 56,000 Palestinians. The assault has also caused a hunger crisis, internally displaced Gaza’s entire population and prompted accusations of genocide at the International Court of Justice and of war crimes at the International Criminal Court. Israel denies the accusations.\n\nInterest in resolving the Gaza conflict has picked up steam in the wake of the US and Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. A ceasefire to the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict went into effect early this week.\n\n“I think it’s close. I just spoke to some of the people involved,” Mr Trump said. “We think within the next week we’re going to get a ceasefire.”\n\nHe did not say who he has been talking to, but he has told reporters he was in near-daily contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nMr Trump’s surprise prediction of a possible ceasefire deal in coming days came at a time when there have been few signs that the warring parties were ready to restart serious negotiations or budge from entrenched positions.\n\nA spokesperson for US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s office said they had no information to share beyond Mr Trump’s comments.\n\nWitkoff helped former President Joe Biden’s aides broker a ceasefire and hostage release agreement shortly before Mr Trump took office in January but the deal soon unravelled.\n\nThe Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIsraeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer plans to visit Washington starting on Monday for talks with Trump administration officials about Gaza, Iran and a possible White House visit by Netanyahu, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nNetanyahu said on Thursday the outcome of Israel’s war with Iran presented opportunities for peace that his country must not waste.\n\n- with Reuters","summary":"US President Donald Trump says a Gaza ceasefire could be reached within days, claiming negotiations between Israel and Hamas are making progress despite deep divisions.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/donald-trump-news-us-president-predicts-gaza-ceasefire-within-a-week-talks-with-israel-and-hamas-intensify-c-19182067","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19182067/2e7e49b16e826f01797b2e419526c18b4c617d64-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:23:23","author":"Kimberley Braddish","authors":["Kimberley Braddish"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.482},{"id":336008112,"title":"Donald Trump news: US President predicts Gaza ceasefire ‘within a week’, talks with Israel and Hamas intensify","text":"Camera IconUS President Donald Trump says a Gaza ceasefire could be reached within days.

Two others are being deported. Another two were deemed inadmissible, but are appealing that decision, according to figures covering the investigation up to June 6.\n\nSpokesperson Rebecca Purdy said the agency was orchestrating a ‘strong response to suspected senior officials in the Iranian regime’ and will ‘stop them from seeking or finding safe haven in Canada.’\n\nIrwin Cotler, a former Canadian Liberal justice minister, is among those who fear that Tehran has, in recent years, embedded sleeper cell agents in Canada to activate and strike at a time of their choosing.\n\n‘Right now, their policy is to target Jews and others abroad,’ he said of the Iranian government in a recent interview with The Globe and Mail.\n\n‘We also know that they activate sleeper cells that are already present in the country.’\n\nCotler, a fervent supported of Israel who is on an Iranian hit list, said he fears Tehran may have activated operatives in Canada to carry out acts of violence against opponents of the Iranian government.\n\n‘We don’t want any untoward Iranian penetration at this time,’ added Cotler.\n\nA Canadian government inquiry earlier this year found that Tehran keeps tabs on regime critics among its diaspora in Canada, and that Iranian officials with records of human right violations had snuck into the country using fake identities.\n\nThey can easily blend in with Canada’s sizeable population of Iranian origin — some 400,000 people concentrated in big urban centers, particularly in Southern Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec. \n\nAlarmingly, some are believed to have connections to the IRGC, the regime’s powerful paramilitary force known for orchestrating foreign terror operations, including bombings, assassinations, and cyber warfare. \n\nSome say that the scale of Iranian covert operations in North America is larger and more dangerous than is widely appreciated.\n\nStopIRGC, a voluntary group that investigates tips and monitors social media posts and news articles, says it has identified 91 cases of former Iranian officials living in Canada since it was founded in 2022.\n\nThe group’s organizer, Mojdeh Shahriari, an Iranian-Canadian lawyer, has urged the government to work to ‘rid this beautiful, peace-loving country from bad actors including the terrorist members of the IRGC.’\n\nConcern about Iranian activity in Canada extend south of the border, where former FBI chief Chris Swecker has identified a clandestine network of Iran-aligned Hezbollah operating on both sides of the US-Canada border.\n\nSwecker, who was an assistant FBI director in the 2000s, says these agents could activate and strike in the US without any direct orders from Hezbollah’s headquarters in Lebanon or Iran, despite a ceasefire coming into effect.\n\n‘I think there is a clear and present danger and the greatest terrorist threat in the post-9/11 era,’ Swecker told the Daily Mail.\n\nAs head of a prosecution effort in North Carolina in the early 2000s, Swecker said he had identified fundraisers and agents of the Lebanese Shiite political party-cum-militia in Michigan, Kentucky and Canada.\n\nSwecker says the US must remain on alert despite the ceasefire because any sleeper cells or radicalized militants could strike even if an attack did not serve the interests of Iran or its proxies.\n\n‘It’s not rational. There’s nothing to be gained by going out and killing Americans, shooting up a shopping mall or a sporting event, or driving a truck through a parade,’ Swecker said.\n\n‘But they’re not rational. They’re religious fanatics, and they wouldn’t necessarily need a direct order from the mothership in Lebanon.’\n\nSwecker’s fears are not without basis — there have been multiple documented cases of nefarious Iranian operations in the US since religious conservatives seized control in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nA US jury in March convicted two agents of Iran for plotting to assassinate the Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad in New York in 2022.\n\nLast November, the US Department of Justice announced charges against an Iranian national and two American accomplices for plotting to assassinate President Donald Trump.\n\nStill, in those plots, Tehran appeared to have hired US-based individuals without any personal ties to Iran to execute their plans — something they would not need to do if they had a network of covert operatives here.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that agents were working ‘full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country.’\n\n‘We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out — and we are,’ added McLaughlin.\n\n‘We don’t wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump’s mandate to secure the homeland.’\n\nIran’s mission to the United Nations in New York, StopIRGC, and Cotler did not answer our requests for comment.\n\nThe revelations about Iran-aligned agents embedded across North America comes as the US, Israel, and Iran assess the fallout of the 12-day war and to what extent Tehran’s nuclear program had been destroyed.\n\nTrump said his decision to unleash bunker-busting bombs in Sunday’s attack had devastated Iran’s nuclear program and called the outcome ‘a victory for everybody.’\n\nBut Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media on Friday that US and Israeli airstrikes caused ‘excessive and serious damage’ to its facilities, and that Trump was ‘exaggerating’ the attack’s success.\n\nHe also shut down ‘speculation’ that Tehran would return to negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program, stoking fears that further military confrontations are on the horizon.\n\n‘I would like to state clearly that no agreement, arrangement or conversation has been made to start new negotiations,’ Abbas Araghchi said. ‘No plan has been set yet to start negotiations.’\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Daily Mail takes a look at the groups Tehran has used to project power around the world.\n\nThe Quds Force \n\nSize: 20,000 (estimated) \n\nLocation: Iran, operates globally\n\nLeader: In flux\n\nAt the heart of Tehran’s global war machine is the Quds Force, the elite wing of the IRGC, tasked with foreign operations. It is named after the Arabic word for Jerusalem, and is likened to a spy agency with commando units.\n\nWith decades of experience funding, training and arming foreign fighters, the Quds Force is Tehran’s go-to instrument for asymmetric warfare. Analysts say that it is likely coordinating Iran’s response, selecting targets across the region and beyond.\n\nThe force built up a network of Arab allies known as the Axis of Resistance, establishing Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1982 and supporting the Palestinian militant Islamist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nQuds Force leaders have in recent years plotted to bomb Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington, and have been involved in assassination plots against Republican hawks John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, along with a Saudi ambassador to the US.\n\nIntelligence chiefs fear that Quds Force already has ‘sleeper’ cells operating in the US homeland. Some 729 Iranian nationals were reportedly allowed into the US between 2021 and 2024 under the Biden administration’s relaxed border rules.\n\nSize: 20,000 (estimated)\n\nLocation: Palestinian territories\n\nLeader: In flux\n\nThe Palestinian group Hamas, a Sunni militant group focused on a land dispute with Israel, was quick to condemn US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, branding Washington and its regional ally Israel ‘fully responsible for the grave repercussions of this aggression.’\n\nYet while expressing ‘solidarity’ with Tehran in its official response, Hamas steered clear of that fight, saying it had ‘complete confidence in Iran’s ability to defend its sovereignty and the interests of its people.’\n\nHamas is not the force it was before the coordinated October 7, 2023, raids on southern Israel that prompted a ferocious reciprocal military onslaught on the militants and blameless Gaza residents alike.\n\nVirtually all of Hamas’ senior leaders have been killed, and it remains unclear whether the group can still mount major attacks on Israel.\n\nIsrael says that it has killed some 20,000 militants in Gaza. US officials in January said Hamas had recruited as many as 15,000 fighters since the war began, though many were young and untrained.\n\nHamas leaders expressed ‘disappointment’ at the lackluster support they received from Axis allies against Israel.\n\nSize: 50,000 (estimated)\n\nLocation: Southern Lebanon\n\nLeader: Naim Qassem\n\nHezbollah was once seen as the ‘crown jewel’ of Iran’s surrogates and the most deadly member of the ‘ring of fire’ to attack Israel in the event of war between the Jewish state and Iran.\n\nBut much has changed since Hamas’ October 2023 raids and Israel’s military response in Gaza, and then against Hezbollah in Lebanon, involving everything from airstrikes to exploding pagers.\n\nThe group is understood to be well short of the 100,000 fighters it boasted of in 2021. It bears the brunt of regular Israel strikes and commando raids, and has not launched a single attack on Israel since the recent flare-up began.\n\nA spokesperson for Hezbollah told Newsweek that the group did not have immediate plans to retaliate against Israel and the US over their strikes on Iran’s nuclear program, saying Iran was a ‘strong country capable of defending itself.’\n\n‘Logic dictates that it can confront America and Israel.’\n\nStill, US intelligence agencies remain alarmed at Hezbollah’s worldwide footprint of terrorist cells, including militants who could have crossed America’s southern border to launch attacks on American soil.\n\nThe Houthis\n\nSize: 10,000 to 30,000\n\nLocation: Yemen\n\nLeader: Abdul-Malik al-Houthi\n\nThe rebel Houthi armed movement in Yemen is the Tehran-aligned group perhaps best positioned to forcefully respond to the US and Israeli airstrikes on Iran.\n\nSince the weekend attacks, the Houthis have vowed to support Iran in its fight and called for Muslim states to join the ‘Jihad and resistance option as one front against the Zionist-American arrogance.’\n\nYet while the Houthis have a track record of long-range drone strikes on Israel and missile attacks on shipping containers transiting the nearby Red Sea, these do not appear to have resumed amid the current escalation.\n\nThe Houthis are still technically bound by a ceasefire they struck with the US in May – Washington stopped its military campaign in exchange for the group halting attacks on US interests in the region.\n\nThe Houthis, too, have had their missiles and other military assets in Yemen pounded by Israeli warplanes for months, along with US and British strikes aimed at reducing their threat to shipping in the region.\n\nWhile the Houthis have received arms and training from Iran over the years, they follow a different branch of Islam, are geographically isolated and chiefly focused on their country’s 11-year civil war.\n\nSyria and Iraq\n\nSizes: Various groups from 3,000 to 60,000\n\nLocation: Syria and Iraq\n\nLeader: Various\n\nIn terms of raw manpower, Iran’s proxy strength is perhaps greatest across Iraq and, to a lesser extent, in Syria. Tehran has strong ties to nearly a dozen armed groups there, some with as many as 60,000 fighters.\n\nAmong the most formidable are Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iraqi Shia Islamist paramilitary group founded in 2003 to fight off US-led forces there, and the Badr Organization, which was formed in the years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nKata’ib Hezbollah has a record of attacking US bases at the behest of Iran. Its commander Abu Ali al-Askari has threatened to target US bases over its attack on Iran, telling CNN that they ‘will become akin to duck-hunting grounds.’\n\nStill, these Shiite groups are also focused chiefly on local concerns. Iran in the past wielded great influence in Syria, thanks to President Bashar Al Assad’s growing reliance on Tehran to prop up his embattled government.\n\nTehran’s influence in Syria collapsed after Assad’s regime fell in December and Sunni rebels seized control of the country. Crucially, this denied Iran a land route to supply missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA shocking wave of Iranian regime insiders — including suspected members of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: There are concerns about internal threats to America&#8217;s security, with fears that Iranian sleeper agents might be poised to act, possibly with support from an unexpected ally. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/there-are-concerns-about-internal-threats-to-americas-security-with-fears-that-iranian-sleeper-agents-might-be-poised-to-act-possibly-with-support-from-an-unexpected-ally/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-They-want-to-destroy-America-from-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:18:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":336010186,"title":"New York City speaks","text":"FOR an entire generation, the most enduring image of New York City (NYC) has been the sight of the Twin Towers being hit by planes on Sept 11, 2001. The spectre of that disaster has haunted the city in all kinds of palpable and impalpable ways. One of the latter has undoubtedly been the undercurrent of Islamophobia that has cast a pall over the skyscrapers and streets of New York. Muslims have been suspected, profiled on the streets, attacked on subways, vilified and pilloried. So have the causes related to Muslims. A prime example has been how students protesting against the genocide in Gaza have been hunted down and prosecuted.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the city appeared to finally turn the page. Following a ranked-choice election, a 33-year-old Muslim immigrant, the son of a professor and a filmmaker, became the Democratic Party’s nominee for mayor of NYC. The win is historic in many ways, Zohran Mamdani is set to be the youngest mayor, the first Muslim American mayor, the first immigrant mayor, and the first mayor who has won on a Democratic-socialist platform. Unlike the rest of the Democratic Party, which has stayed quiet on Gaza, Mamdani has openly and repeatedly condemned the genocide. More importantly, Mamdani has an openly socialist agenda that pledges to help the city’s middle class — crushed by the affordability crisis — by promoting city-owned grocery stores, free childcare and freezing rents for those struggling to live in the city\n\nThe chances that he will go from mayoral candidate to mayor in the election in November are high. New York is a Democratic city and the candidate who wins the Democratic primary usually goes on to win the city-wide race in the mayoral election. In the run-up to the election, most polls predicted that Mamdani’s opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo, would win the primary. This did not happen, and around midnight on the day of the election Cuomo conceded to Mamdani, whose vote counts were ahead by eight points. Mamdani’s other opponent, current NYC mayor, Eric Adams, has faced challenges of his own. Even though he has vowed to run as an independent, his indictment on corruption charges and the fact that he was pardoned by President Donald Trump would have consequences even if he were to run against Mamdani as an independent.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that the road ahead is easy or entirely clear. Mamdani’s support among the younger voters, South Asian and East Asian immigrants, as well as in middle-class neighbourhoods of the city allowed him to raise the maximum $8 million that candidates are permitted in an election. However, his opponents can spend large amounts to attack him. This was evident in the run-up to the voting, when former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg funded the main attack advertisements against Mamdani. These ads focused on painting Mamdani as an extremist, mostly owing to his open and unapologetic support for Muslim and Palestinian causes. For his part, Mamdani’s ads were positive and colourful and sought to mobilise the diverse population of America’s largest city to finally vote for definitive change.\n\nAnother reason why Mamdani’s win has been shocking is that NYC is also home to the largest population of American Jews in the country and one of the largest outside the state of Israel. Mamdani’s openly anti-Zionist stance has irked many in this community. His win has shocked the many rich, pro-Zionist political donors and groups in the city. It is very likely that they will use their money to try and bring down Mamdani’s candidacy to thwart the history-making moment that otherwise would have seen a Muslim immigrant as mayor of America’s largest city in terms of population.\n\n One of the main reasons why Mamdani’s win has been shocking is that NYC is home to the largest population of American Jews in the country.\n\nSo far, Mamdani’s campaign has been able to absorb all of these attacks. One reason for this is that his win is rooted in the strong foundation of grassroots organisation among the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Arab communities that make up a solid vote bank in Queens, where Mamdani is from. These communities now have decades of experience in organising and dealing with Islamophobic attacks that paint their leaders as terrorists — in fact, anything even remotely linked with Islam — as inherently extremist. Mamdani’s win suggests that even the general population of NYC is fed up of these attacks and of being saturated with the same old Islamophobic propaganda that has been flung around to taint each and every Muslim American candidate for just about anything.\n\nAs important as this is the courage that Mamdani has so far shown in espousing a Democratic-socialist agenda. Average rents for a two-bedroom apartment in NYC are often upwards of $5,000, creating a crisis in which the city’s middle class find themselves facing crushing inflationary costs. Crime has risen in the city and the subways have become unsafe and prone to attacks by the mentally ill and homeless, who have no place to go. Women especially feel unsafe in the city’s public transport system, which was once NYC’s pride. Mainstream Democrats have shied away from proposing solutions to these problems, just as they have turned their back on rising Islamophobia and the increasing harassment of migrants and undocumented people. Mamdani’s win suggests that Democratic voters are eager to move farther left instead of centre, which has been the party’s preference at the national level.\n\nAt the same time, while a win for Mamdani is probable, it is not a given. Many months lie between now and November, and Mamdani’s enemies are formidable. However, in having come this far and proving so many people wrong, Zohran Mamdani has shown that change is possible even in a city, that has for quite long now treated Muslims as suspects. \n\nThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\n\nrafia.zakaria@gmail.com\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025","summary":"FOR an entire generation, the most enduring image of New York City (NYC) has been the sight of the Twin Towers being hit by planes on Sept 11, 2001.

I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.” \n\nMr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”. \n\nThe nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move. \n\nIndian ceasefire claims\n\nResponding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality. \n\n“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said. \n\n“If India wants talks, we are ready.

But the ultimate fate of the president's policy remains uncertain.\n\nHere's what to know about birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court's ruling and what happens next.\n\nBirthright citizenship makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally.\n\nThe practice goes back to soon after the Civil War, when Congress ratified the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, in part to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.\n\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,” the amendment states.\n\nThirty years later, Wong Kim Ark, a man born in the U.S. to Chinese parents, was refused re-entry into the U.S. after traveling overseas. His suit led to the Supreme Court explicitly ruling that the amendment gives citizenship to anyone born in the U.S., no matter their parents’ legal status.\n\nIt has been seen since then as an intrinsic part of U.S. law, with only a handful of exceptions, such as for children born in the U.S. to foreign diplomats.\n\nTrump's executive order, signed in Januar,y seeks to deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. It's part of the hardline immigration agenda of the president, who has called birthright citizenship a “magnet for illegal immigration.”\n\nTrump and his supporters focus on one phrase in the amendment — “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” – saying it means the U.S. can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.\n\nA series of federal judges have said that’s not true, and issued nationwide injunctions stopping his order from taking effect.\n\n“I’ve been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,” U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said at a hearing earlier this year in his Seattle courtroom.\n\nIn Greenbelt, Maryland, a Washington suburb, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that “the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed” Trump’s interpretation of birthright citizenship.\n\nThe high court's ruling was a major victory for the Trump administration in that it limited an individual judge's authority in granting nationwide injunctions. The administration hailed the ruling as a monumental check on the powers of individual district court judges, whom Trump supporters have argued want to usurp the president's authority with rulings blocking his priorities around immigration and other matters.\n\nBut the Supreme Court did not address the merits of Trump's bid to enforce his birthright citizenship executive order.\n\n“The Trump administration made a strategic decision, which I think quite clearly paid off, that they were going to challenge not the judges’ decisions on the merits, but on the scope of relief,” said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told reporters at the White House that the administration is “very confident” that the high court will ultimately side with the administration on the merits of the case.\n\nThe justices kicked the cases challenging the birthright citizenship policy back down to the lower courts, where judges will have to decide how to tailor their orders to comply with the new ruling. The executive order remains blocked for at least 30 days, giving lower courts and the parties time to sort out the next steps.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling leaves open the possibility that groups challenging the policy could still get nationwide relief through class-action lawsuits and seek certification as a nationwide class. Within hours after the ruling, two class-action suits had been filed in Maryland and New Hampshire seeking to block Trump’s order.\n\nBut obtaining nationwide relief through a class action is difficult as courts have put up hurdles to doing so over the years, said Suzette Malveaux, a Washington and Lee University law school professor.\n\n“It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem of not having nationwide relief,” said Malveaux, who had urged the high court not to eliminate the nationwide injunctions.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned the court's dissenting opinion, urged the lower courts to “act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court’s prompt review\" in cases “challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order.”\n\nOpponents of Trump's order warned there would be a patchwork of polices across the states, leading to chaos and confusion without nationwide relief.\n\n“Birthright citizenship has been settled constitutional law for more than a century,\" said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a nonprofit that supports refugees and migrants. “By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear.”\n\nAssociated Press reporters Mark Sherman and Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us,\" US President said. The Government of Canada has introduced the digital services tax (DST). The DST requires foreign and domestic large businesses to pay tax on certain revenue earned from engaging with online users in Canada if they meet certain conditions, as per a statement issued by the Canadian Revenue Agency.

We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven-day period. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote. According to CNN, DST allows countries to collect revenue from large companies that operate online, even if their business is unprofitable. Citing a report published by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, CNN noted that American firms, particularly big tech companies like Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are disproportionately affected by DSTs. CNN reported that the US President had taken up the issue of DSTs in the trade negotiations with other countries and had referred to them as \"non-tariff trade barriers.\" It further reported that Canada has a new DST, which is set to come into effect from Monday and would be retroactive to 2022. As per the New York Times, Canada's 3 per cent digital services tax has been in place since last year, but the first payments are only due beginning on Monday. Since the tax is retroactive in nature, American companies were preparing to turn over roughly USD 2.7 billion to the Canadian government, the NYT noted, citing a trade group for large tech companies.

The nine justices on its bench will reconvene in October.\n\nBut before their departure, the justices made headlines. In a major victory for the administration of President Donald Trump, the six-person conservative majority decided to limit the ability of courts to issue universal injunctions that would block executive actions nationwide.\n\nTrump has long denounced court injunctions as an attack on his executive authority.\n\nIn two other rulings, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority again banded together. One decision allowed parents to opt out of school materials that include LGBTQ themes, while the other gave the go-ahead to Texas to place barriers to prevent youth from viewing online pornography.\n\nBut a decision on healthcare access saw some conservative justices align with their three left-wing colleagues. Here is an overview of their final rulings of the 2024 term.\n\nCourt upholds preventive care requirements\n\nIn the case of Kennedy v Braidwood Management, the Supreme Court saw its usual ideological divides fracture.\n\nThree conservative justices – Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts – joined with the court’s liberal branch, represented by Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan, for a six-to-three ruling.\n\nAt stake was the ability of a government task force to determine what kinds of preventive healthcare the country’s insurance providers had to cover.\n\nIt was the latest case to challenge the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, a piece of legislation passed under former President Barack Obama to expand healthcare access.\n\nThis case focused on a section of the act that allowed a panel of health experts – under the Department of Health and Human Services – to determine what preventive services should be covered at no cost.\n\nA group of individuals and Christian-owned businesses had challenged the legality of that task force, though.\n\nThey argued that the expert panel was a violation of the Appointments Clause, a section of the Constitution that requires certain political appointees to be chosen by the president and approved by the Senate.\n\nThe group had previously secured an injunction against the task force’s decision that HIV prevention medications be covered as preventive care.\n\nThat specific injunction was not weighed in the Supreme Court’s decision. But writing for the majority, Justice Kavanaugh affirmed that the task force was constitutional, because it was made up of “inferior officers” who did not need Senate approval.\n\nCourt gives nod to Texas’s age restrictions on porn\n\nSeveral states, including Texas, require users to verify their age before accessing pornographic websites, with the aim of shielding minors from inappropriate material.\n\nBut Texas’s law came under the Supreme Court’s microscope on Friday, in a case called Free Speech Coalition v Ken Paxton.\n\nThe Free Speech Coalition is a nonprofit that represents workers in the adult entertainment industry. They sued Texas’s attorney general, Paxton, arguing that the age-verification law would dampen First Amendment rights, which protect the right to free expression, free association and privacy.\n\nThe plaintiffs noted the risks posed by sharing personally identifying information online, including the possibility that identifying information like birthdates and sensitive data could be leaked. The American Civil Liberties Union, for instance, warned that Texas’s law “robs people of anonymity”.\n\nWriting for the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, Justice Clarence Thomas acknowledged that “submitting to age verification is a burden on the exercise” of First Amendment rights.\n\nBut, he added, “adults have no First Amendment right to avoid age verification” altogether. The majority upheld Texas’s law.\n\nCourt affirms children can withdraw from LGBTQ school material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority also continued its streak of religious freedom victories, with a decision in Mahmoud v Taylor.\n\nThat case centred on the Montgomery County Board of Education in Maryland, where books portraying LGBTQ themes had been approved for use in primary school curricula.\n\nOne text, for example, was a picture book called Love, Violet, which told the story of a young girl mustering the courage to give a Valentine to a female classmate. Another book, titled Pride Puppy, follows a child searching for her lost dog during an annual parade to celebrate LGBTQ pride.\n\nParents of children in the school district objected to the material on religious grounds, and some books, like Pride Puppy, were eventually withdrawn.\n\nBut the board eventually announced it would refuse to allow parents to opt out of the approved material, on the basis that it would create disruptions in the learning environment.\n\nSome education officials also argued that allowing kids to opt out of LGBTQ material would confer a stigma on the people who identify as part of that community – and that LGBTQ people were simply a fact of life.\n\nIn the majority’s decision, Justice Samuel Alito asserted that the education board’s policy “conveys that parents’ religious views are not welcome in the ‘fully inclusive environment’ that the Board purports to foster”.\n\n“The curriculum itself also betrays an attempt to impose ideological conformity with specific views on sexuality and gender,” Alito wrote.\n\nCourt limits the use of nationwide injunctions\n\nArguably, the biggest decision of the day was another ruling decided by the Supreme Court’s conservative supermajority.\n\nIn the case Trump v CASA, the Trump administration had appealed the use of nationwide injunctions all the way up to the highest court in the land.\n\nAt stake was an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office for his second term. That order sought to whittle down the concept of birthright citizenship, a right conferred under the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nPreviously, birthright citizenship had applied to nearly everyone born on US soil: Regardless of their parents’ nationality, the child would receive US citizenship.\n\nBut Trump has denounced that application of birthright citizenship as too broad. In his executive order, he put restrictions on birthright citizenship depending on whether the parents were undocumented immigrants.\n\nLegal challenges erupted as soon as the executive order was published, citing Supreme Court precedent that upheld birthright citizenship regardless of the nationality of the parent. Federal courts in states like Maryland and Washington quickly issued nationwide injunctions to prevent the executive order from taking effect.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday did not weigh the merits of Trump’s order on birthright citizenship. But it did evaluate a Trump administration petition arguing that the nationwide injunctions were instances of judicial overreach.\n\nThe conservative supermajority sided with Trump, saying that injunctions should generally not be universal but instead should focus on relief for the specific plaintiffs at hand. One possible exception, however, would be for class action lawsuits.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, the court’s latest addition and a Trump appointee, penned the majority’s decision.\n\n“No one disputes that the Executive has a duty to follow the law,” she wrote. “But the Judiciary does not have unbridled authority to enforce this obligation – in fact, sometimes the law prohibits the Judiciary from doing so.”","summary":"The Supreme Court delivered victories for religious freedom advocates and the Trump administration on its final day.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/28/what-cases-did-the-us-supreme-court-decide-at-the-end-of-its-2024-term?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25178425381970-1751045179.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:10:04","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":336005520,"title":"Ninth prison escapee in Orleans captured; man remains at large","text":"June 27 (UPI) -- The second-to-last of 10 escapees from a New Orleans jailbreak last month has been recaptured after six weeks on the run, authorities said Friday.\n\nAntoine Massey, 33, was located and arrested in a house in New Orleans on Friday night, according to the Louisiana State Police.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SHARON MAI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:40 BST, 27 June 2025 |Updated:01:03 BST, 28 June 2025 \n\nTommy Hilfiger nearly took a tumble during Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding extravaganza in Venice on Friday.\nThe fashion designer, 74, tripped while trying to get into a water taxi and narrowly avoided falling into the water in front of the newlyweds and all of their other A-list wedding guests.\nIn the video, he is seen walking ahead of quarterback Tom Brady — who risked an awkward run-in with his former flame at what has been widely dubbed as the 'wedding of the century.'\nWhile chatting with those around him, Hilfiger stumbled and nearly fell face first into the canal.\nLip reader Nicola Hickling revealed what Hilfiger said before and after he tripped, including a short exchange with Brady who was waiting behind him in the queue. \nThe lip reader said that Hilfiger turned back to Brady, who was directly behind him in the queue, and allegedly told him: 'You can go after me.'\n\nTommy Hilfiger nearly took a tumble during Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding extravaganza in Venice on Friday\n\nWhile the line seemed to be moving slowly as the slew of wedding guests dressed in black tie apparel were carefully stepping into each water taxi, some celebrities appeared impatient and started striking up conversations with each other. \nThe lip reader said that Hilfiger looked to his side and asked: 'Why do we need to stand here?'\nThen, he trips with the long step down, and an assistant helped steady the designer who then laughs off the misstep and continues on his way.\nHe appeared to have lost his footing more than once but shrugged it off and threw up a peace sign to onlookers.\nAfter Hilfiger was steady on his feet again, Brady appeared to make a joke and, while smiling, said to the fashion designer: 'Are you drunk?' \nHilfiger seemingly cracked a joke back before Brady allegedly added: 'Can you just get on?'\nHe was then seen waving to fans standing on the other side of the canal as they witnessed the celebrity migration to a different location for the weekend-long festivities. \nThis comes as Hilfiger and his wife Dee Ocleppo joined the slew of celebrities at gathering of the world's elites for the billionaire's nuptials to the former journalist.\n\nIn the video, he is seen walking ahead of quarterback Tom Brady — who risked an awkward run-in with his former flame at what has been widely dubbed as the 'wedding of the century'\n\nThe lip reader said that Hilfiger looked to his side and asked: 'Why do we need to stand here?'\n\nAfter Hilfiger was steady on his feet again, Brady appeared to make a joke and, while smiling, said to the fashion designer: 'Are you drunk?'

Gov. Ron DeSantis stated on Fox News Friday that the processing of undocumented immigrants might begin as soon as Tuesday.\n\n[RELATED: What to know about ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ Florida’s immigration detention site in the Everglades]\n\n“The hasty transformation of the site into a mass detention facility, which includes the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services systems, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts,” the lawsuit said. “The defendants, in their rush to build the center, have unlawfully bypassed the required environmental reviews. The direct and indirect harm to nearby wetlands, wildlife and air and water quality, and feasible alternatives to the action, must be considered under NEPA (a federal law known as the National Environmental Policy Act) before acting.”\n\nThe project has drawn national attention as Florida officials say they are trying to help President Donald Trump crack down on illegal immigration. DeSantis has brushed off arguments that the facility could harm the environment, saying Wednesday that opponents are “trying to use the Everglades as a pretext for the fact that they oppose immigration enforcement.”\n\n“It isn’t like we are going to start doing permanent sewer and all the other things,” DeSantis said. “It’s all temporary. We’ll set it up and we’ll break it down. This isn’t our first rodeo. The impact will be zero.”\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the federal Southern District of Florida, names as defendants U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons; Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie; and Miami-Dade County. The county owns the site, which is also partly in Collier County.\n\nWhile Florida has taken the lead in building and planning to operate the facility, the federal government will pay for it.\n\nAttorneys from the Center for Biological Diversity, the Earthjustice legal organization and the Coffey Burlington law firm contend in the 27-page lawsuit that the federal and state agencies have violated the National Environmental Policy Act and a law known as the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nAlso, they allege a violation of the Miami-Dade County code and that the state Division of Emergency Management “has no independent legislative authority to construct and manage a correctional facility.”\n\n[WATCH: Venezuelan migrant detained by ICE after court hearing in Orlando, family says]\n\nThe lawsuit said the National Environmental Policy Act requires federal agencies to prepare evaluations of projects that can significantly affect the environment. It said, for example, that the planned detention center is in an area that serves as habitat for endangered and threatened species such as the Florida panther.\n\n“The (detention) facility and associated operations will use and impair the Big Cypress National Preserve by causing direct and indirect harm to its wetlands, wildlife and air and water quality,” the lawsuit said. “These impacts will result in the degradation of the natural, scenic, hydrologic, floral and faunal and recreational values for which the preserve was created.”\n\nWhile the lawsuit seeks an injunction, DeSantis’ appearance Friday on the “Fox & Friends” program on Fox News showed extensive activity at the site. Trucks, other vehicles and equipment could be seen in the background, and DeSantis walked into a large tent-like structure that would house detainees.\n\n“This is going to be a force multiplier, and we’re really happy to be working with the federal government to satisfy President Trump’s mandate,” DeSantis said.\n\n— News Service Assignment Manager Tom Urban contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. – On Friday, environmental organizations launched a federal lawsuit aiming&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Environmental Groups File Lawsuit to Halt Florida&#8217;s &#8216;Alligator Alcatraz&#8217; Migrant Detention Center first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/environmental-groups-file-lawsuit-to-halt-floridas-alligator-alcatraz-migrant-detention-center/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Environmental-groups-sue-to-stop-‘Alligator-Alcatraz-Florida-migrant-center.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:02:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":336009736,"title":"AS jangka perjanjian perdagangan dimuktamadkan menjelang September - Bessent","text":"WASHINGTON: Amerika Syarikat (AS) merancang untuk memuktamadkan perjanjian perdagangan dengan rakan utama menjelang Hari Buruh pada September.\n\nSetiausaha Perbendaharaan AS, Scott Bessent, yang dipetik Sputnik/RIA Novosti, berkata ia akan dilakukan selepas menyelesaikan perjanjian dengan China dan United Kingdom (UK).\n\n\"Setiausaha (Perdagangan Howard) Lutnick berkata beliau menjangka 10 lagi perjanjian perdagangan dapat dimeterai. \n\n\"Jadi, jika kami boleh memuktamadkan 10 atau 12 daripada 18 perjanjian penting ini, dengan 20 lagi hubungan penting lain, saya fikir kita dapat selesaikan rundingan perdagangan menjelang Hari Buruh,\" kata Bessent kepada Fox Business.\n\nPada Khamis, Presiden AS Donald Trump mengumumkan bahawa AS telah menandatangani perjanjian perdagangan dengan China pada Rabu dan memberi bayangan bahawa perjanjian dengan India mungkin akan dimeterai.\n\nPada 2 April, Trump menandatangani perintah eksekutif yang mengenakan tarif ke atas import dari negara lain dengan kadar asas 10 peratus, manakala kadar lebih tinggi dikenakan ke atas 57 negara berdasarkan defisit perdagangan AS dengan setiap negara berkenaan.\n\nPada 9 April, Trump berkata tarif ke atas eksport dari lebih 75 negara yang tidak membalas akan dikurangkan kepada 10 peratus selama 90 hari.\n\nTempoh penangguhan 90 hari untuk kebanyakan negara akan berakhir pada 8 Julai, manakala penangguhan tarif 90 hari ke atas China, yang turut termasuk dalam peraturan ini, dijadualkan tamat pada 12 Ogos.\n\nSetiausaha Akhbar Rumah Putih Karoline Leavitt pada Khamis berkata Trump menganggap tarikh akhir Julai bagi perjanjian tarif sebagai 'tidak kritikal'.\n\nBeliau berkata bahawa selepas tarikh itu, Trump boleh mengenakan kadar tarif ke atas mana-mana negara walaupun tanpa perjanjian perdagangan dimeterai.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Amerika Syarikat (AS) merancang untuk memuktamadkan perjanjian perdagangan dengan rakan utama menjelang Hari Buruh pada September.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/06/1413246/jangka-perjanjian-perdagangan-dimuktamadkan-menjelang-september","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/bh28jangka-o_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1751068816.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:00:29","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.157},{"id":336009508,"title":"Talks over threats: South Korea tries a new tack to sway its nuclear neighbour","text":"On a day heavy with memory, South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung invoked the language of peace, urging restraint and dialogue even as the nuclear-armed North forges deeper ties with Russia and the Korean peninsula bristles with tension.\n“The surest way to secure our safety is to build peace – peace so strong that there is no need to fight,” Lee said in a solemn social media post, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the onset of the Korean war.\nThe conflict from 1950–53 left millions dead and ended with an armistice, but no peace treaty.\n“The era of relying solely on military strength to defend the country is over,” Lee wrote in his post. “It is better to win without war than to win through war.”\nHis message was more than just rhetoric. In recent weeks, Lee’s newly formed government has moved to recalibrate the peninsula’s dangerous status quo, seeking to nudge North Korea from confrontation to conversation, even as the spectre of conflict looms larger than at any time in recent memory.\n\nIn a gesture laden with symbolism, Seoul this month halted its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border – the first such move in a year. Within hours, Pyongyang reciprocated, silencing its own speakers.\nSeoul has also urged activist groups to refrain from launching anti-regime leaflets across the heavily fortified border, a practice that in the past drew furious responses – and trash-laden balloon launches – from the North.\nWithin Lee’s cabinet, a new voice emerged this week. Chung Dong-young, freshly nominated as unification minister, called on Tuesday for “restoring inter-Korean communication” as “an urgent priority”.\n“Trust between the two Koreas has completely collapsed and trust begins with communication,” he warned, pointedly blaming the previous conservative government of impeached president Yoon Suk-yeol for failing to stop the rot.\nChung urged a revival of talks not just between Seoul and Pyongyang, but also between North Korea and Washington.\nHe also expressed hope that China might reclaim its role as a regional stabiliser, noting Beijing’s “key mediating role” in the six-party talks of 2005. “We hope China will continue to play a constructive role going forward,” Chung said.\n\nThe scars of the Korean war run deep. Few conflicts of the last century wrought such devastation – yet out of that ruin, South Korea has risen, transforming itself into an economic and cultural giant. From a per capita income of just US$67 in 1953, it now stands among the world’s richest economies, a titan of industry and pop culture with a gross domestic product per capita exceeding US$35,000.\nLee, in his anniversary message, paid tribute to that journey. “The truest way to honour the fallen is to build a country where war never happens again,” he wrote, saluting the veterans whose sacrifices underpinned the nation’s rebirth.\nClosed-door policy\nBut the path to reconciliation is perilous. Analysts see Lee’s approach as a return to South Korea’s liberal tradition of engagement – a method aimed at reviving dialogue on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, however remote that prospect may seem.\n“President Lee’s basic stance is to prioritise peace and stability first, then seek to improve ties when the timing is right,” Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, told This Week in Asia. “But he’s facing a North Korea that has firmly shut its doors.”\nThat freeze in inter-Korean contacts was underlined just weeks ago, when Pyongyang ignored a South Korean offer to discuss the return of four North Koreans rescued at sea.\n\nSince 2019’s failed summit in Hanoi between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump, North Korea has grown more isolated and more combative, amending its constitution last year to brand the South a “hostile state” and severing road and rail links in a move Kim called “not only a physical severing, but also the end of an evil relationship with the South”.\nMeanwhile, Pyongyang has tightened its strategic partnership with Russia, supplying arms and soldiers for Moscow’s war in Ukraine, reportedly in exchange for fuel and raw materials.\n“The North is gaining tangible benefits from its cooperation with Russia,” Koh said.\n“Unlike with China, closer ties with Russia carry fewer risks of exposing ordinary North Koreans to outside influences. Pyongyang sees this alignment as ideal for achieving its top goal – preserving the one-man rule of Kim Jong-un.”\nWith its nuclear arsenal growing, North Korea has shown little interest in returning to the negotiating table. “Pyongyang is now emphasising self-reliance and limiting exchanges with the outside world – with the exception of Russia,” Koh added.\n\nLim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea’s Kyungnam University, said Seoul’s recent moves might have helped ease tensions, but expectations were tempered.\n“Seoul’s friendly gestures, such as halting loudspeaker broadcasts and preventing leaflet launches, help reduce military tensions and lower the risk of unintended clashes near the border,” he said.\n“But South Korea does not expect North Korea to return to dialogue any time soon.”\nEven if Lee’s peace drive were to soften Pyongyang’s stance, Lim warned that Seoul’s options had been severely narrowed by international sanctions.\n\n“To restore inter-Korean railways and roads, for instance, you need materials and personnel crossing the border – and that would trigger sanctions,” he said.\n“Unless there’s an unexpected breakthrough in stalled denuclearisation talks, which looks highly unlikely at the moment, President Lee’s peace drive may not go far.”\nFor now, the peninsula remains a sideshow for most world powers. Despite Trump’s reported willingness to meet Kim again, “it’s not high on his agenda”, Lim said.\nWith Washington’s focus increasingly drawn to crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, the two Koreas will remain suspended between war and peace – a division with no clear end in sight.","summary":"On a day heavy with memory, South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung invoked the language of peace, urging restraint and dialogue even as the nuclear-armed North forges deeper ties with Russia and the Korean peninsula bristles with tension.\n“The surest way to secure our safety is to build peace – peace so strong that there is no need to fight,” Lee said in a solemn social media post, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the onset of the Korean war.\nThe conflict from 1950–53 left millions dead and...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3316137/south-korea-tries-different-tack-sway-its-nuclear-armed-neighbour-olive-branch","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/27/86b8f235-968e-46a5-9649-91e8af4e461a_10bd3e00.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:00:13","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":336004256,"title":"Fueling frustration: Why Irish petrol prices stay high, even when oil doesn’t","text":"Like he told major retailer Walmart to “eat the tariffs” he has imposed, the US president was telling oil markets to eat the instability he had directly contributed to in the Middle East with a direct attack on one of the biggest producers of oil in the world.\n\nAs much as he appears to desire the power to dictate such terms, how much we all pay at the petrol pumps is not at the whim of Donald Trump.\n\nSo far, however, prices appear to be singing to his tune somewhat, if not for the reasons he may think so, that is, himself.\n\nHere in Ireland, it was only three years ago that we saw geopolitical forces brought to bear as Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine saw prices for everything skyrocket, including for petrol and diesel.\n\nWhile the impacts on us pale into comparison when compared to the Ukrainian people, Russia’s actions did precipitate a cost-of-living crisis charities say is still biting to this day.\n\nBut, despite bombs falling in Tehran, Tel Aviv and Doha in recent weeks, the oil markets so far — and this must be stressed, so far — have not reacted like they did back in 2022.\n\nBack then, there was a “perfect storm” of Russia being such a big supplier, coupled with a relative shortage of oil supply coming out of the pandemic, according to transport commentator Conor Faughnan.\n\nThis time, due to tariff threats and concerns about the global economy, as well as additional supply in the market at the moment, oil prices had been expected to trend down in the second half of this year prior to the recent Israel-Iran hostilities.\n\n“It’s been notable to observe when we had the Russian invasion in 2022, there was a very strong and prolonged reaction in world oil prices,” Mr Faughnan said. “They went up and stayed high. That’s different from the current crisis.\n\n“There hasn’t as yet been the sort of extreme reaction we might have expected to see. Over the years, there’s been a very serious set of circumstances, there’s been multiple geopolitical shocks to the oil price. Often, they’ll cause turbulence on a two-to-three day basis. \n\n When Russia invaded, we had a sustained effect. This time around, it’s different.\n\nMr Faughnan said it was more a case of the markets having “bated breath”, or there being a “pregnant pause” while they waited to see how events would play out in the Middle East conflict.\n\nOn Tuesday, oil prices hit their lowest in two weeks after Trump claimed there had been a “total ceasefire” agreed between Israel and Iran. But, as we know, the bombing did not fully stop there.\n\nLater in the week, JP Morgan analysts said global energy prices were “moderating” following the ceasefire.\n\nHowever, the lobby group for fuel retailers said that prices were already coming from a high base.\n\nFuels for Ireland chief executive Kevin McPartland said even prior to US strikes on Iran, wholesale prices had already surged by nine cent per litre for petrol, eight cent for diesel and seven cent for kerosene.\n\nAnd this is before tax and retailer margin is applied.\n\n“We fully understand the pressure that rising fuel costs put on households and businesses, particularly as we move through a cost-of-living crisis,” Mr McPartland said.\n\n These are global effects being felt locally. Fuel retailers in Ireland are not setting prices arbitrarily. They are responding to international costs that are outside their control.\n\nOne factor that could send the price ballooning even higher is Iran’s actions at the strategically important Strait of Hormuz.\n\nAbout a fifth of the world’s oil passes through this area, which has Iran to the north and Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the south. Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait, which would restrict trade and affect global oil prices, but has never followed through on the threat.\n\nMr Faughnan said a shock to the world oil price is “possible if the situation worsens, or the Strait of Hormuz is involved”.\n\n“It hasn’t happened yet,” he said. “If it does hit, we’ll reassess. What’s remarkable to note is that post-Israeli attacks on Iran last week, the global oil market was, relaxed is the wrong word, but it wasn’t the extreme reaction we might have expected.” \n\nPetrol and diesel prices in Ireland\n\nThen again, Irish consumers will not need to experience another geopolitical shock to see the cost of filling the car be unwelcomingly high. They have been paying high prices at the pumps for some time.\n\nWhile the cost of a litre of petrol has fallen from its peak of more than €2 in the summer of 2022, it still remains stubbornly high at arobout €1.79, according to figures from AA Ireland.\n\nIts figures suggest prices have fluctuated wildly, ranging between €1.50 and close to €1.90 a litre for both diesel and petrol in recent years.\n\nEven going further back, and the price at the pumps has been high. Heading into 2020, prices going back five years had been in the range of between €1.20 and €1.50 a litre.\n\nIf we were to factor in general inflation since then, using data from the Central Statistics Office, it has reached over 25% in that time. So, the €1.31 you spent for a litre of petrol in January 2015 translates to about €1.64 now. While fuel inflation is higher than this, they’re in the same ball park.\n\nIn other words, the prices were high enough then and even higher now.\n\nFor its part, an AA spokesperson said: “Any volatility in international markets inevitably can affect wholesale costs and, ultimately, prices at the pump. \n\n If tensions escalate or shipping routes are disrupted, it could lead to price increases for Irish consumers. We’ve already seen some fluctuations this year, and continued instability could keep upward pressure on prices in the months ahead.\n\nMr Faughnan said an increase in the cost of oil would also lead to consumers paying more Vat on the cost of filling the car, as it is calculated as a percentage of the cost.\n\nGovernment taxes\n\n“About 55%-60% of the money you pay at the pump goes directly to the Government in taxes,” he said. “The oil price component is surprisingly small. You’ve the oil price, refinery cost, shipping cost, wholesale margin, retail margin. On top of that then the price is doubled.\n\n“A big move in the oil price translates to a more modest move at the pump price.” \n\nMr McPartland, whose organisation represents fuel retailers, said when fuel prices go up the tax on them goes up too, which he said warranted a “comprehensive review of how fuel for heating and transport is taxed”.\n\n“We are calling on the minister for finance to establish a group of experts to undertake this review as a matter of urgency,” he said.\n\nWe’ve been here before. To help mitigate cost-of-living rises, the Government temporarily reduced excise rates on fuel at a “significant cost to the exchequer”, according to officials from the Department of Finance.\n\nIt said last year this measure had effectively been a fossil fuel subsidy and was a “climate negative measure”. It appears any measures to ease the taxes paid at the petrol pumps remain unlikely.\n\nOn carbon taxes — which make up about 13c-14c of the €1.79 litre of petrol — finance minister Paschal Donohoe told the Dáil that if “we want to invest more in a greener and lower carbon future, we need to have a way of paying for it”.\n\nAt the same time, in terms of an alternative, take-up of electric vehicles is accelerating but not yet at the kind of critical mass needed to significantly reduce our transport emissions.\n\nJust last week, the Climate Change Advisory Council said new EV grants of €10,000 should be given to the lower-paid to encourage them to make the switch.\n\n“The benefits and savings from existing policies and measures are not keeping pace with the causes of increased emissions, including increasing transport demand in terms of fuel sales and vehicle kilometres, and corrective action is needed in the sector,” it said.\n\nCSO data tells us despite 16% of new car sales so far this year being EVs, with similar market shares for plug-in hybrids, a further 44% were for petrol and diesel cars.\n\nFor now, the reliance on the petrol and diesel car remains strong in Ireland. And while it does, so too will we be reliant on factors outside of our control.","summary":"Despite relative oil market calm amid Middle East unrest, Irish fuel prices remain high — with tax, volatility, and policy all contributing to pump pain","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41659238.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9362/4681061_13_seoimage1x1_2.15873929.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-28 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Sean Murray","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Sean Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":336004422,"title":"After Years of Violence, DRC and Rwanda Sign Peace Accord","text":"After more than a decade of Rwandan support for armed conflict in DRC, the governments of the two countries signed a peace deal in Washington, D.C. on Friday aimed at ending ongoing brutality in one of the most violent corners of the world.\n\nAccording to a preview of the language jointly released on June 18 by the United States State Department, DRC and Rwanda, terms of the deal include respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities, disengagement and disarmament, and the conditional integration of non-state armed groups. The terms also include the facilitation of the return of refugees and internally displaced people. Those terms, previously initialed by teams from the African nations ahead of Friday’s ceremonial signing, built on a Declaration of Principles agreed to on April 25. \n\nA statement posted Friday on DRC’s government website said the deal “does indeed provide for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops” – pointing to the use of the word “disengagement” as a more comprehensive term that includes “cessation of fighting.” \n\nThe Mobilization for the Safeguarding of Congolese Sovereignty and Autonomy, a coalition of 80 Congolese organizations, published an appeal concerning the peace agreement’s terms and what it considers a lack of transparency.\n\nThe appeal states the following: “This secret agreement, which has not been shared with the Congolese people, will end up diminishing the sovereignty of the DRC over its own lands, resources, governance, economy and military.” The appeal also states that the framework might “normalize the current illicit resource and power grabs underway by Rwanda … and their other allies, including Western powers that covet the DRC’s minerals and support Rwanda with financial aid.”\n\nAt Friday’s signing, Massad Boulos, the senior advisor for Africa for US President Donald Trump’s administration, added that Qatar’s government, which helped broker the deal, was “driving towards a parallel agreement” between DRC’s government and the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group, which has brutalized eastern DRC for more than a decade.\n\nM23 first emerged in 2012 and has fomented violence in waves. Since late 2021, it has terrorized people in a huge swath of eastern DRC, displacing an estimated 1.2 million people as of late March, and killing several thousand this year alone in an effort to secure the region for Rwanda’s interests. That brutality has included the summary execution of children, widespread sexual violence and massacres across the region. The region is among the world’s most violent; approximately 6 million people have died due to multiple conflicts since 1996.\n\nAlongside an estimated 6,000 M23 fighters, roughly 4,000 Rwandan troops are present in DRC. After seizing two provincial capitals, Goma and Bukavu, early this year, M23 renewed its call for regime change in Kinshasa, vowing to “overthrow” the Congolese government.\n\nGlobal Press Journal has extensively covered the conflict in eastern DRC for over a decade.

And critically, NATO survived — indeed, with Trump declaring himself a changed man where the alliance is concerned.\n\nAnd his night in the palace?

They also noted that roughly 70,000 Alaska residents rely on food stamps in order to afford groceries and buy other \"subsistence gear\" that many Alaskans count on for \"essential hunting and fishing.\"\n\n\"In order to make up for this cost-shifting legislation, Alaska would need to find in its already stressed budget hundreds of millions of dollars for Medicaid and tens of millions for SNAP,\" Edgmon and Giessel wrote. \"Such cuts could not come at a worse time. We’re already struggling to stabilize our budget amid sharply lower oil revenue and a decade of out-migration. If this bill passes, it will mean less money for road maintenance and snow clearing, larger K-12 class sizes, school closings and the defunding of state public safety agencies.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'It's a mistake': GOP pollster reveals how Trump's use of 'one word' blew up in his face\n\nThe legislative leaders went on argue that the new work requirements for Medicaid recipients that Congressional Republicans inserted into the bill would prove \"untenable for rural Alaska\" given the lack of job opportunities and internet access across much of the state. They lamented that many residents will likely avoid seeking medical care unless it's an emergency, meaning that emergency rooms could be overwhelmed with uninsured patients, resulting in higher insurance premiums for everyone else.\n\n\"The reality is that most Alaskans on Medicaid are already working, and these provisions just create more barriers and bureaucracy,\" they wrote in the op-ed. \"... We fear that if this bill passes, a village in rural Alaska might lose its one and only grocery store because of a drastic decline in SNAP dollars. It might also lose its sole health care clinic or hospital because it cannot sustain its services with decreased Medicaid reimbursements. The reconciliation bill does not take into account the uniqueness of Alaskan lifestyles and geographic remoteness.\"\n\n\"What is the end game here? How does it help anyone to terminate health care coverage for our most vulnerable through red tape or take away food for families who have limited to no options for gainful employment?\" They added. \"As long-serving members of the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska State Senate, we’ve faced many daunting economic and fiscal challenges, but we’ve never seen federal policy whose impacts are so far-reaching and damaging as what is before us now.

Tim Kaine of Virginia, aimed to affirm that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran. Asked Friday if he would bomb Iranian nuclear sites again if he deemed necessary, Trump said, “Sure, without question.”\n\nThe measure was defeated in a 53-47 vote in the Republican-held Senate. One Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joined Republicans in opposition, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor.\n\nMost Republicans have said Iran posed an imminent threat that required decisive action from Trump, and they backed his decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites last weekend without seeking congressional approval.\n\n“Of course, we can debate the scope and strategy of our military engagements,” said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. “But we must not shackle our president in the middle of a crisis when lives are on the line.”\n\nDemocrats cast doubt on that justification, arguing the president should have come to Congress first. They also said the president did not update them adequately, with Congress’ first briefings taking place Thursday.\n\n“The idea is this: We shouldn’t send our sons and daughters into war unless there’s a political consensus that this is a good idea, this is a national interest,” Kaine said in a Thursday interview with The Associated Press. The resolution, Kaine said, wasn’t aimed at restricting the president’s ability to defend against a threat, but that “if it’s offense, let’s really make sure we’re making the right decision.”\n\nIn a statement following Friday’s vote, Kaine said he was “disappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress” should be a part of a decision to go to war.\n\nDemocrats’ argument for backing the resolution centered on the War Powers Resolution, passed in the early 1970s, which requires the president “in every possible instance” to “consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces.”\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor ahead of Friday’s vote, Paul said he would back the resolution, saying that “despite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure.”\n\n“It is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran’s nuclear aspirations,” said Paul.\n\nTrump is just the latest in a line of presidents to test the limits of the resolution — though he’s done so at a time when he’s often bristling at the nation’s checks and balances.\n\nTrump on Monday sent a letter to Congress — as required by the War Powers Resolution — that said strikes on Iran over the weekend were “limited in scope and purpose” and “designed to minimize casualties, deter future attacks and limit the risk of escalation.”\n\nBut following classified briefings with top White House officials this week, some lawmakers remain skeptical about how imminent the threat truly was.\n\n“There was no imminent threat to the United States,” said Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, after Friday’s classified briefings.\n\n“There’s always an Iranian threat to the world. But, I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago,” Himes said.\n\nDespite Democratic skepticism, nearly all Republicans applauded Trump’s decision to strike Iran. And for GOP senators, supporting the resolution would have meant rebuking the president at the same time they’re working to pass his major legislative package.","summary":"The resolution, authored by Sen.
