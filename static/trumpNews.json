They now share a common adversary, the messaging goes, as Trump has shown little inclination to respect Europe’s security architecture or put his tariff cudgel back into his diplomatic toolbox.\nSefcovic’s goal will be to see how serious Beijing is about repairing its relations to Europe, and he is willing to play hardball to find out.\n\nIn a painstakingly orchestrated agenda, the Slovakian official will meet with Chinese Minister for Customs Sun Meijun on Thursday followed by dinner with Vice-Premier He Lifeng. On Friday, he will meet Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, his direct counterpart.\nIn each meeting, he will lay out precise demands that would help mend the fraying bilateral ties, if China is willing to make concessions, according to people familiar with the plan.\n“He will address the EU’s systemic concerns over the negative impact of China’s non-market policies and practices, and raise market access barrier issues affecting EU exports and investment in China,” read a statement from the European Commission\n“In particular, one of the aims of the trip will be exploring ways to align Chinese investments in the EU with EU priorities and policy objectives.”\nEU sources say two of those demands are “low-hanging fruit” related to market access issues for European firms in China, which Beijing should be able to grant while Sefcovic is still in China.\nOthers – such as further market access issues and uneven treatment for EU firms in China – have longer timelines, but are seen as easily deliverable if Chinese ministers are committed to patching up the relationship.\nSefcovic, who has rarely dealt with China in a long career in the European Commission and as a Slovak diplomat, was said to be optimistic about his trip, even if more seasoned officials on the China beat were gloomier.\n\n“We’ve always been very specific with what we want and had lists that they have simply never responded to,” said one senior EU official, who described his Chinese counterparts as “increasingly intransigent”.\nIn planning meetings, the trade chief has wondered whether, with such a long list of demands, Brussels needs to offer Beijing anything in return. Officials experienced on China have insisted that no such concessions should be made.\nFor years, officials in Brussels have felt their concerns about China’s economic policies have been ignored by Beijing, and are in no mood to compromise.\nChina, meanwhile, has asked to resolve a dispute with the EU over electric vehicles that saw import tariffs slapped on Chinese-made models last year, threatening a broader trade war.\nOfficials in Beijing have also requested that Brussels notify them in advance when it plans to use foreign subsidies regulation (FSR) against Chinese firms. FSR, a far-reaching competition tool, allows European investigators to raid premises of foreign firms suspected to have received market-distorting state subsidies. It has been used mostly against Chinese companies.\n“I am neither optimistic, nor pessimistic … I am determined,” said a second senior official, summing up the prevailing stance towards China in the upper ranks of the commission.\nThis resolve was on display last week when the commission requested a diplomatic démarche with Chinese ministries over tariffs slapped on French brandy, widely seen as retaliation for the EV duties.\nThe EU wanted to complain that the duties were “illegal” and to question why affected spirits have also been removed from duty-free shops at Chinese airports. Beijing refused the request but relented after being told that Sefcovic’s trip would be in doubt otherwise.\nThe brandy issue will be raised in the meeting with customs chief Sun, although at last week’s démarche Beijing was “really completely uncompromising,” according to a source briefed on the talks.\nWith US tariffs raising the stakes in Sefcovic’s shuttle diplomacy, the commissioner has been in message control mode, at the behest of his president Ursula von der Leyen. A press conference planned for Saturday morning in Beijing has been cancelled, while there was no customary briefing for journalists before he left.\nIn tandem with Sefcovic’s visit, several EU member states have dispatched ministers to Beijing, with some in Brussels fearing that his tough message could be undermined by capitals looking to cash in on ties with China.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is travelling in early April, is seen in the commission to be the “weak link”, given his well-established views that the EU and China should rebuild their ties due to Trump.\n“Sanchez sees Spain as a country that can bridge the gap with China,” said Miguel Otero, an analyst of EU-China relations at the Royal Elcano Institute in Madrid.\n“He has been saying: let’s do de-risking, but let’s not overdo it. Let’s be pragmatic, not ideological.”","summary":"EU officials experienced on China have insisted in planning meetings that no concessions should be made to Beijing.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3304035/china-eu-trade-chief-play-hardball-after-trump-tariff-rebuff","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/27/260e63fb-9e8b-4053-851b-e43511840512_1f921cb8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 01:00:17","author":"Finbarr Bermingham","authors":["Finbarr Bermingham"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.066},{"id":304552588,"title":"Inside Maya Jama's new romance with Portuguese footballer Ruben Dias - after Gary Lineker 'confirmed' relationship","text":"Black Friday\n\nPremier League\n\nTransfer News\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Mar 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom a Birmingham cult hero who started it all to an infamous Arsenal failure: Mail Sport goes inside the boom or bust world of loan deals as Aston Villa duo make big impact\n\nBayer Leverkusen's flying Dutchman, a Moroccan speedster and two Spurs stars: EIGHT Liverpool options to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold as he nears Real Madrid move\n\nHow odious Christian Horner used wife Geri Halliwell to whitewash his sexting scandal - and a deeply damning portrait that reveals what EVERYONE'S forgotten, writes IAN HERBERT\n\nHow the mighty Brazil became a laughing stock: Vinicius Jr has not delivered and there's a reason they want Carlo Ancelotti, writes TOM COLLOMOSSE\n\nLewis Hamilton's 'romance with Sofia Vergara is OVER' - with the Modern Family star, 52, feeling 'abandoned' after being given the cold shoulder by the F1 legend\n\nChelsea civil war: Fans urge the Premier League to investigate owner Todd Boehly's links to ticket touting website\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold set to join Steve McManaman and Michael Owen in swapping Anfield for Real Madrid...SEVEN Liverpool heroes who left the club - and one that stayed!\n\nOur children are in need of positive influences - that starts at home and shouldn't fall on the shoulders of young unprepared footballers: SIMON JORDAN\n\nWhy world's best talents are flocking to Chelsea's academy despite mass competition - wonderkids, parents and agents hail Cobham's unstoppable production line and the future Ballon d'Or winners set to shine: CHELSEA CONFIDENTIAL\n\nAlessia Russo inspires heroic Arsenal comeback against Real Madrid in Women's Champions League quarter-finals - with Mikel Arteta's side looking to repeat the trick next month\n\nPLAY TEAMSHEET: Can YOU name the Newcastle side that drew with Leicester to secure Champions League football in 2023?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:00:58 GMT, 27 March 2025 |Updated:00:58 GMT, 27 March 2025 \n\nMaya Jama made headlines last summer when she and Stormzy announced they were splitting for good, after rekindling their romance the year before. \nAnd in the months since, the Love Island host has been linked Portuguese footballer Ruben Dias, 27. \nThe brunette beauty has reportedly been secretly dating the Manchester City player since the pair met at the European Music Awards in November. \nRumours surrounding the pair's romance later intensified after Ruben shared a photo from his New Year celebrations in Ibiza.\nThe snap was of two people gazing at a sunset with their faces obscured, and fans became convinced it was Maya. \nThe pair have kept their romance relatively under wraps - but earlier this month Gary Lineker seemingly confirmed their relationship by referencing her 'boyfriend'.\n\nMaya Jama made headlines last summer when she and Stormzy announced they were splitting for good, after rekindling their romance the year before (Maya seen earlier this month)\n\nAnd in the months since, the Love Island host has been linked Portugese footballer Ruben Dias, 27 (Ruben seen in December)\nOn Sunday, Maya was in the stands at José Alvalade Stadium to see her footballer beau win 5-2 for Portugal in their clash against Denmark for the Nations League quarter-final second leg.\nAnd after the win, Maya celebrated with Manchester City centreback Ruben, posting a social media snap of their romantic fireside retreat at 3:30am.\nThe snap is believed to have been taken at the footballer's Cascais region home, with a vast swimming pool and fire pit glimpsed in the picture. \nThe presenter made merry with a friend and glasses of wine in a VIP hospitality box - usually reserved for friends and family of players. \nAnd just last week, Maya added fuel to speculation as she hinted she is taking Portuguese lessons. \nIn a video on Instagram after the BRIT Awards, a voice reported by Game Set & Match to be that of Ruben can be heard in conversation with Maya, who is speaking back to the defender in Portuguese.\nAnd pouring fuel on the fire, Maya captioned the post: 'Lessons have started'.\nBreaking her silence on the romance in January, Maya replied to an online troll. \n\nRumours surrounding the pair's romance later intensified after Ruben shared a photo from his New Year celebrations in Ibiza\n\nThe presenter made merry with a friend and glasses of wine in a VIP hospitality box - usually reserved for friends and family of players\n\nAfter the win, Maya celebrated with Ruben, sharing a social media snap of their fireside retreat in Lisbon at 3:30am. The snap is believed to have been taken at the footballer's home\nOne user had penned a tweet about people who 'sit on the net all day and obsess about people they don't know and their relationships'.\nMaya quoted their tweet with screenshots of earlier posts from the same user, where they reacted to news of her romance with Ruben by writing: 'She don't rest' and that 'women who jump from relationship to relationship are scary'.\nHitting back, the presenter simply wrote: 'Oh.. but ..' alongside two laughing emojis. \nThen in February, Maya and Ruben were spotted wearing matching £5,050 'LOVE Bracelets' by Cartier in a further hint at their romance. \nThough the pair have kept tight-lipped on the dating rumours, earlier this month Gary took matters into his own hands as he appeared to publicly confirm Maya and Ruben's new relationship.\nFollowing the announcement that Maya would serve as a manager in the Baller League alongside Juventus forward Alisha Lehmann, she appeared on their social media to react to the news.\nShe jokingly called Micah Richards her 'nemesis' and made fun of his age as they played up their rivalry.\nMicah told her: 'You disrespected me, didn't you? You said I look 40 years old, I'm only 36! You do me wrong man. How old are you?'\nMaya laughed as she replied: 'I'm 30 actually, on the dot. Just 3, 0, new, fresh 30. I just got there.'\n\nMaya was joined by three of her friends in the private box earlier, which are usually designated to VIPs and the family and friends of a player or coach\n\nThough the pair have kept tight-lipped on the dating rumours, earlier this month Gary took matters into his own hands as he appeared to publicly confirm Maya and Ruben's relationship\nHowever, Gary suddenly appeared in the frame to interrupt the pair's playful banter and seemingly let slip confirmation of Maya's romance with Ruben.\nHe said: 'Micah, stop flirting and get her boyfriend to play for us!' sparking a burst of laughter.\nWhile Maya seemed to be taken aback by the public reference to her relationship, as she shouted: 'Get out! This is why I don't talk to old people. They're so weird'.\nA source previously told The Sun: 'Maya and Ruben swapped details at the EMAs and have chatted since, but things went up a gear in early December.\n'When Ruben got injured and had to miss the congested new year fixtures, he jumped at the chance to see in 2025 with Maya in Spain. Spending New Year's Eve together was a real step forward in their relationship.\n'They get on really well and obviously make a gorgeous couple, but it's early days.'\nMaya JamaGary LinekerStormzyRuben Dias\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside Maya Jama's new romance with Portuguese footballer Ruben Dias - after Gary Lineker 'confirmed' relationship\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law. Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached. With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done, Trump told reporters on Wednesday. TikTok did not immediately comment. Getting China to agree to any deal to give up control of the TikTok unit worth tens of billions of dollars has always been the biggest sticking point to getting any agreement finalized. Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past. On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a U.S. deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20% up from 10% issued in February. Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5. The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19. The app briefly went dark in January after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal. The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank.","summary":"US President Trump has indicated willingness to reduce tariffs in order to facilitate a deal for TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the app. ByteDance faces an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a US ban on national security grounds.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/donald-trump-says-he-may-give-china-reduction-in-tariffs-to-get-tiktok-deal-done/articleshow/119566012.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119566037,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-75302,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:57:58","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.552},{"id":304552156,"title":"Rachel Reeves branded delusional for claiming to be restoring economic stability - despite growth forecast slashed in half and MORE tax rises likely to come","text":"Rachel Reeves branded delusional for claiming to be restoring economic stability - despite growth forecast slashed in half and MORE tax rises likely to come\n\nPODCAST: A deep dive into the war plans group chat scandal, plus Trump hates his new portrait – on Welcome to MAGAland.

Instead, she cut £3.4 billion from welfare, trimmed public spending and ordered a government efficiency drive in a bid to make up the £14 billion deficit.\n\nThe OBR upgraded its growth forecasts for later years, partly on the basis that government planning reforms succeed in delivering a major increase in housebuilding.\n\nBut overall GDP growth is still set to be lower than it was at the time of the Chancellor's Budget in October.\n\nShadow Chancellor Mel Stride said the decline in the public finances under Labour was 'jaw-dropping' – and accused Ms Reeves of trying to shift the blame to 'anyone but her'.\n\nHe told MPs that she was 'the architect of her own misfortune', adding: 'She borrowed and spent and taxed as if it were the 1970s. Little wonder that the Chancellor has tanked the economy, little wonder that we have an emergency Budget, all because of her choices.'\n\nEconomists warned that by leaving just £9.9 billion of 'headroom' against her fiscal rules, Ms Reeves was likely to have to return with more tax rises in the autumn.\n\nThe OBR said there was a 50:50 chance that the Chancellor would have to come back for more.\n\nPaul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: 'We might be in for another blockbuster autumn Budget. What the Chancellor has all but guaranteed is another six months of damaging speculation and uncertainty over tax policy.'\n\nRob Wood, UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the 'perilous' outlook meant 'further tax hikes and borrowing are coming'.\n\nTom Clougherty, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the Chancellor's measures amounted to little more than 'rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic'.\n\nRachel ReevesKemi BadenochDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRachel Reeves branded delusional for claiming to be restoring economic stability - despite growth forecast slashed in half and MORE tax rises likely to come\n\nAdd comment","summary":"On a humiliating day for the Chancellor, she was forced to deliver a £14 billion package of emergency spending cuts to avoid breaking fiscal rules she wrote herself only five months ago.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14541129/Rachel-Reeves-delusional-economic-stability-tax-rises.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/26/23/96612579-0-image-m-68_1743031693135.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/26/6971767101080027406/1024x576_MP4_6971767101080027406.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:57:28","author":"Editor,Jason Groves","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":304553298,"title":"Fani Willis Granted Extended Deadline in Subpoena Dispute","text":"The terms “subpoena enforcement” and “compliance” are currently at the forefront for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. She faces demands to submit documents and testify under oath regarding her prosecution of former President Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Bill Cowsert, a Republican from Athens, Georgia, leads the Senate Special Committee on Investigations. This committee has scrutinized Willis’ actions for several years. Since the summer of 2024, Cowsert has been persistent in seeking Willis’ sworn testimony about her ongoing legal pursuit against Trump.\n\nThough Willis has resisted those efforts at every turn, earlier this month she told Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura L. Ingram her stonewalling had come to an end — by and large at least.\n\nDuring a Thursday meeting, Georgia state senators discussed the lay of the legal landscape with outside counsel Josh Belinfante.\n\nThe prospect of waxing defiance took center stage even as Willis’ court-filed positions suggest such obfuscation is on the wane.\n\n“She is objecting in our subpoena to documents that she has already produced in other litigation that went to the court of Appeals?” Cowsert asked at one point during the meeting with counsel.\n\n“Presumably,” the committee’s lawyer said. “I can’t say for certain what documents that are being objected to because we’ve never received an itemized list of, you know, as you normally would.”\n\nThe lawyer went on to say that efforts were being made to have Willis turn over a tranche of documents that had already been provided to opposing counsel in the underlying litigation as well as documents previously turned over to the U.S. House of Representatives after congressional investigators issued their own subpoenas.\n\n“We candidly don’t know what documents they are objecting to and what documents are there,” Belinfante explained.\n\nThe underlying litigation referenced during the meeting is what sounded the death knell for the district attorney’s inquiry into Trump and most of his co-defendants: the successful effort to have Willis disqualified over allegations that her romantic relationship with now-former special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.\n\nStill, the lawyer told the committee, a certain number of those documents were being voluntarily produced despite an initial number of attorney-client, work-product, and law enforcement privilege claims offered by Willis and her office in an earlier court filing.\n\n“There’s documents that were relevant in that action to disqualify her from further prosecution of the 16 or 18 defendants that we know exist and have been produced to somebody before and you have an agreement with opposing counsel that we will at least receive those documents with no objection?” Cowsert asked.\n\nBelinfante answered in the affirmative. That accord, the attorney said, was reached on March 10 — with the right to issue additional subpoenas should the committee find the district attorney’s responses lacking. The court overseeing the matter was apprised of the agreement over the limited production promised. Exactly when those documents would be received, however, is unclear.\n\n“So, as of today I do not have the documents,” Belinfante said.\n\nAt the same time, the committee’s lawyer said he was working toward an agreed upon time for Willis to testify under oath and fulfill her obligations under the witness subpoena. After some back and forth, Willis’ office said her travel and trial schedule precluded an in-person appearance before “late April or early May,” according to Belinfante.\n\nThe committee’s attorney went on to reference a separate-but-related case in which Willis violated state open records laws. In that case, intentional failure to comply with the law resulted in substantial attorneys fees being awarded to the plaintiffs.\n\n“This is the first time since Oct. 8 of last year that we don’t have a court order dictating the next step,” Belinfante also said.\n\nThe upshot of the lawyer’s parting points in his presentation were to suggest that the committee might consider asking the court to compel production or make a finding of contempt.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nAt least one member took the lawyer’s final comments to heart.\n\n“This has been going on for a year now,” Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Republican who represents the small town of Cumming, said. “The DA, when we first issued the subpoena, declared in the paper that it was unlawful. When it clearly was lawful. The courts now have agreed with us that it was lawful.”\n\nDolezal referenced “eyewitness reports” that Willis is again traveling with Wade — and asked the attorney for any advice on enforcing compliance in light of such news, specifically inquiring as to whether “personal travel” could be distinguished from work-related travel.\n\nBelinfante more or less repeated his earlier advice that senators could try to enforce the existing witness subpoena by moving to compel Willis, issue a new subpoena, or reach an agreement with her attorney.\n\nDolezal appeared to reject trusting any agreement.\n\n“The DA has thumbed her nose at this committee,” he said. “She has thumbed her nose at Georgia’s open records laws. And I just have limited confidence that she’s acting in good faith. So, I do believe we may be at the point where we need to escalate this to the next step.”\n\nThe state senator went on to say the issue was not with trusting the opposing side’s attorney — former Georgia governor Roy Barnes, a Democrat — but likely with the attorney’s client.\n\nIn the end, the committee voted on a deadline of May 10. By that date, Willis will have to appear in person to testify under oath. If the district attorney continues to stonewall past then, the committee voted on filing another request with the judge to compel her to appear.","summary":"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is seen arriving for a hearing&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/fani-willis-granted-extended-deadline-in-subpoena-dispute/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:55:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.037},{"id":304554018,"title":"World News | Congress MP Manickam Tagore Credits Manmohan Singh as Trump Cites India's Voter Id System in US Election Reform","text":"New Delhi [India], March 27 (ANI): Congress MP Manickam Tagore has credited former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh for the Aadhaar platform after US President Donald Trump referenced India's voter ID system in his executive order reforming the US election process.\n\"We all know that when Aadhaar card was introduced by Dr Manmohan Singh's government, PM Modi criticised the Aadhaar platform. He raised many questions about the platform. In 2013 also, when he was speaking in public meetings, he criticised the Aadhaar - but the Aadhaar was the base for all these things,\" Manickam Tagore said.\nAlso Read | Famous Birthdays on March 27: Mariah Carey, Quentin Tarantino, Imran Tahir and Ram Charan - Know About Celebrities and Influential Figures Born on March 27.\nHe further praised Singh's \"visionary leadership\" and added, \"US President Donald Trump's praise for Aadhaar is the praise for the visionary leadership of Dr Manmohan Singh.\"\nTrump signed the executive order on Tuesday, stating that it would \"enforce basic and necessary election protections\" similar to those adopted by developed and developing nations. The order notes that India and Brazil have integrated voter identification with biometric databases to improve accuracy, while the US primarily relies on self-attestation of citizenship. It also highlights election security measures in Germany and Canada, where paper ballots are counted publicly to minimise disputes, contrasting with the US system, which involves varied voting methods that can create chain-of-custody issues.\nAlso Read | NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte Says '4 American Soldiers Who Went Missing in Lithuania Have Been Killed'.\nFurther comparisons are drawn to Denmark and Sweden, where mail-in voting is restricted to those unable to vote in person, and late-arriving ballots are rejected regardless of postmark. In contrast, many US states allow widespread mail-in voting, some accepting ballots without postmarks or even those arriving well after Election Day. According to the order, this lack of uniformity has raised concerns over election integrity, prompting the new reforms.\nTo implement these changes, the order directs the Election Assistance Commission to update the national mail voter registration form within 30 days, requiring documentary proof of citizenship such as a passport, REAL ID-compliant identification, or military ID. Additionally, state and local officials must maintain detailed records of these documents. The Secretary of Homeland Security has been tasked with granting free access to federal citizenship verification databases, while the Secretary of State will share relevant database information to help identify ineligible voters.\nFederal agencies under the National Voter Registration Act will now be required to verify citizenship before distributing voter registration forms to public assistance enrollees. These measures, according to the order, aim to ensure only eligible citizens participate in federal elections while aligning US election security with global standards.

The wide-ranging measure aims to incentivise car manufacturers to establish more production facilities within US borders.\nAlso Read | Famous Birthdays on March 27: Mariah Carey, Quentin Tarantino, Imran Tahir and Ram Charan - Know About Celebrities and Influential Figures Born on March 27.\nIndustry experts warn that the tariffs could have far-reaching consequences.

These nations export substantial numbers of vehicles to the United States and may view the tariffs as a direct challenge to their automotive industries.\nEconomists predict the tariffs could increase vehicle prices by thousands of dollars, adding further strain to consumers already grappling with persistent inflation. The move represents a dramatic intervention in the automotive market, potentially reshaping global car manufacturing strategies.\nPresident Trump remained bullish about the policy, stating, \"Anybody who has plants in the United States, it's going to be good for.\"\nAs the automotive industry and global markets absorb this significant policy change, other manufacturers, including those in India, are bracing for bigger changes. Earlier, US President Donald Trump targeted India's auto import tariffs in a speech to Congress, stating, \"India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%,\" and vowed that a reciprocal tax would take effect on April 2. He said that the US has been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth and vowed not to \"let that happen any longer.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Today, the Social Security Administration changed course on its online-centric service policy, committing to phone service for certain beneficiaries.\n\nCalling the measures \"proactive steps to enhance the security of its services by implementing stronger identity verification procedures,\" the agency announced that beginning April 14, 2025, individuals applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Medicare, or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) who cannot use a personal my Social Security (online) account can complete their claim entirely over the telephone. There is no need to come into an office.\n\n(The agency had previously announced that beginning in April, SSA would allow beneficiaries to start their claim for benefits on the telephone. However, the agency had indicated at the time that the claim could not be completed until the individual's identity was verified in person.)\n\nFollowing the decision, Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner of Social Security, said in a message on the agency's website, \"We have listened to our customers, Congress, advocates, and others, and we are updating our policy to provide better customer service to the country's most vulnerable populations.\"\n\nThe policy is limited to specific recipients. SSDI, sometimes referred to as \"Disability\" provides monthly payments to people who have a disability that stops or limits their ability to work; Medicare is our country's health insurance program for people age 65 or older (you may also qualify if you have permanent kidney failure or receive Disability benefits); and SSI provides monthly payments to people with disabilities and older adults who have little or no income or resources. That's because, Dudek noted, \"multiple opportunities exist during the decision process to verify a person's identity.\"\n\nIndividuals who cannot use their online account to apply for other benefits, including Retirement, Survivors, or Auxiliary (Spouse or Child) benefits, will still need to prove their identity at a Social Security office. According to the agency, SSA will enforce online digital identity proofing or in-person identity proofing for these cases. And there will be exceptions: the agency says it will not enforce these requirements in \"extreme dire-need situations\" like terminal cases or prisoner pre-release scenarios. The agency says it is developing a process that would require documentation and management approval to bypass the policy in such cases.\n\nThe deadline for the changes has also been pushed to April 14 to allow employees extra time for the training they need to help customers.\n\nStill, Social Security beneficiaries won't be able to conduct some business, like changing their bank account information, over the phone. Instead, they're being pushed to do these tasks on the SSA website. That hasn't changed. The agency now says that those who do not or cannot use its online services to change their direct deposit information for any benefit will still need to visit a Social Security office to process the change (you can call 1-800-772-1213 to schedule an in-person appointment).\n\nTo help ease the wait, the agency said it has recently required nearly all agency employees, including frontline employees in all offices throughout the country, to return to the office five days a week. This change is to ensure \"maximum staffing\" to support the stronger in-person identity proofing requirement.\n\nHowever, the number of available employees is still on the decline. Some attrition has already occurred, with staffers taking advantage of DOGE's \"Fork in the Road\" offer to leave their jobs. Some probationary employees have been let go. As a result, staffing at the agency is at a 50-year low despite a heavier workload. And those numbers are about to drop even more: SSA recently set a staffing target of 50,000, down from approximately 57,000 employees before the start of the current Trump Administration.\n\nToday, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that the agency also plans to close as many as 60% of its field locations, asking in a press conference, \"What is the intent? Kill Social Security by strangling it, by not letting it work, by making it so that it's impossible for people to get their help and their benefits.\"\n\nSchumer also spoke about Bisignano's nomination, saying, \"To confirm Mr. Bisignano as head of Social Security is hiring an arsonist to run the fire station. I've known this guy for 20 years. He's a cutter. Companies bring him in to slash workers. And his claim to fame is cutting and shrinking. He's the last person we need to run the Social Security office.\" Schumer added that if President Trump \"cared at all about Social Security,\" he would withdraw Bisignano's nomination.\n\nA vote on Bisignano's nomination has not yet been scheduled.\n\nBisignano currently serves as the president and chief executive officer of Fiserv Corporation, a fintech payment company, a position he has held since 2020. He previously served as JP Morgan Chase & Co.'s co-chief operating officer and CEO of mortgage banking and held multiple leadership roles at Citigroup.\nForbesWho Is Frank Bisignano?

This will continue to spur growth. We'll effectively be charging a 25 per cent tariff, Trump told reporters. The tariffs, which the White House expects to raise USD 100 billion in revenue annually, could be complicated as even US automakers source their components from around the world. The tax hike starting April means automakers could face higher costs and lower sales, though Trump argues that the tariffs will lead to more factories opening in the United States and the end of what he judges to be a ridiculous supply chain in which auto parts and finished vehicles are manufactured across the United States, Canada and Mexico. To underscore his seriousness about the tariffs directive he signed, Trump said, This is permanent. Shares in General Motors fell roughly 3 per cent in Wednesday trading. Ford's stock was up slightly. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, dropped nearly 3.6 per cent. Trump has long said that tariffs against auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the United States while helping narrow the budget deficit. But US and foreign automakers have plants around the world to accommodate global sales while maintaining competitive prices -- and it could take years for companies to design, build and open the new factories that Trump is promising. We're looking at much higher vehicle prices, said economist Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. We're going to see reduced choice. These kinds of taxes fall more heavily on the middle and working class. She said more households will be priced out of the new car market -- where prices already average about USD 49,000 -- and will have to hang on to aging vehicles. The tariffs on autos would start being collected on April 3, Trump said. If the taxes are fully passed onto consumers, the average auto price on an imported vehicle could jump by USD 12,500, a sum that could feed into overall inflation. Trump was voted back into the White House last year because voters believed he could bring down prices. Foreign leaders were quick to criticise the tariffs, a sign that Trump could be intensifying a broader trade war that could damage growth worldwide. This is a very direct attack. We will defend our workers. We will defend our companies. We will defend our country, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said. In Brussels, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed regret at the US decision to target auto exports from Europe and vowed that the bloc would protect consumers and businesses. Tariffs are taxes - bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the U.S. and the European Union, she said in a statement, adding that the EU's executive branch would assess the impact of the move, as well as other US tariffs planned for coming days. As Trump announced the new tariffs, he indicated that he would like to provide a new incentive to help car buyers by allowing them to deduct from their federal income taxes the interest paid on auto loans, so long as their vehicles were made in America. That deduction would eat into some of the revenues that could be generated by the tariffs. The new tariffs would apply to both finished autos and parts used in the vehicles, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the taxes on a call with reporters. The tariffs would be on top of any existing taxes and were legally based on a 2019 Commerce Department investigation that occurred during Trump's first term on national security grounds. For autos and parts under the USMCA trade pact applying to the United States, Mexico and Canada, the 25 per cent tariffs would only apply to non-US content. The administration is reasoning that there is excess capacity at US automakers that will enable them to ramp up production to avoid the tariffs by manufacturing more domestically, with the official noting that automakers have known since the Trump campaign that tariffs were coming. The auto tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Trump, who plans to impose what he calls reciprocal taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs, sales taxes charged by other nations. Trump has already placed a 20 per cent import tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25 per cent tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10 per cent tax on Canadian energy products. Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including the taxes on autos, after automakers objected and Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve that is set to expire in April. The president has also imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals. He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper.","summary":"President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports to boost domestic manufacturing, projecting $100 billion revenue annually.

While Musk remains at the helm of his companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, he is also leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is an effort to slash federal government spending, personnel and consolidate or eliminate various federal agencies and services.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom. The company delivered five of its electric vehicles there for the president to inspect after he had declared, in a post on Truth Social, that he would buy a Tesla to show support for Musk and the business. Musk stood by his side while Trump called the vehicles \"beautiful\" and praised the unorthodox design of the angular, steel Tesla Cybertruck. \n\nWhen asked by reporters whether the new tariffs would be good for Musk's autos business, Tesla, Trump said they may be \"net neutral or they may be good.\" He pointed to Tesla's vehicle assembly plants in Austin, Texas and Fremont, California and opined that, \"anybody that has plants in the United States — it's going to be good for them.\"\n\nTesla recently wrote, in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, that \"even with aggressive localization\" of its supply chain domestically, \"certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States.\" The company urged the USTR to \"consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices.\"\n\nTesla and other automakers commonly buy headlamps, automotive glass, brakes, body panels, suspension parts, and printed circuit boards for various electrical systems in their vehicles from foreign suppliers in Mexico, Canada and China, especially.\n\nMusk and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how the new 25% tariffs may impact their business.\n\nTesla faces an onslaught of competition with more automakers selling fully electric models than ever before.

The White House, which has made immigration enforcement a top policy priority, has already overseen the detention and deportation of several high-profile foreign nationals allegedly sympathetic to Hamas, a terrorist-designated organization. (RELATED: ICE Rolls Up Hundreds Of Criminal Illegal Migrants In Sprawling Six-Day Massachusetts Raid)\n\nTwo foreign students — Yunseo Chung of Columbia University and Momodou Taal of Cornell University — are both wanted by federal immigration authorities. While neither have surrendered or been caught by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, both individuals have sued the Trump administration to put a halt to enforcement actions against them. In Chung’s case, she successfully requested a court to block her arrest — at least temporarily.\n\n“This action challenges the government’s shocking overreach in seeking to deport a college student, Plaintiff-Petitioner Yunseo Chung, who is a lawful permanent resident of this country, because of her protected speech,” Chung’s lawyers stated in a lawsuit filed Monday against the Trump administration. “The government’s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny.”\n\nVirtually every foreign student targeted by the Trump administration so far has claimed the actions violate their freedom of speech, but immigration experts that previously spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation pointed out that the issue has nothing to do with the First Amendment. The State Department has the authority to remove any non-citizen deemed a potential threat to U.S. foreign policy, which would include individuals appearing sympathetic to a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.\n\n“This is definitely not a free speech issue,” Matt O’Brien, investigations director for the Immigration Reform Law Institute. O’Brien, who previously served as an immigration judge, pointed to a section in U.S. code that states, “An alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.”\n\n“Temporary visa holders can have their visa revoked if they are found inadmissible and permanent visa holders (green cards) can lose their green cards and be removed if they violate a ground of removability,” said Lora Ries, the border security and immigration director at the Heritage Foundation. “The U.S. Government hasn’t charged terrorism-related grounds of deportability or sought to have a green card revoked for too long. And it shows.”\n\nChung, a 21-year-old permanent resident of the U.S. and native of South Korea, has been involved in the anti-Israel protests that have swept college campuses, her lawyers acknowledged in court documents. She was among the individuals arrested on March 5 amid a sit-in at Barnard College’s main library — a protest that turned violent.\n\nAs has become typical with pro-Palestine student activism, the protest at Barnard’s library disrupted classes and led to law enforcement arriving on scene. A bomb threat was called in, prompting police to evacuate the building, but some protesters allegedly chose to resist, leading to some being arrested. Following her arrest by the New York Police Department, Chung was given a desk appearance ticket for “obstruction of governmental administration,” which her lawyers framed as a “a common citation issued by the police at protests” in their court filing.\n\nHowever, it didn’t take long for more serious consequences to materialize for Chung. Her lawyers accuse ICE officials of signing an administrative warrant for her arrest on March 8 and allege that ICE agents visited her residence looking for her on March 9. The following day, a federal law enforcement official informed her counsel that her lawful permanent status was revoked.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed that Chung is wanted by immigration authorities, and accused her of participating in pro-Hamas activities.\n\n“Yunseo Chung has engaged in concerning conduct, including when she was arrested by NYPD during a pro-Hamas protest at Barnard College,” a DHS spokesperson said to the DCNF. “She is being sought for removal proceedings under the immigration laws. Chung will have an opportunity to present her case before an immigration judge.”\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, her lawyers would not comment on her whereabouts, but she likely is in no need to hide out for the time being. On Tuesday, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the Southern District of New York temporarily blocked the Trump administration from arresting her.\n\n“Defendants-Respondents are enjoined from detaining the Plaintiff-Petitioner pending further order of this Court,” Reice, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, wrote in her order. The judge also instructed the Trump administration to give advance notice to the court if it wishes to detain Chung for reasons beyond her removal from the country.\n\nTaal, a 31-year-old Ph.D. student in Africana Studies at Cornell University, sued the Trump administration shortly before the State Department decided to pull his student visa. In his lawsuit, Taal challenges two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump — Executive Order 14161 and Executive Order 14188 — that aim to clamp down on anti-Semitism and pro-Hamas activity by foreign student protesters.\n\nThe Gambian national claims the orders have forced him to withdraw from public engagement, depriving others of their “rights to listen” to his rhetoric sympathizing with Hamas and espousing anti-Israel sentiment, according to his lawsuit.\n\n“As a result of the executive orders, Mr. Taal has been forced to profoundly alter his prior speech and association patterns,” his attorneys stated. “He has refrained from attending protests and public political meetings, has substantially reduced his activity on social media, and no longer discusses politics with associates from Cornell, fearing his words will be misinterpreted or reported to government authorities.” (RELATED: Feds Say Columbia Student Covered Up Past Employment At UN Agency Embedded With Alleged Hamas Operatives)\n\n“He lives in constant fear that he may be arrested by immigration officials or police as a result of his speech,” the lawsuit continues.\n\nTaal has repeatedly declared his hatred for America over the years on social media and he celebrated the massacre of Israeli civilians by Hamas terrorists.\n\n“The end of the US empire in our lifetime in sha Allah,” Taal posted online in February 2022. Just several months later, he — seemingly contradictorily — celebrated his acceptance into a U.S. university, writing “Student Visa issued. We going to America baby! Alhamdulillah! Let’s get this PhD.” He later reiterated his contempt for America, posting “My hatred of the US empire knows no bound. Wallahi,” in November 2022.\n\nTaal rejoiced online the day Hamas militants stormed into Israeli territory and killed roughly 1,200 people. “The dialect demands: That wherever you have oppression, you will find those who fighting against it. Glory to the resistance!” he posted in the early morning hours of Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nTaal was facing consequences for his campus actions before Trump returned to office and signed any executive orders targeting pro-Hamas protesters, according to Inside Higher Ed. Cornell University officials suspended him for a second time by October 2024, with a university email telling him he “demonstrated a pattern of escalating, egregious behavior and a disregard for the university policies.”\n\nEarlier in March, DHS asked Taal to surrender to immigration authorities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed that his student visa was pulled, arguing that the move is in line with Trump’s directives.\n\n“This Department has already been fighting in court to vigorously defend President Trump’s agenda and will continue to do so, especially when it comes to protecting Jewish Americans,” a DOJ spokesperson stated.\n\nTrump has taken unprecedented steps in attempting to remove allegedly pro-Hamas students from U.S. soil.\n\nIn the most high-profile case to date, immigration authorities arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, earlier in March and have kept him detained at a facility in Louisiana while his deportation challenge plays out in court. ICE agents have also detained Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national and researcher at Georgetown University, and arrested Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, after her student visa expired and was previously arrested for her alleged participation in pro-Hamas activity at Columbia University.\n\nThe White House successfully deported Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese national working as an assistant professor at Brown University, after immigration officials allegedly discovered adoring pictures of deceased Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah and other pro-terrorist images. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian national who allegedly participated in anti-Israel protests, self-deported to Canada after her visa was revoked.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to have only just begun cracking down on anti-American foreign students. DHS says it will continue to investigate students allegedly engaged in pro-Hamas activity.\n\n“ICE [Homeland Security Investigations] will investigate individuals engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization,” a DHS spokesperson said to the DCNF. “Based on investigative findings, the Department of State may make a determination which may result in visa revocation or other action impacting the immigration status of an alien in the U.S.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Roger Wicker wants watchdog investigation into Signal chat leak","text":"March 26 (UPI) -- Republican Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday his panel is seeking an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about airstrikes in Yemen.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in the chat during the hearing before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse that originally focused on the global security threats.\n\nThe hearing began shortly after The Atlantic released the entire text conversation that it first reported Monday. Excerpts were posted behind the committee members.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump told reporters his national security adviser Mike Waltz had taken responsibility for creating a Signal group that inadvertently included a journalist and denied any blame on the part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, though he texted a timeline of the planned attack before it was underway.\n\nOn Tuesday, the spy chiefs testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where some members urged Hegseth to resign or be fired.\n\nWicker, of Mississippi, is not on that committee but heads another agency with oversight of the Pentagon.\n\nWicker, speaking to reporters at the Capitol, said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General.\n\n\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.\n\nThe findings would be sent to his committee.\n\nWicker said that he and Reed want a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.\n\nThe chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth.\" They want to learn whether the published transcript is accurate.\n\nWicker said it \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\"\n\nThose on the text exchange said it wasn't classified and most Republicans in Congress agree.\n\nWicker declined to say whether there would be a full investigation of the use of Signal.\n\nThe Pentagon's IG office is being overseen on an acting basis by Steven Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general.\n\nSoon after Trump became president, Trump fired the inspector general at the Defense Department, Robert Storch, in a purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. They act independently.\n\nNational Security Council, White House counsel's office and Elon Musk will lead the investigation into the leak, press secretary Karonline Leavitt said Wednesday during a briefing. Elon Musk, who runs Tesla, SpaceX, X and heads the Department of Government Efficiency, \"has offered to put his technical experts on this, to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat - again, to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,\" Laeavitt said.\n\nWicker said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from - and all of us from - a big success internationally\" though \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\"\n\nWhicker said he didn't think Hegseth should resign or be fired.\n\n\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"\n\nTrump administration reacts\n\nTrump defended Hegseth.\n\n\"How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,\" Trump said in response to a question from a reporter in the Oval Office.\n\n\"It's all a witch hunt,\" Trump added.\n\nAs he prepared to leave Hawaii on Wednesday, Hegseth said that \"there's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information.\"\n\nHowever, according to the messages, there was the precise method of attack, including the specific weapons platforms to be used.\n\nHe said the texts were a \"team update\" to provide \"general updates in real-time.\" Classified matters usually take place in a secure room.\n\nThe defense secretary also posted on X: This only proves one thing: [The Atlantic editor-in-chief] Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it). Not even close,\" Hegseth posted. \"We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was on the chat, said: \"Obviously someone made a mistake. Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist. Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing.\n\nRubio, a former top lawmaker on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said at a news conference in Jamaica: \"I think there'll be reforms and changes made so this never - it's not going to happen again. It can't. I've been assured by the Pentagon and everyone involved that none of the information ... none of the information on there at any point threatened the operation or lives of our servicemen.\"\n\nHaugh, the National Security Agency director, testified to the House committee an advisory on how to use the Signal app was given to NSA employees because there are risks associated with using it.\n\nCongressional response\n\nSeveral Democratic members in Congress said Hegseth should be terminated.\n\nThe House's top Democrat, Hakeem Jeffries, said in a letter to Trump that Hegseth should be \"fired immediately\" as his \"continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation's security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday \"members of the Trump administration lied. People need to resign or be fired.\"\n\nAlso, Sen.

Numbered’ Amid Health Speculation as Russia Intensifies Ukraine Attack","text":"VLADIMIR Putin “will die soon” vowed a raging Zelensky amid rumours of the Russian’s ill-health and intensifying blitzes on Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader pleaded alongside Macron for the US to “stay strong” in the face of Russian skulduggery while Putin is still around.\n\nZelensky and Macron sat down on Wednesday to talk peace, following a shaky Black Sea ceasefire brokered by the US on Tuesday.\n\nIn a display of unity, officials urged Russia to adhere to international expectations while encouraging the EU to maintain cohesion, all in anticipation of a pivotal summit of leaders scheduled for Thursday.\n\nZelensky said that Putin is trying to “hit the European Union from within” – citing Hungary, which sides with Russia.\n\nBut he also vowed: “He [Putin] will die soon, and that’s a fact, and it will come to an end.”\n\nRumours about Putin’s poor health have gathered steam.\n\nHe is often seen with a puffy face, tremors and a twitching legs, fuelling speculation he is on the way out.\n\nThe troubled leader expressed confidence, stating that “America will […] persuade Putin to agree to an unconditional ceasefire,” even as Ukraine suffered ongoing, severe attacks—117 of which occurred on Tuesday night.\n\nMacron vented at Putin repeatedly choosing to “reinterpret” ceasefire after leaving the table.\n\nHe said: “While saying it wants peace, Russia continues to strike intensely the Ukrainian territory, including civilian targets.\n\n“Russia cannot dictate conditions of lasting peace for Ukraine.”\n\nThursday’s meeting of EU leaders will see them once again seek a consensus on how to support Ukraine in the event of a permanent ceasefire deal.\n\nOne option is to deploy troops from willing EU nations to keep peace on the ground.\n\nBut Macron warned on this could lead EU soldiers into direct conflict with Russia.\n\nIf Putin attacked Ukrainian soil, this would constitute an attack on the peacekeepers too, he said.\n\nIt would fall to the troops from countries such as the UK and France to hit back against Russia.\n\nMacron also committed to $2bn more in military aid for Ukraine, emphasising that now is a “decisive phase to put an end to the war of aggression”.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Nato chief Mark Rutte warned that any attack on Poland or any member of the alliance by Russia would provoke a “devastating” military reaction.\n\nHe also had a message for member nations: “This is not the time to go it alone.”\n\nHe insisted there is “no alternative” to Nato when it comes to keeping Europe safe, and that “nothing can replace America’s nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security”.\n\nEU bureaucrats also urged every household in the 27-nation bloc to prepare a war-survival kit.\n\nThe Black Sea ceasefire deal agreed on Tuesday reads like it was dictated by Russia, according to experts.\n\nMilitary analysts told The Sun that it benefits Putin far more than Zelensky, who is trying to salvage a permanent peace deal for his war-torn nation.\n\nAfter a marathon of negotiations, the White House confirmed it had got both sides to agree to halt strikes in the Black Sea region and on energy infrastructure.\n\nDespite the apparent progress, Macron said Russia is still exhibiting a “desire for war”.\n\nThe warmongering superpower has set out demands for peace, which the White House said it would examine.\n\nMacron continued: “Ukraine has clearly expressed to the United States its agreement to a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, even though it is the victim of the aggression.\n\n“We expect the same commitment from Russia.”\n\nZelensky said he anticipated “strong decisions” from Thursday’s meeting, which will include the likes of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Keir Starmer.\n\nHe said: “Now is definitely not the time to reduce pressure on Russia or weaken our unity for the sake of peace.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader agreed that Russia is spinning out the peace process to prolong the war.\n\nHe said: “Russia wants this war to continue. It is dragging it out. We need to put pressure on Russia so that the war ends indeed.”\n\nMacron is expecting 31 representatives around the table on Thursday morning at the presidential Elysee Palace.\n\nNotably, Donald Trump will not be among them.\n\nThe US president has shown no enthusiasm for boots on the ground – European or American – to maintain peace.\n\nTrump told Tucker Carlson the proposal for an EU army to be dispatched was “a combination of posture and a pose”, and also too “simplistic”.","summary":"VLADIMIR Putin &#8220;will die soon&#8221; vowed a raging Zelensky amid rumours of&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/zelensky-claims-putins-days-are-numbered-amid-health-speculation-as-russia-intensifies-ukraine-attack/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:37:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":304546714,"title":"Trump says 25% auto tariff to take effect April 2 with no exemptions","text":"President Donald Trump said Wednesday he will impose a 25 percent tariff on all cars made outside the United States, exempting no trading partner from the latest measure which he claims will generate \"tremendous growth\" in the domestic auto industry.\n\nTrump said the auto tariff will take effect on April 2. \"I think our automobile business will flourish like it's never flourished before,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nFor weeks, Trump had said he was considering a tariff of around 25 percent on imported cars, up from the current 2.5 percent, as part of efforts to revitalize domestic manufacturing and attract more investment into the United States.\n\nTrump's latest trade action could have a considerable impact on Japanese, German, South Korean and other foreign carmakers, as well as their American rivals, who also produce a significant percentage of their vehicles outside the United States and procure parts from around the world.\n\nDue to the complex supply chains in the auto industry, involving numerous suppliers, and the requirement for manufacturers to make huge investments in technology and plants before they roll out new models, it is not a quick or easy process to relocate car production to new lines in the United States, as desired by Trump.\n\nAdditionally, many mainstream economists have warned that higher tariffs will likely result in increased costs not only for manufacturers but also for consumers.\n\nTrump's auto tariff announcement came before he plans to unleash broader reciprocal tariffs, targeting goods from countries around the world with matching duties, on April 2.\n\nHe labels that date as \"liberation day,\" repeatedly claiming that the United States has been \"ripped off\" by its allies and adversaries for many years.\n\nSince returning to the White House for a nonconsecutive second presidency about two months ago, Trump has announced various types of tariffs.\n\nThey include 20 percent additional duties on goods from China and 25 percent levies on all steel and aluminum imports.\n\nThe Trump administration's 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, announced despite the North American free trade pact, briefly took effect in early March, but are now paused until April 2.\n\nRelated coverage","summary":"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Wednesday he will impose a 25 percent tariff on all cars made outside th...","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/03/fb3e5302cc49-update3-trump-says-25-auto-tariff-to-take-effect-april-2-with-no-exemptions.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/dff248e73f10ec98961c713628c943ca/cropped_image_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:28:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":304547764,"title":"US report on religious freedom politically motivated, says MEA","text":"India on Wednesday termed US Commission on International Religious Freedom’s (USCIRF’s) annual report on international religious freedom as “biased” while terming it an attempt to misrepresent isolated incidents and cast aspersions on India’s vibrant multicultural society.In reaction to the USCIRF report, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We have seen the recently released 2025 Annual Report of the USCIRF, which once again continues its pattern of issuing biased and politically motivated assessments.”Talks on bilateral trade agreement begin As reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump are scheduled to kick in on April 2, India is hoping to escape the immediate fallout as it has offered to lower tariff on several items from automobiles to select farm produce.Senior trade officials of India and the US formally commenced three-day talks on the proposed bilateral trade agreement in New Delhi on Wednesday.

Wall Street had expected tariffs on copper to come later this year.\n\nThe most actively traded copper futures contract in New York hit $5.374 per pound Wednesday morning before settling at a record $5.24 per pound.\n\nCopper prices have soared 30% this year, largely driven by US buyers trying to stockpile the red metal due to anxiety around potential tariffs. Copper prices have outpaced gold, which has gained 16%, and far outpaced the major US stock indexes this year.\n\nWhile tariffs on copper have yet to be announced, Trump signed an executive order last month to investigate the national security risks associated with importing copper.\n\nCopper is not a rare earth mineral nor one of the 50 “critical minerals” designated by the US Geological Survey. However, in 2023, the Department of Energy deemed it a “critical material for energy.” The malleable metal is widely used in construction and manufacturing and has essential purposes for electronics, energy and defense.\n\nThe recent price spike in New York copper futures isn’t due to fundamental consumer demand, but rather “major stockpile shifts to the US” due to speculation around tariffs, according to Hansen.\n\nIn London, copper prices have also risen, though not to record highs. Since January, copper futures traded in New York have begun to outpace copper futures traded in London, breaking away from their trend of tracking each other. New York copper futures are now trading at a 17% premium, according to Hansen.\n\n“It highlights how tariffs continue to uproot normal market behavior,” he said.\n\nCommodities giant Mercuria estimates that about 500,000 tons of copper are being shipped to the US this month — a significant boost from the standard monthly import of about 70,000 tons, according to Bloomberg.\n\n“We think shipments to the US will likely be fast tracked,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a Wednesday note, adding that imports of copper in April could jump 200,000 tons.\n\nThe analysts at Goldman Sachs said they had initially been expecting tariffs on copper to go into effect between September and November.\n\nCopper’s bull run\n\nWhile the recent surge in copper prices has primarily been driven by tariff anxiety, other factors have also underpinned copper’s rise over the past year.\n\nThere has been increasing global demand for copper in energy and technology like electronic vehicles, as well as continued demand in China.\n\nGlencore, a commodities giant, suspended production at one of its copper smelters in Chile this month, creating a lull in supply that is also contributing to higher prices, according to Reuters.\n\nBut despite all the uncertainty and speculation, Wall Street will ultimately have to wait and see what Trump’s actual policy is toward tariffs on copper.\n\n“There may be a price correction, at least temporarily, as soon as the pull-forward effect on US demand comes to an end,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a Tuesday note.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Here's what we learned","text":"This week's stunning story about Washington's group chat mix-up has prompted a White House campaign against the looped-in magazine editor and a debate over what constitutes \"war plans\".\n\n\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has repeatedly said since The Atlantic's revelations; comments echoed across the administration.\n\nThe Atlantic has now published screenshots of the chat thread and invited readers to judge for themselves.\n\nHere's what we've learned and what's happened since.\n\nThe 'war plans' are revealed\n\nJeffrey Goldberg's initial report described the \"war plans\" in the chat as \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing\".\n\nThe key message about those plans, posted to the chat by Mr Hegseth, began by stating the weather was favourable.\n\nIt then outlined a sequence of events, including when F-18 fighter jets, strike drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles would launch, with precise information about the timing.\n\nIt did not include precise information about targets. But subsequent messages, posted after the strikes, referred to the Houthis' \"top missile guy\" and his \"girlfriend's building\" being hit.\n\nNational Security Adviser Mike Waltz wrote:\n\nVP. building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID. Pete, Kurilla, the IC, amazing job.\n\nVice-President JD Vance responded: \"What?\"\n\nMr Waltz then wrote:\n\nTyping too fast. The first target — their top missile guy — we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed.\n\nAfter a string of congratulatory messages, and several emojis from Mr Waltz, Mr Hegseth wrote:\n\nCENTCOM was/is on point. Great job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far.\n\nThe Atlantic published the chat thread under a headline that referred to them as \"attack plans\". The White House said that meant the magazine was admitting they weren't war plans.\n\nDefence experts say there are important differences — war plans outline an overall strategy for a conflict, whereas attack plans focus on a specific operation. But both would generally be classified.\n\n\"One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner,\" former CIA official Mick Mulroy told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWas it classified information?\n\nThe Trump administration continues to insist the Signal exchange did not include classified information.\n\nBut some have pointed to the Department of Defense (DoD) manual, which says material should be classified if:\n\n\"… the unauthorised disclosure of the information [could] reasonably be expected to cause [serious] damage to the national security\", including \"military plans, weapon systems, or operations\".\n\nA 2009 executive order, still in place, uses similar language.\n\nDemocratic congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi read from both documents at a hearing of Congress's House Intelligence Committee and said:\n\n\"Applying the executive order as well as the DoD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information.\"\n\nThe Trump administration, though, says the classified details were confined to an authorised communications channel referred to as \"high side\". In one of the Signal messages, Mr Waltz told the group:\n\nTeam, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the president's guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.\n\nMany Republicans are toeing the White House's line.\n\nBut one Republican member of Congress has publicly broken ranks.\n\nDon Bacon, a retired US Air Force brigadier general and intelligence specialist, told The Hill:\n\n\"The WH is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data. They should just own up to it and preserve credibility.\"\n\nDemocrats' calls for heads to roll have only intensified.\n\nSenator Tammy Duckworth, a former Blackhawk helicopter pilot who served in Iraq, posted online:\n\n\"Pete Hegseth is a f***ing liar. This is so clearly classified info he recklessly leaked that could've gotten our pilots killed. He needs to resign in disgrace immediately.\"\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said \"someone made a big mistake\" but the Pentagon had told him the information wasn't classified.\n\nLarry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and White House Situation Room senior director, told the ABC:\n\n\"I've never seen the kind of information that Mr Goldberg showed us today as not being classified … It is really ludicrous to claim that it is not classified.\"\n\nWaltz takes responsibility and recruits Musk\n\nEarlier, Mr Waltz, who set up the chat, said he took responsibility for the journalist's invitation to join.\n\n\"I built the group,\" he said.\n\nHe still says he has no idea how he added Goldberg. He told Fox News:\n\n\"I just talked to Elon [Musk] on the way here. We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened.\"But I can tell you for 100 per cent, I don't know this guy.\"I know him by his horrible reputation — and he really is the bottom scum of journalists — and I know him in the sense that he hates the president, but I don't text him. He wasn't in my phone.\"\n\nTrump suggests the app's to blame\n\nOn Wednesday evening, local time, President Donald Trump was asked if Mr Hegseth should consider his position.\n\nMr Trump then suggested the Signal app itself could have been the problem.\n\n\"How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do it,\" he said.\"It's all a witch-hunt.\"… I don't know that Signal works. I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you, and I think that's what we have to — because you use Signal, and we use Signal, and everybody uses Signal, but it could be a defective platform. And we're going to have to find that out.\"\n\nMemories are refreshed\n\nTwo of the officials involved in the chat — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe — have been questioned by a Senate committee for a second day.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms Gabbard said she could not recall discussions of weapons, timing or targets taking place in the group chat.\n\nPressed on whether that was true on Wednesday, she told the Senate Intelligence Committee she stood by her response:\n\n\"Obviously the release of the screenshots that came from that chat group today were a refresher on what happened. As I said earlier, I was not involved with that portion of the chat, so it did not come to my recollection yesterday.\"","summary":"This week's story about Washington's group chat mix-up has prompted debate over what constitutes \"war plans\" and whether the material was classified.

The decision has sparked criticism from global leaders, raising concerns over economic stability and international relations.\n“I deeply regret the US decision to impose tariffs on European automotive exports,” von der Leyen stated, emphasizing that the European Union remains committed to pursuing diplomatic solutions. “We will continue to seek negotiated solutions while safeguarding our economic interests.”\nCanada’s Strong Response to Tariffs\nThe backlash to Trump’s tariff announcement was not limited to Europe. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also voiced his strong opposition, calling the move a “direct attack” on Canadian workers. His remarks underscored the growing frustration in Canada, a country with deep economic ties to the U.S., particularly in the automotive sector.\n“We will defend our workers. We’ll defend our companies. We’ll defend our country. And we’ll defend it together,” Carney declared, reinforcing his commitment to protecting Canadian industries. As he campaigns for the upcoming April 28 elections, Carney has centered his platform on countering Trump’s trade policies.\nCarney’s response signals that Canada is prepared to take retaliatory action. After meeting with autoworkers and labor leaders, he assured them that any revenue generated from Canada’s counter-tariffs would be directed toward supporting those impacted by the trade dispute.\nEconomic Ties at Risk\nBeyond economic concerns, the tariffs pose a significant threat to diplomatic relations between the U.S. and its closest allies. Carney pointed to the Ambassador Bridge, a crucial trade link between Windsor, Canada, and Detroit, Michigan, as a symbol of the longstanding economic and social ties between the two nations. However, he warned that Trump’s policies are straining these bonds.\n“This is a direct attack, to be clear, a direct attack on the very workers that I stood in front of … this morning at the Ambassador Bridge,” Carney emphasized, expressing concern over the future of U.S.-Canada relations.\n“The bridge is a symbol and a reality up until now of the tight ties between our two countries, ties of kinship, ties of commerce, ties that are in the process of being broken,” he added, warning that the tariffs could have long-term consequences for North American economic stability.\nAs tensions mount, both the European Union and Canada are weighing their next steps. While von der Leyen and Carney have stressed the need for diplomacy, the possibility of retaliatory measures remains on the table. The unfolding trade dispute will likely continue to test the resilience of international economic alliances in the coming months.\nALSO READ: Trump Imposes 25% Tariff On Imported Autos, Aims To Generate $100 Billion In Tax Revenue","summary":"Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25-percent tariff on all auto imports.

Washington, D.C.-based U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, on Wednesday, denied the government’s motion to dissolve her order that prevents the military from denying transgender people the ability to enlist in the military. Reyes presided over a hearing on March 21, when she requested the Department of Defense (DOD) delay its original March 26 deadline to enact the policy. On March 21, the defendants in the suit, who include Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, filed a motion to dissolve the injunction blocking the Pentagon's ban. The filing argued that the policy is not an overarching ban but instead \"turns on gender dysphoria – a medical condition – and does not discriminate against trans-identifying persons as a class.\" TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN SET TO TAKE EFFECT DURING ONGOING COURT BATTLE The Trump administration further requested that, if the motion to dissolve is denied, the court should stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal. The government cited new guidance issued March 21 that it expected to enact the policy if not for the ongoing litigation. The guidance clarified that \"the phrase ‘exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria’\" solely applies to \"'individuals who exhibit such symptoms as would be sufficient to constitute a diagnosis.'\" Reyes said she wanted to allow more time for the appeals process. She also said she had previously allowed plenty of time to appeal her earlier opinion blocking the ban from going into effect. HEGSETH SUGGESTS JUDGE REPORT TO MILITARY BASES AFTER RULING THAT PENTAGON MUST ALLOW TRANSGENDER TROOPS On Wednesday, Reyes acknowledged that Military Department Identification Guidance (MIDI Guidance) is new, but the argument presented by the defense is not. \"Defendants re-emphasize their ‘consistent position that the [Hegseth] Policy is concerned with the military readiness, deployability, and costs associated with a medical condition,’\" the judge wrote. \"Regulating gender dysphoria is no different than regulating bipolar disorder, eating disorders, or suicidality.

Around 44% of Ireland’s pharmaceutical exports go to the States, valued at a record €224 billion last year.\n\nMany of these goods are manufactured by US pharmaceutical companies paying tax here – a situation that the current US government has vociferously opposed.\n\nThe ESRI report includes a forecast of a drop in exports of two percentage points less than if tariffs were not introduced, and a dip in imports next year of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nUnemployment\n\nKieran McQuinn from ESRI warns of an increase in unemployment in Ireland if US tariffs of 25% on EU goods kick in.\n\nThe current unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, the lowest level achieved since 2001.\n\nHowever, should tariffs be introduced, an average unemployment rate of 4.3% is predicted for the whole 2025, gradually increasing to 4.6% for next year, according to estimations made in the ESRI report.\n\n“Clearly the tariff issue will have an impact, particularly in the traded sectors, industry and ICT sectors,” McQuinn said.\n\n“If there is a profound impact, it would clearly have an impact on unemployment. We do have unemployment gently ticking up just over the next year, and that’s really under the baseline due to the deterioration in the trans trading conditions that we are witnessing at present.”\n\nSpending power\n\nReal wages – purchasing power that is adjusted for inflation – have been steadily increasing over the past three years while inflation has been dipping, the latter falling from 8% in 2022 to 2% today.\n\nHowever, the ESRI expects inflation to rise by 2% in 2025 as a result of tariffs, increasing to 2.2% in 2026.\n\nThis is forecast to negatively impact real wages for the first time in three years, decreasing them by just under 1%.\n\nHigher inflation met with decreased purchasing power of consumers will likely cause difficulty in household budgeting and could drive an increase in precautionary savings which may be enough to sustain economic growth in the short-term. \n\nUnemployment and inflation are forecast to rise if proposed US tariffs against the EU go ahead.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nKeith Kelly\n\nView 7 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Report shows 'extremely high' risk of economic hardship for Ireland if Trump tariffs take hold”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Report shows 'extremely high' risk of economic hardship for Ireland if Trump tariffs take hold”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

church US intelligence said helped overthrow a government, invited Donald Trump to speak at its events and saw former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev meet its founder.\n\nThe Unification Church, a religious movement derived from Christianity, has had deep connections to world politics for decades.\n\nBut the shooting of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe might have been the beginning of the end.\n\nHis death sparked investigations that revealed the lengths the church was going to to fund its operations and its links to Japan's political establishment.\n\nThree years since Mr Abe's death, a court in Tokyo has now ordered the church to effectively disband.\n\nHere's what we know about the Unification Church and its ties to world politics.\n\nWhat is the Unification Church?\n\nThe church was founded by the late Reverend Sun Myung Moon in 1954, who preached new and conservative interpretations of the Bible.\n\nHe claimed that Jesus had entrusted him to be the second messiah and had tasked him with bringing about world peace.\n\nDevotees are known as \"Moonies\" after the church's founder.\n\nFormally known as the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, the church champions anti-communism and the unification of North and South Korea.\n\nIt's perhaps best known for mass weddings, where it paired off couples, often from different countries, and renewed the vows of those already married.\n\nThe group is said to have millions of followers around the world, including in Japan, the United States and South Korea.\n\nIt also owns the Washington Times newspaper in the US, where the church's membership base has grown dramatically outside of Asia.\n\nWhy is it controversial?\n\nThe church's recruitment and fundraising tactics have often come under scrutiny.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, it was accused of brainwashing followers into pouring huge portions of their salaries into the organisation. \n\nIt denied the allegations, saying many new religious movements face similar accusations in early years.\n\nBut those claims persisted for decades. \n\nSome experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during the country's colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOthers say most of the church's funding comes from Japan.\n\nHow was Shinzo Abe linked to the Unification Church?\n\nClose ties between the church and Japan's Liberal Democratic Party were unearthed following investigations into the assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022.\n\nThe man arrested after allegedly shooting Shinzo Abe, Tetsuya Yamagami, told police he had killed Japan's former prime minister because of his links to the church, which he had a grudge against because his mother had been a member. \n\nMr Abe was known for his conservative views on security and history, appearing at events organised by church affiliates, but the organisation has said he was never a member or an adviser.\n\nDr Jeffrey Hall from Kanda University of International Studies told the ABC's The World program the Liberal Democratic Party was still dealing with the fallout.\n\n\"More than half of the party was involved in some way, be it attending church events or relying on volunteers from the church, or appearing in church-sponsored publications,\" Mr Hall said.\n\n\"It was a very strong anti-communist organisation, so it had a lot of overlap with Japan's ruling conservatives for many decades.\n\n\"The church seemed to have some influence in pushing its conservative viewpoints on things like gender, same-sex marriage and on constitutional revision.\"\n\nHe said some MPs today still have ties to the church but were operating in a \"grey area\", where church members continue to work for politicians but say it isn't on behalf of the Unification Church.\n\n\"It [the LDP] hasn't really cleaned house or punished the politicians who had ties to the church,\" he said.\n\nBut its influence extended far beyond Japan.\n\nUS intelligence agencies reported that in the 1980s, the staunchly anti-communist Reverend Moon sent cash and supplies to groups who would go on to overthrow Bolivia's democratically-elected government.\n\nHow is Donald Trump linked to the Unification Church?\n\nShinzo Abe wasn't the only political leader with ties to the church.\n\nDonald Trump, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush all had links

concerns that Beijing could utilise the platform for surveillance or influence operations targeting Americans.The legislation became effective on January 19, prior to Trump's inauguration, though he subsequently issued a postponement allowing continued operations.Trump previously attempted to prohibit TikTok's US operations during his first presidential term, citing national security risks.In January, TikTok briefly ceased US operations and was removed from application stores as the deadline approached, affecting millions of users.Following his second term commencement on January 20, Trump suspended the ban's implementation for 75 days whilst seeking resolution with Beijing.TikTok resumed US services and returned to Apple and Google platforms in February.AI company Perplexity has

When challenged on the accuracy of her comment, Leavitt replied, “I think it’s insulting that you’re trying to test my knowledge of economics and the decisions that this president has made.”\nThe 700 per cent figure cited by Leavitt – at 27, the youngest White House press secretary in history – was politely denied in Tokyo as having been based on old data and inaccurate.\n\nJapan imports most of its foreign rice tariff-free under a World Trade Organization agreement. A steep tariff of 341 yen-per-kilogram (US$2.27) applies only to a small amount imported outside that quota. Current estimates put the effective rate closer to 400 per cent – far below the figure Leavitt cited.\n“The current US administration has no literacy whatsoever,” said a message on the website of the Daily Shincho newspaper. “They distort the facts to suit their own convenience, nitpick, and force their way into a deal. It’s no exaggeration to say that a country that was once called the world’s police force is now the world’s antisocial force.”\nAnother added, “The amount of fake news is rather frightening and that those in power are only saying what is good for them – and that this has become the norm.”\nHiromi Murakami, a professor of political science at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, said ordinary Japanese people “are just stunned at what they are seeing”.\nA lot of Japanese were worried about a second Trump government, but they did not believe there would be such chaos, so quickly\nHiromi Murakami, political analyst\n“There seem to be waves of news every day, and it is impossible to keep up with everything or to find out the details of all the different policies,” she told This Week in Asia.\n“I think a lot of Japanese were worried about what a second Trump government would look like, but they did not believe there would be such chaos, so quickly,” she said. “People here just want the confusion and chaos to stop.”\nTrump promised to impose tariffs of 25 per cent on all imports of cars from April 2, with the Japanese industry watching carefully, she said.\n“The US has already imposed tariffs on Japanese aluminium and steel, but that has not really had a direct impact on the Japanese economy or society,” she said. “It will be different if Trump does go ahead with tariffs on cars because that is such an important sector for Japan.”\n\nThe day after her comment on rice imports, Leavitt announced that Japan’s “Asahi Breweries will move its manufacturing base to the US” in response to Trump’s planned increase in import tariffs. The drinks firm denied the report.\nTrump himself has made a number of inaccurate claims about Japan. For example, in his address to Congress on March 5, he said that Honda Motor intended to build a new plant in Indiana.\n“Plants are opening up all over the place,” Trump said. “Deals are being made [that have] never [been] seen. That’s a combination of the election win and tariffs.\n“In fact, already, numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.”\n\nIn a statement issued to Reuters, the company said: “Honda has made no such announcement and will not comment on this report.”\nOn March 19, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy posted a video on social media, which criticised the New York subway system – but used an image of a Japanese train crossing the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo to illustrate his point.\nWhile Trump’s repeatedly discussed plans to take control of Greenland may not directly affect Japan, some are wary of a visit by Vice-President J.D. Vance and his wife to the Danish-controlled territory. There is concern that Washington might one day decide to similarly lay claim to the Okinawa naval base, justifying it on the grounds of national defence.\nA comment linked to an online Jiji Press article suggested that if Japan were threatened by one of its immediate neighbours, “the US might say it would buy Okinawa or Hokkaido”.\n\n“They could say that the marine resources and underground minerals also belonged to the US. How abnormal is that?” the online user added. “I just hope that Trump’s term ends quickly.”\nAnd while there are no statistics currently available on Japanese tourists and others planning trips to the US, Murakami said concerns were clearly influencing travellers’ decisions.\n“My daughter and some of her friends are looking into US colleges for next year,” she said. “But it is obvious that there are a lot of questions about whether they will be able to get a visa and there may be other issues. She may decide to go somewhere else instead.”","summary":"Analysts fear this disinformation will strain the US-Japan alliance, risking economic uncertainty, especially in the auto sector.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3304001/trumps-japan-trade-threats-false-claims-spark-disbelief-want-confusion-chaos-stop","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/26/5a57fd7d-c4bf-44f5-9b1a-6c98965c943e_3f3a786e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-27 00:00:16","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":304544796,"title":"World News | US General Stresses Bangladesh Military's Importance for Regional Security","text":"Dhaka, Mar 27 (PTI) The United States has expressed its interest to equip the Bangladesh Army with its military hardware, taking into account its importance for regional security as US Army's deputy commanding general for Pacific made a 24-hour visit to Dhaka, officials said.

They’ve killed U.S. service members while altering critical shipping routes, leading to delays and, ultimately, higher prices of goods worldwide. \n\nNational security adviser Michael Waltz then put together a group chat on an encrypted app called Signal. Whether Waltz himself put together the chat and maintained the invite list is unclear (midlevel managers have assistants who take care of these things in the corporate world). Many of President Donald Trump’s top Cabinet members were invited to the discussion, including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, among others. \n\nGoldberg, a vehement anti-Trump editor for a vehemently anti-Trump magazine, received what’s called a connection request from Waltz, indicating the two hadn’t spoken before on this particular app. From there, Goldberg was privy to plans of attacks on the Houthis set to launch on March 15 but did not report on his unintended access until after the fact. \n\nGoldberg, in a piece published Monday, claimed that “war plans” were included in the discussion. He has since posted a screenshot of what Hegseth sent, which includes which assets would be launched for attack at what times. In the wrong hands, this information could put American lives at risk. The fact that any reporter or editor was accidentally invited to a discussion like this is patently careless and embarrassing. No amount of spin changes that. \n\nIt is certain Trump was not pleased about the incident after a string of favorable news cycles around dropping gas and grocery prices. Last week, two stranded astronauts splashed down in the Gulf of America to much fanfare, thanks to the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. \n\nThen, there were the U.S. missions against the Houthis themselves, which were and continue to be enormously successful, while Trump showed a clear commitment to differ from Team Biden’s limp responses and to get important shipping lanes open again. \n\nThe Signal fumble is overshadowing everything, at least for now. But the feeling here is that this story will largely be gone by the end of the week. Here are a few reasons why: \n\nWe live in a world that requires instant communication. Some of the aforementioned members of the Trump Cabinet were in several different places where a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, was not available. Vance was traveling to Michigan for an economic event, while Ukraine envoy Steve Witkoff, who was also in the chat, was in Moscow. \n\nNote: SCIFs are bulky and inconvenient. Communication and chats by an app like Signal are infinitely more convenient (almost too convenient). Here’s betting that Biden administration officials also used Signal to hold chats like this since the Signal app was installed on devices and agency computers when Trump officials took office, meaning it was already being used. \n\nMessages referenced in Goldberg’s piece also show Trump Cabinet members talking about switching to what are called “high side” classified systems, showing they knew the difference between an unclassified chat and secure communication for more sensitive content.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a justification for what happened. It cannot occur again, and it would be career suicide for anyone who initiated or joined a chat like this. \n\nBut apparently, Signal use among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle is common. Here’s the new AOC, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), talking about Signal just this past weekend during a speech in Washington, D.C.: \n\n“We have all these Signal chats,” she said before the Goldberg story broke. “If you don’t have Signal, get on Signal, OK? Do not trust — get on Signal!” \n\nHere’s another reason why the legs on this story may not be what Democrats hope they’ll be: \n\nJames Comey. \n\nIt was Comey in 2016, just a few months before Election Day, who provided a get-out-of-jail-free card for this behavior when he didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton for her highly classified emails sitting on an unsecured server while secretary of state. \n\nOnce that decision by the FBI director was made, all bets were off moving forward. It served as a permission slip that these actions were wrong, sure, but merely a light-slap-on-the-wrist wrong. \n\nBy the way, the same people screaming for Trump officials to resign also excused Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents by leaving them next to his Corvette in a garage at one of his Delaware homes. \n\nSit this one out, folks. The selective outrage is obvious. \n\nNow, all of that said, if the shoes were on other feet and this happened with Kamala Harris as vice president, Tony Blinken as secretary of state, and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser holding a chat in such a manner, Republicans would surely be demanding resignations as well … that’s just the way it works now. \n\nAnd that’s the point: When Democrats complained that egg and grocery prices were too high under Trump just days after he took office, it had zero punch because they excused the same thing under Biden. \n\nSo when Democrats, CNN, and MSNBC pundits lecture about the importance of national security, it falls almost completely on deaf ears after so many defended the Afghanistan withdrawal that saw 13 U.S. service members killed, which resulted in exactly zero firings and no accountability.\n\nExcusing an open border that has allowed hundreds, if not thousands, of terrorists into the country also doesn’t help their argument now. \n\nFor his part, Trump has stuck by Waltz so far.“I don’t think he should apologize,” the president said. “I think he’s doing his best. It’s equipment and technology that’s not perfect.”“And, probably, he won’t be using it again, at least not in the very near future,” he added.One gets the feeling, however, that if anything like this happens again, there won’t be a third strike for Waltz. \n\nFinally, there is Goldberg’s past work that needs to be highlighted when it comes to credibility. \n\nIn 2018, Goldberg wrote an Atlantic piece titled, “Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are ‘Losers’ and ‘Suckers.’”\n\n“The president has repeatedly disparaged the intelligence of service members, and asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades,” he added, citing “multiple sources” who predictably all stayed anonymous. \n\nThe story came after poor weather canceled both a flight and a ceremony at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside of Paris. But Trump didn’t refuse anything.

In 2025, just about every sane, rational person has accepted that masks don't stop respiratory viruses, which is why everyone got COVID anyway, even when mask mandates were in place. But sanity and rationality are, as ever, in short supply on the political left. Which is why reporters are some of the last people on earth still wearing masks with any regularity. And one of them questioned President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, and got exactly the treatment they so richly deserve. The reporter asked Trump a question about California, to which he responded: \"You know, I haven't seen a mask in so long, you're wearing a mask!\" He sarcastically added, \"That's so nice of you. I haven't seen anybody wearing a mask in a long time, it's good. You feel more comfortable right, good, that's good.\" Amazing.

It's hard to believe how completely uneducated, unaware and committed to Anthony Fauci you have to be to still wear a mask in spring 2025. We tried masks, for years, everyone got COVID anyway.

Marc, a renowned producer behind films like La La Land and Cruella, flew to meet with Rachel over her social media posts defending Palestine and her remarks against Donald Trump returning to power. Jonah, an actor, writer, and producer, took to social media where he slammed the film star for her stance. Rachel had been working on the film alongside his Marc. Jonah's post which has since been deleted saw Jonah call Rachel \"immature.\" Jonah also suggested that she had narcissistic tendencies. A social media user questioned Jonah, asking: \"Your dad flew to NYC to reprimand a young actress? Any words on this? Cuz that's creepy as hell and uncalled for. People have the right to free speech no? Shame on your father.\" In a fiery rant, Jonah said: \"You really want to do this? Yeah, my dad, the producer of the enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to fly across the country to reprimand his 20-year-old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicly for.\" Jonah suggested that Rachel's statements could effect the box office performance. He said: \"Free speech does not mean you're allowed to say whatever you want in your private employment without repercussions. Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful. Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged.\" Disney reportedly employed a social media guru for Rachel after her Instagram post about Donald Trump's re-election . The actress in November 2024 after the election results took to her Instagram to express her anger and sorrow that Trump was re-elected. Near the end of her post, she had written \"May Trump supporters … never know peace\" and signed off with \"F--- Donald Trump .\" The post received backlash from MAGA supporters and conservatives. Rachel apologised for the post in an Instagram Story the following week. Variety reported on March 25 that the company and Snow White producer Marc Platt hired a social media guru to vet her post before the film's March 21 debut after her Trump post. There reportedly was a back and forth but Rachel eventually worked with the guru. The outlet reported that Disney and Marc had an issue with another of Rachel's social media posts. Rachel, known for her outspoken support for Palestine, had tweeted, \"and always remember, free Palestine.\" The 67-year-old film producer reportedly flew to New York where Rachel was preparing for her Broadway production of Romeo + Juliet to talk to her and get her to remove her pro-Palestinian tweet. Rachel did not budge and maintained her stance as well as her tweet. In an interview Cosmopolitan in October 2024, Rachel spoke about the backlash she received from Snow White leading to people harassing her from her apartment. \"For being brown. For having brown skin. For playing Snow White. There was a lot of harassment from a certain group of people—they were showing up at my apartment and screaming profanities,\" the 23-year-old said. The article did not mentioned if Disney offered Rachel additional security for the vitriolic and racist backlash she received for playing the role as a Latina woman—she is half Colombian—and for calling out the film for being outdated as well as sharing how the film \"scared\" her as a child.

Circuit declined the Trump administration’s request for an emergency suspension of the temporary restraining order. This order was originally issued on March 15 by D.C. District Court Chief Judge James E. Boasberg, who began his judicial career under George W. Bush and was later elevated by Barack Obama.\n\nNotably, each judge on the three-judge panel provided individual explanations for their decisions. Circuit Judges Patricia Millett, another appointee of Obama, and Karen L. Henderson, named by George H.W. Bush, expressed agreements. Meanwhile, Circuit Judge Justin R. Walker, appointed by President Donald Trump, authored a dissenting opinion.\n\nIn the case before the court, the Trump administration claimed something not entirely unlike plenary authority to quickly deport immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1789. The law, which has not been used since World War II, has hitherto been understood to apply only during an actual war with another country. Its use by the Trump administration to target suspected foreign gang members poses a matter of first impression for the judiciary at large.\n\nThe law in question reads, in relevant part:\n\nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.\n\nHenderson, for her part, believes in the historical understanding of how the law works through its conditional and operative clauses.\n\n“Thus, the AEA vests in the President near-blanket authority to detain and deport any noncitizen whose affiliation traces to the belligerent state,” the judge wrote. “A central limit to this power is the Act’s conditional clause—that the United States be at war or under invasion or predatory incursion.”\n\nTo hear the Trump administration tell it, however, the court’s authority to resolve AEA-related issues are beyond the scope of judicial review because they are so political in nature.\n\nHenderson sharply rejected that claim – accusing the U.S. Department of Justice of misreading the U.S. Supreme Court precedent cited to make that un-reviewability argument.\n\n“In no uncertain terms, the Court said the AEA ‘preclude[s] judicial review . . . [b]arring questions of interpretation and constitutionality,”” Henderson noted. “Questions of interpretation and constitutionality—the heartland of the judicial ken—are subject to judicial review.”\n\nThe judge also offered a new analysis of her own – in light of government claims that the word “invasion” in the statute applies to the current state of the U.S. immigration system because there are large numbers of “illegal” immigrants. This argument was also rejected.\n\n“[T]he invasion must be ‘against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government,’” the judge observed. “The requirement that the ‘invasion’ be conducted by a nation-state and against the United States’ ‘territory’ supports that the Congress was using ‘invasion’ in a military sense of the term.”\n\nThe concurrence elaborates, at length:\n\nThis should come as no surprise. The term “invasion” was well known to the Fifth Congress and the American public circa 1798. The phrase echoes throughout the Constitution ratified by the people just nine years before. And in every instance, it is used in a military sense. For example, the Guarantee Clause provides that “[t]he United States shall . . . protect each [State] against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.” The clause is a federal guarantee to the states against attack from without (invasion) or within (insurrection).\n\nIn one small salve for the government, Henderson cited common law to suggest Boasberg might have to limit his temporary restraining order so that it does not apply to the president himself. Still, she said, the broader restraining order should stand for at least as long as the lower court fully briefs the issues.\n\nIn her own concurrence, Millett also said the lower court was equipped to deal with the case on the merits at this stage – and chided the government for what appeared intentional efforts to remove the case from the court’s jurisdiction by its actions.\n\n“The district court has been handling this matter with great expedition and circumspection, and its orders do nothing more than freeze the status quo until weighty and unprecedented legal issues can be addressed through a soon-forthcoming preliminary injunction proceeding,” Millett wrote. “There is neither jurisdiction nor reason for this court to interfere at this very preliminary stage or to allow the government to singlehandedly moot the Plaintiffs’ claims by immediately removing them beyond the reach of their lawyers or the court.”\n\nMillett used especially strong language to take issue with the Trump administration’s interpretation of the AEA.\n\n“[T]he government maintains that whether there has been an ‘invasion or predatory incursion’ of the United States and whether [the Venezuelan gang Tren de Agua] is a ‘foreign nation or government’ are committed to the President’s discretion,” the judge writes. “Not likely.”\n\nThen judge then took a larger ax to the executive branch.\n\n‘[T]he government is mistaken about the extent of unilateral Executive authority under the Constitution,” she goes on. “An assertion of exclusive Executive authority is ‘the least favorable of possible constitutional postures’ and it runs aground here on the express constitutional assignment of relevant authority to Congress.”\n\nThe government’s position in the AEA case also implicates fundamental constitutional rights; Millett says those issues have long since been decided and the government is wrong again here.\n\n“Over one-hundred-and-fifty years ago, the Supreme Court addressed whether civilian courts could be closed just because the Executive declared an emergency,” the judge noted. “The Court said no.”\n\nAs for the basic claim advanced by the Trump administration, Millett rubbished the government for insisting the AEA could be used to deport people while at the same time suggesting anyone aggrieved by such a deportation could file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\n“The government’s removal scheme denies Plaintiffs even a gossamer thread of due process, even though the government acknowledges their right to judicial review of their removability,” Millett concluded. “The district court’s temporary restraining orders have appropriately frozen the status quo until an imminent motion for preliminary injunction is filed. The district court acted well within its discretion in doing so. We lack jurisdiction to review the government’s motion to stay those orders, and the government’s jurisdictional objections to the district court’s actions do not raise a substantial question at this stage.”","summary":"President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/appeals-court-criticizes-attempts-to-deport-without-due-process/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:53:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":304545664,"title":"Studio Ghibli-inspired memes and portraits made with ChatGPT are flooding the internet","text":"The internet has become a Studio Ghibli-inspired playground. Admirers of the Japanese animation studio are using a new update from ChatGPT to create portraits and memes inspired by the distinct artistic style popularized by filmmaker and studio co-creator Hayao Miyazaki. The trend emerged within a day of OpenAI’s introducing new native image-generation capabilities Tuesday within GPT-4o, the latest version of ChatGPT. Users who pay for the premium tiers, which start at $20 a month, are able to upload any images into the system and asked the tool to transform them “into the style of Studio Ghibli.” Users can also use the tool with Sora, ChatGPT’s text-to-video AI model. Some of the most shared images posted to social media Wednesday re-created political events in U.S. history, including President Donald Trump’s Feb. 28 meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Others transformed popular memes, including a recent one referring to fitness influencer Ashton Hall’s morning routine and the decade-old Distracted Boyfriend meme. But many people simply used it to make their favorite photos with their family members, friends and pets look as if they came out of a Ghibli film. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also joined in on the trend, changing his X profile picture into the same Studio Ghibli style. ChatGPT released the feature amid continued concerns from artists about the infiltration of generative artificial intelligence technology into every artistic medium, including images, voices and music. At the end of 2023, a widely circulated list revealed the names of thousands of artists whose work was used without consent to train the popular AI art generator Midjourney. Last year, more than 11,000 creatives signed an open letter condemning the use of human art to train AI without permission. And last month, thousands of artists similarly signed an open letter urging Christie’s New York gallery to scrap its auction of AI art. “Many of the artworks you plan to auction were created using AI models that are known to be trained on copyrighted work without a license,” the letter said. “These models, and the companies behind them, exploit human artists, using their work without permission or payment to build commercial AI products that compete with them.” While many social media users were excited to use the new AI tool, others lamented that its use diminishes the work of Miyazaki. Some people referred to the reimagined art as AI slop, a term used to describe the outlandish, seemingly AI-generated images that often dominate social media feeds. Others called the images “soulless.” “What we’ve seen today is the very definition of AI slop,” an X user wrote. “Knock-off Ghibli abundance flooding our feeds. Art reduced ‘content’. Unique design becomes memetic generation. Zero creativity.” OpenAI, like many of its competitors, does not reveal the specific data used to train its models. But the accuracy of its Studio Ghibli impressions has also re-raised some users’ questions about whether it has scraped the studio’s works without permission. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment. OpenAI — which has been sued by several news outlets, authors and visual artists who allege copyright infringement — asked the U.S. government this month to make it easier for AI companies to learn from copyrighted material, citing a need to “strengthen America’s lead” globally in advancing the technology. The company claims its latest image generation tool particularly excels at closely following a user’s prompts, using context from the chat and accurately rendering text — which AI image generators have previously been notoriously inept at. “These capabilities make it easier to create exactly the image you envision, helping you communicate more effectively through visuals and advancing image generation into a practical tool with precision and power,” the company wrote in an announcement on its blog Tuesday. Miyazaki, a legendary animator, previously called AI-generated art “an insult to life itself.” “Whoever made it gives no thought to pain. It’s very unpleasant,” he said during an AI demonstration in 2016, according to clip of the moment that circulated across social media on Wednesday. “You can make horrible things if you want, but I want nothing to do with it.”","summary":"The internet has become a Studio Ghibli-inspired playground.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/studio-ghibli-chatgpt-inspired-memes-portraits-rcna198273","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250326-my-neighbor-totoro-se-523p-6151a8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:52:33","author":"Angela Yang","authors":["Angela Yang"],"language":"en","source_country":"na","sentiment":0.385},{"id":304545924,"title":"Piers Morgan makes cheeky Hillary Clinton jibe after 'smashing glass ceiling'","text":"Piers Morgan and Hillary Clinton became involved in a surprising social media conversation on Wednesday. It comes as the pair often come to blows over their different stances on tough subjects. However, this time both were surprised to find themselves in agreement. It came after the former Good Morning Britain man wrote on Elon Musk's microblogging site, X, formerly known as Twitter : \"If you don't consider this to be classified info about imminent war plans, it *may* be that you're too partisan to recognise the truth when it slaps you around your tribal chops. \"If this had happened on Biden's watch, Republicans would have rightly gone berserk.\" He then shared leaked information from the United States secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth. In it, it allegedly shows timings for potential launches. Hillary re-shared Piers' post and said: \"Never thought I'd be retweeting Piers Morgan , but he's right!\" Piers shared the interaction on his Instagram account and captioned the post: \"Finally, Hillary smashes a glass ceiling...\" He then told his followers to scroll to see how he replied to her. The message showed Pier's response reading: \"Do you know much about classified info breaches?\" Hegseth was urged \"resign\" after his Signal account shared the \"reckless\" attack plans. His critics said the leak could \"put a target\" on pilots during the mission. Democrat Senator for New Jersey Andy Kim said Mr Hegseth acted \"recklessly\" after his account texted times when American pilots would carry out strikes in Yemen earlier this month. In the \"team update\" group chat on Signal, Mr Hegseth said F-18s would launch multiple strikes while being supported by drones that would be deployed against targets. The leaked chats have proved to be a major embarrassment for the Trump administration with chat members, including Hegseth slamming critics. That is despite White House officials confirming the authenticity of his claims. Hegseth has repeatedly denied texting attack plans in the Signal group chat that included The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg. Earlier in the week, Piers also took aim at Lord Alan Sugar . While the journalist and broadcaster wished Lord Sugar a happy birthday on Monday, he couldn't help but made a jibe - even referencing Donald Trump . \"Happy birthday, my Lord,\" he said. \"I’m staggered that the age gap between us is only 19 years. You look about 10 years older than Trump who’s your age.\" The dig was in response to a previous barb by Lord Sugar, which read: \"@piersmorgan its my birthday today Piersy (78).

Although the bill won't go anywhere this year because a deadline has passed for consideration by both chambers, the hearing by the House's Republican leadership gave anti-abortion activists a chance to speak out on an issue near and dear to their constituents.

Each time someone left the room after testifying, they were met with cheers from those on their side of the bill. \"Tens of thousands of babies made in the image of God continue to be murdered in our state every year, all within the bounds of the current law,\" said bill sponsor Rep Emory Dunahoo, a Gillsville Republican. “This bill simply ensures that those same laws protecting the lives of people after birth equally protect the lives of people before birth.” The bill would make most abortions a crime from the point of fertilisation. Georgia already bans abortions after finding a “detectable human heartbeat\", which can happen as early as six weeks into pregnancy when many women still don't know they are pregnant. Still, a flurry of religious leaders said the measure doesn't go far enough. Some religious anti-abortion individuals were among the bill's opponents, though, saying it goes too far with criminalisation. Critics of the measure said it would bar women from lifesaving care during birth complications and in-vitro fertilisation. Many voiced concern that women with miscarriages or dangerous health complications during birth would not get the care they need. Rep Shea Roberts, an Atlanta Democrat, recounted her own experience getting an abortion to save her life. \"It was one of the most devastating times in my life, and doctors told me that the dream of my child was going to die either inside of me or within minutes outside my body, and it would be suffering,\" Roberts said. The bill would grant some exceptions, including in cases involving a “spontaneous miscarriage” and procedures undertaken to save a mother's life \"when accompanied by reasonable steps, if available, to save the life of her unborn child\". But opponents say doctors would be too frightened by the proposal to provide that care even when necessary. They pointed to the cases -- reported by the investigative journalism outlet ProPublica -- of two women who died from delayed care tied to Georgia's abortion law after taking abortion pills. Doctors also noted that Georgia already has some of the nation's highest maternal mortality rates, especially for Black women. Lawmakers should focus on helping them get more care, opponents said. Doctors also said the bill sets the stage for the criminalisation of in vitro fertilisation and would force fertility clinics to close. The bill comes about a month after Georgia's House passed a bill with bipartisan support to protect the right to in vitro fertilisation in the state. That measure was sponsored by Statesboro Republican Rep Lehman Franklin, whose wife used IVF to conceive. Despite concerns from several doctors, Dunahoo responded that the bill would not interfere with access to in vitro fertilisation. But Karenne Fru, who runs a fertility clinic that provides in-vitro fertilisation, said the bill would put her out of work. “My whole life is doing God's work. He said go forth and procreate,” said Fru, her voice shaking. “I'm doing that. Please, just let me continue to do that. I cannot go to jail because I want to help people become parents.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

We will defend our companies. We will defend our country.”\nCarney said he needs to see the details of Trump’s executive order before taking retaliatory measures. He called it unjustified and said he will leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special cabinet committee on US relations.\nCarney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian car industry jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.\nVehicles are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries. “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said.\n\nTrump previously granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for US vehicle makers.\nThe US president has plunged the US into a global trade war – all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.\nThe Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its US consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021.\n“His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Carney said earlier while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada’s April 28 election.\nThe tax hike on vehicle imports starting in April means carmakers could face higher costs and lower sales.\nTrump previously put 25 per cent tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminium and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products – as well as all of America’s trading partners – on April 2.\n“He wants to break us so America can own us,” Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don’t look out for ourselves we look out for each other.”\nCarney, former two-time central banker, made the earlier comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest US-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25 per cent of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in car manufacturing.\nCarney said the bridge carries C$140 billion (US$98 billion) in goods every year and C$400 million (US$281 million) per day.\n“Now those numbers and the jobs and the pay cheques that depend on that are in question,” Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.”\n\nIn the vehicle sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-US border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said, whose province has the bulk of Canada’s car industry, said plants on both sides the border will shut simultaneously if the tariffs go ahead.\n“President is calling it Liberation Day. I call it Termination Day for American workers. I know President Trump likes tell people ’Your fired!” I didn’t think he meant US auto workers when he said it,” Ford said.\nTrump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbour and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians.\nThe new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still has not had a phone call with Trump. It is unusual for a US president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.\n“It would be appropriate that the president and I speak given the action that he has taken.

But Australia is much more preoccupied by threats of a different nature 25 years later, largely emanating from China. These include cyber attacks, economic coercion, political interference, and the harassment of Australian Defence Force (ADF) ships, aircraft and personnel.\n\nThough our international outlook has changed a lot over the past quarter century, Australia’s alliance with the US has remained a constant throughout. \n\nHowever, as our militaries have grown closer, the US-China competition has also intensified. Combined with the array of unpredictable and destabilising decisions coming from the second Trump administration, this closeness has caused some unease in Australia.\n\nEvolving threats and challenges\n\nIn December 2000, the Howard government released its first Defence White Paper. This marked the beginning of a period of major change in Australia’s international outlook and presence.\n\nIt emphasised that “two interrelated trends seem likely to shape our strategic environment most strongly – globalisation and US strategic primacy”. It also noted that “military operations other than conventional war [were] becoming more common.”\n\nThe paper was prescient in respect to China’s rise, as well. It said:\n\nThe United States is central to the Asia-Pacific security system […] It will be in Asia that the United States is likely to face the toughest issues in shaping its future strategic role – especially in its relationship with China.\n\nThere is a small but still significant possibility of growing and sustained confrontation between the major powers in Asia, and even of outright conflict. Australia’s interests could be deeply engaged in such a conflict, especially if it involved the United States.\n\nYet, nine months after that document’s release, the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, followed by the Bali bombings of 2002, began to dramatically reshape the global security outlook. \n\nA few days after the September 11 attack, Howard invoked the ANZUS Treaty for the first and only time, joinging US President George W. Bush’s “war on terror”. Australian forces then deployed to Afghanistan as part of the US-led invasion in October 2001.\n\nBy the time the 2003 Foreign Policy White Paper was released, it highlighted “terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional disorder and transnational crimes such as people smuggling” as the key features of Australia’s “more complex security environment”.\n\nA month later, Australia joined the US-led “coalition of the willing” to invade Iraq to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein and locate and destroy stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction believed to be there. (It later emerged that evidence of the existence of these weapons was erroneous.) \n\nAustralia contributed 2,000 troops to the mission. Our soldiers remained actively engaged in training, reconstruction and rehabilitation work in Iraq until July 2009.\n\nBoth of these events tied Australia’s foreign policy interests to the US to a greater degree than any time since the Vietnam War.\n\nAlthough the relationship with the US had been critical to Australian defence and foreign policy for decades, it had become less prominent in Australia’s strategic planning in the years following the end of the Cold War.\n\nUS support – and diplomatic pressure on Indonesia – had been vital in securing the post-referendum presence of Australian peacekeepers in East Timor in 1999. However, it was the “war on terror” that really re-centred the relationship as core to Australian foreign policy.\n\nIn fact, Australia was even referred to as the US’ “deputy sheriff” in the Asia-Pacific – a nickname used by Bush in 2003 that caused some unease at home and in the region.\n\nThis image has since gone on to have significant staying power, and it’s proved difficult for Australia to dislodge. \n\nHistory repeating?\n\nThough the accusations of war crimes levelled against Australian special forces in Afghanistan continue to reverberate, our foreign policy focus has shifted firmly back to our own region.\n\nThis change was driven in large part by the perceived threat posed by a rising China. While the need to focus more on China was acknowledged as early as the 2009 Defence White Paper, this emphasis became most pronounced under Scott Morrison’s leadership. \n\nThe 2024 National Defence Strategy portrayed Australia as facing “its most challenging strategic environment since the Second World War”. \n\nIt advocated for a significant change in the ADF’s strategic objectives and structure, noting the optimism of the 1990s had been “replaced by the uncertainty and tensions of entrenched and increasing strategic competition between the US and China”. \n\nToday, the military ties between the US and Australia are arguably as close as they have ever been. \n\nThe ADF operates top-tier US platforms like the F-35 combat aircraft, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft, M1 Abrams tanks, and AH-64 Apache helicopters. Defence Minister Richard Marles has gone so far as to say the ADF should not only interoperable with the US, but interchangeable.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Australia will also build and operate its own fleet of nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS partnership in the coming decades.\n\nAt the same time, US President Donald Trump’s “America First” positioning has made the US’ closest allies nervous. \n\nHis early moves have put paid to the notion that globalisation is the goal all major states are pursuing. In fact, some argue that deglobalisation may be taking hold as the US aggressively enacts tariffs against its allies, pursues economic onshoring and withdraws from key international bodies.\n\nThese actions have led to many to question whether Australia has become too dependent on its major ally and if we need to emphasise a more self-reliant defence posture. However, this is much easier said than done. \n\nLooking back, the year 2000 represented the beginning of a period of major change for Australian foreign policy. Such is the pace of change now, we may view 2025 in the same light in another quarter century. \n\nWhether Australia’s alliance with the US will face long-term harm is yet to be seen. No matter how the bilateral relationship may change, the Indo-Pacific region will continue to be at the core of Australia’s foreign policy outlook, much as it was at the turn of the century. \n\nThis piece is part of a series on how Australia has changed since the year 2000.

Three planes, however, landed and the immigrants were imprisoned.\n\nAdministration lawyers later refused to answer a number of questions from Boasberg about the flights, citing “state secrets.”\n\nA subsequent filing from administration attorneys instructed Boasberg to “be more respectful.” He later responded in a ruling calling the attorneys “intemperate and disrespectful,” noting he had never before been subjected to such an attitude by government lawyers in his court.","summary":"U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is clashin with the president over the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants, was assigned the new lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in Washington, D.C.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-james-boasberg-signal-lawsuit-b2722258.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/20/39/Trump-Deportations-jm3l0go4.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XgskyTvu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:41:56","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":304545962,"title":"‘Oligarchs’ wedding: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez invite Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump, Kim Kardashian","text":"As Americans begin crowding into Senator Bernie Sanders’ “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies, top “oligarch” Jeff Bezos and his flashy fiancée Lauren Sanchez are preparing for their glitzy Italian wedding this summer, which could prove to be the couple’s ultimate statement about the wealth, power and influence they hope to wield in American society under the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nNow, the couple seem set on enlisting some of America’s most popular celebrities in making such a statement, with TMZ reporting on the rich and glamorous A-listers who have made the guest list for what is shaping up to be the “ultra-luxe, ultra-exclusive” event of the year.\n\nSanchez’s “BFF” Eva Longoria made the guest list for the wedding of the billionaire Amazon founder and his soon-to-be-wife. So, too are Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, Gayle King, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Jewel.\n\nTMZ also reported that Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, made the cut, as did Ivanka Trump’s in-laws: Jared Kushner’s brother Joshua Kushner, and his supermodel wife Karlie Klaus.\n\nTMZ sources furthermore revealed that fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and her husband Barry Diller have been invited, which seems fair, given that the couple hosted a lavish, star-studded engagement party for Bezos and Sanchez at their Beverly Hills mansion in the fall. Others on the guest list include film producer Brian Grazer and models Brooks Nader and Camila Morrone.\n\nBut to some observers of the national mood, Winfrey, Longoria, Kardashian, Perry and the others could be accused of failing to “read the room,” oblivious to growing national anger against a growing oligarchy and America’s “move toward authoritarianism,” as Sanders said in a speech on the Senate floor in February.\n\nThe Vermont senator talked about the growing divide between two Americas, amid increasing income and wealth inequality. At the very top are the relatively few “oligarchs,” who include Bezos and other tech titans such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who view themselves as “modern-day kings” — which would make Sanchez a would-be “queen.”\n\nSanders said that together, Bezos, Musk and Zuckerberg are worth a combined $903 billion and own more than the bottom half of American society — $170 million.\n\n“What we NOW have is an ideology being pushed by the oligarchs which says that as very, very wealthy people — often self-made, often the masters of revolutionary new technology and as ‘high-IQ individuals,’ it is THEIR absolute right to rule,” Sanders said.\n\nWhen it comes to Bezos and Sanchez, they effectively embraced Trump’s leadership by participating in a pretty stunning bit of stagecraft at the polarizing new president’s inauguration, which arguably served both Trump’s interests and their own. They stood in an honored position in the U.S. Capitol with Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and other business leaders in what The Guardian called a display of the “oligarchy” and the powerful influence they expect “to wield” in Trump’s America.\n\nBezos and Sanchez has been especially demonstrative in being friendly with Trump — which should seem shocking and disturbing to their famous liberal friends. That is, unless they, too, want to be part of Bezos and Sanchez’s new in-crowd.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, the couple joined Musk for dinner with Donald and Melania Trump at Mar-a-Lago, with Trump boasting, “In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.” The night before Trump’s inauguration, Bezos and Sanchez also attended what Sanchez hailed as “a magical evening” — a candlelight dinner honoring Trump, where they got to schmooze with such MAGA figures as Musk and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nWinfrey, Longoria and Perry were among Bezos and Sanchez’s friends who were very outspoken in their opposition to Trump getting a second term — and the danger they said he posed to American democracy. While speaking at a campaign rally on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris, Winfrey warned that the country stood on “precipice of danger,” with Trump poised to usher in an authoritarian regime if elected. Meanwhile, Longoria has said that America would become such a “scary place” under Trump that she was happy to be living outside the United States.\n\nBut Winfrey may experience of serious case of “FOMO” if she turns down an invitation to Bezos’ and Sanchez’s wedding of the year. So, too, would Longoria, Perry, Gayle King and the morally flexible Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian.\n\nNotably, Longoria has shown a willingness to turn a blind eye to concerns expressed by Sanders and others that Bezos and his oligarchic brethren “will sacrifice, without hesitation, the well-being of working people to protect their privilege.”\n\nLast year, the longtime activist praised Bezos and Sanchez for their “courage and civility” after she received a $50 million prize from them, supposedly to be shared with nonprofits of her choice. Earlier this month, she included Sanchez in the “badass” women she celebrated in an Instagram post for International Women’s Day.\n\nMeanwhile, King and Perry are set to join Sanchez in another splashy PR opportunity, possibly before the splashy wedding: an all-female trip to space on one of Bezos’s Blue Origin rockets.","summary":"Others stars who could help Bezos and Sanchez use their wedding as a display of their wealth and cultural clout in Trump's America include Eva Longoria, Katy Perry and Gayle King.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/26/oligarchs-wedding-jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-celebrity-guest-list/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SanchezBezos1.jpg?w=1024&h=705","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 23:39:45","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.491}]}
