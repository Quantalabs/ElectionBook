The promise of AI bringing prosperity competes with the peril of AI enslaving humanity. Miracle cures are here, but they are no match for malignant variants. Rule of law prevails but flails like a toothless old crone against scams, lobbies and leaders. Peace prospects shine in Ukraine, but dark questions arise about a new, destructive war looming in Europe. Predicts German security expert Hanna Notte, 'Europe risks a self-fulfilling prophecy over the Russian threat.' European leaders predict an imminent Russian attack on a NATO country. Warns Mark Rutte, secretary general, 'We are Russia's next target. [We] must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured.' Richard Knighton, the UK's defence chief, urged British youth to prepare for war should Russia attack Britain. Germany's defence minister Boris Pistorius invoked the nostalgia of a tranquil bygone era, 'We already had our last summer of peace.' Cold War jargon resurrects from the European deep freeze: Revanchist Russia, Red Scare, Bolsheviks, Broken Arrow—all zigzag low and loose but fail to hit target: the European public. So far, they are unimpressed by the scaremongering. The euphoric European propaganda, early in the Ukraine war, convinced people that Ukraine was winning and Russia losing, with its clunky tanks squashed like dead toads on a highway. Public perception solidified that the Russian military is no match for NATO—proclaimed the most powerful military alliance in world history. To pivot now and believe that Russia is a well-equipped mortal enemy is a big ask. Besides, Russian attacks aren't new. Their hybrid war in Europe is decades old. But predictions of full-fledged war legitimise the ongoing rearming of Europe's military-industrial complex, which contributed to much destruction during the World Wars, and which had shrunk thereafter as Europe invested in infrastructure and public welfare. Military spending is now accelerating, especially in Germany, Italy, Britain and France. While GDP figures swell, citizens face funding cuts to municipalities, safety, health care programmes and reel under an affordability crisis—aggravated by the Ukraine war. Europe's rising war rhetoric is triggered by worry—about Russia and an unreliable US: Donald Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin, his impatience to end the Ukraine war, his public condemnation of Europe's liberal governments and praise for Europe's 'patriotic' far right. It bothers liberal Europe that the increasingly popular, pro-Kremlin far-right groups' narrative that Russia has a right to defend itself against NATO enlargement is gaining mainstream momentum. Russia, frequently, unfurls its brutality and perfidy. Yet, events from the 19th century onwards show a pattern of European disdain for Russia's security concerns. Russia is seen as 'revanchist'—a vengeful, expansionist power under Tsarist, Soviet and post-USSR regimes. Independent western scholars say the problem is not Russian ideology, but Europe's refusal to recognise Russia as a legitimate, equal security actor. Europe's Russophobia stems partly from Russia's huge landmass sprawled across Europe and Asia. Size matters. Further Russian expansion is unacceptable, so it must be contained. That was western strategy. It still is. History repeats. Prophecies come true. From Greek myths to Star Wars, in legend and in life, the cruel irony is that the very actions taken—like rearmament—to avoid self-fulfilling prophecies, lead to its unfolding. An apt New Year resolution is to stop repeating the ancient Roman dictum: 'If you want peace, prepare for war.' History shows preparation, like self-fulfilling prophecies, invariably leads exactly to what it wishes to avoid—war.

So it should come as little surprise when there's a major question about both the league and John Harbaugh, the leader of the free world is going to have an opinion. And he's going to make that opinion known to millions of people. Trump Wants Giants Hiring Trump So the decision from the Oval Office is in: Trump wants the New York Giants to hire the recently fired Harbaugh. \"Without question,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account Saturday afternoon. And he doesn't want Harbaugh hedging on a choice. He wants Harbaugh to accept the Giants' coaching vacancy. Sorry, Dolphins, Falcons, everybody else. Harbaugh, it should be known, has options. And so do the Giants. Trump Wants Harbaugh Taking The Job Harbaugh is spending this weekend deciding on three or four teams he believes to be a fit for him. He intends to study their overall rosters, ownership, and quarterback situation. And then he's expected to begin taking interview requests next week. The Giants have been in contact, as have the Miami Dolphins, Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns and others. Trump doesn't care about that list. Trump commands special forces that can fry your little lists with secret weaponry. The President wants Harbaugh in New Jersey. \"Take the job!!!\" he wrote. No Delay From Giants, President Demands The Giants, who fired head coach Brian Daboll during the season, have already interviewed former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, former Falcons coach Raheem Morris, Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph (via zoom), Broncos special teams coach Darren Rizzi (via zoom), interim coach Mike Kafka, and former Raiders coach Antonio Pierce. They're expected to speak with former Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy and Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. Giants general manager Joe Schoen, who is leading the search for the club, has been busy. Yeah, um, Trump doesn't care about that. Harbaugh is your guy, Trump believes. Trump Hosted Harbaugh Family Trump has been on this issue for some time now. He posted earlier this week that somebody, anybody, should hire Harbaugh immediately because he considers the coach to be outstanding. Trump hosted both Jim Harbaugh and John Harbaugh at the White House before the 2025 NFL season began. So here are the questions that loom: Does Trump know something about Harbaugh's mindset and is thus trying to convince him to take the job? Does Trump sense the Giants, which definitely value Harbaugh as their top candidate prior to the interview, sense any delay coming from the team? This should all play out in the next week. And it's a good bet the President will continue to chime in.","summary":"President Donald Trump endorses John Harbaugh for New York Giants coaching job on Truth Social, urging the recently fired coach to &apos;take the job&apos; amid the team&apos;s ongoing search.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/president-donald-trump-wants-john-harbaugh-coaching-new-york-giants","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2026/01/gettyimages-2248260304.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 22:20:15","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.141},{"id":392267480,"title":"Iran’s military vows to “vigorously protect” the nation amidst surge in protests","text":"On Saturday night, protesters surged back onto the streets of Iran, voicing their discontent with chants directed against the government. In response, Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards issued a stark warning, declaring the maintenance of national security a “red line”. The military echoed this sentiment, pledging to “vigorously protect” the country against any forces seeking to undermine order and peace.\n\nEscalation in Tehran\n\nThe capital city, Tehran, reverberated with anti-government slogans throughout Saturday night. Despite a deadly crackdown by authorities and widespread internet blackouts, demonstrators persisted, fuelling what has become the largest protest movement against the Islamic republic in over three years.\n\nUnprecedented Challenge to the Regime\n\nThe protests, which have continued for two weeks, represent one of the most significant challenges Iran’s theocratic rulers have faced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Nevertheless, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has remained defiant, attributing the unrest to interference from the United States.\n\nInternational Involvement and Statements\n\nOn Saturday, US President Donald Trump stated that America was “ready to help” the protest movement. His remarks followed a warning issued on Friday, in which he claimed Iran was in “big trouble.” Trump also reaffirmed the possibility of new military action, referencing Washington’s support for Israel during its 12-day conflict with Iran in June.\n\n“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nOrigins and Evolution of the Protests\n\nThe demonstrations initially erupted due to acute economic hardship but have since evolved into calls demanding the removal of the country’s clerical leadership.\n\nOn Saturday, crowds once again gathered in northern Tehran, lighting fireworks and banging pots while chanting slogans in support of the ousted monarchy. This was documented in video footage verified by AFP.\n\nProtest Tactics and Government Crackdown\n\nAdditional videos circulating on social media—though not immediately verified by AFP—revealed further demonstrations across the capital, with protesters repeating anti-government slogans. Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s deposed shah, encouraged Iranians to organise more targeted protests over the weekend, following mass demonstrations on Friday. In a video posted on social media, Pahlavi declared, “Our aim is no longer just gathering in the streets; we intend to get ready to seize and hold city centres.”\n\nAfter the protests began on 28 December, Iranian authorities initially called for “restraint” and promised to address grievances. However, as unrest persisted, officials adopted a harsher stance. Rights groups raised concerns that the authorities were intensifying a deadly crackdown during a 48-hour internet blackout. This was reported by the monitoring group Netblocks.\n\nReports of Violence and Casualties\n\nAmnesty International reported it is examining claims of increased use of lethal force by security forces against protesters since Thursday. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights organisation stated that at least 51 people have lost their lives during the crackdown, cautioning that the actual toll may be higher. The group also released images purporting to show victims of the protests at Alghadir hospital in eastern Tehran, further substantiating reports of excessive and deadly force. Verified AFP footage additionally showed crowds in Tehran’s Saadatabad district chanting anti-government slogans, with vehicles signalling their support.\n\nOfficial Response and International Reactions\n\nIranian authorities have reported the deaths of several security personnel during the ongoing unrest. Supreme Leader Khamenei has blamed “vandals” and accused the United States of encouraging the disturbances. State television broadcast funerals for fallen officers and aired footage of buildings, including a mosque, set ablaze. The Iranian army reiterated its commitment to defending national interests against those disrupting public order.\n\nInternational leaders, including EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, have called on Iranian authorities to exercise restraint and have condemned violence against protesters. Internet disruptions have impacted daily life in Tehran, with one resident characterising it as “the price to pay before the victory of the people.”","summary":"On Saturday night, protesters surged back onto the streets of Iran, voicing their discontent with chants directed against the government.

In a defiant joint statement, Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and the island’s political leaders shut down Trump’s threats with the clear message: “We don’t want to be Americans, we don’t want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders.” The intervention came after Trump ramped up his rhetoric on Friday, claiming he was “going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" insisting the vast island was a US “national security priority.\" Nielsen pushed back strongly, saying Greenland’s future could only be decided by its own people. He said: “Greenland’s future must be decided by the Greenlandic people.” Prime Minister Nielsen added: “As Greenlandic party leaders, we would like to emphasise once again our wish that the United States’ contempt for our country ends. “No other country can meddle in this. We must decide our country’s future ourselves – without pressure to make a hasty decision, without procrastination, and without interference from other countries.” Trump has repeatedly claimed the US needs Greenland to prevent rival powers stepping in, previously warning: “We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not. Because if we don’t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland – and we’re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbour.” The US President went on to say: “I would like to make a deal the easy way. But if we don’t do it the easy way, we’re gonna do it the hard way.” Trump has doubled down on his desire to acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory, saying he needs the island “from the standpoint of national security,\" the Sun reports . Speaking on Friday, Trump said: “I’m a fan of Denmark…but, you know, the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn’t mean that they own the land.” The escalating rhetoric has sparked alarm in Europe, with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that any US military move on Greenland would mark the “end of the Nato alliance”. It lead to Trump responding: \"If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have a Nato right now.” It has also emerged that Trump’s team has discussed offering Greenlanders huge cash incentives to back independence, with reports suggesting lump sums of between $10,000 and $100,000 per person. Such a move could cost Washington around $5.7billion in an attempt to win over the island’s 57,000 residents. Despite talk of buying the territory, Trump has refused to rule out military action, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the US is seeking a “peaceful” solution and has played down invasion fears. European leaders have rallied behind Denmark, with France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Britain and Denmark all voicing support for Greenland. Conservative Danish MP Rasmus Jarlov said allied troops should be welcomed so “that the price of a military invasion for the Americans would be extremely high”. While left-wing leader Pelle Dragsted warned: “We must make it clear that it would be an armed conflict.” Denmark has also confirmed its long-standing military doctrine would apply in the event of an invasion, requiring troops to open fire immediately without waiting for orders. While the US already has more than 100 personnel stationed at its Pituffik base in north-west Greenland, polls show overwhelming opposition to Trump’s ambitions. Around 85 per cent of Greenlanders have rejected becoming part of the US, while only seven per cent of Americans support the idea of a military takeover. Despite Trump’s insistence, Greenland’s message remains crystal clear... that it will decide its own future.","summary":"After recent comments from US President Donald Trump about his need for Greenland, the country's Prime Minister had hit back with seven words of defiance","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/greenlands-defiant-seven-word-statement-36531659","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36531656.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-VENEZUELA-POLITICS-CONFLICT-OILjpgarning.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 22:07:13","author":"Sean McPolin","authors":["Sean McPolin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":392266452,"title":"US launches new retaliatory strikes against ISIS in Syria after deadly ambush","text":"WASHINGTON — The U.S. has launched another round of retaliatory strikes against the Islamic State in Syria following last month's ambush that killed two U.S. soldiers and one American civilian interpreter in the country.\n\nThe large-scale strikes, conducted by the U.S. alongside partner forces, occurred around 12:30 p.m. ET, according to U.S. Central Command.

The tide has gone out and we can now see that the UK military was not wearing any trunks.”\n\nIt comes as a debate is set to be held next week in the Commons on the beleaguered Ajax heavy army project with the government likely to come under pressure to ditch it after continued failures after around £6bn spent on its development.\n\nMeanwhile, another Policy Exchange report earlier in the week from another retired air marshall, Lord Stirrup, outlined how the UK had become too reliant on possessing nuclear weapons for deterrence which he warned was not scaring Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe former chief of the defence staff warned the UK has been hamstrung by an “outdated nuclear doctrine” and needs to recognise that deterrence relies “on a spectrum of capabilities, not just nuclear weapons themselves”.\n\nIt came as Sir Richard Shirreff, who served as Nato's deputy supreme allied commander in Europe between 2011 and 2014, said allied forces would need at least 50,000 troops in Ukraine to deter an attack from Russia while the army currently has less than 75,000 personnel.\n\nMeanwhile, former defence secretary Gavin Williamson warned that a token number would not be enough and said that the UK would need an equivalent of “the army of the Rhine” of more than 40,000 stationed in West Germany after the Second World War as a Cold War deterrent.\n\nWith Donald Trump looking to pull out of European defence and even threatening a NATO ally Denmark over Greenland, Air Marshal Stringer warned the UK had become too reliant on America and not its own sovereign capabilities.\n\nHe said: “During the period of American-policed 'Rules-Based International Order', we increasingly relied on borrowing off the Americans while making cuts to vital capabilities. The optics of occasional tactical excellence obscured the increasingly hollow nature of our sovereign capacity.\n\n“But now the USA is signalling strongly that it is putting 'America First' and the rest of NATO will have to look after its own defences. This fundamentally challenges the model that we had semi-accidentally slipped into: our national defences have been revealed to be a flimsy facade. The tide has gone out and we can now see that the UK military was not wearing any trunks.”\n\nWarning of a huge gap between what politicians claim on defence spending and the reality of the UK’s relative military weakness, he went on: “The Say-Do gap between the image of ourselves we have come to believe - and the reality of the hard power we can project in practice, is stark. The first necessary step is to recognise that, and recognise that the methods that got us into this mess have to be discarded ruthlessly.” \n\n “The paper argues that whilst the government has been voluble in resetting the narrative of decline in our defence capacity, the reality is that neither spending nor front-line capabilities have kept pace with the rhetoric. Target dates in the 2030s are far too late, and such assurance are neither reassuring our allies our impressing our adversaries.\n\n“The government's procurement agencies have not absorbed the Government’s message on the seriousness of the times and the threats we now face, and the 'business as usual' ticks along, promising to be better by the 2030s while troubled programmes such as Ajax absorb billions for equipment that simply doesn’t work.”\n\nAn MoD spokesperson said: “This government is delivering the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War - with a £5bn boost this year and hitting 2.6 per cent of GDP by 2027, a level not seen since 2010. This will see over £270 billion invested into defence across this parliament, meaning no return to the hollowed out and underfunded armed forces of the past. \n\n“The government is also bolstering the UK’s readiness and resilience, signing over 1,000 major contracts since the election, building at least six state-of-the art munitions and energetics factories this parliament, and implementing at pace the recommendations in the Strategic Defence Review.\"","summary":"In a damning report for the thinktank Policy Exchange, retired Air Marshall Edward Stringer says increased defence spending is not preventing the UK’s military from shrinking","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/defence-spending-mod-overdraft-ukraine-b2898061.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/04/12/14/38GpPO-OFFICIAL-20180927-162-219.jpg.iCe_1qjSMWATAA.Fr-utAFLf5.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/RO9aiRPs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-10 22:00:37","author":"David Maddox","authors":["David Maddox"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":392268824,"title":"EE.UU. sostuvo “conversaciones preliminares” sobre posible ataque a Irán, asegura el Wall Street Journal","text":"LIMA, Perú – El Gobierno de Estados Unidos sostuvo este sábado “conversaciones preliminares” sobre posibles planes para atacar Irán, informó The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFuentes consultadas por el medio estadounidense aseguran que durante la cita se habló sobre qué sitios deberían ser atacados si, en efecto, se realizara la operación.

On Wednesday, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis in her vehicle, and on Thursday US Border Patrol shot a man and a woman in a car in Portland. \n\n“The murder of Renée Nicole Good has sparked outrage in all of us,” Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, one of the organizations spearheading the nationwide demonstrations, told Mother Jones. “Her death, and the horrific nature of it, was a turning point and a call to all of us to stand up against ICE’s inhumane and lawless operations that have already killed dozens before Renee.” \n\nThe weekend protests are happening or poised to happen in blue cities like New York and Chicago, as well as Republican strongholds like Lubbock, Texas, and Danville, Kentucky. \n\nThe demonstrations are being organized by the ICE Out For Good Coalition, which in addition to Indivisible, includes groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Voto Latino, and United We Dream. \n\n“For a full year, Trump’s masked agents have been abducting people off the streets, raiding schools, libraries, and churches,” Katie Bethell, the civic action executive director for MoveOn, another organization in the coalition, said. “None of us want to live in a country where federal agents with guns are lurking and inciting violence at schools and in our communities.”\n\nAccording to tracking from The Guardian, 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025—the most of any year in more than two decades. \n\nAdditionally, The Trace reports that since June 2025, there have been 16 incidents in which immigration agents opened fire and another 15 incidents in which agents held someone at gunpoint. The outlet writes that, in these incidents, four people were killed and seven injured. The Trace noted that the number of incidents involving guns could likely be higher, “as shootings involving immigration agents are not always publicly reported.”\n\nSince Wednesday, an already tense situation in Minneapolis—and in other cities—boiled over. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, officers on the scene met protesters with chemical irritants. In the days since, border patrol agents outside the Whipple Building in Minneapolis have used violent tactics against protesters, including using chemical agents on demonstrators. \n\nOnline, some videos show escalating moments between immigration agents and those resisting them. In one instance, a border patrol agent is seen telling multiple women sitting in cars in Minneapolis: “Don’t make a bad decision today.” The women were seemingly attempting to interrupt immigration agents by taking up road space. \n\nThe coalition hosting the protests said in its list of stated goals that the groups hope to “Demand accountability, transparency, and an immediate investigation into the killing of Renee Nicole Good,” “Build public pressure on elected officials and federal agencies,” and “Call for ICE to leave our communities,” among other aims. \n\nThese are just the latest protests to take over cities since President Donald Trump was sworn in for the second time. In April, it was the “Hands Off!” protest against Trump and Elon Musk’s gutting of government spending and firing of federal workers. Months later, in October, the “No Kings” demonstrations sought to call out Trump’s growing, often unchecked executive power. According to organizers, each saw millions of protesters. And now, only the second weekend of the new year, people are once again angry and outside. \n\n“The shootings in Minneapolis and Portland were not the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, but they need to be the end,” Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer with the ACLU, said. “These tragedies are simply proof of one fact: the Trump administration and its federal agents are out of control, endangering our neighborhoods, and trampling on our rights and freedom. This weekend Americans all across the country are demanding that they stop.”","summary":"Scores of people are once again taking to their streets this weekend to protest the Trump administration’s ongoing offensive against immigrants and those who attempt to stand up for them.

Banks are making the argument that such a plan would most hurt poor people, at a time of economic concern, by curtailing or eliminating credit lines, driving them to high-cost alternatives like payday loans or pawnshops.“We will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Researchers who studied Trump’s campaign pledge after it was first announced found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back.About 195 million people in the United States had credit cards in 2024 and were assessed $160 billion in interest charges, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says. Americans are now carrying more credit card debt than ever, to the tune of about $1.23 trillion, according to figures from the New York Federal Reserve for the third quarter last year.RELATED STORY | Could your holiday generosity wreck your credit score?Further, Americans are paying, on average, between 19.65% and 21.5% in interest on credit cards according to the Federal Reserve and other industry tracking sources. That has come down in the past year as the central bank lowered benchmark rates, but is near the highs since federal regulators started tracking credit card rates in the mid-1990s. That’s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.The Republican administration has proved particularly friendly until now to the credit card industry.Capital One got little resistance from the White House when it finalized its purchase and merger with Discover Financial in early 2025, a deal that created the nation’s largest credit card company. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is largely tasked with going after credit card companies for alleged wrongdoing, has been largely nonfunctional since Trump took office.In a joint statement, the banking industry was opposed to Trump's proposal.“If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the American Bankers Association and allied groups said.Bank lobbyists have long argued that lowering interest rates on their credit card products would require the banks to lend less to high-risk borrowers. When Congress enacted a cap on the fee that stores pay large banks when customers use a debit card, banks responded by removing all rewards and perks from those cards. Debit card rewards only recently have trickled back into consumers' hands. For example, United Airlines now has a debit card that gives miles with purchases.RELATED STORY | Credit cards could get cheaper, but also more limited, under proposed swipe fee settlementThe U.S. already places interest rate caps on some financial products and for some demographics. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active-duty service members more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.Credit card companies earn three streams of revenue from their products: fees charged to merchants, fees charged to customers and the interest charged on balances. The argument from some researchers and left-leaning policymakers is that the banks earn enough revenue from merchants to keep them profitable if interest rates were capped.\"A 10% credit card interest cap would save Americans $100 billion a year without causing massive account closures, as banks claim. That’s because the few large banks that dominate the credit card market are making absolutely massive profits on customers at all income levels,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, who wrote the research on the industry's impact of Trump's proposal last year.There are some historic examples that interest rate caps do cut off the less creditworthy to financial products because banks are not able to price risk correctly. Arkansas has a strictly enforced interest rate cap of 17% and evidence points to the poor and less creditworthy being cut out of consumer credit markets in the state. Shearer's research showed that an interest rate cap of 10% would likely result in banks lending less to those with credit scores below 600.The White House did not respond to questions about how the president seeks to cap the rate or whether he has spoken with credit card companies about the idea.Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., who said he talked with Trump on Friday night, said the effort is meant to “lower costs for American families and to reign in greedy credit card companies who have been ripping off hardworking Americans for too long.\"Legislation in both the House and the Senate would do what Trump is seeking.Sens.

What I’m not hearing is too much optimism that there will be justice in this case,” Rapalo said, referring to Good’s killing.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who demanded that ICE leave the city after the deadly incident, said on Saturday that 29 people had been arrested overnight as police responded to continued protests.\n\nFrey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who damage property or endanger others will be arrested.\n\nMinneapolis ​Police ‌Chief Brian O’Hara said one police officer ‌was injured ‌during the ⁠protest response.\n\nMeanwhile, three US lawmakers representing Minnesota attempted to tour an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on Saturday morning but were told to leave after initially being allowed to enter.\n\nUS Congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.\n\n“They do not care that they are violating federal law,” Craig said after being turned away.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/we-have-to-stand-up-ice-killing-in-minneapolis-sparks-protests-across-us/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-10T181846Z_1211331611_RC2IYIAVZTHX_RTRMADP_3_USA-MIGRATION-PROTESTS-WASHINGTON-1768070876-yksiNC.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 19:27:19","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":392262500,"title":"America's backyard war: Global lawlessness looms, aiding rival powers","text":"TOKYO -- At first, U.S. President Donald Trump seemed genuinely intent on securing a place in history as a formidable peacemaker, remembered for a remarkable record of conflict resolution.

We further demand that the UK Government dissociate itself from these acts and likewise demand this rampage stops.\n\n“The failure of US allies to oppose these acts has emboldened Trump to threaten numerous other governments in North and South America, and even to threaten Nato member Denmark over Greenland, which the US Government asserts it wishes to take over.\n\n“The spineless collusion of our Government in this naked imperialism is aiding and abetting Trump.\n\n“In Scotland, John Swinney has acknowledged the illegality of these acts, but pledged no action.\n\n“It’s time for the Scottish Government to end its trade talks with the US until aggression ceases and international law is complied with.\n\n“Failure to confront Trump today will mean threats continue to multiply.

I would like to make a deal, the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\n\n“I’m a big fan of Denmark, they’ve been very nice to me. But the fact they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn’t mean they own the land. I’m sure we had lots of boats go there also.”\n\nThe issue has shocked NATO allies with U.K. prime minister Sir Keir Starmer speaking twice to the president about it in a bid to persuade him to back off his demands.\n\nWhen it was put to Rose that Denmark and Greenland are not going to be cooperative because of the international backlash to Trump’s threats, he replied: “That's quite possible.”\n\nHe went on: “I've worked with Danes for 25 years of my career. They are wonderful allies. They have shed blood for the United States in Afghanistan. These people are good allies. \n\n“You know, you really don't want to upset your friends for no reason. Sometimes you need to upset your friends. Okay, that's just, that's life. This is not one of those situations where we need to upset our friends to get what we need.\n\n“I say this, as someone who's actually negotiated with the Danes and the Greenland Home Rule government back in 2003/ 2004 to enhance the security of the United States, I understand how important Greenland is.”\n\nAs a a junior staffer at the Pentagon working on missile defense, he was responsible for working with the Danish government and the Greenland Home Rule government to allow them to upgrade the radar as part of the homeland missile defense mission.\n\nHe said the radar “is really critical with regards to our ability to protect the East Coast of the United States from long range missile threats from North Korea and potentially Iran.”\n\nIt is also critical to track missiles in space or ones fired over the poles by Russia or China.\n\nThe United States occupied Greenland during the Second World War after Denmark fell to Nazi Germany and then the treaty of 1951 meant that they could station whatever military they wanted afterwards.\n\n“So Trump absolutely right about the strategic importance of Greenland, but fundamentally, under the 1951 Defense of Greenland Treaty, we basically have wide latitude to deploy additional troops as needed,” Rose said. \n\n“We have all the legal rights necessary to do what we need to do. This is Donald Trump. He gets many of these, the fundamental issues right, but it's how he goes about it. And I wish somebody on the National Security Council or the State Department was telling him that we can do whatever we need to do there.”","summary":"Exclusive: Obama’s former assistant secretary of state Frank Rose was the last U.S. official to negotiate a defence deal with Denmark and the Greenland Home Rule administration.

This afternoon, I chaired a further meeting with the water companies, and local resilience forums to restore supplies as quickly as possible, prioritising vulnerable customers and essential public services.\n'Action by this Government means compensation rates have increased for customers and businesses affected by disruption.\n'It underlines why this Government is prioritising investment in infrastructure to improve the resilience of our water system.'\nForecasters also warned that a dangerous combination of melting snow and heavy rain could significantly increase flood risks in the coming days.\nSnowfall totals already recorded include 15cm at Lake Vyrnwy in Powys and 7cm at Preston Montford in Shropshire and Nottingham.\n\nIn Scotland, 27cm was recorded at Altnaharra in Sutherland, 26cm at Loch Glascarnoch and 22cm at Durris in Kincardineshire.\nThe heaviest rainfall was logged in Cornwall, with 61.8mm at Colliford Dam, followed by 57mm at Ddolwen Bridge in Dyfed and 54mm at White Barrow in Devon.\nThe latest warnings come after police earlier hit out at Instagram-loving tourists for their 'ridiculous parking' on a snow-covered Welsh mountain.\nHordes of visitors descended on Snowdonia in North Wales to capture images of the winter wonderland, despite police urging motorists not to abandon vehicles on icy mountain roads.\nNorth Wales Police warned that drivers were putting others at risk of 'serious' injury and 'pushing them into the paths of oncoming vehicles'.

A widespread risk of ice is also expected to cause disruption.\nA separate yellow warning for ice covers large parts of England and Wales until midday on Saturday as partially thawed snow refreezes, alongside wintry showers and freezing fog.\nIn Northern Ireland, a yellow warning for snow and ice runs until 11am on Saturday, with icy patches and hill snow expected.\nAnother yellow warning will be in force from 2am until 3pm on Sunday for much of Scotland, the East and West Midlands, North-East and North-West England and Yorkshire.

It will be a widely cold day, with frost lingering across parts of the country.\n'Sunday will start dry in the East, but cloud and rain already present in the West will move steadily eastwards.\n'The rain will fall as snow inland across the North Midlands and areas further North. However, temperatures will rise through the day, meaning the snow will become increasingly confined to higher ground by the afternoon.\n'It will be windy for all, with coastal gales and the potential for severe gales in the north west later in the day.\n'The unsettled but increasingly milder theme continues into next week, with persistent rain at times in northern and western areas, along with strong to gale force winds. However, it will feel much milder than recently, with temperatures returning to near-normal values.'\nWalesMet OfficeStorm Goretti\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritain could be hit with a foot of snow tomorrow as Met Office issues amber warning amid fears of flooding - as country counts the cost from deadly Storm Goretti\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 125\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The protesters appeared to be taking encouragement from repeated declarations of support by the Trump administration, and by the country's exiled crown prince, who called on them Saturday to try and overwhelm security forces and seize towns and cities. An external rights group that relies on information from contacts inside Iran says at least 65 people have been killed in the protests, which began in Tehran in late December as anger over Iran's ailing economy, but quickly spread and morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in years.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused President Trump of having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" in remarks aired Friday on Iranian state TV, as supporters gathered before him shouted \"Death to America!\"Protesters are \"ruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\" the 86-year-old Khamenei said to the crowd at his compound in Tehran. \"Because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\"State media later called the demonstrators \"terrorists,\" setting the stage for a possible violent crackdown – how Iran has responded to other major protests in recent years, despite Mr. Trump's pledge to back peaceful protesters, with force if necessary. On Saturday, Iran's attorney general warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. Trump issues fresh warnings to Iran's leadersMr. Trump has repeatedly pledged to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that has taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's former President Nicolás Maduro. He issued a message of support to protestors on Saturday afternoon. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP,\" he wrote on Truth Social. A day earlier, Mr. Trump said that any possible American strike wouldn't \"mean boots on the ground but that means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"\"Iran's in big trouble,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.\"He added, \"I tell the Iranian leaders you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too.\"In a brief social media post published in the very early hours of Saturday morning in Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"the United States supports the brave people of Iran.\"Iranian regime warns protesters will be punished \"without any legal leniency\"Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \"will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\"According to the Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which was founded by anti-regime activists, as of Friday, the 13th day of unrest in Iran, at least 65 people had been killed, including at least 14 members of the security forces. More than 2,300 people had been arrested, and protests were recorded in at least 180 cities.Iranian authorities shut down the internet on Thursday night as protests escalated sharply, seemingly as people heeded a call by the exiled crown prince, a vocal opposition figure, for Iranians to raise their voices against the regime.According to an update posted online Saturday morning by the monitoring organization NetBlocks, \"metrics show the nationwide internet blackout remains in place at 36 hours, severely limiting Iranians' ability to check on the safety of friends and loved ones.\"That communications blackout has made it incredibly difficult to gain a clear picture of the scale of the protests overall – and the Iranian authorities' response to it. Some other reports put the death toll from unrest much higher, with TIME citing a doctor in Tehran as saying at least 217 people had been killed, for instance. Iranian authorities have acknowledged a few deaths, but usually only those of security forces.A doctor and medic at two hospitals in Iran told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed with injuries. The doctor said a Tehran eye hospital had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital who said the facility did not have enough surgeons to handle the influx of patients. The medic claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes. Asked by CBS News how seriously he believes Iran's autocratic rulers are taking the warnings from Mr. Trump not to kill protesters, Maziar Bahari, editor of the IranWire news website, said he was certain it had \"really scared many Iranian officials, and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors.\"\"But at the same time ... it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" said Bahari, who spent months in Iranian prisons after being arrested during a previous round of massive unrest in 2009.\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" Bahari told CBS News' Haley Ott. \"And we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the movement. But a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution. But we don't have that leader.\"But while decades of draconian control over the media and the deliberate sidelining of dissident voices in the country have deprived Iran of a clear opposition figurehead inside the country's borders, many in the vast Iranian diaspora hope the nation's ousted royal family could stage a comeback.Online videos contradict state media Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the \"Epic of Khorramshahr\" by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year, honors Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.Meanwhile, state television reported that \"peace prevailed in most cities of the country\" overnight, with \"no news of any gathering or chaos in Tehran and most provinces.\" That was directly contradicted by an online video verified by the Associated Press that showed demonstrations in Tehran's Saadat Abad area. Thousands gathered in the street, and one man could be heard chanting \"Death to Khamenei!\" The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and one of the few media outlets able to publish to the outside world, released surveillance camera footage of what it said came from demonstrations in Isfahan. In it, a protester appeared to fire a long gun, while others set fires and threw gasoline bombs at what appeared to be a government compound.The Young Journalists' Club, associated with state TV, reported that protesters killed three members of the Guard's all-volunteer Basij force in the city of Gachsaran. It also reported a security official was stabbed to death in Hamadan province, a police officer was killed in the port city of Bandar Abbas, and another in Gilan, as well as one person was slain in Mashhad.State television also aired footage of a funeral service attended by hundreds in Qom, a Shiite seminary city just south of Tehran.Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.Head of Iran's exiled royal family predicts his return is \"very near\"Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has been seen by many analysts as a galvanizing force behind the momentum of this round of protests. On Saturday, he called on Iranians not only to continue coming out into the streets, but to try to seize control of towns and cities from the authorities by overwhelming them. \"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in his latest video message posted on social media, calling for more demonstrations on Saturday and Sunday.\"Striking an optimistic tone, Pahlavi declared that he was \"preparing to return to my homeland,\" suggesting the day on which he would be able to do so was \"very near.\"But Pahlavi has lived in exile for nearly 50 years, and while he has long sought to position himself as a leader-in-waiting, it's far from clear how much real support he has inside the country.His father, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was widely despised inside Iran when he fled into exile himself amid street protests in 1979, as the Islamic Revolution that brought the current regime to power took hold. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.","summary":"As Iran's exiled crown prince predicts his imminent return, the Islamic Republic shirks Trump's warnings and threatens protesters with maximum punishment.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-protests-deaths-mount-trump-warning-pahlavi-calls-for-city-takeovers/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/10/ddbda20e-80a2-4cc3-893c-444ee0a9a13b/thumbnail/1200x630g8/2d0e2598bd56ef07d6471d0da9cb8a6c/iran-protest-tehran-fire.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 18:34:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":392269006,"title":"Trump says US needs to &#039;own&#039; Greenland to prevent Russia and China from taking it | Barbados","text":"President Donald Trump says the US needs to “own” Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so.\n\n“Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don’t defend leases. And we’ll have to defend Greenland,” Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.\n\nWe will do it “the easy way” or “the hard way”, he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.\n\nIn a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland’s party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the “US’s disregard for our country to end”.\n\n“We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,” they said. “The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nDespite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland’s location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.\n\nThe US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was “covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place”.\n\nThe US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland’s north-western tip – a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.\n\nUnder existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.\n\nBut speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough.\n\n“Countries can’t make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,” he said, adding that they had to have ownership.\n\n“I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,” Trump said. “But I don’t want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.”\n\n“And by the way Nato’s got to understand that,” the US president added.\n\nDenmark’s Nato allies – major European countries as well as Canada – have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that “only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations”.\n\nStressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, “collectively”.\n\nThey also called for “upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders”.\n\nConcerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump’s use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.\n\nIn recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland’s natural resources – including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron – which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.

Why the hell don't the Danes lease them Greenland for a hundred years?\n\n'I think it's really important that we look at this, not in terms of, \"Gosh, isn't Trump doing dreadful stuff?\" It's about European security and the safety of the area in which we live.'\n\nSir Richard added that he believes the Danish could 'make concessions', which would be a 'big plus for Europe's security'. \n\nThe ex-MI6 chief cited the US's purchase of Alaska from Russia as well as Louisiana from France in the 19th Century as 'precedents'. \n\nWhen asked if he believed it would be positive if the US president annexed Greenland, he said 'definitely'. \n\n'It makes the Northern approach a hell of a lot safer for all Europeans, and it keeps the Chinese out too, which is also massively important,' he added.\n\nIt comes as Sir Keir was frantically trying to persuade Trump that NATO can defend the Arctic without a US takeover of Greenland.\n\nEuropean leaders have backed Denmark in a dispute with the US, which threatens to tear the Nato alliance apart.\n\nThe Prime Minister held calls with the Danish leader and the head of NATO before speaking to the US president for the second time in two days.\n\nDowning Street said Sir Keir had attempted to persuade Trump that Europe was defending the Arctic, but did eventually concede that more could be done. It said the leaders had 'discussed Euro-Atlantic security and agreed on the need to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia in the High North'.\n\nA statement added: 'European allies had stepped up in recent months to defend Euro-Atlantic interests, but more could be done to protect the area, the Prime Minister said.'\n\nIn a day of intensive diplomacy, the PM spoke to Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, who previously said if the US chooses to attack another Nato country militarily, 'then everything stops'.\n\nHowever, both agreed: 'NATO should step up in the area to protect Euro-Atlantic interests.' Nato secretary General Mark Rutte agreed with Sir Keir that 'more needed to be done to deter Russia in the High North'. Both welcomed discussions on how allied countries could 'further protect the region from increasing Russian threats'.\n\nPresident Trump's plan to acquire Greenland, either through purchasing the territory or through military means, has been criticised by political enemies and allies across Europe and in the US.","summary":"Sir Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of Britain's intelligence agency, said there was a 'strong argument' for the US to have Greenland in a bid to deter Chinese threats.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15451469/Former-MI6-chief-Trump-control-Greenland-European-security.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/10/10/105398563-0-image-m-18_1768040685931.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 18:15:17","author":"Editor,Shannon McGuigan","authors":["Editor","Shannon McGuigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":392263622,"title":"Celebrity couple look unrecognisable in sweet childhood snaps after welcoming their first baby - but can you guess who they are?","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 10th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Monster strangled wife as their young daughters slept because she told him she was leaving him over years of abuse\n\nElon Musk hits out at 'fascist' Britain and posts AI image of Keir Starmer in a bikini as he claims banning X over Grok sexualised pictures would be 'censorship'\n\nTwo people arrested after protester climbs onto Iranian embassy balcony and removes flag\n\nMy life was ruined by fatigue and dizziness... it turned out I had a 'hidden' problem that hits a third of women.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in the latest significant upheaval since President Donald Trump became involved with the venue.\n\nThe Kennedy Center, which was recently renamed the Trump Kennedy Center in a potentially illegal move, has been the opera company’s home since 1971.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Times, the WNO said: “Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity.”\n\nThe company said its board of trustees voted to move all its upcoming performances out of the Kennedy Center’s 2,364-seat Opera House. They intend to find new locations in Washington, D.C., but no leases have yet been signed.\n\nFollowing the WNO announcement, a spokesperson for the Trump Kennedy Center told The Independent: “After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to part ways with the WNO due to a financially challenging relationship. \n\n“We believe this represents the best path forward for both organizations and enables us to make responsible choices that support the financial stability and long-term future of the Trump Kennedy Center.”\n\nThe opera company said in a statement to the Washington Post that support previously provided by the venue had now been eliminated, and productions would now be required to be fully funded in advance.\n\n“Opera companies typically cover only 30-60% of costs through ticket sales, with the remainder from grants and donations that cannot be secured years ahead when productions must be planned,” the company said.\n\nTheir artistic director, Francesca Zambello, added that she was “deeply saddened” to leave.\n\n“I have been proud to be affiliated with a national monument to the human spirit, a place that has long served as an inviting home for our ever-growing family of artists and opera lovers,” she told the Post. “In the coming years, as we explore new venues and new ways of performing, WNO remains committed to its mission and artistic vision.”\n\nLast month, several artists announced that they had backed out of upcoming dates at the Kennedy Center in protest of President Donald Trump’s takeover.\n\nJazz supergroup The Cookers pulled out of a series of New Year’s Eve concerts, with saxophonist Billy Harper saying: “I would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture.”\n\nArtists, including Issa Rae, Peter Wolf, and Lin-Manuel Miranda, have also withdrawn from Kennedy Center performances since Trump returned to office.","summary":"After WNO announced their departure, the Trump Kennedy Center claimed the decision was due to a ‘financially challenging relationship’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/washington-national-opera-kennedy-center-trump-b2898116.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/09/23/16/GettyImages-2205590622-(1).jpg?crop=3334.5,2223,x0.2,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3SEPLF64-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-10 18:04:22","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":392266458,"title":"Washington National Opera leaves Kennedy Center, joining slew of artist exits","text":"The Washington National Opera is leaving the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, its home since 1971. \n\nFriday's news, shared with NPR in a statement via email from the opera company, comes in response to new policies which the 70-year-old performing arts group said strain its financial model. \n\nThe Washington National Opera stressed the \"amicability\" of its decision to end its longtime residency at the Kennedy Center. But it said the center's new business model, which requires productions to be fully-funded in advance, is incompatible with the usual mix of ticket sales, grants and donations that cannot all be secured ahead. \n\n\"Opera companies typically cover only 30-60% of costs through ticket sales, with the remainder from grants and donations that cannot be secured years ahead when productions must be planned,\" the statement said.\n\nThe company added the model also does not accommodate its artistic mission, which aims to balance popular works such as West Side Story, slated for May 2026, with more obscure and experimental operas, such as the little-known Scott Joplin work, Treemonisha, scheduled for March. \"Revenue from major productions traditionally subsidizes smaller, innovative works,\" the statement said.\n\nArtistic director Francesca Zambello, who has led the company for 14 seasons, shared her regrets in a statement with NPR, while also looking to the future.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened to leave the Kennedy Center,\" Zambello said. \"In the coming years, as we explore new venues and new ways of performing, Washington National Opera remains committed to its mission and artistic vision. Our repertory will continue to include diverse offerings, from monumental classics to more contemporary works, presented in bold visual productions with first-class musical values.\"\n\nIn addition to a continued presence for now on the Kennedy Center website, the opera company launched its new independent website within a few hours of its announcement.\n\n\"After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to part ways with the Washington National Opera due to a financially challenging relationship,\" the Kennedy Center wrote in an email to NPR on Friday. \"We believe this represents the best path forward for both organizations and enables us to make responsible choices that support the financial stability and long-term future of the Trump Kennedy Center.\"\n\nOn social media, Kennedy Center executive director Richard Grenell said it was the center's decision to sever ties with the opera company — and not the other way around. \n\n\"The Trump Kennedy Center has made the decision to end the EXCLUSIVE partnership with the Washington Opera so that we can have the flexibility and funds to bring in operas from around the world and across the U.S.\" Grenell said. \"Having an EXCLUSIVE relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety.\" \n\nGrenell reposted his message on Saturday after he was alerted that his X.com account had been hacked and the original message had been removed. \n\nPresident Donald Trump was named chairman of the Kennedy Center's board in February 2025. His name was added to the Kennedy Center in December following a vote by the Trump-appointed members of its board. Since the power of the venue's board to rename the center is currently in dispute, NPR continues to refer to the Kennedy Center using its legal name.\n\nA string of exits\n\nThe Washington National Opera's departure is the latest and perhaps most significant in a string of artist exits from the cultural institution since Trump took over the institution. \n\nBacklash from ticket-buyers, slated performers, and certain board members—including Shonda Rhimes—was swift.\n\nArtists are continuing to cancel performances. But one of the first to do so was a touring production of the musical Hamilton. In a statement on X in March 2025, producer Jeffrey Seller said he opposed the Trump administration's ousting of many Democratic board members.\n\n\"The recent purge by the Trump Administration of both professional staff and performing arts events at or originally produced by the Kennedy Center flies in the face of everything this national center represents,\" wrote Seller.\n\nActress and writer Issa Rae followed suit with a post on Instagram, cancelling her sold-out March performance.\n\nA slew of additional artists and performance companies canceled after the board's vote to rename the center \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\" Congress has not yet authorized the name change.\n\nGrenell has responded to many cancellations on social media, condemning the artists. After Banjo player Béla Fleck canceled his performance because he said the center had become \"political,\" Grenell wrote on X, \"You just made it political and caved to the woke mob who wants you to perform for only Lefties.\n\n\"This mob pressuring you will never be happy until you only play for Democrats. The Trump Kennedy Center believes all people are welcome—Democrats and Republicans and people uninterested in politics. We want performers who aren't political—who simply love entertaining everyone regardless of who they voted for.\"\n\nFind a running list of these cancellations below.\n\nSonia De Los Santos \n\nOn Jan. 8, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos announced on Instagram that she was canceling her upcoming February concert at the Kennedy Center. \"As an artist,\" wrote De Los Santos, \"I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country.\"\n\nDe Los Santos, who was nominated for a Latin Grammy for best children's album in 2018, stated that \"I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.\"\n\nPerforming at the Kennedy Center \"has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music,\" wrote American banjo player Béla Fleck about his scheduled appearance with the National Symphony Orchestra in an official statement posted to Instagram on Jan. 7. \"I have withdrawn from my upcoming performance with the NSO at The Kennedy Center,\" he wrote. \"I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art.\"\n\nThe 18-time Grammy winner has performed at the Kennedy Center in the past.\n\nStephen Schwartz\n\nThe composer and lyricist for the beloved musicals Wicked, Godspell and Pippin was expected to host a gala fundraiser for the Washington National Opera in May 2026. On Jan. 2, Schwartz announced his withdrawal. According to NBC News, Schwartz reflected that the Kennedy Center was \"founded to be a political home for free artistic expression for artists of all nationalities and ideologies.\" Today, he said, making an appearance \"has now become an ideological statement.\"\n\nRichard Grenell quickly responded to Schwartz's withdrawal, calling it a \"bogus\" report in a statement posted on X and saying reporters were plagiarizing a \"fake @RollingStone story.\" Schwartz was \"never signed,\" Grenell wrote.\n\nReports from NBC and other outlets, including Variety, have refuted this claim, publishing screenshots showing that Schwartz was promoted on the Kennedy Center's website prior to his cancellation.\n\nThe Cookers\n\nThe seven-piece band of veteran jazz musicians announced shortly before Dec. 31 that they would not perform at the Kennedy Center for \"A Jazz New Year's Eve:\"\n\n\"We know this news is disappointing,\" reads the statement on their website. \"We are not turning away from our audience, and do want to make sure that when we do return to the bandstand, the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it. Our hope is that this moment will leave space for reflection, not resentment.\" \n\nThe statement went on to say, \"We remain committed to playing music that reaches across divisions rather than deepening them.\"\n\nChuck Redd \n\nThe American jazz drummer and longtime host of the Kennedy Center's annual Christmas Jazz Jam chose to cancel his 2025 appearance when he \"saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building,\" according to a statement sent to the Associated Press.\n\nOn Dec. 27, the Kennedy Center announced its plan to file a $1 million lawsuit against Redd. \"Any artist canceling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,\" said Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi.\n\nIn a letter shared with NPR, Richard Grenell condemned Redd: \"Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center.\"\n\nDoug Varone and Dancers\n\n\"The renaming for me has kind of pushed me off a cliff,\" said choreographer Doug Varone on Dec. 31, when he spoke with NPR's Morning Edition. Varone, who was set to showcase members of his Doug Varone and Dancers company at the Kennedy Center in April 2026, pulled the performance.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, for whom the Kennedy Center was established as a living memorial, \"believed in the arts as kind of the beating heart of our nation,\" said Varone.\n\n\"I believe that the level of artistry has dropped drastically since the administration change, and the employees that were responsible for the quality of the work at the center have all been let go.\"\n\nAfter canceling, the company started a crowdfunding campaign to help offset its financial loss. It raised over $42,000, exceeding its $40,000 goal.\n\nIn a statement posted to Facebook on Jan. 5, Greg Artzner of the American folk duo Magpie announced the decision to pull their Feb. 28 concert, set to play on the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage.\n\n\"There isn't really anything defensible\" about Trump, said the statement from Artzner and Magpie's Terry Leonino. Although they had planned an evening of songs with messages of unity and hope, \"We are personally and philosophically in agreement with the belief underlying the growing boycott,\" they said. \"The stand being taken by fellow artists we respect and admire has created a moral picket line. We stand with them in solidarity.\"\n\nAn update on Jan. 9 said that Magpie would now be performing a longer version of that concert on Feb. 21 at Seekers Church in Washington, D.C., now called, \"The Traveling John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Restoration Roadshow.\"\n\nFolk singer Kristy Lee canceled her Jan. 14 Kennedy Center performance due to \"recent efforts to impose political branding on the Center,\" according to a statement posted on her website.\n\n\"Public arts spaces should be free from political influence,\" Lee said in her statement. \"I step back out of respect for artistic freedom and the Kennedy Center's founding mission, not in opposition to its staff, artists, or audience.\"\n\nOn Jan. 14, Lee plans to host a live-streamed concert instead, titled \"Showing Up: From the Kennedy Center to the Couch.\"\n\nLow Cut Connie\n\nPhiladelphia rock and roll band Low Cut Connie pulled their concert, set for February 2025, \"Upon learning that this institution that has run non-partisan for 54 years is now chaired by President Trump himself and his regime,\" according to a statement posted on their Facebook page.\n\n\"Maybe my career will suffer from this decision,\" wrote band frontman Adam Weiner, \"but my soul will be the better for it.\"\n\nRhiannon Giddens\n\nIn Feb. 2025, folk singer Rhiannon Giddens announced her departure from the Kennedy Center lineup in a social media statement. \"I cannot in good conscience play at The Kennedy with the recent programming changes forced on the institution by this new board,\" wrote Giddens.\n\nGiddens transferred her May 11 concert, \"Old-Time Revue,\" to The Anthem concert hall, also in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Puerto Rican band, based in Brooklyn in New York City, canceled their Kennedy Center performance, which had been set for Feb. 27, 2025.\n\nAccording to a statement posted to Balún's Instagram account, \"recent events made it clear that the space no longer aligns with our values. Our safety, integrity, and commitment to justice come first.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much for selling out the Kennedy Center for 'An Evening With [Me],'\" wrote Issa Rae, the acclaimed star and creator of HBO's Insecure, on her Instagram stories page in Feb. 2025. \"Unfortunately, due to what I believe to be an infringement on the values of an institution that has faithfully celebrated artists of all backgrounds through all mediums, I've decided to cancel my appearance at this venue.\"\n\nIn March 2025, Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller announced on X that the Tony-award winning musical phenomenon would no longer run as scheduled at the Kennedy Center. According to the statement, the decision was made both for political and for business reasons. Not only was there \"a new spirit of partisanship,\" the statement read in part, but \"it would be \"financially and personally devastating to the employees of Hamilton if the new leadership of the Kennedy Center suddenly canceled or re-negotiated our engagement. The actions of the new Chairman of the Board in recent weeks demonstrate that contracts and previous agreements simply cannot be trusted.\"\n\nThe Kennedy Center was swift to respond to Hamilton's cancellation. On X in a now-deleted post, Richard Grenell accused Hamilton star and creator Lin Manuel-Miranda of being \"intolerant of people who don't agree with him politically,\" and stated that the decision was \"a publicity stunt that will backfire.\"\n\nIn the months since the show's cancellation at the Center, Hamilton has continued to sell out theaters on Broadway and in venues nationwide who host its North American touring company.\n\nU.S. Marine Band\n\nThe U.S. Marine Band announced in February 2025 that the Marine Band would not perform in the Equity Arc Wind Symphony event, a collaboration between Marine Band members and selected high school musicians.\n\nThe U.S. Marine Band, known also as \"The President's Own\" was founded by an Act of Congress in 1798, making it the country's oldest professional music organization.\n\nComposer Kevin Charoensri, whose music had been scheduled to be performed by the band at the event, stated in a Facebook post that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) orders resulted in the cancellation of the Equity Arc concert:\n\n\"It has come to my attention that the program, one based on equity and diversity of voices, is no longer supported at the federal level under this administration,\" Charoensri wrote. \"It was for this reason that the program and performance were canceled.\"\n\nJennifer Vanasco edited this story.","summary":"The WNO is just the latest to say they will no longer perform at the Kennedy Center since Trump took over last year.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/10/nx-s1-5671107/kennedy-center-canceled-trump-washington-national-opera-wno","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/6000x4000!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2Fe0%2F5ec809b147d3afab0d2962dc5637%2Fgettyimages-2252859427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 17:58:33","author":"Chloe Veltman","authors":["Chloe Veltman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.513},{"id":392263556,"title":"Iran defies Trump: Islamic Republic kills 50 protesters in defiance of Donald Trump's warning he would intervene should there be further bloodshed","text":"READ MORE: DAVID PATRIKARAKOS reveals terrifying new tactics IS is using to infiltrate West, group's chilling vision for the future... and why we're completely unprepared \n\nBy ELIZABETH HAIGH, SENIOR NEWS REPORTER\n\nPublished: 13:42 GMT, 10 January 2026 | Updated: 19:47 GMT, 10 January 2026\n\nIranian security personnel have killed at least 50 protesters in a sign of the regime's defiance of US President Donald Trump's warning of intervention if bloodshed continued.\n\nThe death toll is expected to increase as local hospitals report being overrun with casualties, including many with gunshot wounds, while some families are too terrified to get medical help for fear of being arrested.\n\nIranian rights group HRANA reported 65 deaths including 50 protesters and 15 security personnel as of January 9, while the Norway-based human ⁠rights group Hengaw said more than 2,500 people have been arrested in the last two weeks.\n\nIt comes after Trump said on Friday it looked as if Iran's leaders were 'in big trouble' and repeated his earlier threat of military strikes if peaceful protesters are killed.\n\n'It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,' Trump said.\n\nAnd speaking on Air Force One earlier this week, he told journalists: 'We're watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.' \n\nProtests have taken place across Iran for 13 days in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, with growing calls for the end of the clerical system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, which ousted the pro-Western shah.\n\nUnrest continued overnight, with state media reporting a municipal building was set on fire in Karaj, west of Tehran, for which they blamed 'rioters'.\n\nProtests have spread to more than 220 towns and cities in every one of Iran's 31 provinces. \n\nProtests have taken place across Iran for 13 days in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, but which have escalated into calls for regime change\n\nDemonstrations continued overnight in Tehran's Kaj Square (pictured) as unrest across Iran entered its third week\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in Tehran as well as cities and towns across all of Iran's 31 provinces (Pictured: Protesters in Mashhad, northeastern Iran)\n\nIt comes after US President Donald Trump said on Friday it looked as if Iran's leaders were 'in big trouble' and repeated his earlier threat of military strikes if peaceful protesters are killed\n\nSocial media images showed thousands participating in Tehran, while videos published by Persian language television channels based outside Iran showed large numbers taking part in new protests in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom.\n\nBut the country's infamous Revolutionary Guards and other law enforcement agencies are launching a brutal crackdown, with the nation's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning anyone taking part in protests would be considered 'an enemy of God'.\n\nThis offence is punishable by death under Iran's strict laws, and even those who assisted protesters would also be prosecuted, a statement on state TV reported.\n\n'Prosecutors must carefully and without delay, by issuing indictments, prepare the grounds for the trial and decisive confrontation with those who, by betraying the nation and creating insecurity, seek foreign domination over the country,' it read.\n\n'Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence.' \n\nIt appears to be a desperate bid to try and limit the number of protesters after Friday night saw some of the largest swells of activists yet.\n\nVideos show many chanted 'death to the dictator' and 'death to Khamenei', while others banged pots and pans. \n\nWhile some protests have been peaceful, videos in some cities show burning buildings, overturned cars and authorities opening fire. \n\nA doctor in northwestern Iran said that since Friday, large numbers of injured protesters had been brought to hospitals. Some were badly beaten, suffering head injuries and broken legs and arms, as well as deep cuts.\n\nAt least 20 people in one hospital had been shot with live ammunition, five of whom later died.\n\nThe US-based son of Iran's ousted shah urged Iranians on Saturday to stage more targeted protests with the aim of taking and then holding city centres.\n\nThousands of protesters gather in Tehran on Friday night as protests continue to sweep the country\n\nA fire is filmed by protesters in Tehran, the capital of Iran, on Friday\n\nThe movement marks the biggest threat to the Islamic Republic in years and has seen a typically brutal crackdown from the country's Revolutionary Guards\n\nA nationwide internet blackout has now been going on for more than 36 hours, making monitoring of events increasingly challenging (Pictured: Protesters in Kermanshah, Iran on January 8)\n\nThe Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei described protesters as 'vandals' - 30 seconds of his speech was aired during the BBC's news report\n\nOutrage grows over BBC's 'shameful' coverage of Iran protests as it airs blundering report\n\n'Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,' Reza Pahlavi said in a video message on social media.\n\nHe urged more protests on Saturday and Sunday and said he was 'preparing to return to my homeland' in a day he believed was 'very near'. It came after he appealed for the help of Trump on Friday.\n\nThese protests followed giant demonstrations on Thursday that were the biggest in Iran since the 2022-2023 protest movement sparked by the custody death of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating the dress rules for women.\n\nThe rallies came as internet monitor NetBlocks said authorities imposed a 'nationwide internet shutdown' for the last 36 hours that was violating the rights of Iranians and 'masking regime violence'.\n\nAmnesty International said the 'blanket internet shutdown' aims to 'hide the true extent of the grave human rights violations and crimes under international law they are carrying out to crush' the protests.\n\nOn Saturday morning, a local governor of the Tehran province told Tasnim news agency, which is associated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, that 100 people had been arrested.\n\nThose detained were accused of having 'disrupted public order' and 'used firearms and cold weapons against the people and security and law enforcement forces' in the county of Baharestan.\n\nIn his first comments on the escalating protests since January 3, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators 'vandals' and 'saboteurs'.\n\nKhamenei, in a speech broadcast on state TV, said Trump's hands 'are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians', in apparent reference to Israel's June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own.\n\nIranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Kermanshah, Iran on January 8\n\nPeople gather on the streets during a protest in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran this week as activists gathered in towns and cities in all 31 of Iran's provinces\n\nHe predicted the 'arrogant' US leader would be 'overthrown' like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.\n\n'Everyone knows the Islamic republic came to power with the blood of hundreds of thousands of honourable people, it will not back down in the face of saboteurs.'\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on a visit to Lebanon on Friday accused Washington and Israel of 'directly intervening' to try to 'transform the peaceful protests into divisive and violent ones', which a US State Department spokesperson called 'delusional'.\n\nIn a joint statement on Friday, the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada and the European Union issued a strong condemnation and called on Iran to 'immediately end the use of excessive and lethal force by its security forces'. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nIran defies Trump: Islamic Republic kills 50 protesters in defiance of Donald Trump's warning he would intervene should there be further bloodshed\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The death toll is expected to increase as local hospitals report being overrun with casualties, including many with gunshot wounds, while some families are too terrified to get help.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15451689/Iran-defies-Trump-Islamic-Republic-kills-50-protesters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/10/13/105400479-0-image-m-83_1768051888987.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/10/3386439227213724143/1024x576_MP4_3386439227213724143.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-10 17:52:51","author":"Editor,Elizabeth Haigh","authors":["Editor","Elizabeth Haigh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":392262170,"title":"Greenland leaders push back on Trump's calls for US control of the island: 'We don’t want to be Americans'","text":"Greenland's leadership is pushing back on President Donald Trump as he and his administration call for the U.S. to take control of the island. Several Trump administration officials have backed the president's calls for a takeover of Greenland, with many citing national security reasons. \"We don’t want to be Americans, we don’t want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night, according to The Associated Press. Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory and a longtime U.S. ally, has repeatedly rejected Trump's statements about U.S. acquiring the island. Greenland's party leaders reiterated that the island's \"future must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\" \"As Greenlandic party leaders, we would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States’ contempt for our country ends,\" the statement said. TRUMP SAYS US IS MAKING MOVES TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND 'WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT' Trump was asked about the push to acquire Greenland on Friday during a roundtable with oil executives. The president, who has maintained that Greenland is vital to U.S. security, said it was important for the country to make the move so it could beat its adversaries to the punch. \"We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"Because if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we're not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor.\" Trump hosted nearly two dozen oil executives at the White House on Friday to discuss investments in Venezuela after the historic capture of President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. \"We don't want to have Russia there,\" Trump said of Venezuela on Friday when asked if the nation appears to be an ally to the U.S. \"We don't want to have China there. And, by the way, we don't want Russia or China going to Greenland, which, if we don't take Greenland, you can have Russia or China as your next-door neighbor. That's not going to happen.\" Trump said the U.S. is in control of Venezuela after the capture and extradition of Maduro. Nielsen has previously rejected comparisons between Greenland and Venezuela, saying that his island was looking to improve its relations with the U.S., according to Reuters. FROM CARACAS TO NUUK: MADURO RAID SPARKS FRESH TRUMP PUSH ON GREENLAND Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Monday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland could mean the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). \"I also want to make it clear that if the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. Including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War,\" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2. That same day, Nielsen said in a statement posted on Facebook that Greenland was \"not an object of superpower rhetoric.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller doubled down on Trump’s remarks, telling CNN in an interview on Monday that Greenland \"should be part of the United States.\" CNN anchor Jake Tapper pressed Miller about whether the Trump administration could rule out military action against the Arctic island. \"The United States is the power of NATO. For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously Greenland should be part of the United States,\" he said.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy VIVEK CHAUDHARY, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:16:25 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:17:22 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nA monster husband who strangled his wife as their young daughters slept upstairs did it in a jealous rage because she planned to leave him over his abuse, her heartbroken family have revealed.\nIsobella Knight, 32, was choked to death by Paul Knight at the home they shared together in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, on June 13 last year, after telling him she had had enough of his controlling behaviour and bullying.\nThe morning after killing Izzy - as she was fondly known by friends - Knight asked his mother to babysit their two children before making a botched attempt to kill himself, crashing his car in a McDonald's.\nThis week Knight, 36, finally admitted murdering Izzy and was told he can expect a life sentence at his next court appearance.\nAfter his guilty plea Tim Davies, Izzy's father, said she had suffered years of mental and verbal abuse at the hands of Knight - and had finally told him that the marriage was over when he killed her.\nSpeaking to the Daily Mail, Mr Davies said: 'She suffered from his controlling behaviour and verbal and psychological abuse, particularly over the last few years.\n'She told him that she wanted to split, and they had come to an agreement on how to handle things for the benefit of the kids. Izzy made it clear that she'd had enough.'\nMr Davies, 58, revealed that what has added to the family's heartache is that she never shared her marriage woes with them, and they only discovered the truth after her death.\n\nIsobella Knight, 32, was choked to death by Paul Knight at the home they shared together in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, on June 13 last year\n\nThe morning after killing Izzy - as she was fondly known by friends - Knight asked his mother to babysit their two children before making a botched attempt to kill himself\n\nThis week Knight, 36, finally admitted murdering Izzy and was told he can expect a life sentence at his next court appearance\n\nPolice outside the house in Donnington Road, Burton Latimer, where Isobella Knight died\n'She never told me her troubles and that's hard for me to take,' he said. 'She discussed it with some of her close friends, but we only found out about the domestic pressure she was under after her killing.\n'The truth about her marriage really shocked me and this has added to the emotional trauma the whole family has been going through.'\nIzzy's sister Georgia, added: 'We only found out the truth about her marriage afterwards and it was a huge shock.\n'Izzy was my best friend, we spoke every day, but she never told me anything about the abusive behaviour she was suffering because she wanted to protect the family. She was a lovely sister and one of the most caring, selfless and loving people you could meet.'\nMr Davies revealed that Izzy's two daughters, aged six and three, are now being cared for by her mother Helena and her partner David, who have become their legal guardians.\nHe added: 'We as a family are supporting my ex-wife and granddaughters. We're helping out with the kids at weekends and are pulling together to make sure they have a good upbringing.\n'We face the challenge united as a family of raising them and dealing with the future. Izzy was a wonderful mum and daughter. Her kids were more important to her than anything and we will do our best to honour her memory.'\nMr Davies and Georgia said that they did not want to speak about Knight or comment on what sentence he deserves.\nBut Mr Davies added: 'We've been told that he's looking at around 15 years imprisonment before he'd be eligible for parole. In my opinion that's not enough.\n'My ex-wife, Georgia and I have all decided that we will read out our victim impact statements ourselves when Knight is sentenced. That's when you'll hear how we feel about him and the full extent of his behaviour towards my daughter.'\nKnight is due to appear for sentencing at Northampton Crown Court on 29 January.\nMr Davies added: 'We were told on Christmas Eve that he had decided to change his plea. But we knew the truth all along and it doesn't change anything we think about him.'\nMr Davies also expressed concerns at the failure of the Government to bring Jade's law into force.\n\nIzzy's father has told the Daily Mail she was subjected to years of 'controlling behaviour and verbal and psychological abuse' by Knight\n\nKnight, 36, previously admitted manslaughter but had denied murdering his wife - with a two-week trial due to begin on Thursday morning\nThis is new legislation in the UK that automatically suspends parental responsibility for a parent who has been convicted of killing their partner.\nIt means that a convicted parent cannot have a say in key decisions affecting their children's lives.\nBut the law is not applicable yet meaning a court will have to rule if Knight should be exempted from making decisions about his children.\nMr Davies said: 'If Jade's law was operating we would not have this concern. I may potentially have to pay for legal advice to get him exempted and that's not right. \n'It's ridiculous that the Government has taken so long over this. It was passed through Parliament in April 2024 yet only remains prospective because of a disagreement between the Ministry of Justice and family court authorities.'\nAfter strangling Izzy and unsuccessfully trying to commit suicide, Knight left the family home and crashed his car in the car park of a nearby McDonald's restaurant.\nOfficers from Northamptonshire Police Force responded to the collision and after finding his behaviour odd decided to search his home address, leading to the grim discovery of Izzy's body.\nIn the summer, Georgia set up a fundraiser for Izzy's two children, who have now lost both their mother and their father.\nThe GoFundMe page has already raised more than £16,000 from 459 donations.\nGeorgia, who has two young children of her own said: 'Izzy was my older sister, and we've grown up together. We went to the same schools and shared a bedroom until we were 17. We've done like everything together in terms of our stages of life.\n'We were extremely close, and because of the children and we would meet up like every week. We spoke every single day on voice notes. It was always about the children.'\nShe added: 'The response to the GoFundMe has been amazing. I shared it on Facebook, and it just went up quicker than I had ever expected.'\nKnight, 36, previously admitted manslaughter but had denied murdering his wife - with a two-week trial due to begin on Thursday morning.\nHowever, just as the case was about to start, Knight, an area sales manager for a property business, changed his plea to guilty.\nHis barrister, John Lloyd-Jones KC explained to Northampton Crown Court that he had met with his client before Christmas and he had decided to admit murder.\nKnight kept his head bowed during the hearing in court.\nMr Lloyd-Jones said: 'He has never denied that he unlawfully killed the victim in this case.\n\nJust as the case was about to start, Knight, an area sales manager for a property business, changed his plea to guilty\n'He pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the first opportunity.\n'The events of that night have been a source of huge anguish for him as, of course he accepts, they have been for a very large number of other people.'\nMr Lloyd-Jones then asked that the count of murder could be put to his client again.\nAs the clerk read the charge, Knight looked down and then replied 'guilty'.\nHer Honour Judge Adrienne Lucking warned Knight that there was only one sentence she could pass, that of life imprisonment, but that she must decide the minimum amount of time he will serve before he becomes eligible for parole.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRevealed: Monster strangled wife as their young daughters slept because she told him she was leaving him over years of abuse\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 859\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (MCCC) unanimously approved the decision in a 4-0 vote on Dec. 11. Under the new rule, non-cannabis businesses such as yoga studios and movie theaters can obtain a cannabis license to host consumption areas. \"The first new cannabis business models to be introduced to Massachusetts’ regulated industry in five years will allow adults ages 21 and older to buy and consume cannabis on-site at licensed Marijuana Establishments (MEs), sanctioned events and non-cannabis businesses that partner with licensees,\" the MCCC press release notes. SMOKING AND VAPING MAY BE BANNED AT ONE STATE'S MOST POPULAR BEACHES AND PARKS: HERE'S WHY Chair Shannon O’Brien said Massachusetts residents have been \"eagerly\" waiting to socially consume marijuana, according to the release. \"We look forward to the economic opportunities these new license types will offer to small businesses and entrepreneurs who have been disproportionately harmed by the war on drugs,\" said O’Brien. The regulations take effect immediately. Social consumption licenses, however, are not yet available. The commission will be working on an implementation plan to create new consumption establishment applications along with guidance and vendor training, the release noted. MCCC recently praised President Donald Trump for his executive order in December reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER Marijuana previously was labeled a Schedule 1 drug under the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations — the same category the agency uses for drugs including heroin, ecstasy and LSD. Under the new Schedule III classification, marijuana is now in a category alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids, which the agency claims arethe ones with a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" \"President Trump’s Executive Order expediting rescheduling of cannabis marks a significant step forward for public health and patient care in the United States,\" said Commissioner Kimberly Roy in a press release at the time. \"By aligning federal policy more closely with science, this action will help remove long-standing barriers to medical research and open the door to safer, more effective treatments for people living with chronic and debilitating conditions,\" Roy added. CLICK HERE FOR MORE LIFESTYLE STORIES In a recent study, researchers at UC San Francisco determined that eating edible cannabis, such as gummies, has the same impact on cardiovascular risk as smoking marijuana. The risk stems from reduced blood vessel function, with the study finding that cannabis users were found to have \"decreased vascular function,\" comparable to those who smoke tobacco. Their blood vessel function was roughly half compared to those who did not use cannabis, with the side effect linked to a higher risk of heart attack, high blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions, the researchers noted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:09:53 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:17:08 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nVictoria Wood is renowned as one of nation's most beloved comedians, entertaining millions with her witty takes on mundane marriages and daily life woes.\nBut behind her one-liners and famous piano numbers, the star went through strife of her own in her marriage to her husband Geoffrey Durham, 76, with a revealing new documentary set to bring insight into the star's life.\nBecoming Victoria Wood, which was released in cinemas on Friday, is set to explore the life of the late comedian alongside insights from famous friends like Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Michael Ball and Joan Armatrading.\nDespite happier origins - Victoria said that things 'clicked' between her and Geoffrey when they met back in 1976 - the comedian frequently implied they were troubles in the relationship, including her reluctance to get married in the first place.\nDetails about the cause of their split have been questioned for many years, with a spokesperson simply announcing saying: 'The separation is entirely amicable - there are no other parties involved. They have asked for their privacy to be respected.'\nVictoria herself was impartial on the subject, saying in an interview she felt like a 'failure' when the marriage ended, and following her death from oesophageal cancer in 2016, both her children and ex-husband Geoffrey kept details about her death to minimum.\n\nDespite being known as one of the nation's most beloved comedians, Victoria Wood battled a secret heartache, when her marriage to Geoffrey Durham ended in 2002 (pictured in 1991)\n\nA new documentary is set to share insight into the star's life, including her failed relationship with the magician, to whom she left nothing in her £9.3million will (pictured in 1997)\nGiven the lack of insight, it was a surprise when it was revealed that Victoria had left nothing to her ex-husband Geoffrey in her will, instead donating half of her £9.3million fortune to a charity set up in her name.\nShe first met her husband Geoffrey, a magician and actor, in 1976 shortly after she won New Faces, when they were both appearing at the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester. \nShe later said of him: 'It was just one of those things when you click. He was encouraging because comedy's a very lonely thing to do without someone in your corner. I don't think it would have worked as well with him. We just did everything together.'\nThe couple married in 1980 and they went on to have two children together, but the comic previously confessed she was reluctant to tie the knot, given her own parents' failed relationship.\nSpeaking in Let's Do It: The Authorised Biography Of Victoria Wood, she said: 'I didn't want to get married. He did. Every day he'd ask me to marry him,' confessing she finally relented after a string of rows over why they had not wed.\nDuring her relationship, Victoria confessed that she was disillusioned with the idea of sex, saying: 'It's never got any better. Sex. There's something so stressful about it. I keep thinking in the end they will just have to faze it out altogether.'\nBut after winning the first of her five BAFTAs for As Seen On TV, she and Geoffrey retreated further and bought their first home together in a small village in Lancashire.\n'I wanted to cut myself off. I wanted to be separate,' she said.\n\nDespite happier origins - Victoria said that things 'clicked' when they met back in 1976 - the comedian frequently implied they were troubles in the relationship (pictured in 1991) \n\nThe couple married in 1980 and they went on to have two children together, but the comic previously confessed she was reluctant to tie the knot (pictured in 1986)\n\nVictoria (pictured in 2015) died in 2016 at the age of 62 after a battle with oesophageal cancer\n\nVictoria herself was impartial on the subject, saying in an interview she felt like a 'failure' when the marriage ended (pictured on stage with her spouse in 1982)\n\nEXCLUSIVE ITVX content warning on Victoria Wood's 'Let's Do It' because lyrics 'may offend modern audiences' \nThe couple were together for 26 years, but when they split in 2002, little was known about the cause of the end of their marriage.\nWithin four months of Geoffrey moving out, the star was photographed kissing his tour manager, Helen Morris-Brown, while the comic never had another long-term relationship.\nVictoria also shared that she suffered from depression after they separated, admitting on Desert Island Discs that she felt 'like a cartoon character who had run over a cliff'.\nIn a later interview, she said: 'I take a lot of responsibility. I bear the consequences. I don't feel hard done by.\n'I've felt very guilty about my part in it. I felt a failure, completely. That's quite hard to live with.' \nVictoria was tight-lipped about the cause for her marital split, but did tell The Guardian in 2005 she 'f****d up' and felt 'guilty' about her part in the relationship's failure.\nShe said: ''I take a lot of responsibility. If I f****d up, then I bear the consequences. I don't feel hard done by. I've felt very guilty about my part in it.\n'I felt a failure, completely. That's quite hard to live with. If you're quite a punishing sort of person anyway, then: woah, you've suddenly got the biggest mallet to whack yourself over the head with.' \nThe star has implied that the end of the marriage came as a shock, adding: 'You look back at the good bits and the bad bits and you think, \"Were the good bits that good?\"\n'You churn the whole thing over and oh, it's exhausting, trying to make sense of something that, in the end, you can't make sense of. But it shakes your perception of yourself on a really basic level.'\n\nWithin four months of Geoffrey moving out, the star was photographed kissing his tour manager, while the comic never had another long-term relationship (pictured in 1995)\nIt then came as a huge shock when she died, she left him without a penny in her will, and instead left her £4million Highgate mansion and Lake District cottage to their kids Grace, 28, and Henry, 24.\nBut the Dinnerladies star made no mention of her comedy magician ex partner, known as the 'Great Soprendo', who she was married to for 22 years.\nThe comic left half of her fortune to set up the charity Victoria Wood Charitable Trust, to support causes like helping young and disabled people, The Sun reported.\nHanding over her Lake District property to her children, she gave the instructions that it should not be sold 'so long as it's enjoyed by family'.\nGrace and Henry were also given her letters, diaries and photos which it's believed she wanted to be kept private.\nShe also gave £50,000 each to her three siblings - Rosalind, Penelope and brother Chris Foote Wood, 76.\nThe screenwriter gave between £2,000 to £25,000 to ten of her closest friends, including her two godchildren.\nDawn FrenchJennifer Saunders\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVictoria Wood's hidden heartbreak: Late comic battled marital strife with husband Geoffrey Durham - but she got the last laugh when she left none of her £9m fortune to him\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 752\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

And Jeff was murdered. I want to know who killed him and on whose behalf?” \n\nImprisoned Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell has also said she believes he didn’t die by suicide.\n\nThe White House has faced allegations that it is engaging in a cover-up of the full Epstein story, owing to Donald Trump’s past friendship with the late pedophile.\n\nA bipartisan revolt in Congress pressured the president to sign a bill releasing more of the files, though lawmakers accuse the administration of failing to comply with the bill's terms and have said they are drafting contempt charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi. \n\nThe administration has strongly denied that Trump was aware of or involved in any of Jeffrey Epstein’s wrongdoing.","summary":"Multiple federal reviews have concluded Epstein died by suicide, but doubters continue to insist he died from foul play","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jeffrey-epstein-brother-autopsy-murder-suicide-b2898090.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/03/14/epstein%20prison.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5zMIDPD8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-10 17:05:24","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":392264334,"title":"Trump’s ‘morality’ raises nightmare of ghosts past in Colombia","text":"A man convicted on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records, and found liable in a civil court for sexual abuse and defamation, now says that as US president he is unbound by international law and answers only to “my own morality”.\n\nDonald Trump’s latest boast came at the end of a week when his forces abducted the Venezuelan president abroad and after his ICE agents killed a mother of three on home soil.\n\nIn Venezuela, he violated the nation’s sovereignty. In Minneapolis, he pre-empted any investigation into the shooting of Renee Good, claimed she had tried to run over an ICE agent and that the armed agent who killed her by firing three shots point blank acted in self-defence.\n\nThere is no aspect, now, of international law that Trump believes he is bound by. And few of domestic, either.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, he was asked whether there were any limits on his use of American military might.\n\n“Yeah, there is one thing,” he replied. “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me. I don’t need international law. I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nIn Bogata, Colombia’s capital, that claim is dismissed outright.\n\nFilipe Grisaldo, a bookshop assistant not far from Palaza de Bolivar, the central square in the capital, represents many when he says that for the last week he has felt genuinely afraid that his country would come under American attack.\n\n“Here where I work is very close to the government buildings. If the Americans come, I could be killed,” he adds.\n\nHis fear was caused by Trump’s threats against Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, who, the US president said, needs to “watch his ass”.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories and isn’t going to be doing it very long,” Trump threatened earlier this week. \n\nWhen asked if he favoured military intervention against Colombia’s drug operations, the president said, “sounds good”.\n\nThis week, thousands of people flooded onto Plaza de Bolivar, named after South America’s “liberator”, Simon Bolivar, to protest at the US threats – made before Trump insisted he was above international law.\n\nColombia’s military is already on high alert along its border with Venezuela, dealing with transnational narco-gangs like Tren de Aragua, and with rebel movements like ELN and FARC, also involved in international drugs and gold smuggling.\n\nCocaine production in Colombia is at its highest ever. But the US and Bogota have worked together for years trying to reduce the scale of the problem for both countries.\n\n“It is the longer history between South and Central America and the US that really frightens me, though,” says Grisaldo.\n\n“We had decades when the US was operating in our countries, supporting authoritarians and guerrilla groups that brought chaos.”\n\nIn the 1960s and for the next three decades, until the fall of the Soviet Union, successive governments in Washington backed covert and overt operations to keep socialist and communist-leaning leaders from power in America’s backyard.\n\nCuba remains isolated and under a crippling economic embargo as a socialist state established by Fidel Castro. \n\nThe US was instrumental in the 1973 coup against Salvador Allende, who was killed, and backed the reign of terror of right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet until 1990.\n\nUS military support for successive military regimes in Guatemala led to UN allegations of acts of genocide against the Indigenous people. The US backed Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua, and supported death squad regimes in El Salvador, plus the “dirty war” of Argentina’s dictatorship. The list is longer than this.\n\nThose US actions sought to offset a threat of growing Soviet influence and the possibility of establishing military bases to threaten the US. \n\nToday, there is no obvious physical danger from Vladimir Putin’s Russia. His efforts to restore the Soviet empire have focused on Eastern Europe. He has weaponised the cyber realms and social media to undermine democracy across the West, including the US, to this end. He wants Ukraine – not Uruguay.\n\nTrump is leaving Putin to pursue his aim to regain dominance over Eastern Europe while his focus is on the western hemisphere. \n\nTo that end, he has withdrawn further from international bodies and treaties, leaving 31 UN bodies and agreements and more than 30 others that cover global efforts to mitigate climate change and defend the rights of women.\n\n“American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again,” Trump said after the Venezuelan operation.\n\nHis focus lies on the drug cartels, which have evolved into military organisations with nation-sized budgets in the bloody soup of South and Central America’s proxy wars between Moscow and Washington. \n\nChaos and compromise led to vast ungoverned spaces and weak governments unable, or unwilling, to deal with the explosion of criminal gangs.\n\nThese gangs, Trump insists, now pose a threat to US security. But now Trump, in turn, poses a threat to the security of allies in the US’s “war on drugs”.\n\nHe has backed away from threatening Colombia’s president for now and has instead invited him to a meeting at the White House. \n\nPetro has readily agreed because when Trump makes threats, as Maduro has found out and Greenland may soon, he tends to mean it. And his business and personal life shows that he is unhindered by complex ethics.","summary":"As the belligerent US president threatens more attacks on South America with no regard to international law, he is causing real fear in the region, reports world affairs editor Sam Kiley from Bogota, Colombia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-colombia-cartels-drugs-venezuela-b2897814.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/08/00/EEUU-COLOMBIA_07473.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/veRb9TUM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-10 17:01:47","author":"Sam Kiley","authors":["Sam Kiley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":392263548,"title":"Oscar-nominated screen siren who starred with Natalie Wood seen on rare outing in LA","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 10th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Monster strangled wife as their young daughters slept because she told him she was leaving him over years of abuse\n\nElon Musk hits out at 'fascist' Britain and posts AI image of Keir Starmer in a bikini as he claims banning X over Grok sexualised pictures would be 'censorship'\n\nTwo people arrested after protester climbs onto Iranian embassy balcony and removes flag\n\nMy life was ruined by fatigue and dizziness... it turned out I had a 'hidden' problem that hits a third of women.

So in a final bid to keep Labour rebels in check, Starmer is going for the nuclear option","text":"Desperate times call for desperate measures. So Keir Starmer has decided to issue one, final despairing plea to Labour MPs preparing to oust him from office. ‘Stick with me. Or you’ll get nuked.’\n\nAs a minister explains: ‘This is going to be the new line pushed at the backbenches by the Whips. The argument will be that we’re on the brink of war with Russia, Trump is threatening Greenland, the Middle East is a tinderbox and China has spies lurking round every corner in Westminster. So who do you want dealing with all that – Keir or Andy Burnham?’\n\nOn one level it’s easy to see the attraction of this apocalyptic narrative. The Prime Minister’s New Year’s relaunch has already imploded. As we report today, the global threats facing Britain are all too real, with Trump genuinely considering an occupation of Greenland, fresh strikes on Iran reportedly imminent and Putin threatening retaliation for the seizure of his tankers.\n\nAnd while Keir Starmer has been grappling with these geopolitical threats, his potential successors – Burnham, Wes Streeting and Angela Rayner – have primarily been struggling to get to grips with the Manchester Bee Network, the BMA and the Inland Revenue’s regulations on stamp duty.\n\nAs one Starmer ally told me: ‘It’s going to be the old Ed Miliband question. Who do you trust most to stand up to Vladimir Putin?’\n\nBut trying to get Labour MPs to focus on the threat of thermo-nuclear annihilation, rather than their increasingly vulnerable parliamentary majorities, is not going to prove an easy task. Not least because it’s a strategy that has been tried – and failed – in the recent past.\n\nIt became a running joke that whenever Boris Johnson was facing a domestic political crisis he would suddenly pop up in Kyiv. Liz Truss spent the last days of her brief premiership checking Met Office weather charts because she had been warned by security chiefs that Russia was preparing to detonate a low-yield nuclear device over the Black Sea.\n\nYet the very real and present danger posed by Putin’s aggression was not enough to convince rebellious Tory MPs to stay their hand. And there is precious little evidence their Labour counterparts will prove any more forgiving. The other problem for Keir Starmer is that foreign affairs no longer provides the political sanctuary it afforded at the start of his premiership.\n\nIt was significant that at last week’s session of Prime Minister’s Questions, Kemi Badenoch chose to focus on Ukraine and defence spending, rather than domestic issues. And even more significantly, she gave the Prime Minister a proper shellacking over his failure to deliver a full parliamentary statement over his agreement to deploy British troops as part of a post-ceasefire Ukrainian peacekeeping operation, or to provide a hard date for the proposed increase in defence spending to 3.5 per cent.\n\nStarmer and his aides have long been of the view his unwavering support for Ukraine plays well with the voters. But his MPs are not so sure. As one told me last year: ‘People in my constituency are saying, “How come we can afford drones for the Ukrainians but we haven’t got any money to fix the potholes at the end of my street.”’\n\nThe other major issue with his ‘Get Burnham, Get Nuked’ line is that the Prime Minister’s backbenchers are becoming just as concerned at the increasingly reckless adventurism of his erstwhile ally Donald Trump as they are at the predatory behaviour of Putin.\n\nForeign affairs committee chairman Emily Thornberry spoke for many colleagues with her intervention in the wake of the US attack on Venezuela when she chided: ‘We condemn Putin for doing it. We need to make clear that Donald Trump shouldn’t be doing it either. People just can’t do whatever they want. I mean, we really can’t have a kind of international anarchy.’\n\nHer words were quickly echoed by Labour’s First Minister in Wales, Eluned Morgan, who warned: ‘There comes a point when you have to stand up and be clear with your friends and say, “Up to here and no further”, because if you’re not they just go on to the next thing, as you are seeing in relation to Greenland.’\n\nThese comments reflect a wider view within the Labour movement that Starmer has gone far enough in his efforts to ingratiate himself with Trump, and that he now needs to start to put some distance between himself and the President’s increasingly erratic, and potentially electorally toxic, behaviour.\n\n‘Keir can bang on as much as he likes about the importance of the special relationship. But look at the polls. British voters don’t like Trump and they don’t trust him. We can’t be seen to be getting too pally with him,’ one MP told me.\n\nBut the biggest drawback with Downing Street’s new strategy is that however scared Starmer’s MPs may be by Putin’s aggression and Trump’s irrationality, the British people scare them more.\n\nThe continuing slide in Labour’s poll ratings, the angry reaction to Rachel Reeves’ betrayal of her pledge not to raise taxes on working people and the chaotic start to the New Year – which has already seen panicked U-turns on farmers’ inheritance tax and pub business rates – are what is focusing their minds.\n\nThey are less worried at the prospect of Russian paratroopers landing in their back garden than they are of the response they will get when they knock on the front doors of their constituents.\n\n‘Look, am I delighted at the thought of Andy or Angela sitting down opposite Vladimir Putin to try to prevent World War III? No. But to be honest that’s a pretty abstract problem. People in my area are focused on bread and butter issues such as the cost of living. And at the moment I don’t see any prospect of Keir or Rachel getting to grips with that,’ one backbencher admitted.\n\nAnother MP was even more blunt. ‘Unless Keir can demonstrate he can turn things around, he has to go. Because if he doesn’t then the person in charge of our foreign policy will be Nigel Farage. And who does that help?’\n\nThe reality is that raising the spectre of nuclear annihilation as a means of ushering rebellious Labour MPs back on side is a sign of No 10’s increasing desperation. One that merely underlines the extent to which they have run out of cards to play.\n\nIn 1940, Neville Chamberlain was ousted by his party while Britain was facing the gravest international danger.\n\nIn 2026, despite Keir Starmer’s best efforts, history may be about to repeat itself.","summary":"Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:14:48 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:16:48 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nDavina McCall held back tears as she revealed she has finished her radiotherapy after battling breast cancer last year.\nThe TV presenter, 58, revealed last November that she had detected it early after noticing a lump and getting it checked, leading to a successful lumpectomy.\nShe has now completed her course of preventative radiotherapy and became emotional about the treatment coming to an end.\nSpeaking in an Instagram video, she said: 'I finished my radiotherapy today, and it was very, very emotional.'\nDavina then paused for a moment and held back tears as she added: 'Much more emotional than I thought it would be. \n'And I need a bit of positivity and brilliance, so I'm going to go and watch Julia Bradbury on Begin Again.'\n\nDavina McCall held back tears as she revealed she has finished her radiotherapy after battling breast cancer last year\n\nThe TV presenter, 58, revealed last November that she had detected it early after noticing a lump and getting it checked, leading to a lumpectomy (pictured on Stand Up To Cancer)\nDavina recently revealed she is stepping back from full-time work after her breast cancer diagnosis served as a stark wake-up call.\nThe TV star described the overhaul as essential after facing two major health scares in quick succession - a rare brain tumour in 2024, followed by cancer.\nSpeaking candidly on the Miss Me? podcast on Monday, the Masked Singer judge admitted the double health blow had forced her to confront a lifetime of running from change and overworking.\n'Change is something that all my life, I spent running away from,' she confessed. 'I absolutely hated it. Change was something that really frightened me. I always loved the status quo, knowing what I was doing and feeling safe in that.'\nFor over three decades, Davina has maintained a punishing schedule, fronting everything from Big Brother and Long Lost Family to The Masked Singer and My Mum, Your Dad. \nBut the mother-of-three revealed her perspective has shifted dramatically following her recent health battles, acknowledging that her most significant personal growth has emerged from difficult periods.\n'What has happened, actually, is that I have realised that all my really big growth has come from change - and often quite painful change,' she said.\nDavina, who married hairdresser Michael Douglas, 49, last month, explained while her brain tumour had initially prompted reflection about reducing stress, it was the subsequent breast cancer diagnosis that truly forced her hand.\n\nDavina recently revealed she is stepping back from full-time work after her breast cancer diagnosis served as a stark wake-up call\n\nFor over three decades, Davina has maintained a punishing schedule, fronting everything from Big Brother to The Masked Singer (pictured with fellow judge Maya Jama) \n\nDavina underwent an operation to remove a colloid cyst in her brain last year and almost one year later found a lump on her breast\n'I had an amazing breakthrough when I got clean in the early nineties,' she said, referring to her heroin and alcohol addiction in her twenties. \n'I had another huge breakthrough after I had my brain tumour removed. I realised that I needed to de-stress my life.\n'Interestingly, I realised that - but then the breast cancer, which I thought was a very, very frightening thing, made me realise that I really, really had to put that into place. And I have now.'\nShe continued: 'I'm going to work a four-day week. I feel so much better now about my life and trying to get it more balanced.\n'So now, really, as I hit this stage of my life, I want to take more care of myself. That is my latest project: me, because I can't take care of anyone else if I'm not okay.'\nThe 14mm growth was discovered during a health scan offered as part of her menopause advocacy work. \nFollowing a six-hour operation, Davina spent several days in intensive care before making what doctors described as a remarkable recovery.\nShe shares three children - Holly, 24, Tilly, 22, and Chester, 19 - with ex-husband Matthew Robertson, a former Pet Rescue presenter.\nThe couple were married for 17 years before divorcing in 2017, and have maintained an amicable co-parenting relationship.\nLast month, she married Michael, whom she has been dating since 2019. The couple tied the knot in a low-key ceremony in London, with Davina later sharing that the experience of facing serious illness had only strengthened their bond.\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year\n\nBreast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated?\nWhat is breast cancer?\nIt comes from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts.\nWhen the breast cancer has spread into surrounding tissue it is called 'invasive'. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.\nMost cases develop in those over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men, though this is rare.\nStaging indicates how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.\nThe cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast-growing. High-grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.\nWhat causes breast cancer?\nA cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'.\nAlthough breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance, such as genetics.\nWhat are the symptoms of breast cancer?\nThe usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most are not cancerous and are fluid-filled cysts, which are benign. \nThe first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.\nHow is breast cancer diagnosed?\n\nInitial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammogram, a special X-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours.\nBiopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer.\nIf you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest X-ray.\n\nHow is breast cancer treated?\nTreatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.\n\nSurgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumour.\nRadiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops them from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery.\nChemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying.\nHormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the 'female' hormone oestrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer.\nHow successful is treatment?\nThe outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.\nThe routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 71 means more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.\nFor more information visit breastcancernow.org or call its free helpline on 0808 800 6000\nDavina McCallThe Masked Singer Australia\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall fights back tears as she reveals she has finished radiotherapy after breast cancer diagnosis\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 221\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email: john.james@dailymail.co.uk \nBy JOHN JAMES, SENIOR REPORTER and JOHN SIDDLE \n Published:12:43 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:16:40 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nA family who built a 5ft hill in their back garden have been ordered to flatten it and demolish a granny annexe after losing a war with the council.\nRom Panday, 63, raised the level of his back garden to make it more accessible, a move he says was intended to ensure his outdoor space was easier to use in older age.\nThe revamp also saw an outbuilding constructed at the end of his garden near Charlton, south London.\nBut despite no complaints from neighbours on either side of his semi-detached home, council planners launched enforcement action ordering him to raze the structure and return the garden to its original level.\nGreenwich council officers claimed raising the ground invaded neighbours' privacy, because Mr Panday could easily see into their gardens.\nBut residents have revealed the did not object to the development and described Mr Panday as a 'good neighbour'.\nAhmed Abdi, who has lived next door for two decades, told the Daily Mail: 'I don't see any problem with it at all. I don't think they're invading any privacy on my side.\n'I didn't complain at all. They're good neighbours. I don't see any problem.\n\nThe Panday family claim they raised the height of their garden by 1.5meters to 'make it more accessible' \n\nRom Panday (far right) and his family, who have lived in their Greenwich home for over years are now battling their council \n\nAerial pictures of the new garden show a large annex raised at the back of the space\n'It's up to them, what the council decide, but if you ask me I don't have any problem.\n'They're good neighbours, and I don't have any issue with the extension.'\nThe enforcement notice, issued in June 2023, accused Mr Panday of carrying out unauthorised development, including the erection of a concrete and brick outbuilding and the raising of ground levels across his rear garden.\nThe annexe - measuring approximately 7 metres wide and 4 metres deep - sits at the far end of the garden, while the ground level across the entire plot was raised by around 1.5 metres.\nMr Panday appealed the decision, arguing that the council had overstated the scale of the works and that the changes caused no real harm.\nHe argued that the steps down to the original garden could become difficult in older age.\nHowever, the planning inspector dismissed the appeal, despite admitting: 'Adjoining neighbours are supportive.'\n\nJoin the debate\nShould councils have the power to overrule supportive neighbours on private home improvements?Comment now\n\nThe unassuming family home has become a battleground for Greenwich council \n\nPiles of dirt can be seen on the edge of the newly raised garden \n\nWhen approached by the Mail, Mr Panday declined to comment further on the matter \nIn her written verdict, Ms Watson concluded that the raised garden created a 'much more intensive form of overlooking' than would normally be acceptable.\nShe said: 'The resultant garden levels enable anyone standing in the garden to look down onto the full length of the gardens on either side at very close range.'\nThe annexe itself escaped some criticism, with the inspector finding that its windows did not directly overlook neighbouring homes.\nBut Ms Watson ruled that the very act of walking along the entire length of the raised garden to access the building caused a loss of privacy for neighbours.\nAlthough the inspector acknowledged that Mr Panday’s neighbours supported him, she ruled her decision must also consider future residents.\nMr Panday, who declined to speak, was handed nine months to return the garden to its original state, demolish his annexe and remove all construction debris.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFamily in £500k home at war with council after building five foot HILL in back garden and erecting granny annexe at the top\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 254\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

I always care.'\n\nNicole Scherzinger showed off her incredible physique in a skimpy yellow and pink bikini as she frolicked on the beach during a getaway to the Maldives in a clip shared to Instagram on Friday\n\nTaking to Instagram on Friday, Nicole shared a video of herself running from their lavish villa out onto the sand before diving into the water\nIt comes days after Nicole and Thom looked completely loved-up as they posed for a fun Instagram post on Sunday.\nNicole and former rugby player Thom, who got engaged in July 2023, also hit back at fans who question why they still haven't got married yet. \n'Asking the universe for patience… and sunscreen,' she captioned her post.\nLast summer, Nicole revealed she would marry Thom when her stint in Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard musical on Broadway came to an end in 2025.\nSpeaking on US radio the star was asked if she will walk down the aisle soon, she explained: 'Yes, we will get married. We’re engaged to be married when I’m not working. Thank God he is so patient.\n'I’ve had to be disciplined to make sure I get six to eight hours [sleep] because my voice is my everything so I kind of live like a hermit. I don’t do much, I just drink a lot of water.' \nThom popped the question during their holiday in Portugal back in July 2023. \nTaking to Instagram to share the special moment at the time she captioned her post: 'I said yes,' along with a ring emoji. \n\nShe displayed her gym-honed figure in a triangle yellow and pink patterned two-piece bathing suit\n\nShe captioned the clip, which had Icona Pop's I Love It playing over it: 'Oh I care. I always care'\n\nThe snaps showed the moment Thom got down on one knee with the ring, and the moment they embraced after she said yes. \nStruggling to hide her shock as Thom got down on one knee, Nicole stunned in a blue and white paisley dress for the memorable moment.\nNicole first met ex-Glasgow Warriors rugby league player Thom when she was a judge on a celebrity edition of the X Factor in 2019 - and they soon hit it off.\nBack in 2022 a friend of the couple told the Daily Mail's Richard Eden that the pair would definitely be getting married, with Thom knowing Nicole was 'the one' since they met.\n\nThe singer, 47, is currently enjoying a luxurious romantic trip to the Maldives with her rugby player fiancé Thom Evans \n\nThe couple looked completely loved-up as they posed for a fun Instagram post on Sunday\nThom said: 'Within the first couple of days with Nicole it was just awesome, and it has been awesome ever since.'\nNicole previously enjoyed an eight-year, on-off relationship with Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and a shorter romance with tennis player Grigor Dimitrov.\nWhile Thom's former girlfriends include model and actress Kelly Brook - who herself is set to wed boyfriend Jeremy Parisi 'in the coming weeks'.\nBut the pair have now found the one they plan to spend the rest of their lives with.\nNicole ScherzingerThom EvansInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicole Scherzinger shows off her incredible physique in a skimpy yellow and pink bikini as she frolics on the beach during Maldives getaway\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 157\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Goodbye to the pretence that we have morals about foreign policy and disapprove of those who force their will on sovereign countries. Goodbye to the idea that free men and women stand up to bullies to preserve our freedom.\n\nAnd goodbye to all the pious humbug about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which so many politicians and media figures, from Nato enthusiasts to the sort of people who wear Make America Great Again baseball caps, claimed to disapprove of. But they didn’t really. They just objected when Russia did it.\n\nThey had mostly proved this already, by their ‘see no evil’ response to the lawless, Western-condoned overthrow of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. But because most people, to this day, do not know how Mr Yanukovych was toppled, they got away with that.\n\nDonald Trump has imposed his will on Venezuela through the use of naked state force. As far as we can discover, dozens of Cuban and Venezuelan members of president Nicolas Maduro’s palace guard died trying to defend him, though we have been shown no film of the combat.\n\nAlso injured in the struggle was Mrs Cilia Maduro, who was paraded in New York with a bruised face and sticking plaster on her forehead, and who complained to a judge of a suspected broken rib.\n\nI wonder if any of the American special forces supermen who took Senora Maduro into custody will get a medal for tackling this dangerous Caracas tigress. Perhaps the hero of this particular skirmish is still in hospital.\n\nNobody of any importance dares to oppose or criticise Mr Trump outright for what is obviously a breach of the basic rules of civilisation. Nor does anyone (including Mr Trump) know where he will strike next.\n\nThat is why the great men and women of democratic Europe now mumble and quibble about the President’s shameless putsch in Caracas, but do not condemn it outright as they would have if Vladimir Putin had done something similar.\n\nMr Putin, smirking into his sleeve, humorously allows his Foreign Ministry to denounce the action as an ‘act of armed aggression’, ‘unacceptable violation of sovereignty’, and a breach of international law. But just you wait and see what the Kremlin says to any American official who in future condemns Russia’s Ukraine invasion.\n\nPresident Trump has himself called his own action ‘one of the most precise attacks on sovereignty’, at his triumphal press conference last Saturday. So even his most servile apologists of all kinds can’t claim it wasn’t such a thing. And what a ludicrous event it was. It is almost impossible to like, on any grounds at all.\n\nEven on its own terms it pays a huge, lasting price for a very small achievement. He has replaced an awkward Marxist despot with a servile Marxist despot, and to hell with the people of Venezuela.\n\nThe actual leaders of Venezuelan democracy are still out in the cold. Nobody really knows what happens if acting president Delcy Rodriguez is not obedient enough to pacify Mr Trump and his whim of iron.\n\nPresident Trump’s fulminations about Maduro’s alleged drug trafficking are comically hypocritical. A few weeks ago, he pardoned the ex-president of Honduras, Juan Hernandez, who had been serving 45 years in an American prison.\n\nUS prosecutors had said he was a central figure in a huge drug-trafficking scheme that sent hundreds of tons of cocaine into the US, and a Manhattan jury convicted him. Mr Trump apparently believes that this was a ‘set up’ by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nIs Mr Trump any more concerned about drugs than he is about democracy or aggression? Probably not. Only three weeks ago, he greatly weakened US federal laws against marijuana, despite growing mountains of evidence linking this drug with incurable mental illness, and violent crimes committed by those it has driven crazy.\n\nAnd if Mr Trump objects to rigged elections so much, perhaps he might get his special forces to pay a visit to his friend Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, an oil despot and US ally. Azerbaijan recently ethnically cleansed thousands of Armenians from disputed territory, with some cruelty.\n\nMr Aliyev’s elections are famous for their absurdity and dishonesty, the most striking being the occasion in 2013 when the results (a government victory, amazingly enough) were leaked before voting had even started.\n\nMeanwhile the big garbage bins at the back of the White House are full to overflowing with discarded morals. These were once kept carefully polished and displayed in the Oval Office.\n\nNow they are forgotten and covered in eggshells, soggy cereal, Styrofoam burger containers and coffee grounds, waiting to be carted away to landfill or thrown into some furnace.\n\nI often wonder if Donald Trump has been sent into the world to teach us all a lesson we seem to need very badly. That lesson is that, if we worship human power and wealth, and make up the rules to suit ourselves, anarchy and death will come storming and yelling into our midst.\n\nThe great Irish poet William Butler Yeats, in his bitter, cruel poem, The Second Coming, suggested that our new pagan age was witnessing the birth of a thuggish god of wealth and power and luxury, perhaps better-suited to our desires than Christianity has been. Yeats asked: ‘What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?’\n\nIn words which always haunt me, he described it as having ‘a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun’, words which somehow come to mind quite often these days. Who do they remind me of?\n\nAnd we must ask whether this new Trumpised United States, on which this unprecedented President imposes his will more and more, is beginning to embody his nature and character at home as well as abroad.\n\nI do not think any open-minded person can look on film of the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis without a shudder. Did the man who fired those shots think he was doing the will of his President? Should such things happen in a law-governed country?\n\nWe are seeing something quite new in the world, born out of what has often been justified frustration, but no less ugly and menacing for that.","summary":"Goodbye to all that then.

Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LILY JOBSON, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:15:50 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:16:17 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nKatie Price has revealed she spent New Year's Eve with ex-boyfriend JJ Slater before they split after almost two years together.\nDaily Mail revealed how the former glamour model, 47, ended the romance after realising she didn't see a future with the former reality star, 14 years her junior.\nInsiders say cracks in their relationship had become 'too obvious to ignore' in recent months, despite Katie insisting they were going strong.\nAnd it appears the break up happened just days ago as she shared that they spent the New Year together in her recent YouTube video, she posted on Saturday.\nThe Married At First Sight star, 32, appeared in the clip with her son Harvey, 23, and daughter Princess, 18. \nKatie and JJ began dating in February 2024, after JJ rose to fame on E4's Married At First Sight UK. \n\nKatie Price, 47, has revealed she spent New Year's Eve with ex-boyfriend JJ Slater, 32, before they split after almost two years together\n\nDaily Mail revealed how the former glamour model ended the romance after realising she didn't see a future with the former reality star, 14 years her junior\nKatie even spoke of having a child together, her sixth, but in the end, it wasn't meant to be.\nA source previously told Daily Mail: 'Katie has had doubts for some time about whether JJ is husband material, but she hoped those concerns would fade. \n'Instead, her fears only grew, and she's now accepted the relationship will not end with her walking down the aisle for a fourth time.\n'JJ was left disappointed and has already packed his bags and moved back to his home in Essex. \n'He genuinely saw a future with Katie, but it seems she ultimately had a very different outlook.'\nThe Daily Mail contacted Katie and JJ's representatives for comment at the time. \nFashion entrepreneur JJ had appeared on the 2023 series of Married At First Sight UK, where he made headlines for dating transgender bride Ella Morgan despite marrying another contestant during the experiment.\nKatie has been married three times, to singer Peter Andre, 52, with whom she shares children Junior, 20, and Princess, former cage fighter Alex Reid, 50, and personal trainer Kieran Hayler, 38, the father of her youngest two children, Jett, 12, and Bunny, 10.\nShe is also mother to son Harvey, whom she shares with footballer Dwight Yorke, 54. \n\nThe Married At First Sight star appeared in the clip with her son Harvey, 23, and daughter Princess, 18 (pictured January 2025) \n\nJJ had appeared on the 2023 series of Married At First Sight UK, where he made headlines for dating transgender bride Ella Morgan despite marrying another contestant\n\n Katie Price makes an X-rated confession as she reveals a very awkward encounter with an ex-boyfriend \nJJ supported Katie through a number of health scares in recent months, as fans voiced concern over her increasingly skinny and gaunt appearance and her continued fixation with cosmetic surgery.\nIt comes after Katie insisted 'I don't need a man' after splitting from her boyfriend.\nSpeaking on the latest episode of her podcast, The Katie Price Show, the star said: 'Years ago, I was always afraid of being on my own. I always felt I needed someone. \n'How I am now, I always say, I don't need a man. If I want a man, it's because I want them. I don't need a man, whereas years before, I needed a man.' \nHowever, insiders are less convinced by Katie's proclamation that she is happy being single and say she will be back in a new relationship in no time. \nA source told the Mirror: 'She wants to find a husband and can't cope without being with a partner. It wouldn't be surprising if she hasn't got someone lined up already.\n'It will last three seconds. Her family are concerned she will throw herself deep into another relationship and put the pressure on again to get married, like she has with JJ. You can't force someone to get married, you can't force someone to love you.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKatie Price reveals she spent New Year's Eve with Married At First Sight star JJ Slater before they split after almost two years together\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 81\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy DOLLY BUSBY SHOWBUSINESS CORRESPONDENT \n Published:09:50 GMT, 10 January 2026 |Updated:19:46 GMT, 10 January 2026 \n\nA candle-lit ceremony in a beautiful, historic setting? Tick. An enviably stylish, high-fashion wedding dress? Tick. A gaggle of celebrity guests? But of course...\nHolly Ramsay worked tirelessly to produce her dream wedding to triple Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty at Bath Abbey just over a week ago.\nAnd now she’s been rewarded with pages of coverage in the latest online edition of British Vogue, which allowed the 25-year-old to gush at length about her ‘perfect’ weekend - from the Elie Saab gown that made her ‘feel like a princess’ to the special menu and red-wine pairings devised by her very own Michelin-starred chef, father Gordon, and a team from the Savoy.\nThe glittering wedding breakfast took place at Kin House, a Georgian pile in Wiltshire, which costs £30,000 to rent for the weekend.\nThere, amid the celebrations, 25-year-old Holly made sure to pose for the cameras along alongside family friends Sir David Beckham and wife Victoria, who just happened to have designed the bridesmaids’ dresses.\nThrow in a blubbing prince-charming husband, and it’s clear no woman could possibly ask for more - or so you might think from the acres of photography in Vogue’s glossy ‘buy up’ of the Ramsay-Peaty nuptials.\n\nHolly Ramsay worked tirelessly to produce her dream wedding to triple Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty at Bath Abbey just over a week ago\n\nA day of seamless happiness and joy? Well... I’m not so sure. What I witnessed on the day was a young woman wracked with nerves, a grumpy father and an ostentatious event overshadowed by a very public and decidedly toxic family feud\nA day of seamless happiness and joy? Well... I’m not so sure. What I witnessed on the day was a young woman wracked with nerves, a grumpy father and an ostentatious event overshadowed by a very public and decidedly toxic family feud.\nThe mood was set from the off. Standing among the onlookers outside, I’d hoped to see a blushing bride emerge from a Rolls-Royce to enter through the doors of the medieval Abbey towards her date with destiny.\n\nIn reality, Holly was half an hour late and climbed out of the car with a look of pure anxiety on her face.\nWas she troubled by the hundreds of spectators who’d gathered outside Bath Abbey? Unlikely. Surely, she knew that holding her much-anticipated and talked-about wedding in an ancient British landmark two days after Christmas would draw a crowd.\nOr perhaps she’d twigged that most were passers-by who’d stopped to take a look because they’d heard the Beckhams might be turning up. When I explained to members of the crowd they were witnessing the wedding of Holly Ramsay and Adam Peaty, many replied: ‘Who?’\nBarely acknowledging the shouts of ‘congratulations’, Holly’s eyes were downcast, face fixed, as she walked towards the entrance.\nMeghan Markle famously remarked on the size of the crowd outside Windsor Castle when she married Prince Harry in 2018. ‘So much fun!’ she exclaimed as she made her way up to St George’s Chapel. Not ‘so much fun’ for Holly, from the looks of it.\nFather Gordon, a media pro after four decades as a television chef, did a little better, shouting ‘Merry Christmas’ to the well-wishers.\nLooking back, Holly might come to regret passing up the chance of slipping into the Abbey through the back door like the Beckhams.\n\nThe mood was set from the off. Standing among the onlookers outside, I’d hoped to see a blushing bride emerge from a Rolls-Royce to enter through the doors of the medieval Abbey towards her date with destiny\n\nIn reality, Holly was half an hour late and climbed out of the car with a look of pure anxiety on her face\nBut there were pictures to be taken and sold - and that meant ensuring that no one caught so much as a glimpse of the wedding dress, which would have spoiled the surprise for Vogue and its readers.\nHence the curious hooded silk shroud-like ensemble that Holly clasped around herself as she was helped from the car by her 59-year-old father.\n\nAnd hence the sudden appearance of black umbrellas, a phalanx of them hiding the bride from the prying eyes on the street.\nIt is a technique used by A-listers at the annual Met Gala in New York, but possibly a first for Bath Abbey.\nAdam, meanwhile, is learning fast. The Olympic gold-medallist joined the books of Holly’s influencer agency, Hypesight, just a few weeks before the wedding.\nIt describes him as follows: ‘Adam embodies a modern standard of ambition, refinement, and influence that naturally aligns with high-end, luxury brands.’\nThat, presumably, includes Rolls-Royces. But even the cars proved contentious on the couple’s big day.\nIt turns out that Gordon wanted to use his own flashy sports car when father and daughter made the half-hour journey to the Abbey from Kin House, where they’d spent the night. But Holly had insisted on the Rolls-Royce.\n\nPerhaps she’d twigged that most were passers-by who’d stopped to take a look because they’d heard the Beckhams might be turning up\nSo, determined to have a least a bit of his own way, the TV chef ensured his car was waiting for him outside the Abbey when the ceremony, and the Vogue photoshoot, were over.\nThis caused much annoyance to Bath traffic wardens who had a heated back-and-forth with Ramsay’s driver, insisting the chef’s car was not allowed to sit in a bus lane for more than two hours. Somehow, Gordon Ramsay won that skirmish. The car stayed.\nThe real animus of the day, of course, was the one between Clan Ramsay and the groom’s family, the Peatys, most of whom were excluded from Adam and Holly’s wedding.\nThere have been reports the family feuding first began some months ago when Holly took against the dress that Adam’s mother, Caroline, had been due to wear for the occasion.\nFrom what I saw of the wedding as it unfolded, Holly seemed very much in charge of the event despite her anxiety - and I can imagine she might have had strong views...\nTwo members of the Peaty family were allowed to attend: Adam’s older sister Bethany, 32, who has sided with the Ramsays, and his five-year-old son, George, from a previous relationship.\nHolding tight on to his father’s hand as they walked into the Abbey together, the little boy was clearly disturbed by the crowds and flashing cameras. Understandably, he tried to hide behind his dad.\nIt must have been something of an ordeal. After the 70-minute ceremony, George had to spend another hour inside the Abbey in the company of Vogue photographers.\n\nThe real animus of the day, of course, was the one between Clan Ramsay and the groom’s family, the Peatys, most of whom were excluded from Adam and Holly’s wedding\n\nThere have been reports the family feuding first began some months ago when Holly took against the dress that Adam’s mother, Caroline, had been due to wear for the occasion\nThe resulting pictures tell a carefully crafted story of a wedding and a party crammed with celebrities.\nIn reality, it was a small handful of famous folk in attendance, including the Beckhams.\nIn addition to the Beckham family (minus Brooklyn and wife Nicola, of course) Dan Walker, the Channel 5 presenter, can be seen chatting with Dragon’s Den-star Sara Davies. Gordon is pictured laughing with his chef pals Marcus Wareing and Paul Ainsworth.\nBut that, when it came to stardust, was pretty much that.\nNot that Holly’s pursuit of the perfect occasion shows any sign of slowing down.\nIt’s been more than ten days since the couple tied the knot but Holly has decided that people want to see yet more of those painstaking preparations.\nYesterday [TUE] she shared a video that shows her heading into Smythson, the upmarket leather goods and stationary shop. Holly captioned it: ‘Designing our wedding stationery with Smythson was a dream come true, it all added the perfect touch to our weekend.’\nDoes she have some sort of commercial deal with Smythson?
