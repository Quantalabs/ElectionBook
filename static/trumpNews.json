Harris had just two events Saturday, one in Atlanta and one in Charlotte, at a time when campaigns are blanketing swing states with candidates and surrogates.\n\nHarris kept closely to her schedule as she went from city to city. It wasn’t until she was in mid-air that advisors told the press pool traveling with Harris that she would be going to New York – and even then they would not say why.\n\nTellingly, seats had been made available aboard Air Force 2, a Boeing 757, for four still photographers. The campaign avoided directly confirming her plans on the record, although it became obvious when the candidate motorcaded from New York’s LaGuardia airport to Rockefeller Center, where NBC has its studios and the show is filmed. \n\nEarlier this week, Harris failed to lock in an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan – another platform to reach the masses. \n\nHe interviewed Donald Trump just over a week ago to record ratings of over 17 million views on YouTube in less than 24 hours.\n\nSNL gets less than five million views per episode, so her appearance tonight will reach considerably fewer Americans than a Rogan sit-down would have, although perhaps on more favorable terrain.\n\nRogan confirmed that Harris refused to come on his podcast over scheduling conflicts and a clash about how long the interview would last.\n\nThe podcast host opened up about why the ‘very difficult’ VP had failed to appear on his popular show that boasts 14 million subscribers and 18 million YouTube followers.\n\nLast month, fans of Saturday Night Live were up in arms over a sketch they say sought to save face for Kamala Harris after her ‘disastrous’ interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. \n\nThe skit saw a recently cleared Alec Baldwin assume the role of Baier in a surprise appearance. \n\nThe cold open contained several instances of Baldwin’s Baier interrupting Rudolph, painting the personality’s line of questioning as combative.\n\nMultiple onlookers online, however, remained unconvinced, claiming the display was a lame attempt at eliciting a more favorable judgment in the court of public opinion.\n\n‘Well, Kamala is collapsing in the polls so a desperate @nbcsnl brought out its big “guns,”‘ wrote one such user on X.\n\n‘Yes, that was @AlecBaldwin playing the Fox News journalist! Too soon?’ they then asked, referencing the regular host’s recently wrapped manslaughter case.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Harris campaign advisors came back mid-flight after her rally in North Carolina to inform the press pool that she would be stopping in New York on the way to Detroit, Michgian.\n\nAides initially did not respond directly to questions about what she will be doing in NYC.\n\nBut the Harris motorcade pulled up to the Rockefeller Center just before 8 p.m., where SNL is famously taped.\n\nHarris still plans to head to Detroit after the surprise SNL diversion where she has a morning rally on Sunday.\n\nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris are spending their final weekend on the campaign trail with just three days before what could be one of the closest elections in history.\n\nMore than 70 millions of Americans have already cast their ballots, but the candidates are still pushing to persuade the final critical voters who could take them to victory. \n\nDailyMail.com’s polling partners J.L. Partners show Harris has the momentum going into sprint before November 5, with the race trending into tossup territory. \n\nBoth held rallies earlier Saturday in the critical swing state of North Carolina where the polls have the race deadlocked. \n\nTrump also took the stage in Virginia, where he is trailing in the polls. \n\nHe has another rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, this evening.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris added a previously unannounced stop in New York&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-makes-surprise-appearance-on-saturday-night-live-after-campaign-plane-is-redirected-to-nyc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-campaign-plane-redirected-to-NYC-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 01:07:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":262090542,"title":"Kamala Harris will appear on SNL in last episode before presidential election","text":"NEW YORK — Vice President Kamala Harris has made an unannounced trip to New York to appear on “ Saturday Night Live,” briefly stepping away from the battleground states where she’s been campaigning with just three days to go before the election.\n\nHarris departed on Air Force Two after a campaign stop on Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina.

President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady @MELANIATRUMP want to Make America Healthy Again.”\n\n Fluoride is added to water to help protect the enamel on teeth, and prevents cavities, helping them become stronger and to fend off decay, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the CDC does not mandate water fluoridation, the U.S. Public Health Service provides a recommended fluoridation level, and most water already has naturally-occurring fluoride. And some communities choose to supplement to the recommended 0.7 mg/L, though it is not required. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends that drinking water contain less than 2.0 mg/L of fluoride with the intention of preventing dental fluorosis (a condition that can affect children under age eight while their teeth are still developing), less than one percent of the U.S. population is exposed to that level of fluoride. \n\n RFK Jr.’s tweet linked to a video from a lawyer involved in a long-running lawsuit, which did recently find some concern over fluoride, though more research has been recommended. In September, a federal court in California ruled against the EPA, ordering it to take action over potential health risks from its current fluoride level recommendations. The ruling came following a nearly decade-long court battle with anti-fluoride groups, which include the Fluoride Action Network. The judge cited a review by the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) recent toxicology report, which concluded that “higher levels” of fluoride is now linked to lowered IQ in children, though the report also said more research is needed.\n\n The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) questioned the NIH report, given other reviews have produced different conclusions. The AAP, along with other expert groups, continue to recommend the use of fluoride toothpaste combined with fluoridated water to protect teeth from cavities. Fluoride has been added to some water systems in the U.S. since as early as 1945.\n\n Despite RFK touting numerous other health-related conspiracy theories such as vaccines being linked to autism, RFK’s fluoride comment came around when the GOP presidential nominee was discussing the role he planned for “Bobby” if he were to win the election. “Bobby is going to be working on the food and the pesticides and all of the things [in health],” Trump said. He added that they were on a plane yesterday where they discussed RFK Jr.’s role. “I told him, Bobby, look, here’s the story. You can work on food. You can work on anything you want. He wants health. He wants women’s health. He wants men’s health. He wants kids — he wants everything.”\n\n Trump then explained that RFK Jr. can’t handle “our liquid gold, I’m handling that.” He quipped: “Bobby, so have fun with the pesticides, but the liquid gold you’ll have to leave with me. We’ll do very well.”","summary":"“Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss,” the oft-health conspiracy theorist claims","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-health-pick-rfk-jr-removing-fluoride-from-water-1235151497/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RFKJR-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 01:03:22","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":262090572,"title":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office.\n\nFluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.\n\nKennedy made the declaration on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.\n\n“On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S​. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, “want to Make America Healthy Again,” he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Kennedy discussed Saturday’s post with Trump or his aides. Neither Trump’s campaign nor a spokesperson for Kennedy responded to questions Saturday evening. \n\nBut the sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump’s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.\n\nIn 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.\n\nOfficials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.\n\nIn August, a federal agency determined “with moderate confidence” that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.\n\nA federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it’s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn’t say what those measures should be.\n\nIn his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.\n\nKennedy’s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.\n\nWhat role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy. \n\nKennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin. \n\nTrump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: “You can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.\n\n“He wants health, he wants women’s health, he wants men’s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added.","summary":"Robert F","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ap-donald-trump-phoenix-melania-trump-food-and-drug-administration-b2640416.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/03/00/Election_2024_Trump_68950.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:53:07","author":"Jonathan J.

Kennedy Jr. has been joining Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President ... [+] Donald Trump on Trump's Presidential campaign trail. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWell, here’s something wild that former President Donald Trump said during his campaign event in New York City on October 27. Trump literally used the word “wild” when he told the crowd at Madison Square Garden what he would do with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., if the 45th President were to become the 47th. “I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,” said the 78-year-old Republican nominee. Looks like Trump might be oiling the wheels for Kennedy Jr. to determine what happens with health and science policy, operations and research in the U.S. government.\n\nSpeaking of oil, Trump did indicate one exception to what Kennedy, Jr. can go wild on: “The only thing I don’t think I’m going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet.”\n\nAll of this is in line with what Kennedy Jr. had told Tucker Carlson at an event Wisconsin in mid-September: “[Trump’s] asked me to help him end the childhood disease, chronic disease epidemic, and make Americans healthy again.” Kennedy Jr. also said that Trump wants Kennedy, Jr. to help chose the heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. “President Trump has asked me specifically to do two things,” Kennedy, Jr., asserted then. “One, to help unravel the capture of the agencies by corrupt influence. In other words, to drain the swamp.”\n\nSo, in less than a year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has gone from being a Democratic candidate for President to being an Independent candidate to potentially being part of the transition team for Trump. And should Trump re-take the White House, Kennedy, Jr. may go from making what FactCheck.org, a fact-checking project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania, described as a “trail of false and misleading claims on health topics such as vaccines, autism, and Covid-19” to helping Trump choose the next leaders of the U.S. government’s biggest health and scientific organizations.\n\nKennedy, Jr. also has the distinction of being named on of the “Disinformation Dozen” by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in 2021. It’s a distinction because there were only 12 of them. It’s also a distinction that one probably wouldn’t list on one’s resume. The Center for Countering Digital Hate described the Disinformation Dozen” as “twelve anti-vaxxers who play leading roles in spreading digital misinformation about Covid vaccines. They were selected because they have large numbers of followers, produce high volumes of anti-vaccine content or have seen rapid growth of their social media accounts in the last two months.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Cataclysmic Collapse’—Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk’s Radical $35.7 Trillion Plan To Avert ‘Financial Emergency’ Spurs Huge Bitcoin Price Bets\n\nFBI Warns Gmail, Outlook, AOL, Yahoo Users—Hackers Gain Access To Accounts\n\nNetflix’s Best Returning Show Arrives With High Critic Scores For Season 2\n\nHere are just a few examples of what Kennedy, Jr. has done and said over the years:\n\nClaiming in a Fox & Friends interview, “Vaccines are the only medical product that is not safety-tested prior to licensure.” That, of course, is not the case as vaccines cannot reach the U.S. market without undergoing clinical trials that produce results reviewed by the U.S. FDA.\n\nBlaming anti-depressants for school shootings, which was basically the headline of an article by Miles Klee for Rolling Stone. Kennedy, Jr. has not provided adequate scientific evidence to support this view. Daniel R. Stalder Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, wrote for Psychology Today that “shooters who were prescribed antidepressants...constitute less than a fourth of the mass shootings,” but guns “co-occur 100 percent of the time.”\n\nQuestioning on multiple occasions whether HIV is really a cause or the only cause of AIDS as described by an article in the New York magazine. There’s an abundance of evidence linking infection with the human immunodeficiency virus with AIDS. For example, a New England Journal of Medicine article entitled “The Discovery of HIV as the Cause of AIDS” detailed the steps that led to, well, basically what the title of the article said. By contrast, those denying HIV as the cause of AIDS have not produced adequate scientific evidence to support their views.\n\nRepeatedly suggesting that chemicals in water “making children gay or transgender and causing the feminization of boys and masculinization of girls,” as reported by Abby Turner and Andrew Kaczynski for CNN. See above about not providing adequate scientific evidence.\n\nAnd even though Kennedy, Jr. is a lawyer without any formal scientific training, he was quoted by David Remnick for the New Yorker as saying, “I don’t necessarily believe all the scientists, because I can read science myself. That’s what I do for a living. I read science critically.”\n\nReading science is one thing. Understanding science fully is another thing. Making scientific recommendations without providing adequate supporting scientific evidence is something totally different. And giving someone with no real scientific background the power to decide how the largest and most important U.S. governmental health and science institutions will be organized, led and run would be quite, well, wild. Doing so could end up threatening the well-being and lives of many, many people across the country.

She was scheduled to head to Detroit, but once the aircraft was in the air, aides said it was actually going to New York.\n\nHer appearance on the show was confirmed by three people familiar with Harris’ plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. It is the final SNL episode before Election Day on Tuesday.\n\nActor Maya Rudolph first played Harris on the show in 2019 and has reprised her role this season, doing a spot-on impression of the vice president, including calling herself “Momala.”\n\nRudolph opened the show’s season premiere with the line: “Well, well, well. Look who fell out of that coconut tree.” And she’s joked about keeping President Joe Biden in his place.\n\nHarris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, has been played by former cast member Andy Samberg and Biden is played by Dana Carvey, who also famously played then-President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s.\n\nRudolph’s performance has won critical and comedic acclaim — including from Harris herself.\n\n“Maya Rudolph — I mean, she’s so good,” Harris said last month on ABC’s “The View.” “She had the whole thing, the suit, the jewelry, everything!”\n\nHarris added that she was impressed with Rudolph’s “mannerisms.”\n\nPoliticians have a long history on SNL, including Harris’ Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, who hosted the show in 2015.\n\nHillary Clinton was running for president in the 2008 Democratic primary when she appeared next to Amy Poehler, who played her on the show and offered a trademark, exaggerated cackle. The real Clinton wondered during her appearance, “Do I really laugh like that?”\n\nClinton returned in 2016, while running against Trump in a race she ultimately lost.\n\nThe first sitting president to appear on Saturday Night Live was Republican Gerald Ford, who did so less than a year after the show debuted. Ford appeared on April 17, 1976, and declared the show’s famous opening, “Live from New York.”\n\nBarack Obama was still just a Democratic presidential candidate when he appeared in February 2008, and Republican Bob Dole made an appearance in 1996 — a mere 11 days after losing that year’s election to Democrat Bill Clinton. Dole consoled Norm Macdonald who played the Kansas senator on the show.\n\nThen there was Tina Fey’s 2008 impression of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin — and in particular her joke that “I can see Russia from my house.” It was so good that Fey won an Emmy award. Palin herself appeared on the show that season, in the weeks before the election.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The show airs at 11:30 p.m. ET (0330 GMT).\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nA \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance would add a surprise jolt ahead of the presidential election on Tuesday.\n\nThe long-running show separately hosted both Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, and featured Trump in 2004, long before he entered politics.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Harris and Trump's planes shared the tarmac in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe close encounter was a dramatic illustration of how the two candidates are focusing on a handful of states where Tuesday's U.S. presidential election will ultimately be won or lost.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nIt was the fourth day in a row that the candidates campaigned in the same state. Only seven states, including North Carolina, are seen as truly competitive. But a Des Moines Register poll released on Saturday showed Harris holding a surprise lead in Iowa, a state Trump won easily in the last two elections.\n\nHarris campaigned in Charlotte, North Carolina, with rock star Bon Jovi, while Trump held a rally in suburban Gastonia. It was not clear whether he was on his plane when Harris arrived.\n\nTrump and Harris stuck to familiar themes at their appearances.\n\nTrump said he would deport millions of immigrants if elected and warned that if Harris wins, \"Every town in America would be turned into a squalid, dangerous refugee camp.\"\n\nCampaigning in Atlanta, Harris said Trump would abuse his power if he returns to the White House.\n\n“This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power,\" she said.\n\nMore than 72 million Americans have already cast ballots, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, short of 2020's record early-voting pace during COVID-19, but still indicating a high level of voter enthusiasm.\n\nIn North Carolina, the western counties that were devastated by Hurricane Helene appeared to be voting at roughly the same rate as the rest of the state, according to Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer.\n\nTrump criticized the federal government's response to the disaster and repeated his false claim that aid had been diverted from the state to help immigrants entering the country.\n\n'BEAUTIFUL WHITE SKIN'\n\nAt a later rally in Salem, Virginia, a state that analysts say he is unlikely to win, Trump said he ran for office to rescue the economy from \"obliteration,\" even though it would have been easier to relax at one of his oceanfront resorts.\n\n\"I didn't need to be here today,\" he said. \"I could have been standing on that beach, my beautiful white skin getting nice and being smacked, being smacked in the face by a wave loaded up with salt water.\"\n\nTrump was joined on stage by women from a local college swim team who have objected to competing against transgender athletes. Some of Trump's TV ads have sought to capitalize on transgender controversies.\n\nHarris and Trump have very different policies on major issues including support for Ukraine and NATO, abortion rights, immigration, taxes, democratic principles and tariffs, which reflect the schisms between the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAdditional reporting by Richard Cowan and Ismail Shakil; Writing by Andy Sullivan and Costas Pitas; Editing by Heather Timmons, Daniel Wallis, Cynthia Osterman and Leslie Adler\n\nXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"Harris to appear on 'Saturday Night Live' in final days of U.S. election campaign, say sources  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-harris-head-north-carolina-us-election-campaigns-final-weekend-2024-11-02/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXJWGENUQ5JXTNJWIQB4J2LLEE.jpg?auth=35eb2d46ef903c98ab633366486d7ef24ae128e690cf57f3f901b3c62aaff65b&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:32:00","author":"James Oliphant,Nandita Bose","authors":["James Oliphant","Nandita Bose"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.14},{"id":262089256,"title":"Harris, Trump hold final rallies ahead of 5 November vote","text":"Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump have zeroed in on the Sun Belt as they embarked on a final weekend of campaigning to sway undecided voters in battleground states ahead of an extremely tight presidential race.\n\nBoth candidates pitched rival agendas on the economy and other issues that each insisted is what Americans want.\n\n“We have overcome every attack, every abuse and even two assassination attempts,” Trump said at a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina.\n\nTrump pledged to bring back the ‘American Dream’ and claimed that suburban Americans are “under attack” by criminals, vowing to deport millions of immigrants if he is elected. \n\nHe warned that if Harris wins, “every town in America would be turned into a squalid, dangerous refugee camp.”\n\nLater, Trump headed to Virginia, which isn’t considered a battleground state, but offered a similar message, telling supporters that there is no way he can lose and is on the cusp of “the greatest political victory in the history of our country.”\n\nTrump predicted he would win not just the Electoral College count but a majority of votes cast across the country, which he failed to do in two previous tries.\n\n“We’re going to win the popular vote,” Trump told the crowd. “I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote.”\n\nHarris, meanwhile, has been urging her supporters to vote early so she can be elected and provide the “new generation of leadership” that she argues she represents.\n\n“I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America,” she said during remarks at a rally at the Atlanta Civic Center parking lot.\n\nHarris warned her support base that if returned to the White House, Trump would abuse his power.\n\n“This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power,” she said.\n\nShe also pledged affordable housing and healthcare and promised to protect women’s reproductive rights.\n\nThe flurry of rallies at the weekend is part of a final, frenzied push by Harris, Trump, their running mates and their high-profile stand-ins to encourage people to vote early or in person on Election Day.\n\nWith the race on a knife edge, enthusiasm among Americans is reflected by the numbers who have turned out to vote early.\n\nThe University of Florida’s Election Lab puts the figure in excess of 70 million, well in excess of the number of early ballots cast in 2016 and 2012.\n\nHarris’ campaign hoped for a “high-impact” moment with a two-minute spot to air Sunday during NFL games on CBS and FOX, including the Green Bay Packers against the Detroit Lions, two swing state teams.\n\nIt shows Harris interacting with people during the campaign and talking directly to viewers.\n\n“Now I’m asking for your vote because as president I will get up every day and fight for the American people,” she says at the end.\n\nHarris also called her campaign and supporters “the promise of America.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race in summer when it became clear he could not win, was doing his part for the Democrats by making what could be his final 2024 campaign stop.\n\nBiden, who turns 82 this month, struck a nostalgic tone as he tried to help get out the vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz during an event at the carpenters’ local in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nBiden went off script to offer some especially blunt statements. After slamming Trump and his supporters on policy issues, the president added, “I know some of you guys are tempted to think he’s this macho guy. But, I’m serious, these are the kind of guys you’d like to smack in the ass.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, spoke wistfully, as he has at some of his recent rallies, about how after nearly a decade of campaigning, his final race is nearing its end.\n\n“We’re going to meet again many times I hope,” said the former president, who also was stopping in Salem, Virginia — not a battleground state — before returning to North Carolina for a late-night rally in Greensboro.\n\n“This has been the thrill of a lifetime for me and for you.”\n\nTracking the polls\n\nLike many other pollsters, 538, which Euronews is using for its election data, predicts an incredibly close race with Harris currently polling at 48% and Trump at just under 47%.\n\nThe final days of campaigning have focussed mainly on the crucial swing states, widely expected to decide the results of the election.\n\nThis year there are seven and they are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","summary":"The flurry of rallies at the weekend is part of a final, frenzied push by Harris, Trump, their running mates and their high-profile stand-ins to encourage people to vote early or in person on Election Day.

He warned that if Harris wins, \"every town in America would be turned into a squalid, dangerous refugee camp.\"Later, Trump headed to Virginia, which isn't considered a battleground state, but offered a similar message, telling supporters that there is no way he can lose and is on the cusp of \"the greatest political victory in the history of our country.\"Trump predicted he would win not just the Electoral College count but a majority of votes cast across the country, which he failed to do in two previous tries.\"We're going to win the popular vote,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I think we have a really good chance to win the popular vote.\"Harris, meanwhile, has been urging her supporters to vote early so she can be elected and provide the \"new generation of leadership\" that she argues she represents.\"I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America,\" she said during remarks at a rally at the Atlanta Civic Center parking lot.Harris warned her support base that if returned to the White House, Trump would abuse his power.\"This is someone who is increasingly unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and the man is out for unchecked power,\" she said.She also pledged affordable housing and healthcare and promised to protect women's reproductive rights.The flurry of rallies at the weekend is part of a final, frenzied push by Harris, Trump, their running mates and their high-profile stand-ins to encourage people to vote early or in person on Election Day.With the race on a knife edge, enthusiasm among Americans is reflected by the numbers who have turned out to vote early.The University of Florida's Election Lab puts the figure in excess of 70 million, well in excess of the number of early ballots cast in 2016 and 2012.Harris' campaign hoped for a \"high-impact\" moment with a two-minute spot to air Sunday during NFL games on CBS and FOX, including the Green Bay Packers against the Detroit Lions, two swing state teams.It shows Harris interacting with people during the campaign and talking directly to viewers.\"Now I'm asking for your vote because as president I will get up every day and fight for the American people,\" she says at the end.Harris also called her campaign and supporters \"the promise of America.\"President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race in summer when it became clear he could not win, was doing his part for the Democrats by making what could be his final 2024 campaign stop.Biden, who turns 82 this month, struck a nostalgic tone as he tried to help get out the vote for Harris and running mate Tim Walz during an event at the carpenters' local in Scranton, Pennsylvania.Biden went off script to offer some especially blunt statements. After slamming Trump and his supporters on policy issues, the president added, \"I know some of you guys are tempted to think he’s this macho guy. But, I'm serious, these are the kind of guys you’d like to smack in the ass.\"Trump, meanwhile, spoke wistfully, as he has at some of his recent rallies, about how after nearly a decade of campaigning, his final race is nearing its end.\"We're going to meet again many times I hope,\" said the former president, who also was stopping in Salem, Virginia — not a battleground state — before returning to North Carolina for a late-night rally in Greensboro.\"This has been the thrill of a lifetime for me and for you.”Tracking the pollsLike many other pollsters, 538, which Euronews is using for its election data, predicts an incredibly close race with Harris currently polling at 48% and Trump at just under 47%.The final days of campaigning have focussed mainly on the crucial swing states, widely expected to decide the results of the election.This year there are seven and they are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.","summary":"Harris calls Trump 'unstable', Trump warns Harris will turn US into a 'refugee camp'","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2024/11/03/harris-calls-trump-unstable-trump-warns-harris-will-turn-us-into-a-refugee-camp","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/82/90/32/1440x810_cmsv2_9367bb9b-eb89-5a0b-930c-5e4b686ffceb-8829032.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:18:58","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":262090238,"title":"Trump's 'Garbage' Stunt Fails Massively as Everyone Compares Him to Oompa Loompas Instead","text":"Donald Trump recently employed an unexpected campaign tactic by dressing as a garbage collector and riding on a garbage truck. According to reports, this action was a reaction to President Joe Biden's controversial comments in which he labeled Trump supporters 'garbage.' During a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Trump wore a bright orange safety vest, but instead of garnering compliments for his garbage collector costume, he faced backlash for his overall look and makeup.\n\nAs reported by Nicki Swift, social media users criticized the former president's look as one X user said, \"Trump goes any darker on the Oompa Loompa makeup and he’s going to have to deport himself.\" Another person wrote, \"Oompa Loompa is still trending because the world is laughing out loud after this photo went viral internally. Apparently, Donald Trump is auditioning as king of the Oompa Loompas with a MAGA Garbage Man schtick! How totally embarrassing for America! For shame!\"\n\nA third X user wrote, \"Happy Halloween Oompa Loompa … go vote or it’ll be even scarier next week. #HappyHalloween.\" A fourth person said, \"One of the best Oompah-Loompah Halloween costumes I've ever seen! #HappyHalloween.\" However, this wasn't the first instance of Trump facing backlash over his appearance.\n\nJust before his garbage truck stunt, Trump attended a rally in Pennsylvania on October 29. With the election looming, Trump appeared a bit frazzled, and his mismatched tan became a topic of conversation. Journalist Aaron Rupar highlighted this in a tweet that quickly gained traction online. He wrote, \"Look. At. Trump's Face. This is from his rally last night. My god.\" Several users in the comment section then pointed out Trump's uneven orange complexion.\n\nCircling back to his recent garbage collector look, several late-night hosts also took jibes at the GOP nominee. According to host Seth Meyers, while all politicians pander, Trump is the most obvious and regular panderer in American history who frequently uses costume play as one of his go-to tactics. Meyers believed that Trump would never succeed as a sanitation worker, as that role demands genuine responsibility and a good work ethic. Jimmy Kimmel also pointed out the absurdity of Trump continuing to wear the reflective vest at his rally afterward, jokingly suggesting that the 'garbage was riding the truck,' as reported by The Guardian.\n\nMeanwhile, after the controversial comments made by Biden went viral online, the current President clarified that his remarks during a video call on Tuesday night were misconstrued. The White House also emphasized that Biden was referring to just one lesser-known comedian who referred to Puerto Rico as a 'floating island of garbage' while entertaining the crowd at Madison Square Garden for Trump. Later on, Kamala Harris weighed in on Biden's comments earlier Wednesday. She told the reporters that she firmly opposes any criticisms aimed at individuals based on their voting choices, as reported by CNN.","summary":"&#34;The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Joe Biden had reportedly said about Donald Trump’s supporters previously.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-garbage-stunt-fails-massively-as-everyone-compares-him-to-oompa-loompas-instead","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/722774/uploads/6f34e2b0-98ee-11ef-a434-05d948632ea7_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:15:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":262088866,"title":"Kamala Harris May Flip State Donald Trump Won Twice, New Poll Suggests","text":"A new poll shows a shock reversal in the state of Iowa, with Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris taking the lead among likely voters just days ahead of the 2024 presidential election.The Des Moines Register on Saturday published the results of its most recent poll, finding that Harris took a three-point lead with 47 percent of likely voters saying they would choose her if the election were held today versus 44 percent saying they would choose Republican nominee Donald Trump.This still falls within the poll's margin of error, which is plus or minus 3.4 percent.Trump had held a four-point lead in the paper's previous poll from September and a staggering 18-point lead in a June poll when Trump was facing incumbent President Joe Biden.The former president won the state in the previous two elections, growing his lead from 51.15 percent in 2016 to 53.09 percent in 2020. The state voted twice for Barack Obama, and it voted for George W. Bush going into his second term after backing Al Gore in the 2000 election.However, J. Ann Selzer, president of Pollster Selzer & Company, the firm that conducted the poll, said in a release along with the results that she imagines it was \"hard for anybody to say they saw this coming.\"Newsweek reached out by email on Saturday evening to the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment.The poll included independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped out of the race in September and endorsed Trump. Kennedy tried to have his name taken off ballots, but he failed to get his name off the Iowa ballot.He kept his name on ballots in non-battleground states, such as New York, and encouraged voters to back him in those states.Kennedy picked up three percent of the responses in the Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll, making up the difference between Harris and Trump.The additional points went to other candidates, with fewer than one percent backing Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver and one percent saying they would just generally pick someone else.The pollsters determined that independent voters overall had started to break for Harris, particularly independent women voters, continuing the trend of an increasing gender gap among likely voters.The poll found women voters backing Harris by 56 percent to Trump's 36 percent. Male voters showed a similar but inverse pattern, favoring Trump by 52 percent to Harris' 38 percent.The Selzer & Co. survey included 808 likely Iowa voters, both those who had already cast ballots and those who said they would definitely vote.

Do Republicans have the edge?","text":"Four years ago, Deborah Scott played a key role in helping President Biden win Georgia, leading a band of mostly Black women to canvass, phone bank, even dance outside polling stations as part of a movement that helped flip this historically conservative Southern state blue. But even as the grassroots organizing dynamo hustles to get out the vote this year, she is not sure she and other Black and brown organizers can coax and inspire enough voters to the polls to deliver another win for Democrats. “I don't feel confident of anything,” the chief executive of Georgia STAND-UP said as she took a break Friday from bopping to Southern trap outside a polling station in a historic Black neighborhood of southwest Atlanta and waving a sign that said “YOU have the POWER.\" Scott’s team has 200 people calling and knocking on doors and has sent out more than 1.5 million text messages. On the last day of early voting, they had a DJ cranking out rap from Young Jeezy and Waka Flocka Flame, and a line of food trucks serving free French fries, Philly cheesesteaks and shaved ice. “We know that early voting is up all the way around, which is good,” Scott said. “We just want to make sure it's good votes — progressive votes.” Early voter turnout in Georgia has been historic. But after early voting wrapped up Friday with more than 4 million Georgians casting a ballot — 3% higher than in 2020 — it is still hard to predict who will win: GOP strategists point to the fact that early voters in this election skew white and older, demographics that typically vote Republican, while Democrats emphasize the high turnout of women and Democratic-leaning voters who did not vote in 2020. Some voters in Atlanta are confident of a Harris victory even as polls show Trump ahead in Georgia by about 1.5 percentage points, well within the margin of error. “It should not be this close,” Teddy Woodson, a 30-year-old student, said after he cast his ballot for Harris at a library in Southwest Atlanta. “She should be winning by a landslide, but I know she’s going to win. … I can't wait for Tuesday, when we get to victory.” Others said they were concerned that Trump had won over a large number of voters across rural Georgia. “I’m hopeful, but I’m also trepidatious and scared about what the possible outcome is going to be,” Maisha Baucham said as she exited the polling station. The 50-year-old judicial administrator who lives in Atlanta’s historic West End, said whenever she left the city to drive out to neighboring counties for her son’s soccer games, she saw a growing number of Trump signs. Most experts agree that early voting data cannot be compared to 2020, an outlier year because of the pandemic. After President Biden won in Georgia by fewer than 12,000 votes in 2020, Republicans realized they made a tactical error by pushing their supporters away from early voting. This year, the strongest surge in voter turnout in Georgia isn’t in the Democratic bastions of metro Atlanta, but in rural red counties, such as Pickens County, a North Georgia county that voted 82% for Trump in 2020 and has seen 157% more early voters this year. With turnout among Black voters, who make up a third of Georgia’s population and form the backbone of the state’s Democratic Party, making up just 26% of the early vote, some Republicans are confident Trump will prevail on election day. “Trump's on a pathway to winning Georgia,” said Brian Robinson, a GOP strategist and former communications director for former Gov. Nathan Deal. “Democrats have to have a really incredible election day to win, because the Black vote is nowhere near where it needs to be for Democrats to win statewide.” But Democrats counter that Black voter turnout is not as low as it appears. Tom Bonier, chief executive of TargetSmart, a Democratic firm that specializes in political data, said part of the lag in Black voter turnout is because Georgia recently changed its rules, allowing registered voters to register as “other” for their race. His modeling assumes a portion of the 9.5% of “other” early voters are Black and estimates Black turnout at 29% — about 2 percentage points lower than 2020. “There's no doubt there's a lag there,” Bonier said. “But that's driven primarily by the fact that you just have white voters pivoting from election day to early voting. It's not new votes.” In a promising sign for Democrats, women have voted early in greater numbers than men: Nearly 56% of those who cast ballots were women, compared with 44% men. But although women have gravitated away from Trump after his Supreme Court appointees helped overturn Roe vs. Wade in 2022, the Trump campaign is trying to make a last-ditch appeal to Georgia women. On Saturday evening, Lara Trump joined South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and other female Trump supporters in Atlanta for a “Team Trump Women’s Tour.” Democrats are also outpacing Republicans in new voters: 11% of likely Democratic votes were those who didn’t vote in 2020, Bonier noted, compared to less than 10% on the Republican side. “The fact that Democrats have generated more new voters than Republicans is really a good sign for Democratic intensity,” Bonier said. “Otherwise, it's just Republicans shifting votes around and they're losing election day votes.” Touching down in Atlanta Saturday for a rally with film director Spike Lee and rapper 2 Chainz, Harris told her supporters they had hard work ahead. “Atlanta, we have three days to get this thing done, and no one can sit on the sidelines,” she said. “Let's knock on doors, let's text, let's call voters. Let's reach out to family and friends and classmates and neighbors and co-workers and new play cousins.” Harris described Trump, who will hold a rally Sunday in Macon, Ga., as “increasingly unstable” and “out for unchecked power.” “We have an opportunity in this election to finally turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump,” Harris said. “He’s trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We’re done with that. We’re exhausted.” “We’re not going back!” the crowd chanted. The trajectory of Georgia’s political realignment has been dramatic over the last decade and a half as its population has swelled from 9.6 million to 10.7 million and a growing number of Asians and Latinos have moved to the state as Black people have migrated from northern cities. Nearly 12% of its population is now foreign born. In 2012, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney won Georgia by 8 percentage points; in 2016, Trump won by 5 percentage points. In 2020, Biden won by fewer than 12,000 votes. But that doesn’t mean Democratic victories in Georgia are inevitable. Republicans scored key victories in 2022, with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp beating Democrat Stacey Abrams by more than 7 percentage points. \"We lean red, and and that only applies when we have a good candidate and the Democrats don't,\" Robinson said. \"A really good Democrat and a bad Republican, the Democrat can win.\" Asked if voters consider Trump a better candidate than they did in 2020, Robinson said he thought many white college-educated Republicans in Georgia who had abandoned the GOP in the Trump era had drifted back at the same time as Republicans were attracting more Black and Latino men. He acknowledged not knowing how many of the 58% white early voters had cast a ballot for Harris. \"I just have a hunch that she ain't winning enough of them,\" Robinson said. Even if Harris won Georgia this year, Scott said, strong voter outreach and engagement would be necessary in the coming years. “We can't say, ‘Black and brown people and progressive people have decided on who the president's going to be, and now we can go back to normal,’” she said. “This is the new normal — that Georgia will continue to be the battleground state.”","summary":"After early voting wrapped up Friday with more than 4 million Georgians casting a ballot, but it is still hard to predict who will win.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-11-02/2024-election-georgia-democrats-republicans","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5900c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3546x1862+0+255/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe8%2Fe1%2F5e822c5043b7bf932baa86b36cdd%2Faptopix-election-202","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:08:05","author":"Jenny Jarvie","authors":["Jenny Jarvie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":262089220,"title":"Trump Island Residents Gear Up to Vote for Donald Trump Despite Being Surrounded by Democrats","text":"Locals of a tiny California town are turning out in their droves to back Donald Trump for the presidency, despite being in a Democratic heartland. \n\nDiscovery Bay, on the east of Contra Costa County, in the San Francisco bay area hosts just a single supermarket, as well as a harbor and yacht club. \n\nThe town is an anomaly in the largely Democratic state of California, with the majority of residents supporting Trump in the 2020 election. \n\nResidents Paul and Connie Rodgers, both Republicans, had moved to Discovery Bay from nearby Marin County in 2017 without realizing that the town was red. \n\nConnie told The San Francisco Chronicle she had bit her tongue for years on her political views, saying the move to the area felt like ‘being gay in the closet’. \n\nThe two told the outlet that they are free to have their political discussions and disagreements without feeling villainized. \n\nInitially nervous about moving from their longtime home, Connie said she overcame her nerves when her conservative views were met with agreement. \n\nPaul, an Air Force Veteran, had wanted to move into a smaller single-story home and for the chance to have his own boat, docked on the pontoon in his backyard deck. \n\nThey had both voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, with Connie contesting she sometimes wish he would talk less. \n\nDespite their draw to Trump, they did concede to the outlet that they prefer his running mate Senator J.D. Vance. \n\nThe couple have been together for 49 years and describe themselves as moderates, Connie was originally a Democrat before changing her stance. \n\nPaul said: ‘People don’t talk about their ailments. They talk about their boats and about fashionable cocktails. It’s just a really refreshing place to live.’\n\nDespite him wearing a Trump hat while talking with the outlet, he said he refuses to use Trump bumper stickers for when he drives back to Marin County to see family.\n\nThe town recently held a boat parade specifically for President Trump, with locals happily waving Trump flags from the back of their boats. \n\nLocals also adorned themselves in their MAGA hats and patriotic get ups for the occasion. \n\nJennifer Mix, who has lived in the area for twenty years, is the secretary of the local county Republican Party. \n\nShocked with the political and cultural stance in California, she found herself in Discovery Bay and prefers the slower and conservative lifestyle than the state. \n\nShe told the outlet: ‘Everyone has a boat. Even if you don’t live on the water, their boats are at the marina.’ \n\nMix described the community as being a ‘safety zone’ from the problems plaguing California cities including widespread drug use and homelessness. \n\nShe said that Republicans don’t feel heard and can be ‘a little forgotten out here’, with the majority of politicians representing the area being Democrats. \n\nAn enthusiastic Trump voter, she believes that many others back the former president too. \n\nShe said she was ‘absolutely confident’ he will win the majority of the town’s support. \n\nThe couple and Mix are both concerned about the economy and immigration, two central campaign issues. \n\nBreaking away from typical Republican beliefs, Connie and Paul are also strong believers in reproductive rights and want abortion to be legalized. \n\nThe median age in the area is around 44, nearly six years higher than California’s median age of 42.4.\n\nHouse prices are also drastically lower than nearby San Francisco, with costs at $371 per square foot – compared to $958 per square foot in the city. \n\nCensus figures also points to Discovery Bay being older, whiter, and more native-born than the rest of the state of California.","summary":"Locals of a tiny California town are turning out in their

Iowa poll that matters—with major national implications","text":"Ann Selzer’s Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register came out Saturday, and it’s a political thermonuclear bomb:\n\nKamala Harris: 47\nDonald Trump: 44\n\nThe previous poll had Trump up 47-43 in September, and leading President Joe Biden 50-32 in June.\n\nAnd this matters far beyond saying “it’s just one poll.” \n\nSelzer is one of the nation's most accurate pollsters, doing the vast majority of her work in her home state of Iowa. \n\nHer track record is impeccable: (Actual results in parenthesis)\n\n2022 Senate: R+12 (R+12)\n2020 President: R+7 (R+8)\n2020 Senate: R+4 (R+7)\n2018 Governor: D+2 (R+3) — a rare miss\n2016 President: R+7 (R+9)\n2014 Senate: R+7 (R+8)\n2012 President: D+5 (D+6)\n\nI remember that 2016 poll like it was yesterday. At the time, Iowa was still considered a battleground state, with Hillary Clinton’s campaign heavily contesting it. When those results came back, we shrugged them off, as they were significantly out of line with other polling showing a close but steady Clinton lead. In hindsight, it was the canary in the coal mine. \n\nAnd that’s what this is for Donald Trump now. It’s not just the trendlines. Trump won Iowa by 8 points in 2020. Even a swing of a few points in a white, rural, midwestern state spells incredible danger for Republican chances across the entire midwest, and even into Nebraska, where independent Senate candidate Dan Osborn is trying to pull off a massive upset to unseat incumbent Republican Deb Fischer in that deep red state. Iowa also has two competitive House races, and if these numbers hold, Democrats could flip both of them on Tuesday. \n\nThe internals are downright brutal for Trump and his party. \n\n“Independent voters, who had consistently supported Trump in the leadup to this election, now break for Harris. That’s driven by the strength of independent women, who back Harris by a 28-point margin, while independent men support Trump, but by a smaller margin,” the Register reported.\n\n“Similarly, senior voters who are 65 and older favor Harris. But senior women support her by a more than 2-to-1 margin, 63% to 28%, while senior men favor her by just 2 percentage points, 47% to 45%.”\n\nHarris is crushing it with white, older, rural women. \n\nAnd who are the most reliable voters, not just in Iowa but the entire freakin’ country? Yeah, those white, older, rural women. \n\nSo the polling aggregators? Throw them out. Even Nate Silver admits that the data inputs for them—public polls—are garbage, with “herding” driving risk-averse pollsters into releasing the exact same numbers as their peers.\n\n“Specifically, the odds are 1 in 9.5 trillion against at least this many polls showing such a close margin,” Silver wrote. Yet somehow he refuses to make the next leap—if the data is quite literally impossible, then how can his model still be of any insight given that it is based on that garbage data? \n\nThat goes for 538 and all the other aggregators. Throw them out. This is a different kind of election. \n\nAs I tweeted on Friday: \n\nThis Selzer poll proves my point, and it won’t be the only state in which the final results will be different than what the public polling and the aggregators claim. \n\nI will say this: Harris is looking really good in the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. And holy shit, the ground game is driving hard for that final victory.\n\nThe sunbelt states are tighter, and Trump has a real chance to win them. We don’t want that. We want to win everything and then some. Like Iowa. And the Texas and Florida Senate races.\n\nSo no, none of this is to say that Harris and Senate and House Democrats have it in the bag. We work hard for every last possible vote, everywhere. \n\nBut just like in 2016, Selzer has reset the expectations of the race. \n\nLet’s freakin’ finish strong and bring it home. \n\nLet's get to work electing Kamala Harris our next president! Sign up for as many shifts as you can between now and Nov. 5 to talk with progressive voters in key states who might not turn out without hearing from you!","summary":"Ann Selzer’s Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register came out Saturday, and it’s a political thermonuclear bomb:\n\n\n\nKamala Harris: 47\n\nDonald Trump: 44\n\n\n\nThe previous poll had Trump up 47-43 in September, and leading President Joe Biden 50-32 in June.\n\n\n\nAnd this matters far beyond saying “it’s just one poll.” ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/11/2/2281976/-Harris-leads-in-the-one-Iowa-poll-that-matters-with-major-national-implications?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1363732/story_image/AP24307674762058.jpg?1730592002","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-03 00:01:01","author":"kos","authors":["kos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":262088608,"title":"Newspaper headlines: ‘Labour challenges Badenoch’ and ‘Lopez backs Harris’","text":"The news of Kemi Badenoch’s appointment as the leader of the Conservative party appears on the front of a number of Sunday’s papers. The Sunday Telegraph quotes the politician for its headline: ‘It’s time for a fresh start’. Badeonch has become the first black woman to lead a major UK political party. The Observer reports Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has ordered the country’s largest peacetime military deployment to tackle the fall-out from floods that devastated parts of the country this week. The paper also addresses Kemi Badenoch leading the Tory party, instead focusing on a financial ‘challenge’ put to her from the Labour Party. Jennifer Lopez waves to a crowd on the front page of the Financial Times weekend edition. The star joined US vice-president Kamala Harris at a Las Vegas rally on Friday. The paper says Harris is neck and neck with Republican candidate Donald Trump -according to polls – and that the economy is the ‘main issue’ for voters. The Mail on Sunday continues Saturday’s coverage of an upcoming biography about King Charles, written by Robert Hardman. The author claims the honour Order of the British Empire (OBE) may be changed to Order of British Excellence, to distance itself from the country’s colonial past. Homes owned by Prince William’s estate are not meeting energy standards, the Sunday Mirror reports in a different royal story. The paper says some tenants are struggling to heat their damp homes. The Sun on Sunday also leads on something alleged in a new book. Former rugby union player James Haskell alleges his ex-wife, TV presenter Chloe Madeley, was groped in a club by an unnamed rugby star. The Sunday Express leads on an exclusive, reporting all RAF pilots have to train in the US, due to a shortage of jets. Elsewhere the paper takes aim at Labour’s new Budget, suggesting the government cutting inheritance tax exemptions will encourage people to spend their pension money to avoid being taxed. Councils cancelling Bonfire Night parties leads the Daily Star’s Sunday edition. The paper reports councils are responding to complaints about smoke, noise and mud by cancelling 5 November celebrations.","summary":"The news of Kemi Badenoch&#8217;s appointment as the leader of the Conservative party appears on the front of a number of Sunday&#8217;s papers.

Tim Walz said during a rally in Flint that women will send a message to former President Donald Trump in Tuesday’s general election “whether he likes it or not.”\n\n Walz was referencing \n comments made by Trump at a Wisconsin rally this week, when the Republican nominee for president said that “whether the women like it or not, I’m going to protect them,” adding that his advisors had urged him not to use the line because it would be “very inappropriate for you to say.”\n\n “He told the women here that he would be your protector,” Walz said Friday. “And he added, he said, ‘I’m going to do it, whether women like it or not,’ which is pretty much what he’s done his entire life.”\n\n “It’s pretty simple. [Vice President] Kamala Harris and I trust women, and I have a feeling that women across this country, of every age, of either party, are going to send a loud and clear message to Donald Trump next Tuesday – whether he likes it or not,” Walz said.\n\n Walz’s stop in Flint was one of several he made throughout the state as the campaigns enter the final sprint to Election Day. He also held a roundtable in Detroit, spoke to union members in Taylor and held another rally in Traverse City.\n\n Trump also \n spent the day in Michigan, visiting a restaurant in Dearborn and holding a rally at Macomb Community College. His running mate, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), spoke at an event in Portage.\n\n Michigan is one of \n seven swing states expected to play a key role in determining the next president.\n\n U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) is running for U.S. Senate against former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake). She called Michigan “the center of the political universe.”\n\n “If you haven’t noticed, everyone wants to come and see what real Michiganders in their natural habitat are really thinking and talking about, and that’s because we are the home of the swing voters, the independent voters,” Slotkin said. “We have urban, rural, suburban – we’ve got it all. If you can make it work in Michigan, you can make it work anywhere in the country.”\n\n Academy Award-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo joined Walz for the rally, introducing himself as someone who “moonlights as an actor,” calling activism his day job. He’s also scheduled to campaign for Harris Saturday at the University of Michigan tailgate in Ann Arbor along with U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n After Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, Ruffalo said that the Republican Party is a “little tent party,” adding that “they’re not even really any kind of party. They’re just a downer event.”\n\n “Donald Trump and his troupe of cronies and goofy billionaire boyfriends” have “nothing but downer news and downer ideas. If they were a boy band, they would be Downer Donald and the Despairs,” Ruffalo said.\n\n While the war in Gaza has been a difficult issue for Democrats to navigate, with campaign events frequently being interrupted by protestors, Ruffalo said that he “wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for Kamala Harris and where she stands on Gaza and Israel.”\n\n Mark Ruffalo greets attendees at a rally with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Flint, Mich., on Nov. 1, 2024. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)\n\n “The images we’re seeing coming out of that part of the world are just so heartbreaking; we shouldn’t be seeing those kind of images, not from one of our allies,” Ruffalo said. “It creates a really troubling and conflicting sense of who we are and what our morals are.”\n\n “It’s my belief that Kamala means it when she says that every Palestinian has the \n right to self-determination … and that Israel and Palestine have a right to share the same shared security,” Ruffalo said. “We’ve seen it again and again, wars don’t mean shit. They don’t bring us anything.”\n\n Ruffalo took aim at Elon Musk, who has been campaigning with Trump, alleging that “he wants to take your billions of dollars in tax funds to go start his little empire on Mars, and he knows that the Democrats won’t let him do it, and that’s why he jumped into the arms of his new little boyfriend, Donald Trump.”\n\n Walz contrasted Harris’ economic plans with Trump’s, which Walz pointed out Musk recently said would cause “temporary hardship.”\n\n “What in the hell does a billionaire know about hardship? These damn people,” Walz said.\n\n Walz said that he has been asked about how a hypothetical Harris administration would fund her policy proposals.\n\n “Well, for starters, we’ll have Donald pay his damn taxes. Elon can pay his taxes,” Walz said.\n\n Walz, a former high school football coach, used a football analogy to describe the state of the race during the final weekend on the campaign trail.\n\n “Momentum is on our side, but this is the time to take nothing for granted. It’s a pep talk for the folks who are here,” Walz said. “Tied game, two minutes left, we got the damn ball, we got the best quarterback in Kamala Harris, we got the best team that’s doing the work in all of you, we don’t get tired because we sleep when we’re dead in this group.”\n\nMichigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

I'm sure you are too,\" he continued, before referring to former president Donald Trump. \"But the other guy? He spent four years turning us against each other while embracing dictators and tyrants around the world. That's not how we are.\"\n\n \"We don't need to 'make America great again.' C'mon, we are great. What we need is to work together again. What we need is a president who works for all of us again,\" Ford concluded the clip.\n\n In a separate video, the Indiana Jones star spoke out more directly against Trump, stating that he believes the \"other guy demands unquestioning loyalty\" and that Trump \"wants revenge.\"\n\n \"Look, I've been voting for 64 years. Never really wanted to talk about it very much.

We are working with the counties and the political parties to ensure this is done transparently and within Georgia law.”\n\n Raffensperger later added that while he is pleased that watchers were eventually allowed in, he is concerned that their presence was ever in question.\n\n “The eyes of the world are on Fulton County,” he said. “Local officials must ensure that every process from now until election day and after is transparent and in accordance with Georgia law, given the history of controversy in the county’s election administration.”\n\n Fulton County was at the center of conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 presidential election.\n\n The ballots turned in before the county allowed observers likely numbered under 100, according to Georgia Secretary of State Chief Operating Officer Gabriel Sterling.\n\nThe controversy\n\n In an X post that includes an unverified image of an email purportedly between Fulton County election staff banning poll watchers, State Republican Party Chair Josh McKoon accused Democrats of trying to steal the election.\n\n “Democrats are panicked by the incredible Republican turnout in early voting and will do anything to try to catch up even if it means doing it under the cover of darkness and stiff arming any independent observation of whatever the hell is going on in their four ‘special voting locations’ open today with no notice or approval by anyone authorized to oversee elections administration.”\n\n Josh McKoon speaks at a Protect the Vote event in Alpharetta. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder\n\n According to the Harris campaign, a Fulton county judge denied Republicans’ request to shut down the ballot returns Saturday morning. Democrats said the GOP’s efforts are anti-voter and frivolous.\n\n “Across Georgia, the Trump campaign has been cherry-picking facts and making up problems where there are none,” said campaign senior advisor and outside counsel Dana Remus. “But each time, we were prepared, we responded, and we won. We are ensuring our voters can make their voices heard, and we are protecting the integrity of the election so that every legal vote will count — no matter what Trump says.”\n\n Tensions are high ahead of Tuesday’s election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. Georgia’s 16 electoral votes could prove critical, evidenced by the steady stream of visits to Georgia by the presidential candidates and their allies.\n\n After Trump lost the presidency in 2020 to current President Joe Biden, Trump spread unfounded rumors that he was cheated out of victory. He lost in Georgia by less than 12,000 votes.\n\n Many of the party’s strongest backers took the idea that Georgia’s elections were rigged in favor of Democrats to heart, despite two recounts and many unsuccessful court cases. In response, the GOP-led state legislature passed a series of election reforms. Trump has sought to convince his supporters to vote early, and other Republicans have stressed the message that Georgia’s elections are safe and reliable.\n\n According to Fair Fight, the voting rights group started by Democrat Stacey Abrams, expanded mail ballot return hours are available in Chatham, Clarke, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties.\n\n “72,000 Georgians have still not returned their vote-by-mail ballots – that’s a 23% unreturned rate. In Georgia, where presidential elections can be as close as 11,779 votes, every ballot could make the difference. If you have your mail ballot, we recommend hand delivering it to your county. If that’s not an option, you should vote in person on Election Day – just tell a poll worker you’re canceling your mail ballot,” said Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo.\n\nGeorgia Recorder is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

There has been no evidence put forward of widespread election fraud in 2020 or 2024.\n\n\n\n\tRepublican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said the party has filed suit, and that Republican poll watchers were not being allowed to observe the process in populous blue counties including Fulton, DeKalb and Cobb.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Amy Lamare For Dailymail.Com \n Published:23:38 GMT, 2 November 2024 |Updated:23:44 GMT, 2 November 2024 \n\nBen Affleck and his son Samuel enjoyed a day to themselves over the weekend. \nThe father, 52, and son, 12, duo – who recently got stranded when Ben's Ford Bronco broke down – were spotted shopping on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue.\nThe Batman star looked casual in a pair of grey jeans and a tan button-down shirt over a white t-shirt. Samuel, meanwhile, wore light-wash jeans with a white Nike t-shirt.\nBen — who is reportedly ready to start dating again amid divorce from Jennifer Lopez, 55 — was seen carrying a large black shopping bag with a shoe box poking out of the top of the bag in one photo.\nIn the other, both men carried multi-colored shopping bags as they crossed a parking lot between two BMWs. \n\nBen Affleck, 52, and his son Samuel, 12, enjoyed a day to themselves over the weekend\n\nEXCLUSIVE Ben Affleck is ready to start dating after split from Jennifer Lopez - but he has a non-negotiable \nBen shares Samuel as well as daughter Violet, 18, and child Fin, 15 with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, 52. \nThe sighting comes as reports surface that Affleck is ready to go no contact with his other ex-wife.\nThe issue there, is that Fin and JLo's kids twins Max and Emme, 16, which she shares with her other ex-husband Marc Anthony, go to the same school.\n'Ben knows he’s going to see Jen at these functions. Their kids go to the same school, so how could he not?' an insider told In Touch. 'Still, it’s awkward.'\nAnd when Ben moves on to his next girlfriend, he has one thing that is not negotiable.\nThe woman must either be sober or in recovery as he is not willing to jeopardize his own sobriety. \n'Ben has not given up on relationships and finally feels ready to move forward and start dating again,' an insider told DailyMail.com exclusively.\n'He is not going to jump into anything serious until the divorce is finalized but that does not mean he cannot date.'\nThey continued: 'He only wants to date someone who is sober or in recovery. These past two years have been tough for Ben and as he begins to heal, one thing is very clear: his recovery comes before anything. He is not going to put his sobriety in jeopardy.’ \n\nThe father and son duo were spotted shopping on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue \n\nBen shares Samuel as well as daughter Violet, 18, and child Fin, 15 with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, 52; Seen here with Samuel on December 13, 2022\n\nBen is reportedly ready to start dating again amid divorce from Jennifer Lopez, 55; the estranged pair seen in November\n\n'Ben has not given up on relationships and finally feels ready to move forward and start dating again,' an insider told DailyMail.com exclusively; the two seen in February\n\nAffleck was reportedly upset by the news that people feared he would relapse after a lengthy bout of sobriety.\n‘Ben tries to avoid reading the news but it did upset him that people thought he relapsed because he had not,' the source said. 'Like every alcoholic, Ben just wakes up with one goal in mind. To stay sober for that day.'\nAffleck has been open about his addiction battle and first stopped drinking in 1997.\n'I just wanted to stop,' he told a reporter in 1998. 'I started regretting some things I did when I was drunk. It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it's like, \"I think I hurt that person's feelings\", \"I made a fool of myself\" or \"I didn't want to kiss that girl\". I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me.'\nJennifer GarnerJennifer LopezLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBen Affleck keeps it casual as he enjoys a day of shopping with son Samuel, 12, in Los Angeles\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEMargot Robbie gives birth!

And Republicans were beating both unaffiliated and Democratic voters headed into the final day of early voting, which wasn’t the case in either 2016 or 2020, according to the John Locke Foundation’s Vote Tracker.\n\nWhat’s more, former President Donald Trump’s campaign is embracing early voting. At his Saturday rally in Gastonia, many attendees said they had already voted early.\n\nJason Little is a Statesville resident and volunteer for Trump Force 47, a network helping the former president’s 2024 campaign. The organization has made a big push this year for people to vote early.\n\nOn Saturday, Little volunteered at the rally in a Trump Force 47 T-shirt and a white baseball cap that said “Trump Force Captain,” with a Trump signature on the brim.\n\n“You’re taking too much of a chance waiting till the day of, you know, anything can happen. You could be in a wreck. Your kid can have appendicitis or something, and you’ve lost, you know, your biggest right as a citizen to vote,” Little said. “That’s been our push is to make it too big to have any problems. And that’s been the message from the entire campaign the whole time is to vote early.”\n\nAs he spoke, the big screens behind Little’s head said, “Make a plan to vote! Mail/Absentee/Early in-person.”\n\nBut he isn’t fully on-board with early voting.\n\n“You know, we’re not thrilled with the length of time of early voting,” Little said. “We don’t think it should be so long because that leaves opportunities for things to happen.”\n\nA video before the rally also featured Trump warning voters they need to “swamp the polls” in order to prevent Democrats from “cheating,” repeating debunked claims that Joe Biden did not legally win the 2020 election.\n\n“These people will cheat, and they do cheat,” he said. “We have to prevent what happened in 2020 from ever happening again.”\n\nSome other voters shared Little’s reservations.\n\n“I’m sort of old school,” said Laura Schnabel who came in from Lake Wylie, South Carolina, to attend her first Trump rally. “Let’s just have election day on one day, and this way there’s no fake, phony stuff.”\n\nSchnabel said she and her husband voted this year by mail, a method the Trump campaign tried to restrict in 2020, since they recently moved from New York and would’ve struggled to register in South Carolina in time for the election.\n\n“I don’t like to do that, but we had to do it,” she said.\n\nWhen it came to Trump’s speech, he stuck to familiar talking points: immigration, the economy and an insufficient response from the federal government after Hurricane Helene.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump promised to cut down on illegal immigration, claiming undocumented migrants are causing crime in the United States to rise.\n\n“I will stop the invasion of massive numbers of criminals that have come into our country,” he said, claiming “thousands” of “murderers, rapists and convicted felons,” are entering the country’s southern border illegally.\n\nThere is no evidence that countries are emptying prisons and mental health facilities and sending people to the United States, as Trump has claimed.\n\nNationally, crime has fallen by 49% between 1993 and 2022, and again dropped by 3% between 2022 and 2023 – murder dropped by 11% that year alone – according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, Trump falsely claimed Saturday that many large cities don’t report their crime data to the FBI and were left out of its report.\n\nBut most large cities in the U.S., including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, reported their 2023 crime data to the FBI.\n\nRumors originally arose online that large cities weren’t reporting their crime data after the FBI changed it’s requirements in 2021, according to the website verifythis.com. Some law enforcement agencies, including those in large cities, didn’t report their 2021 crime data because they were unable to comply with the new FBI guidelines. But in 2022, the FBI made it easier for more agencies to participate. Over 85% of the nation’s law enforcement agencies – covering over 94% of the U.S. population – submitted crime data in 2023.\n\nWestern North Carolina and FEMA\n\nTrump claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency has failed to give sufficient aid to western North Carolina.\n\n“You’ve been through a lot, and your government has not helped you too much,” he said, adding 50% of phone calls from western North Carolina to federal agencies in the wake of Helene went unanswered.\n\nFederal call data reported by Politico show the government struggled in its disaster response, but officials say that is due to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton hitting the nation’s coast in quick succession.\n\nFEMA now has 21 disaster recovery centers in 39 counties in North Carolina, including a total 1.7 million households.\n\nTrump also cited a Friday report that job creation slowed sharply last month, with just 12,000 jobs created in the U.S. in October, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n“One of the worst jobs reports of all time,” Trump said. “These are Depression numbers, I hate to tell you.”\n\nThe report came in well behind the around 100,000 new jobs economists expected and the worst since late 2020. However, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%.\n\nEconomists credit the slowdown to strikes, including the nearly 44,000 workers taking part in the Boeing strike, and the effects of Hurricane Helene.\n\n©2024 The Charlotte Observer.

With speculators and short sellers focused on technical indicators, the seemingly impenetrable $50 level was an easy read. Moreover, it dropped further, breaking through the next major barrier, $35.\n\nThe technical picture turns significantly negative\nJohn Tobey (StockCharts.com)\n\nNote: DJT has been labeled a meme stock which heightens risk and volatility. See my October 30 article for explanation: “Trump Media Stock (DJT) - A Meme Stock Plummet Can Be Hard To Stop”\n\nSecond, the rapid rise on extremely high trading volume means that many stock buyers were drawn into the run-up. Therefore, the fast decline both dashed easy money hopes and turned quick profits into speedy losses. Additionally, there are the shareholders who became unlocked on September 20 and chose to hold. This turnabout could be the reason they sold or will sell.\n\nThird, an uptrend rationale was Donald Trump's improving election poll readings. The Trump brand remains the key support for the high prices relative to the company's fundamentals. Therefore, his rising chances of becoming president bolstered the brand support. However, there is the other reality that perhaps has become more important: The polling shows a 50/50 split between Kamala Harris and him. In other words, there is a 50% chance that he will not be elected.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Cataclysmic Collapse’—Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk’s Radical $35.7 Trillion Plan To Avert ‘Financial Emergency’ Spurs Huge Bitcoin Price Bets\n\nFBI Warns Gmail, Outlook, AOL, Yahoo Users—Hackers Gain Access To Accounts\n\nNetflix’s Best Returning Show Arrives With High Critic Scores For Season 2\n\nFourth, Wall Street knows that campaign promises have a way of being toned down, delayed, or set aside after the inauguration. That is when the White House-Senate-House governing structure brings in reality (through reordering preferences, negotiating, and compromising). Based on media reports, Wall Street is especially interested in reduced personal and company income taxes. The other promises, some of which are viewed negatively, are expected to be watered down, or dismissed.\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nDJT clearly reversed its uptrend last week. Not only did it fail to break $50, but it also fell back below the major $35 barrier it crossed the previous week. The inability to hold a breakthrough for two weeks is a negative sign. Therefore, the stock will likely be volatile on Monday and Tuesday without any real trend movement. Only after the election results are in, and then confirmed, can the Trump brand be evaluated for the Trump Media stock.\n\nThe bottom line: Fundamentals matter, even in meme stocks\n\nIn mid-November, Trump Media will report the 3rd quarter results. Will they continue to show weak revenues and sizeable negative earnings? What about the costs of setting up the streaming service versus the expected revenue growth? And what about the employee roster - Has it grown to match the increased services?\n\nThe answer to those questions and others, while not determining the dollar-value of the stock, will affect investors' views and confidence in the company's operation and outlook.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn. \n\nJohn S.

Media has been been biased for Kamala Harris from the start","text":"In a recent op-ed, Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos noted that the media is now less trusted than Congress. “Something we are doing is clearly not working,” he wrote. \n\nIt was a refreshing admission that followed an uproar at the ultra-lefty Post over his decision not to endorse a presidential candidate. Naturally, most of the staff was hell-bent on supporting Kamala Harris, and some sputtered with rage by accusing Bezos of trying to curry favor with Donald Trump. \n\nIn his column, the owner rejected the charge while noting that endorsements “create a perception of bias . . . ending them is a principled decision.” \n\nBezos deserves credit for explaining his decision, but events demonstrate that he misdiagnoses the disease and vastly underestimates it. \n\nThe problem is not that the public believes the media is biased. The problem is that the media is biased. \n\nThe main evidence is not editorial endorsements or opinion columns labeled as such. The bias is revealed when supposedly straight-news articles are so one-sided as to be indistinguishable from propaganda. \n\nAgenda-driven journos \n\nTo borrow a phrase from the late Ed Koch, too many reporters are nothing more than politicians with press passes. \n\nThat’s certainly the case at The Washington Post, which has been at the forefront of the outbreak of media madness dominating the campaign’s final days. Along with ABC, NBC and CBS, The New York Times, CNN, NPR and the Associated Press, Bezos’ outlet has disgraced itself by shilling for Harris in its news pages, facts be damned. \n\nThis is not the ordinary tilt we have unfortunately come to expect. This is a whole new level of flagrant misconduct. \n\nI have never seen anything like it — nor has anyone else. History is being made in a terrible way. \n\nIt’s seems incredible now but just 20 years ago, during the 2004 campaign, top CBS anchor Dan Rather was caught presenting false documents to claim that President George W. Bush got preferential military treatment in the 1970s to avoid being sent to Vietnam. \n\nCBS investigated and Rather and his team were fired. Nowadays, given how corrupt CBS is, they would be celebrated. \n\nThat’s how far the media has fallen. Fearing that Harris could lose Tuesday’s vote, most major outlets are trashing even the pretense of professionalism and fairness to serve up distorted and sometimes fabricated “gotcha” moments against Trump. \n\nEach is delivered with a breathless urgency aimed at swaying voters. \n\nMonday reeked of false claims that Trump hates Puerto Ricans and his wildly successful rally at Madison Square Garden was full of racism. \n\nI was there — it was a joyful, spirited crowd, with one comedian making a tasteless joke. \n\nThen came the ridiculous assertions that Trump is targeting women with his policies and doesn’t care what they want or say — all designed to boost Harris with women. \n\nLiz Cheney spin cycle \n\nFriday brought the disgraceful accusation that he threatened GOP turncoat Liz Cheney with execution. \n\nIn fact, what Trump clearly did was call her a war hawk who wouldn’t last a minute in combat if she had to face enemy guns pointing at her. \n\nBut why report the truth when a lie is much more useful? \n\nHarris, who has escaped all serious scrutiny, naturally took her cue from the media jihad and declared that each concocted issue proved Trump is unfit. \n\nHer remarks were then featured by the same media outlets, as if repetition makes them valid. This is what passes for a news cycle in 2024. \n\nThe bias against Trump has been a regular feature of his 9-year political career, but the open hatred for his supporters has reached new depths. \n\nWhen Hillary Clinton called them “deplorables” and “irredeemable” in 2016, the media recognized her contempt and warned it could hurt her. \n\nFast forward to how the same press downplayed Joe Biden’s description of Trump supporters as “garbage.” \n\nThe intent was so clear that the White House offered stupid lies to make it seem innocent. When that didn’t work, aides changed the official transcript, which angered stenographers. \n\nIf a president Trump had called Harris supporters “garbage,” then tried to cover it up, Dems would have demanded impeachment and the media would have applauded like trained seals. \n\nBurying Biden’s gaffes \n\nBut when Biden does it, the press rushes to rescue Harris by framing the incident as Republicans “seizing” on a Biden “gaffe.” \n\nNotice, too, a lack of follow-up stories on how Trump supporters felt about being called “garbage” by the president who promised to unite the nation. \n\nNo surprise. These days, “MAGA Republican” is used as a synonym to describe someone as stupid, insane, a racist, a misogynist or even a traitor! Who cares how they feel? \n\nBesides, most of the media thinks Biden was right. \n\nIt’s all part of the see-no-evil approach to virtually everything Democrats do and say. When they fail, their motives are always pure and their mistakes innocent. \n\nEverything Trump says and does comes from a heart of darkness. \n\nThis rampant media misconduct is a big part of why I am voting for Trump. \n\nBeyond the Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous policies, the progressive cultural rot they advocate is undermining our nation. The rise of antisemitism on college campuses reveals the dereliction of university presidents, faculties and administrators, but the White House has been shamefully silent because most Jew hatred is coming from their party’s left wing. \n\nOther signs of cultural madness include the administration’s near-religious devotion to climate change and its use of elementary schools to indoctrinate children in radical gender and race theories. \n\nAlmost without exception, the press corps has embraced those attacks on Jews and American life and history. A Trump victory would deliver a crucial comeuppance. \n\nRecall that his 2016 victory provided an essential course correction in both policy and culture, and another correction is desperately needed now. \n\nThat’s not to say I believe a Trump presidency would lead to soul-searching and a new commitment to fairness among the leftist outlets. After all, his first election saw them spend four years trying to get him impeached, convicted and prosecuted. \n\nMany, including the Times, saw a surge in readers, which its former CEO, Mark Thompson, called the “Trump bump.” \n\nIn truth, it was an anti-Trump bump. And Thompson now heads CNN. \n\nStill, a second Trump election would, at least for a time, smash the gatekeepers’ prestige and power and give new outlets to gain an audience by pursuing facts instead of a partisan agenda. \n\nThe way Elon Musk has turned X into a prime source of news and opinion is an example of what could happen elsewhere.

In summary the commissioner considered the former governor unfit for leadership even at the lowest level. “Aminu Waziri Tambuwal shouldn’t have been a Local Government Chairman let alone a governor, talk less of being the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a futile ambition that consumed his time and attention,” he snorted angrily. “He was unfair to the people of Sokoto State. He ought to have left hand-over records which would guide the new government but did not…Those who want to see the true picture of Aminu Waziri Tambuwal should come to Sokoto state, we will take him or her round and also show them facts and figures, site and even sounds from the public of his disastrous eight years as governor. Whoever wants to see the footprint of the real Aminu Waziri Tambuwal should come to Sokoto State. We will take him round, even to his own hometown of Tambuwal, that he failed to keep his promise to dualize the roads within the town…So, if I say that Aminu Tambuwal took the state backwards by 20 years it’s not an overstatement.”\n\nThis column passed the same judgement on the Tambuwal governorship barely a few years into his eight years rule. It is reassuring that little by little, many analysts are beginning to turn their minds in the direction of the variables that qualify a person or politician for leadership. Mr Dan Tsoho’s summation may be scathing and coloured by the long-standing animosity between the current governor Ahmad Aliyu and his predecessor, Mr Tambuwal, to whom he was deputy for about three years before resigning in 2018, but the stridency of the commissioner’s conclusions are not diminished by the temperaments of Government House intrigues. Too little attention has been paid to the subject of succession in Nigeria, whether at the federal, state or local government level. But the matter deserves a lot of attention, and gradually, especially after the depredations of the Olusegun Obasanjo years, Nigerians may start to recognise that their fortunes are tied to their leaders. At his exit in 2007, a two-term limit he regretted bitterly, Chief Obasanjo gave the country the Umaru Yar’Adua/Goodluck Jonathan condominium. Apart from health and confidence challenges respectively, neither had demonstrated the qualities of great leadership. But they were foisted on Nigeria with disastrous consequences. Years later, in 2015, the country again bought a pig in a poke in the form of former military leader Muhammadu Buhari. The consequences were even more devastating, and would have been catastrophic had he got his wish of enthroning Ahmad Lawan, former senate president.\n\nRead Also: My unforgettable battle with traditionalists in Ota, by cleric\n\nNeither the federal governor nor Sokoto State is alone on the matter of botched succession politics. The crisis of development in many states, not to talk of in local governments, is connected with the quality of their leadership. Without a conscious effort to structure and systematise leadership recruitment, especially with the unhealthy reliance on the guesswork institutionalised by the constitution, national development will not only be stymied, the likelihood of total collapse may become frighteningly real. The Nigerian constitution has its limitations. It is unable, by its provisions concerning qualifications for office, to properly sift competent and incompetent candidates and leaders. Rivers State is a perfect example of the facile presumption that undergirds leadership recruitment. Apart from constitutional inadequacy, outgoing leaders must also be imbued with the sublime skill, the altruism and metaphysical depth, of determining which aspiring successor possesses great leadership skills. One of the many reasons Western countries are experiencing leadership crisis is their jaded leadership recruitment process, especially in countries where the process is not qualified by leadership training facilities and sturdy constitutional provisions and amendments.\n\nNigerians have heedlessly come to deplore the godfather concept as a sifting tool for mediating great leadership succession. That deploration is anchored on the fact that in many instances, both the outgoing leader and the incoming leader are incompetent in equal measure. Nevertheless, the Gordian knot must be cut. If a country or state manages to get it right by producing a sound leader with the right instincts for reproducing his kind, the crisis of development may be largely avoided. China has been able to get it right, despite running a unique one-party state that somewhat mimics democracy or replicates collegiate leadership. After Deng Xiaoping took the reins of office in 1978, China has deliberately nurtured succeeding generations of leaders, preferring not to leave the matter to chance, and ensuring that succeeding leaders were capable of producing their kind. Nigeria had the chance before 2007 to birth a great and enduring leadership recruitment process, but Chief Obasanjo, despite his unceasing rhetorical overkill, lacked the discipline and the depth to produce the next generation of great leaders. Instead, he nurtured dwarfs expected to fit into and execute his defective worldview. What ailed Chief Obasanjo in 2007 also ailed Nyesom Wike in 2023 in Rivers State. Unable to conjure the altruism he desperately needed, and not understanding the rubric of great leadership, Mr Wike reproduced a successor that has kept Nigerians truly numbed. For the foreseeable future, Rivers will remain knackered. \n\nIn short, two factors will enable Nigeria to overcome its leadership failings and developmental crisis: a scientific leadership recruitment process, and outgoing leaders with the depth and metaphysical grasp of identifying a great successor. As the United States experience is showing in its presidential campaign, a system that had for centuries managed to produce some great leaders, or at least incompetent leaders incapable of destroying constitutional and societal guardrails, even the most advanced of countries can be horrifyingly susceptible to a candidate like Donald Trump who would threaten the stability of his own country as well as trifle with the world order. So, even when a scientific or constitutional recruitment process does exist, it must be enabled by outgoing leaders with enough chutzpah to fish out a great successor and help him get elected. Great leaders also often possess the right instincts. German war hero and Chancellor Paul von Hindenburg doubted the bona fides of Adolf Hitler and was for a brief moment chary of the risks of asking him to form the government after the 1933 elections, but he overruled his doubts and endorsed him, with catastrophic consequences.\n\nCatherine the Great of Russia (1762-1796) also doubted the competence of her son, Emperor Paul I (1796-1801) who was described as ‘idealistic, mercurial and vindictive’, and wanted him disinherited in favour of her grandson Alexander I (1801-1825), but she died of stroke before she could get her wish entrenched. As proof that Catherine’s instincts were sound, one of Emperor Paul’s teachers thought his student ‘was always in a hurry, acting and speaking without reflection’. Indeed, shortly after Emperor Paul I took the throne, he confirmed what many observers thought of him, and was soon assassinated. The doubts that assailed Catherine were akin to the suspicions that wracked the mind of the Ottoman Emperor Suleyman the Magnificent (1520-1566) regarding the leadership qualities of his potential successors. Together with his wife, they plotted to get rid of their children who were thought unfit for the throne, apart from small pox killing another potential successor. Even then, the presumptive heir, Selim II, believed to be far better than the other candidates, fared only partially better in the end. The empire only lasted for more than 300 years because of Emperor Suleyman’s stupendous work of empire building.\n\nLast month, Defence minister, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, asked Nigerians to take their regnant political culture as an infallible given. There was no room for secession, he said curtly. But this is a political system without a definitive worldview or paradigm, a system superficially inspired by the letter of the deeply philosophical constitution of the United States without being affected by the spirit of that great constitution. The National Assembly is engaged in reviewing the constitution, but there are no indications they can burrow deep into its philosophical core to get gold, nor if they get there, appreciate its pertinent provisions and nuances. What is indisputable is that neither the Nigerian constitution nor the Nigerian political culture guarantees the right political recruitment culture. Without a philosophy to guide both national life and leadership or even a great recruitment process, where will the right successors be found, and if found, what constitution and idea would they implement?\n\nNigeria’s leadership crisis goes beyond looking warily in the direction of the opposition, for even here, only two aspirants come to mind in recent months: ex-vice president Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi. Unfortunately, both display contempt for the judiciary, have little understanding of what opposition politics entails, are destitute of any form of nobility, are obsessed with office, and have shown no inclination for visionary undertakings of any kind. Resolving the country’s leadership conundrum will, therefore, be a herculean task, let alone tackling the country’s myriad economic crises. And if, along the way, a great leader happens to Nigeria, there is no structure in place, in the midst of bitter ethnic and religious recriminations, to guide future leadership selections, either by way of constitutional changes or by dint of political culture.","summary":"Last week, Nasiru Aliyu Dan Tsoho, Sokoto State commissioner in charge of lands, housing, survey and town planning, passed a curious and evocative judgement on the administration of former governor\n\n\nThe post Nigeria yet to get it right appeared first on The Nation Newspaper.","url":"https://thenationonlineng.net/nigeria-yet-to-get-it-right/","image":"https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/02223255/Tam-Wike.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-02 23:25:15","author":"Palladium,The Nation","authors":["Palladium","The Nation"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":262087592,"title":"Judge rejects suit seeking to block acceptance of hand-returned mail ballots","text":"A Georgia judge on Saturday rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person.The lawsuit only named Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that includes most of the city of Atlanta and is home to 11% of the state's voters. But at least five other populous counties that tend to vote for Democrats also announced election offices would open over the weekend to allow hand return of absentee ballots.The lawsuit was filed late Friday and cited a section of Georgia law that says ballot drop boxes cannot be open past the end of advance voting, which ended Friday. But state law says voters can deliver their absentee ballots in person to county election offices until the close of polls at 7 p.m. on Election Day. Despite that clear wording, lawyer Alex Kaufman initially claimed in an emergency hearing Saturday that voters aren't allowed to hand-deliver absentee ballots that were mailed to them.Kaufman then argued that voters should be blocked from hand-delivering their ballots between the close of early in-person voting on Friday and the beginning of Election Day on Tuesday, even though he said it was fine for ballots to arrive by mail during that period. It has long been the practice for Georgia election offices to accept mail ballots over the counter.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kevin Farmer, in an online hearing, repeatedly rejected Kaufman's arguments before orally ruling against him.\"I find that it is not a violation of those two code sections for a voter to hand-return their absentee ballots,\" Farmer said.Fulton County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez said that as of just before 5 p.m. Saturday, 105 ballots had been received at the four locations. \"All voters returning absentee ballots in person to the Department of Registration & Elections must sign an affidavit indicating whether they are returning the ballot for themselves or an authorized family member, household member or person in their care,\" the Fulton County Department of Registration & Elections said in a news release Saturday evening. Republicans have been focused on the conduct of elections in Fulton County for years, after President Donald Trump falsely blamed Fulton County workers for defrauding him of the 2020 election in Georgia.State GOP chairman Josh McKoon accused counties controlled by Democrats of \"illegally accepting ballots.\" The issue quickly gained traction online Saturday among Republican activists, particularly after a Fulton County election official sent an email to elections workers saying that observers would not be allowed to sit inside election offices while ballots were turned in.Fulton County elections director Nadine Williams said during the hearing that these were county offices and not polling places, and thus partisan poll watchers have never been allowed to observe those spaces.But hours later, Williams sent out an email clarifying that the process should be open to the public and no credentials or badges were needed. She noted that members of the independent monitoring team that is observing Fulton County's election processes were also on site and that investigators from the secretary of state's office might also be present.","summary":"The judge rejected a Republican lawsuit trying to block counties from opening election offices on Saturday and Sunday to let voters hand in their mail ballots in person.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-judge-republican-lawsuit-hand-returned-mail-ballots-fulton-county/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/02/7149ed8d-e82f-4649-8a02-e240e98c71c4/thumbnail/1200x630/b43c79d2e327c63861de26be49810573/gettyimages-2181499757.jpg?v=379420b9063a2aadbcd559df18e2d1ae","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3308835_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-02 23:24:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.482},{"id":262087138,"title":"Major incident in Edinburgh as police rush to seal off busy street in Scottish capital, with pubs forced to shut","text":"Breaking News\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Nov 2nd 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiracle as woman is found alive in Valencia after being trapped in a car with her dead sister-in-law for THREE days - as rescue teams continue grim hunt for victims of deadly mega storm\n\nElection model reveals a huge change in momentum between Trump and Harris with just three days left\n\nThe Queen planned to end Harry and Meghan's lease on Frogmore Cottage and force Prince Andrew to downsize.

Trump","text":"I wasn’t planning to write this. Two years ago, I said I would vote for a Democrat over Donald Trump in 2024. I wrote that during a Republican primary I hoped Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would win; DeSantis had stood almost alone against COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates, forever earning my respect. But Trump crushed DeSantis in the primary. Ever since, I have struggled over what to do in this election. In one sense, my vote doesn’t matter. I live in New York, which Kamala Harris is sure to win. But it must matter at least a little, because many of you - a surprising number - have asked or urged me to repudiate my 2022 words and endorse Trump. With three days left in this most brutal of campaigns, I am. In some ways, this choice pains me. CLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO ALEX BERENSON'S SUBSTACK, ‘UNREPORTED TRUTHS’ Donald Trump’s rhetoric is vicious. His unwillingness to promise to abide by the results of Tuesday’s election is dangerous. His friendly attitude towards dictators like Vladimir Putin disheartens me. And though I hate abortion, I do not support overturning Roe v Wade. Yet. Yet when I pull back and consider the issues, I see: It is the Democratic Party that stands against free speech; that forced mRNA vaccines on tens of millions of healthy adults; that opened America’s southern border until public outcry forced it closed; that supports decriminalization of drugs and \"decarceration\" of violent criminals; that presides over one giveaway after another to its favored interest groups; and that is willing to risk the American economy over its fears of climate change - it has, with little notice, pushed through regulations that will make gasoline-powered vehicles all but unaffordable within a decade. What exactly does Kamala Harris stand for, if not more of the same? That’s not a rhetorical question. I truly don’t know. But she is happy to take the endorsement of Dick Cheney, the chickenhawk warmonger who for 50 years has stood for everything wrong with American elites and American politics. And if Donald Trump’s words have grown more vicious, he has his reasons. In the last year, prosecutors in his former home state launched not one but two trials against him, the first aimed at bankrupting him over loans he repaid in full, the second at imprisoning him for the crime of winning in 2016. In front of juries in Manhattan, a county that voted against Trump by nearly 9 to 1 in 2020, both succeeded. And - though the media rarely sees fit to mention this - Trump was almost assassinated in July, under circumstances that remain somewhat murky. In response, Trump did NOT stop campaigning. He is working harder to win votes than he ever has, in the face of an elite media that hates him more than ever. For all his complaints about rigged elections, he wants to win this one quite badly. So, yes, Donald Trump is angry. He has the right to be. We ALL have the right to be. For too long, our self-appointed betters - in the media, in public health, in academia - have told us they know best. They have told us that men can be women if they just click their heels three times, that the United States is an evil nation founded mostly to protect slavery, that there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. Most of all they have tried to shut down - to cancel, to censor -anyone who disagrees. They’ve gone too far. And with their lawfare, they have proven that they will do anything to stop the man they abhor. So I will be voting for Donald Trump. It is not an easy choice - not for me, anyway - but it is the only choice.","summary":"Best-selling author and former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson endorses Trump in Tuesday&apos;s election, and details how he arrived at a choice he never thought he&apos;d make.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/alex-berenson-why-im-voting-donald-j-trump","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/10/931/523/88c735c0-file-66.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-02 23:14:33","author":"Alex Berenson","authors":["Alex Berenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":262086668,"title":"Trump invites 'brave' women's swim team that 'stood up to' transgender athlete to rally stage","text":"Members of the Roanoke College women's swimming team who spoke up against a transgender athlete trying to join the team last year were invited on stage at Donald Trump's rally in Salem, Virginia, Saturday. The team wore shirts that said \"Keep [hot dogs] out of women's sports.\" Prior to bringing them up on stage, Trump explained the backstory of when a former member of the men's swim team at the school attempted to join the women's squad last year. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Last year, the radical left's gender insanity arrived right here in Salem when a man was allowed to transfer onto the Roanoke College's women's swim team,\" Trump said. \"I just met them backstage. They're great swimmers. … The brave members of the swim team stood up to the transgender fanatics, something new in our country.\" After Trump's introduction, a team captain, Lily Mullens, spoke. \"Thank you so much, President Trump.

The state doesn’t have early voting — instead offering the time-consuming and paperwork heavy option of on-demand mail balloting. It also doesn’t process its mail ballots ahead of Election Day.\n\nSo, in the hours after polls close on Election Day, when many battleground states will be reporting their early, mail and Election Day totals, Pennsylvania will be counting ballots around the clock in a mad dash to catch up. \n\nThen there’s the “fixing” or “curing” of ballots with minor errors, such as mail-in ballot mixing a signature. If a ballot has errors, each county in the state decides on its own whether it will let voters “fix” them, creating significant differences in voting policy throughout the state. (Most states have a statewide policy for curing ballots.)\n\nAnd finally, after the ballots are counted, there can be challenges. Pennsylvania laws give residents a spate of ways to challenge and delay certification of the results with recounts, appeals, and litigation.\n\nElection experts say Pennsylvania’s laws make it fertile ground for rigged election claims to flourish. They also stressed that there is little reason to believe that unsubstantiated voter fraud claims—and any lawsuits associated with them—will actually stop the certification of the results.\n\n“The Pennsylvania legislature had multiple opportunities to clarify and improve the state’s election law,” said Nate Persily, an NBC News election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School. “It deliberately chose not to. The gaps in the law provide a vacuum that gets filled with conspiracy theories and require the courts to bring coherence to an incoherent regime.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his campaign are already targeting Pennsylvania, falsely claiming there is large-scale “cheating” and “voter fraud” at play.\n\nTrump’s campaign has repeatedly portrayed the long lines in Bucks County during on-demand mail balloting as a form of voter suppression that, according to vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, was “voter fraud” perpetrated by Democrats. (The state’s Republican secretary of the commonwealth, Al Schmidt, rejected Vance’s claim.)\n\n“They’ve already started cheating in Lancaster, they’ve cheated. We caught ‘em with 2600 votes,” Trump said at a recent rally, misconstruing a real incident where hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications were identified and rejected in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis type of disinformation campaign is what worries Wendy Weiser most. As vice president for democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law School, Weiser said she isn’t concerned that partisans will somehow block the certification of the results. “Those are not battles that are going to succeed,” she told NBC News recently.\n\nBut she fears that Trump’s “disinformation campaign” and “broad propaganda efforts” will “cause people to think there is something wrong with the election,” she said. “That’s a huge danger that we’re already in.”\n\nOnce the results are counted, there are several ways for the Trump campaign — if it loses — and its allies to challenge the results.\n\n“We should expect a spate of local litigation throughout the state in the immediate aftermath of the election, not because those suits are meritorious, but because Pennsylvania law is rife with such opportunities,” said Michael Morse, an NBC News election law expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law.\n\nState law allows any “aggrieved” person who disagrees with how a county board handled its results to appeal them within two days, something that will delay certification temporarily, Morse said in an email. Limited recounts can be demanded by as few as three voters in a precinct, per state law, something that helped delay Pennsylvania’s 2022 result certification by weeks.\n\nBut the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has tightened the standard for such a recount, requiring petitioners to identify and show evidence that fraud or error occurred, Morse said.\n\nTrump supporters on county boards across the country have sought to block the certification of election results by delaying or voting against the certification in the past.\n\nAll three experts, though, agreed that Pennsylvania’s courts have tools and legal precedents that allow them to force certification of the results when no credible claims of large-scale voter fraud exist.\n\nState courts have also taken steps to ensure that legal challenges are handled swiftly. The state Supreme Court has expedited its election appeal period from ten to three days to ensure that the state certifies its results by the December 11th federal deadline created by the Electoral Count Reform Act, enacted in 2022 to clarify the counting of presidential election results.\n\n“The concern to me is less certification of the vote by December 11,” Morse said. “Than the collateral damage to voter confidence that bad-faith actors can easily inflict along the way.”","summary":"With Pennsylvania expected to be a close and crucial state in the&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-reasons-behind-pennsylvanias-unique-voting-laws-that-could-lead-to-accusations-of-election-fraud/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Why-Pennsylvanias-unusual-voting-laws-make-it-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-02 22:40:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.337}]}
