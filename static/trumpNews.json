Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy TASH MOSHEIM SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:51 GMT, 5 March 2025 |Updated:01:00 GMT, 5 March 2025 \n\nWhen BBC bosses sacked the much loved Sue Barker from Question of Sport and replaced her with a much younger male presenter, the show's millions of fans were furious.\nIn fact, three quarters of them stopped watching in protest that Paddy McGuinness - then 47-years-old - took the then 64-year-old former tennis star's seat.\nSo you'd think that the Corporation may have wanted to show her some kindness.\nBut Ms Barker revealed just how vindictive the BBC has been by banning her from using any reference - or even mentioning Question of Sport during the Sue, Matt & Phil Live! The Reunion Tour which she is currently touring the UK with alongside former panellists Phil Tuffnell and Matt Dawson.\nOn Sunday at the Hammersmith Eventim in London, she told the audience that neither she or her co-stars were allowed to mention the programme, which was axed in 2023 after 53 years on the airwaves.\nShe also revealed that she was forbidden from using the names of the rounds that were used on Question of Sport, such as the picture board or the one minute round.\n\nSue Barker has revealed she is banned from mentioning A Question Of Sport on her new reunion tour, after she was dropped from the show in 2021\nAs the trio welcomed the audience, she made a point of not mentioning the show because they were not allowed to.\nDuring the show they mocked the BBC's decision by making a play of the fact they were forbidden from mentioning it.\nSpeaking to the viewers, former England rugby star Mr Dawson said: 'Welcome to...' before saying an illegible word in place of Question of Sport.\nMs Barker said: 'We're not allowed to use any of the names of the rounds, but in actual fact, they're all exactly the same. So let's go and play a quiz.\n'It's lovely to be back, before I got sacked, basically,' which prompted lots of boos from the sell-out crowd.\nThere was no mention of the programme during the two-hour long show,\nMs Barker's confession comes amid ongoing criticism of the BBC's handling of Question of Sport since her departure.\nOnce a primetime favourite, the show suffered a dramatic ratings decline following its revamp under new host McGuinness, who has no sporting background.\n\nOnce a primetime favourite, the show suffered a dramatic ratings decline following its revamp under new host Paddy McGuinness, and was reportedly axed in 2023\nFans were dismayed by the replacement of its traditional sporting guests with celebrity participants such as Jamie Laing and Anton Du Beke and the introduction of light-hearted, non-sporting challenges.\nAt its peak, Question of Sport drew audiences of up to 19 million.\n\n Question Of Sport's Sue Barker says the BBC 'wanted a younger audience' \nUnder Ms Barker's tenure, it consistently attracted between four and five million viewers.\nAfter McGuinness, 51, stepped into Sue Barker's shoes, ratings plummeted to just 800,000 in 2023, prompting the BBC to axe the programme last year, after 51 years on air.\nThe former tennis player has since spoken of her disappointment at the show's demise, describing it as 'the best fun I ever had on television'.\nSpeaking on the Monday Mile podcast last year, she said: 'I'm really disappointed for this next batch of athletes that they won't have that experience..'\nWhen asked if she would consider returning should the show be revived, Ms Barker admitted: 'I would be amazingly tempted... but I know the right decision is no.'\nDespite the cancellation, the BBC has yet to confirm whether Question of Sport has been permanently retired.\nMs Barker was previously hopeful it would return, saying: 'Hopefully they'll bring it back because they haven't said they're going to bin it forever. So bring it back and have fun again, it'll be great.'\nBBCLondonPaddy McGuinness\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSue Barker takes a swipe at BBC bosses for Question Of Sport sacking and reveals she's BANNED from mentioning the show on reunion tour\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

comment","text":"Roger Cook’s description of Mr Vance came as Australia vies for an exemption from the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister said on Wednesday he “wouldn’t use that language” and that Mr Cook had acknowledged it “wasn’t a moment of the greatest discipline on his part”.\n\n“That’s obviously not language I would use in terms of describing the American Vice-President and to be frank, the relationship between our government and the new administration in America is going well and they have treated us with enormous respect,” Mr Marles told the ABC.\n\n“I was the first of (JD Vance’s) international counterparts that he met of anyone around the world. \n\n“Penny Wong was the second foreign minister that Secretary Rubio met in terms of any foreign minister around the world. \n\n“We’ve had two discussions between the Prime Minister and the President. \n\n“You know, there is a real courtesy and respect which is being afforded to us by the Trump administration and we’re grateful for that.”\n\nMr Cook, who is seeking a third term, made the comment at a pre-election event in Perth, during which he said the Trump administration represented an “uncertain” road.\n\nA journalist asked him to finish the sentence: “JD Vance is a …”\n\n“Knob,” Mr Cook replied, sparking laughter and applause.\n\nHe later brushed it off as a “lighthearted, non-professional moment” and said he “didn’t mean any offence”.\n\n“When I made the comments there was a lot of applause around the room so perhaps some people enjoyed the fun that came with it,” he told reporters.\n\n“Other people might have been offended and I apologise.”\n\nDonald Trump and Mr Vance sparked international ire after they berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a broadcast exchange in the White House.\n\nMr Vance accused the Mr Zelenskyy of not being grateful enough for US support as Ukraine fights back against invading Russian forces.","summary":"Labor has gone into damage control after Western Australia’s premier called Donald Trump’s number two a

cash to Musk","text":"An internet rights group on Tuesday raised alarm over reports the United States may steer billions of dollars to Elon Musk's Starlink by making changes to a rural broadband deployment program.\n\nNet neutrality supporter Free Press spoke out after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Commerce could set Musk up for a windfall by overhauling a $42.5 billion program established under former President Joe Biden to bring broadband internet service to rural parts of the country.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff he plans to significantly increase the share of money available to satellite-internet providers such as Starlink rather than firms that use fiber-optic cables to deliver high-speed internet service, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation.\n\nStarlink is a unit of Musk's SpaceX company.\n\nMusk -- the world's wealthiest person and a top donor to Donald Trump's 2024 campaign -- has status as a \"special government employee\" and \"senior adviser to the president.\"\n\nTrump put Musk in charge of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency that has been slashing the ranks of US agencies under the auspices of budget cutting.\n\n\"The Trump administration is undermining an essential bipartisan program designed to bring reliable and affordable broadband to tens of millions of Americans -- and it's doing so just to line Elon Musk's already bulging pockets,\" Free Press co-chief Craig Aaron said in a statement.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the Federal Communications Commission rejected Starlink's application for nearly $900 million in subsidies on the grounds it failed to show it could meet service requirements, Free Press noted.\n\nFiber optic cables are considered faster and more reliable than satellites for broadband internet service.\n\nCongress created the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program as part of a 2021 infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law.\n\nProposals from every US state have been approved, but critics argue the program is moving too slowly.\n\nThe bill called on states to prioritize reliable, fast broadband service built to last, according to Free Press.\n\n\"The Trump administration is throwing out this sensible approach to favor only providers who are stationed inside the White House,\" Aaron said.\n\n\"From the FAA to the Defense Department, giving billions to Musk seems to be the Trump administration's top priority, and now the Commerce Department is getting in on the action,\" he added.\n\nStarlink internet service can currently be accessed by anyone in the United States, and the company doesn't need taxpayer subsidies, Free Press argued.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"An internet rights group on Tuesday raised alarm over reports the United States may steer billions of dollars to Elon Musk's Starlink by making

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy MOLLY CLAYTON SHOWBUSINESS CORRESPONDENT \n Published:00:27 GMT, 5 March 2025 |Updated:00:48 GMT, 5 March 2025 \n\nGeorgia Harrison has spoken out about her court case with Stephen Bear left her out of pocket, claiming the 'justice system needs to change'.\nSpeaking tonight at the What Next in the Fight Against Image-Based Abuse?, a parliamentary roundtable hosted by the Rt. Hon. Kirith Entwistle MP and GLAMOUR UK, in partnership with the End Violence Against Women & Girls Coalition, Georgia, 30, discussed her experience with the civil law.\n'In terms of civil compensation for me, the money that was made from my video was around £27,000,' Georgia said. \n'I was given £5,000 for the struggles I had gone through, which is actually quite high for a victim. \n'And that doesn't make any sense that he can take all of the money made off of my body. \n'I went through a very hefty case that lasted well over a year and I was awarded the most anyone has ever got for a case like mine which was around £209,000. \n\nGeorgia Harrison has spoken out about her court case with Stephen Bear left her out of pocket, claiming the 'justice system needs to change'\n'At the time my perpetrator then owned a house worth £550,000 in his name. \n'When I went into the civil court it got adjourned half way through, because of that it was put out there how much I would win. \n'During the six days after, my perpetrator got to sell his house, from prison, to a company called We Buy Any House, from the sex offenders wing, I got nothing. \n'In the end I ended up with minus £7,000, but at least I have my dignity. We need to change the justice system.'\nStephen Bear, from Loughton, Essex, was sentenced to 21 months in March 2023 after a jury found him guilty of voyeurism and disclosing private, sexual photographs and films after he leaked a sex tape of Georgia.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) previously told how Stephen has shown 'a complete lack of remorse'.\nAhead of his sentencing, he posed for selfies outside court and sang Lady In Red to a reporter wearing a red coat. He also arrived for hearings, supported by his father, in lavish outfits and a Rolls Royce.\nAs he was jailed, he waved from the dock and said: 'Have a good evening. Enjoy the weekend everyone.'\n\nStephen Bear (pictured in January) was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2023 after being found guilty of disclosing private photographs and films after he leaked a sex tape of Georgia\n\nSpeaking tonight at the What Next in the Fight Against Image-Based Abuse?, a parliamentary roundtable, Georgia discussed her experience with the civil law\nStephen was given a restraining order to not contact Georgia for five years. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register and is subjected to notification requirements for 10 years.\nLast February, GLAMOUR launched its GLAMOUR Talks Consent campaign, with research which found that 91 per cent of women think deepfaking poses a threat to the safety of women.\nIn recent months, a number of high profile figures have been victims of deepfake pornography, including pop star Taylor Swift and US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\nFake images and videos are made to look realistic, and victims are usually unaware and unable to consent to being sexualised in such a way.\nAlso at the event tonight was Cally Jane Beech, 33, who appeared on Love Island in 2015 and has become a prominent activist to raise awareness of the disturbing rise of deepfake porn and call for the Government to clamp down on the vile abuse.\nCally discovered digitally faked nude photos of herself circulating online in January last year.\nGeorgia HarrisonStephen Bear\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGeorgia Harrison reveals she was left with 'minus £7,000' despite winning revenge porn legal battle with ex Stephen Bear as she insists the 'justice system needs to change'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy JESSICA JANES FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:40 GMT, 5 March 2025 |Updated:00:45 GMT, 5 March 2025 \n\nShe disappeared from Hollywood for over a decade after becoming a huge child star. \nNow, the actress, 37, has delighted fans as she made a rare public appearance at Comic Con in Scotland on Saturday. \nAt the event, the star appeared in high spirits as she donned a chic black leather jacket. \nShe styled her short black locks into a voluminous blowout, complemented by a bold swipe of red lipstick as she greeted her fans.\nSharing a photo of herself signing autographs on Instagram, the actress wrote: 'First day of #ComicConScotlandAberdeen!' \nBut do you recognise her? \n\nShe disappeared from Hollywood for over a decade after becoming a huge child star - But do you recognise her?\nThat's right, It's Matilda child star Mara Wilson! \nThe American actress landed her first big break in 1993, starring alongside the late Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. \nThe following year, she appeared in the beloved Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street. \nHowever, she truly rose to fame in 1996 after landing the iconic role of Matilda in the movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel. \nThe movie, which also starred legendary actor Danny DeVito, is a nostalgic classic for many people of a certain generation. \nMatilda follows the story of a young girl, underappreciated by her cruel parents and tormented by the evil headmistress Miss Trunchbull.\nUsing her psychic powers, Matilda takes matters into her own hands and is eventually adopted by her caring teacher, Miss Honey. \nDespite the movie's massive success, Mara chose to step away from acting to pursue a career as a writer instead. \n\nThat's right, It's Mara Wilson from Matilda! (pictured in the movie in 1996)\n\nThe American actress, now 37, landed her first big break in 1993, starring alongside the late Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire (L-R Matthew Lawrence, Lisa Jakub, Robin Williams, Mara, and Sally Field)\n\n Mrs Doubtfire stars REUNITE! On-screen siblings Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson and Lisa Jakub pose for rare snap and tease new project - 31 years after film's premiere \nMara previously said: 'Writing was always my secret desire. It was always something that in the back of my head I wanted to do.' \nShe continued: 'I wrote a lot of stories on the sets of movies. On Matilda, I wrote several.' \nShe has since written for prestigious publications like Elle, The New York Times and Vanity Fair and released her memoir, Where Am I Now?, in 2016.\nMara, who was just nine-years-old when Matilda was released, is said to have left acting behind in 2000.\nShe later explained why she walked away from Hollywood, saying: 'The rejection hurt because it had been just such a prominent part of my life for so long. It had been the thing that defined me.'\n'Writing I'd always loved. There's a saying - \"If you can live without it, you should\". And I found that I could.'\nHowever, in 2016, Mara made a brief return to television, appearing in a Mrs. Doubtfire-inspired episode of Broad City where she played a waitress and re-enacted the iconic Heimlich scene from the film.\nThat same year, she voiced Jill Pill, a writer/director anthropomorphic spider, in season three of BoJack Horseman. \n\nThe following year, she appeared in the beloved Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street (pictured with late Richard Attenborough in 1994)\n\nHowever, she truly rose to fame in 1996 after landing the iconic role of Matilda in the movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel (pictured with Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman in the movie)\nMara Wilson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n90s child star looks unrecognisable as she attends Comic Con in Scotland - but can YOU guess who it is?\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

About 53% of those veterans are disabled.\n\nThe federal downsizing includes the recent firing of about 1,400 probationary workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nProbationary workers have less than a year on the job and don't have the same protected employment status as non-probationary workers in the federal government.\n\nOfficials for the Disabled American Veterans advocacy group speculated the VA firings would have a negative effect on disabled veterans and their families.","summary":"Military veterans are among those who have lost federal government jobs as the Trump administration continues downsizing to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/03/04/alina-habba-veterans-fired/5121741133908/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5121741133908/2025/upi/1872f065f6b4f90b8265d7607de3e559/v1.2/Trump-White-House-adviser-Habba-critical-of-fired-federal-employees-including-veterans.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:41:24","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":296746828,"title":"Judge educates Trump administration on First Amendment for a long time","text":"The Trump administration has failed to convince a federal judge that its efforts to penalize “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) initiatives should be allowed to go forward amid an ongoing lawsuit.\n\nIn January, President Donald Trump issued two executive orders attempting to root out DEI from federal government contracts and barring government contractors with in-house DEI programs. Additionally, Trump directed the U.S. attorney general to “deter” such “programs or principles” and to consider launching “civil compliance” investigations to bring about such deterrence.\n\nOn Feb. 21, U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson, a Joe Biden appointee, issued a preliminary nationwide injunction against the three anti-DEI directives. On Feb. 25, the government filed a motion to stay the court’s order pending appeal. On Feb. 28, the plaintiffs in the case urged the judge to stick to his guns.\n\nOn Monday, the court denied the government’s motion to stay the injunction. In a 10-page memorandum opinion and order, the judge opined at length that the government’s anti-DEI policies constitute one of the “most egregious” violations of the First Amendment.\n\nIn the order, the judge notes that the government expressly aims to “deter” certain “principles” it disagrees with. Under long-established Supreme Court case law, the legal terminology to describe such action is “content discrimination.” Specifically, the subset of speech policing at issue is “viewpoint discrimination.”\n\nThat kind of government action is in the mainline of protections provided by the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee, the court notes. And here, the government’s various attempts to stamp out DEI created a panoply of free speech violations, the judge observed.\n\nThe court suggests the issue is not at all close.\n\n“[T]he specific executive order provisions at issue in this case run afoul of these protections, and do so on their face, meaning the provisions themselves, among other things, expressly ‘draw distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys,”” the order reads. “They punish, or threaten to punish, individuals and institutions based on the content of their speech, and in doing so they specifically target viewpoints the government seems to disfavor. The provisions target not only purely private persons who have no nexus to federal funding, but also ‘seek to leverage funding to regulate speech’ of individuals and institutions that happen to contract with (or receive grants from) the federal government, and they terminate benefits or threaten punishment ‘because of [individuals’] speech on matters of public concern,’ which constitute independent First Amendment violations.”\n\nThe Fifth Amendment also looms large in the case.\n\nThe coalition of plaintiffs, led by the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, also convinced the judge that some anti-DEI directives were too vague and “undefined” for people to know exactly what the administration was trying to punish.\n\nThose concerns are ancillary to the First Amendment analysis, Abelson said.\n\nThe court explains, at length:\n\nThe specific provisions at issue also likely violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. After all, the First and Fifth Amendment analyses in this case merge in several ways, because laws that “interfere with the right of free speech or of association” must pass a “stringent vagueness test,” for such a law to give citizens sufficient notice of “what is prohibited, so that [they] may act accordingly,” and for such a law to provide sufficiently “explicit standards” to avoid “arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”\n\nThe Trump administration, for their part, argued the court’s nationwide injunction “intrudes on the Executive’s authority to enforce the law” and harms “intra-executive policy implementation by enjoining the President’s policy directives to federal agencies.”\n\nAnd, in any event, it was still unconvincing.\n\n“As the Court explained in its memorandum opinion granting the preliminary injunction, the executive branch is obviously entitled to have policy goals and to pursue them,” the opinion goes on. “But in pursuing those goals it must comply with the Constitution, including, as relevant here, the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.”\n\nLove true crime?

Likewise, Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits based on the unconstitutional vagueness of the challenged provisions. Defendants have offered no new evidence or arguments that justify a reassessment of the balance of the harms or the public interest considerations in this case.”\n\nIn an alternative but also failed effort to get the court to reconsider the extent of the injunction, U.S. Department of Justice lawyers cited both Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch. Abelson said those citations were not convincing. The Gorsuch reference had to do with a different issue; the Thomas reference had to do with a general disdain for so-called “universal” injunctions.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge educates Trump administration on First Amendment for a long time first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-educates-trump-administration-on-first-amendment-for-a-long-time/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Judge-gives-lengthy-First-Amendment-lecture-to-Trump-admin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:36:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":296747176,"title":"Trump to address Congress for first time since return","text":"Camera IconThe theme of Donald Trump's speech is the \"renewal of the American dream\", the White House says.

Lincoln. Washington. Jefferson.\n\nIt might sound strange, but bills introduced this year could put President Donald Trump’s mug right in line with these other iconic former leaders.\n\nOne such bill (HR 792) was filed back in January by U.S. Rep. Anna Luna, R-Florida, and it would direct the Secretary of the Interior to arrange the carving of Trump on the Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n\n“His remarkable accomplishments for our country and the success he will continue to deliver deserve the highest recognition and honor on this iconic national monument,” Rep. Luna wrote on X. “Let’s get carving!”\n\nWhile it might sound odd, the legislation isn’t alone in seeking to plaster the president’s face in the public view.\n\nJust last week, U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, announced that he introduced what he dubbed the “Donald J. Trump $250 Bill Act,” which as the moniker might indicate, would establish a new $250 bill and print Trump’s face on it.\n\n“Next year is the 250th Anniversary of the United States and allows this currency not only to be in a larger denomination to help families carry less cash, but also symbolically recognize the President of the United States during the Semiquincentennial anniversary,” Rep. Wilson explained.\n\nAnd Wilson’s not the only one. U.S. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, also introduced a similar bill on Monday that would feature a picture of Trump on the front face of the $100 bill.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require that all $100 bills issued after Dec. 31, 2028, replace Benjamin Franklin’s face with Trump’s own.\n\n“Featuring him on the $100 bill is a small way to honor all he will accomplish these next four years,” Gill said.\n\nAnd if these bills weren’t enough, U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-New York, also put forward a bill just last month that would make Trump’s birthday a new national holiday.\n\nUnder that bill (HR 1395), Trump’s birthday and Flag Day — both of which fall on June 14 — would be designated as a legal public holiday.\n\nHR 1395 was referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Feb. 14, so there are still quite a few steps to take before an official vote by lawmakers on whether to approve the bill.\n\nBut if the bill is passed by both the U.S. House and Senate and signed by the eponymous president, then Trump’s birthday could indeed become an official holiday.\n\nTenney took to social media after introducing the bill, explaining why she chose to put it forward.\n\n“No modern president has been more pivotal for our country than Donald J. Trump,” she wrote. “Today, I introduced legislation to designate Trump’s Birthday and Flag Day as a federal holiday, ensuring President Trump’s contributions to American greatness are forever enshrined into law.”\n\nJuneteenth was the latest federal holiday established, having been signed into law back in 2021 under then-President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to officials, most federal employees are given days off for public holidays, so if HR 1395 were signed into law, then it would add to the list of 11 existing federal holidays, which include:\n\nNew Year’s Day — Jan. 1Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Birthday — Third Monday in JanuaryGeorge Washington’s Birthday/President’s Day — Third Monday in FebruaryMemorial Day — Last Monday in MayJuneteenth National Independence Day — June 19Independence Day — July 4Labor Day — First Monday in SeptemberColumbus Day — Second Monday in OctoberVeterans Day — Nov. 11Thanksgiving Day — Fourth Thursday in NovemberChristmas Day — Dec. 25","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC – Roosevelt.

The charges stem from a failed effort by Castillo to declare a state of emergency and dissolve Peru's Congress as legislators prepared an impeachment vote against him in December 2022. Also Read | Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Calls Spat With US President Donald Trump 'Regrettable', Says Ready To Negotiate Peace Deal Immediately. Castillo failed to get the military's support for his move, and was swiftly deposed by Congress and arrested after prosecutors accused him of trying to promote a coup. But the removal of Castillo, Peru's first Indigenous president, sparked large protests in the south of the country, in which at least 49 people were killed in the weeks following the president's ouster. Castillo was replaced by then-Vice President Dina Boluarte, who now leads a conservative government and has built alliances with legislators from the nation's traditional parties. The former president's trial is taking place in a police base, where he has been held since he made his unsuccessful attempt to dissolve Congress and call for new elections.

Prosecutors have said they are seeking a 34-year prison sentence against Castillo, a former union leader and rural school teacher who won Peru's 2021 election with a surprise victory over the nation's political establishment. The left-wing politician showed up at the trial half an hour late and in an opening statement he denied being guilty of rebellion. “All I did was express the wishes of the people through a speech,\" Castillo said of his effort to dissolve Congress. On Dec 7, 2022, Castillo read out a decree on national television in which he attempted to dissolve Congress and call for new elections. Castillo did not bring a lawyer to the trail, which he has described as a “farce” on his social media accounts, and was instead appointed a public defender. The former president has tried to get one of the judges overseeing the trial removed, arguing she has already expressed her views on his attempt to dissolve Congress. Castillo is also facing a separate investigation for corruption in which he has been accused of irregularly providing promotions to members of the military and avoiding standard procurement practices to grant a contract for a bridge. Castillo had survived two impeachment votes before his unsuccessful attempt to dissolve Congress in late 2022. He and his supporters have argued that conservative parties in Congress were blocking his policy initiatives and making it impossible for Castillo's government to carry out efforts to increase government spending and bring education and infrastructure to neglected rural areas. Castillo's opponents have accused him of corruption and of undermining democracy through his attempt to dissolve Congress. A similar move to shut down Congress by President Alberto Fujimori in the early 1990s led to several years of authoritarian rule. Castillo's removal from office has also created a rift between the government of Peru and left leaning administrations in Colombia and Mexico, where Castillo's family sought refuge after he was deposed. Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a longtime ally of Castillo, wrote on his X account Tuesday that Peru's former president is being tried for rebellion because \"he is poor and from the left.” The Colombian president, whose government no longer has an ambassador in Peru, said authorities in Peru are “mocking\" voters who elected Castillo in 2021. Peru is scheduled to hold elections next year. President Boluarate has said that as the former vice president, she is obliged to serve out the rest of Castillo's term.

Approximately 650 million NIS (USD 180 million) will be allocated to improve planning and housing, with a dedicated planning committee being established to accelerate development and streamline processes. This includes efforts to promote new construction, particularly for discharged soldiers and young couples, as well as improving infrastructure such as electricity connections.\nAlso Read | Pakistan Bomb Blast: At Least 9 Killed, 16 Injured in Suicide Attack As 2 Explosive-Laden Vehicles Ram Into Cantonment in Bannu, 6 Terrorists Neutralised (Watch Videos).\nAnother significant component of the plan is the empowerment of local authorities. More than 1 billion NIS (USD 2,77,000,000) will be directed toward strengthening budgets, improving organizational efficiency, and enhancing service delivery. Localities will also benefit from investments in economic projects designed to promote financial independence and stimulate growth.\nIn terms of education, the plan outlines a 450 million NIS ( USD 124 million) investment to enhance the education system, better aligning it with the demands of the future job market.\nAdditionally, more than 1 billion NIS will be allocated to boost local economies, integrate the community into high-tech industries, increase productivity, and develop industrial zones. Furthermore, small and medium-sized businesses will receive support, alongside investments in vocational training and career guidance.\nImprovements to public transportation, welfare services, and the expansion of cultural and sports activities are also central to the plan. These efforts aim to enhance the overall quality of life for Druze and Circassian residents and promote sustainable growth.\nIsrael's Druze community of 1,52,000 trace their ancestry back to the Biblical figure Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses. Israeli Druze serve in senior positions in public and military life, and the bond between Jewish and Druze soldiers is referred to as the \"covenant of blood.\" The Druze speak Arabic but are not Muslim and are very secretive about their religious beliefs.\nThe Druze living in the Galilee and Mount Carmel areas sided with the Jews in 1948 during Israel's War of Independence, opted to be part of Israeli society and established themselves in all areas of public life.\nWhen Israel captured the Golan Heights during the Six-Day War of 1967, the Golan Druze refused Israeli offers of citizenship, believing Syria would recapture the plateau. But attitudes have changed since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011.\nIsrael's Circassian population is approximately 5,000. Although they are Muslim, they serve in the Israeli military. The community traces its roots to the Caucasus, Crimea, Georgia and the Black Sea shores. The Circassians came to present-day Israel in the late 1800s when Russia deported them to the Ottoman Empire.

In response to Trump's tariffs, Ottawa and Beijing have announced plans to retaliate, sparking fears of a global trade war.On Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatened to block energy exports to the U.S. \"with a smile\" if the tariffs imposed on Canadian goods went into effect.What to KnowThe fourth-largest energy commodity traded between Canada and the U.S. is electricity, preceded by crude oil, natural gas and petroleum, respectively. Energy products from Canada now pace a 10 percent tariff.According to a report from the Canadian Energy Centre, Canada's electricity exports to the U.S. were north of $54 billion between 2000 and 2019. According to the data, Vermont was considered the \"top recipient\" of electricity exports from Canada in 2019 at $585 million.Joseph Webster, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, told Newsweek that Canada electricity exports to the U.S. peaked in 2020 and have declined since. However, several cities still benefit significantly from Canadian electricity, including Buffalo, New York; Ogdensburg, New York; Pembina, North Dakota; Seattle, Washington; Great Falls, Montana; and Portland, Maine.Those cities, particularly upstate New York, would be significantly impacted if Canadian leaders block energy exports to the U.S. If electricity exports are blocked with little warning, Webster said it could result in significant price increases for Americans.On Monday, Ford said Canadian energy kept \"the lights on for 1.5 million homes and manufacturing [facilities] in New York, in Michigan and in Minnesota.\" In December, he also threatened to restrict energy exports to those three states.In addition to New York, Michigan and Minnesota, states identified as importing the most electricity from Canada include North Dakota, New Hampshire, Maine, California, Vermont, Nevada and Arizona, according to a 2020 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).What People Are SayingFord in comments made on Monday: \"I don't start a tariff war, but we're going to win this tariff war. If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything—including cut off their energy with a smile on my face, and I'm encouraging every other province to do the same.\"Ford added, \"They rely on our energy.

These are known as \"enablers\".\n\nUkraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia.\n\nA European peacekeeping or \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary.\n\nThese enablers \"can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry\" as one European politician put it to me.\n\nThis is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible.\n\n\"Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,\" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me.\n\nWe were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday.\n\n\"Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation.\n\n\"Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind.\"\n\nAnother fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence.\n\nOn Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it.\n\nGermany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future.\n\nBerlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little.\n\nAs for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that \"Europe is in an era of re-armament\".\n\nShe suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by:\n\nUsing its joint budget more creativelyProviding 150bn euros in loans to benefit the defence of the EU as a whole — so, for example, in air and missile defence, anti-drone systems, and military mobilitySuspending EU fiscal rules to allow individual EU countries to spend more on defence\n\nEU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine.\n\nBut potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics.\n\nHungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way.\n\nCountries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence.\n\nIn Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities.\n\nBut Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow.\n\nEuropean nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says.\n\nIf Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnekw9lyjo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0515/live/fa288080-f946-11ef-ab6a-cb409d79bd4e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:28:11","author":"Katya Adler","authors":["Katya Adler"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.081},{"id":296745522,"title":"Ros Atkins on...

The Office of Special Counsel made the request Friday and disclosed it Tuesday. If the request is granted by the Merit Systems Protection Board, the employees would be back on the job for 45 days as an investigation continues. At that point, the board could be asked to make a final decision to reinstate them. Also Read | Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Calls Spat With US President Donald Trump 'Regrettable', Says Ready To Negotiate Peace Deal Immediately. Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger said the firings “appear to have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with federal personnel laws.\" It's possible that he could reach similar conclusions about employees at other departments as well. Probationary workers have been targeted for layoffs across the federal government because they're usually new to the job and lack full civil service protection. They were often summarily informed that they were being fired for poor performance. Also Read | Pakistan Bomb Blast: At Least 9 Killed, 16 Injured in Suicide Attack As 2 Explosive-Laden Vehicles Ram Into Cantonment in Bannu, 6 Terrorists Neutralised (Watch Videos). The case is proceeding at a moment of turbulence for the federal workforce and the offices responsible for protecting workers' rights. Not only are administration officials laying off thousands of employees, Trump wants to remove obstacles by firing Dellinger and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board nominated by President Joe Biden. Both attempts have been blocked through litigation, most recently on Tuesday when U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Trump did not have the power to remove Harris from office “at will.” The attempt to fire her was illegal because he didn't seek to remove her for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” the judge said. The one-sentence email that informed Harris of her firing didn't cite any of those reasons, Harris' attorneys said. “There are hard constitutional cases where the law remains unsettled and the Supreme Court has not spoken. This case is not among them,” they wrote in a court filing. Administration officials have already appealed Contreras' order. Harris was appointed in 2022 and has chaired the board since last March. Her term was due to expire in March 2028, but the White House notified her of her firing on Feb. 12. A second board member, Raymond Limon, retired Friday. Government attorneys argued that the judiciary doesn't have the authority to reinstate Harris or bar Trump from replacing her on the board. “The American people elected President Trump to run the executive branch,” they wrote. “And President Trump has determined that keeping (Harris) in office no longer serves the best interests of the American people. That democratically accountable choice should be respected.” The Merit Systems Protection Board is responsible for protecting federal government employees from political reprisals or retaliation for whistleblowing. Its administrative judges issue approximately 5,000 decisions annually. Trump's recent executive orders regarding federal employees have led to a surge in new appeals over the past few weeks, according to Harris' lawyers. “Now more than ever, the Board's actual impartiality and the appearance of impartiality are critical,” they wrote. “It is imperative that everyone — civil servants, courts, and the public at large — has confidence in the Board's ability to do its job, free from fear or favor.” The board's three members are nominated by the president and are confirmed by the Senate. Members serve seven-year terms. No more than two of them may come from the same political party. On Saturday, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sided with Dellinger in a case that's likely headed back to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Gen. Min Aung Hlaing was on his fourth trip to Russia since his army seized power in February 2021 from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Western nations have imposed economic and political sanctions in response to the takeover and the violent repression of opposition, which has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians and given rise to an armed conflict widely seen as civil war.

At the start of the Kremlin talks, Putin noted growing bilateral trade and close cooperation in the international arena, and thanked the Myanmar leader for sending six baby elephants to Moscow. Russia, along with China, is a major supporter and arms supplier to Myanmar. Russian-made fighter jets are used in attacks on territory under control of ethnic minority groups, many of them allies with pro-democracy resistance forces.

Russia defends Myanmar's military government in international forums, and the ruling generals generally support Moscow's foreign policy agenda. The countries have held joint military drills and signed a pact on developing nuclear power. The countries signed agreements to outline cooperation around Moscow building nuclear power plants in Myanmar and recognize academic qualifications. Ming Aung Hlaing emphasized his military government's support for Russia's military action in Ukraine. “Russia is a key backer of the Myanmar military,” said Morgan Michaels, a Singapore-based analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies. “In addition to diplomatic and symbolic support, it plays a vital role in enhancing and sustaining the regime's warfighting capacity.” Nay Phone Latt, a spokesperson for Myanmar's main opposition National Unity Government, said the military leader is in desperate need of international recognition and willing to trade the country's resources in exchange. “So, to maintain his power, he will go to countries that will recognize him and provide him with some kind of assistance,\" Nay Phone Latt said Monday in a text message to the AP.

The index stood at 380 in December compared with a peak of 601 in November 2018 when the city’s property market was booming.\n“To maintain the fund’s liquidity, we will continue to buy and sell shops with good potential,” he said. “Just like developers, we can’t hoard our stocks and wait while the market continues to drop.”\n\nLee, who forayed into property investments in 2009, said it was his fund’s first loss since it was set up in 2016. He said the sale was not due to any liquidity problems and the fund was not under any financial pressure.\nLee said Bridgeway would continue to offload retail units as sentiment in the property market continues to improve, citing rising transactions driven by a stock market rally.\nBanks in Hong Kong are wary of non-performing loans and rising leverage among their clients because of high borrowing costs. They have been asking borrowers to cover the difference in mortgages because of falling property values, forcing some owners to sell at distressed prices to raise cash.\nThe US and Hong Kong have kept their key interest rates unchanged this year amid new inflation challenges after cutting them three times last year. The policy uncertainty has become the biggest factor stoking leverage concerns among property owners.\nEconomists have pushed back forecasts for more rate cuts or a faster pace of easing because of fresh inflation risks in the US. President Donald Trump’s economic policies have also roiled global trade.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s base rate, which currently stands at 4.75 per cent, was likely to remain elevated for longer, according to some market observers.\nThere were 46 street shops for sale on Bridgeway’s website as of Tuesday. A ground floor shop in Kam Fung Mansion, Sai Ying Pun, had an asking price of HK$8.2 million, lower than the fund’s acquisition price of HK$8.3 million.\nThe retail property market has also been suffering because of falling retail sales and a weak rental outlook.\nHong Kong’s retail sales fell for the tenth consecutive month in December, bringing the overall decline in 2024 to 7.3 per cent, with total sales for the year amounting to HK$376.8 billion, according to official data.\nHigh street shop vacancy rates in the four key shopping districts of Central, Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok increased by 1 percentage point in last year’s fourth quarter from the previous three-month period, according to CBRE’s latest report. On an annual basis, the vacancy rate decreased by 1.3 percentage points to 7.8 per cent at the end of December.\nThe vacancy rate for high street shops was likely to remain relatively low, which could support rental growth of up to 5 per cent this year, CBRE said.\n“Leasing demand is expected to remain healthy on the back of attractive rents, resulting in higher profit margins for retailers,” the consultancy said, adding that a slow recovery in retail sales would provide limited room for rental growth.","summary":"Bridgeway, managed by veteran investor Edwin Lee, sold the shop for HK$18.7 million (US$2.4 million) after acquiring it for HK$27.5 million.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3301040/hong-kong-retail-property-fund-bridgeway-sells-jordan-shop-30-discount","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/04/52179f2d-ff57-4771-bc55-db362c73686b_7e58874b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:15:08","author":"Salina Li","authors":["Salina Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.001},{"id":296752176,"title":"Hong Kong Company will sell Panama Ports to a US Consortium","text":"Under strong pressure from US President Donald Trump, Hong Kong firm Hutchison announced Tuesday that it has agreed to transfer its stake in the operation of the Panama Canal and other port facilities to a US consortium. CK Hutchison Holdings will sell 90% of its shares in Panama Ports Company (PPC) and another series of ports to a group led by asset management giant BlackRock for $19 billion, according to a joint statement.\n\nHutchison owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic canal. The sale of PPC “will be carried out separately once the government of Panama confirms the proposed terms for the sale,” the statement said.\n\nSince taking office on January 20, Trump has denounced alleged Chinese control over the Panama Canal. The Republican president even threatened to retake control of the interoceanic waterway, which caused protests in the Central American country. In a joint press release with the buyers, Hutchison noted that the agreement was motivated by business, not politics.\n\n“I would like to highlight that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and is not related at all to recent political news about Panama’s ports,” said CK Hutchison Holdings co-CEO Frank Sixt. “This transaction is the result of a fast, discreet but competitive process in which numerous offers and expressions of interest were received,” said Sixt, who described the chosen agreement as “clearly in the best interest of shareholders.”\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the transaction demonstrated his firm’s ability to “deliver differentiated investments for clients,” according to the press release. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth,” Fink said.\n\nAudit continues\n\nThe announcement consists of transactions between the parties, one related to PPC and the other with various Hutchison stakes in 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. Completion of the agreement with PPC requires confirmation from the Panamanian government, the parties said.\n\nThe Panamanian government said in a statement that this sale “is a global transaction, between private companies, motivated by mutual interests,” which, however, will not interrupt “until its completion” an audit being carried out by the Comptroller’s Office on the subsidiary that operates both ports.\n\nIn February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama during his first trip abroad as Secretary of State, proof of the canal’s importance to the new administration. Rubio obtained a commitment from Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, China’s flagship infrastructure construction program.\n\nRubio also pushed for the free passage of US ships through the Panama Canal, after telling Panamanian officials it was unfair for the United States to be in a position to defend the vital waterway and also pay for its use. The waterway, built by the United States and inaugurated in 1914, was handed over to Panama 25 years ago after the signing of bilateral treaties.\n\nSince 2000, the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous state entity that manages the canal independently of the government, has successfully modernized the more than century-old waterways and locks to allow the passage of increasingly larger ships. Five percent of global maritime trade passes through this route.","summary":"Under strong pressure from US President Donald Trump, Hong Kong firm Hutchison announced Tuesday that it has agreed to transfer its stake in the operation of the Panama Canal and other port facilities to a US consortium.

It was like being on top of a big wave and you had to stay on.\n'You concentrate on not falling off. It became a whirlwind, but to be honest Zoe helped me through it as she knew that level of fame before.'\nSpeaking to The Mirror, he gushed: 'Zoe is a very kind, thoughtful person and she just had this way of just checking my ego like \"We are still human beings. We are still nice to people.\"'\n\nNorman Cook, otherwise known as Fatboy Slim, has gushed about his close relationship with his ex wife Zoe Ball, calling her his 'soulmate' (pictured in 2001) \n'She brought me through the trickier bits. If you are out with your mates you can't say to them \"I am having trouble coping with fame.\" You are not going to get a lot of sympathy.\n'But to Zoe I could say \"I am a bit scared. Is this not scary?\" We could talk about it as we were thrust into the same spotlight. It was nice to have a soulmate in there with you.' \nNorman and Zoe's son Woody Cook recently revaled how his parents have been 'gardening' and 'doing puzzles' and working in a local cafe since Zoe quit her six-figure radio job.\nRadio presenter Zoe stepped down from her BBC Radio 2 breakfast show in December to 'focus on her family', bidding farewell to her lucrative £950,000 salary.\nHer departure came after an extended break earlier in the year when her mother Julia died from cancer, and she is now enjoying some time off with her family before returning to airwaves in March with a new project.\nSpeaking exclusively to MailOnline last month, her son Woody, 24, gave an insight into how she has been spending her time since quitting her job, focusing on 'gardening' and 'doing puzzles'.\nHe admitted it has been 'funny' watching his 'crazy party' parents Zoe and Norman ditching wild nights out for more calm hobbies.\n'In the last five years, it's been funny watching my parents take up gardening both of them,' Woody - who was promoting his Specsavers partnership - shared. \n\nThe DJ, 61, and Radio 2 star Zoe, 54, split in 2016 after 18 years of marriage but have remained close friends and co parents to their children Woody, 24, and Nelly, 15\n\nIn a new interview to promote his new book looking back at his career, Norman has reflected on his enduring relationship with his 'soulmate' Zoe (pictured on their wedding day in 1999)\n\nPraising his ex for her support when they both rocketed to fame in the 1990s, Normal gushedL 'Zoe is a very kind, thoughtful person and she just had this way of just checking my ego\n'These crazy party people I grew up with are now gardening, making puzzles and working in the local café. \n'It's very funny to see that transitional period, just as I'm kind of leaving the nest and now at the start of something big for me in music.' \nFatboy Slim has owned the Big Beach Cafe in Hove, East Sussex since 2013.\nZoe and Norman were known for their hard-partying ways back in the 2000s and have both since spoken about their battles with alcohol.\nThey tied the knot in 1999 and welcomed their son Woody and a daughter Nelly, 15, together before they split up in 2016, though they remain very close friends.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFatboy Slim calls Zoe Ball his 'soulmate' as he reveals how his 'kind' ex wife has supported him through his tough times\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

What Betting Odds Say","text":"The odds are firmly against President Donald Trump ending the Russia-Ukraine war during his first 90 days back in the White House, according to a popular online betting market.Newsweek reached out for comment to the White House via email on Tuesday.Why It MattersDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to end the war in Ukraine within \"24 hours.\" While the self-imposed deadline came and went, the president has continued to call for a fast end to the war.Trump initially received a significant amount of backlash for opening a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin on ending the war while largely leaving Ukraine out of the loop.Last week's contentious meeting at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which featured Trump and Vice President JD Vance engaging in a heated argument with their guest in front of the press, and a freeze on U.S. aide to Ukraine has only intensified the criticism and doubts about peace.What To KnowRussia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, significantly escalating a war between the countries that has been taking place since Putin's forces invaded and annexed Crimea in March 2014.While the U.S. had been strongly allied with Ukraine and provided significant military aid to the country since the 2022 invasion, relations have been icy since Trump's return to office.Polymarket, which was funded in part by prominent Trump backer Peter Thiel, showed Trump with a 27 percent chance of ending the Russia-Ukraine war during his \"first 90 days\" as of early Tuesday evening.The odds have risen in recent days from a low of 19 percent on Sunday. However, the odds are well below a high point of 53 percent on November 7, two days after Trump won his second term.Polymarket odds, which are based on bets by users rather than any outside factors like polling, accurately predicted that Trump would defeat former Vice President Kamala Harris last year in the presidential election.According to Polymarket's terms, Trump will have ended the war if the following condition is met: \"An armistice, ceasefire, or negotiated settlement is announced by both Ukraine and Russia regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine at any point between the Associated Press calling the election for Donald Trump, and April 19, 2025, 11:59 PM ET.\"What People Are SayingTrump, during a White House press conference on Monday: \"The deal could be made very fast. It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast. Now, maybe somebody doesn't want to make a deal. And if somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long.That person will not be listened to very long. Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal, they've suffered more any anyone else.\"Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, in an opinion article published by U.S. News & World Report on Monday: \"The only way to get a real peace deal would be to convince Putin that he cannot conquer any more territory. That would entail the U.S. and our European partners giving Ukraine more weapons to create a stalemate on the battlefield. Trump, however, has signaled the opposite...Trump and his team have not proposed in public a single concession that Putin should make to end this war. Not one. Yet we are already seeing signs of Putin's future demands: limits on the number of soldiers Ukraine can have in its army, a ban on Ukraine importing weapons and other constraints on Ukraine's sovereignty.\"What Happens NextIt is unclear when, or if, a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will be reached. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Trump would announce during his joint speech to Congress that a mineral rights deal between Ukraine and the U.S., which could be a key component for a deal, had been signed.However, the White House quickly pushed back on the report, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent telling Fox News that \"there is no signing planned.\" A report from CBS News speculated that Trump was holding out for a \"bigger, better deal.\"","summary":"Trump repeatedly promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war within \"24 hours\" during his 2024 presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/can-trump-end-russia-ukraine-war-90-days-what-betting-odds-say-2039619","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2600401/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-war-peace-deal-odds.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:14:28","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":296750114,"title":"Can potash be a trade war weapon for Trump tariffs? Experts urge caution","text":"Canada is vowing to fight back against U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs that went into effect Tuesday, and potash could become a potent weapon in the growing trade war — but economists are urging caution.\n\nPotash is a key ingredient in fertilizer, and roughly 85 per cent of the supply used by American farmers comes from Canada — particularly Saskatchewan, where potash is a major export market.\n\nU.S. farming groups and even some Republicans aligned with Trump have called for potash to be exempted from the blanket tariffs out of concern for the agricultural industry.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford told reporters Tuesday that Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe should consider no longer selling potash, uranium and oil to the United States and instead find different markets.\n\n“We need to make sure America feels the pain,” Ford said. “Without potash down there, (the U.S.) doesn’t have a farming system.”\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, while announcing a first round of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, said Canada would also look at non-tariff measures if necessary but did not answer directly when asked whether Ottawa might curb exports of potash or crude oil.\n\nMoe has previously pushed back on the idea of restricting Canadian material exports to the U.S., and that Canada’s countermeasures should not disproportionately hurt any one province.\n\nHe said in a statement Tuesday that his cabinet would meet Wednesday to “consider all options” to respond to the U.S. tariffs, and reiterated calls for reduced interprovincial trade barriers and the promotion of pipelines and other infrastructure.\n\n“American farmers need Canadian fuel and fertilizer to grow their crops,” Moe said. “Trump’s tariffs will drive up the cost of oil, potash and uranium and that will drive up the cost of groceries for every American family.”\n\nEven with a decline in potash prices in 2023, Saskatchewan exported over $11.5 billion worth of potash that year. Nearly all of it goes to other countries, representing a full third of global production. The next largest producers, Russia and Belarus, make up another third combined, followed distantly by China.\n\nThe Canadian fertilizer industry said U.S. tariffs not just threaten food production and security on both sides of the border, but will also push American farmers toward those countries.\n\n“Imposing U.S. tariffs on Canadian fertilizer imports will distort the U.S. market in favour of countries such as Russia and China, who do not operate under the same environmental, human rights and trade practices, undermining the critical trade goals of each of our countries,” a statement from Fertilizer Canada said.\n\nBut Corey Rosenbusch, president and CEO of the Fertilizer Institute in Denver, Colo., said those countries won’t fill the gap left if the American agricultural industry moves away from Canadian potash.\n\n“There would not be (enough) supply globally to completely replace that,” he said in an interview. “Even with tariffs we still will need Canadian potash.”\n\nNutrien, one of the largest potash producers in Saskatchewan, has warned the cost of tariffs would ultimately be felt by U.S. farmers. The company told Global News it has been engaging with policymakers and stakeholders in the U.S. and Canada to make the case against tariffs.\n\nOther companies that mine potash in Saskatchewan — many of which are foreign-owned — declined requests for an interview or comment Tuesday.\n\nRosenbusch said farmers were able to import enough potash and other fertilizer products during February, when tariffs were temporarily paused, to prepare for the spring planting season that’s already underway in some states.\n\nBut he said importers saw price increases due to the uncertainty, and some had to turn to Russian potash due to the high demand.\n\nHe added 60 per cent of potash used annually in the U.S. is applied in the fall, meaning farmers will soon feel the impact of tariffs in the coming months.\n\nFarming industry groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation say farmers have suffered losses on most major crops for three straight years amid high global inflation and supply chain constraints, with tariffs further adding to those woes.\n\n“This is not a great time for them to see increased input costs,” Rosenbusch said.\n\nIn February, after Trump first announced the tariffs on Canada and Mexico but before he temporarily halted them, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa — a major agricultural state — said he was pushing for potash to be exempted from the additional levies, something also pushed by fertilizer and farming groups.\n\nAsked Tuesday if he was still looking for a potash exemption, a spokesperson for the senator pointed to a comment Grassley made to reporters where he said he was taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s tariff policy.\n\n“I’m still a free and fair trader,” he said. “The president won the election based upon the fact he was going to impose tariffs, and maybe it will work (to reduce or eliminate global tariffs).\n\n“If he’s successful I’ll say ‘amen,’ and if he’s not successful I’ll say ‘I told you so.'”\n\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters Sunday that she had raised the issue of increased potash import costs with Trump and other administration officials “and will continue to.”\n\nEconomists say cutting off potash exports to the U.S. would be unnecessarily escalatory and threaten food supply in both countries.\n\n“I see significantly more risk for negative repercussions, but also in terms of public perception in the United States, as well as sort of indirectly here in Canada, that would make me hesitate thinking about using potash,” said Werner Antweiler, a professor and international trade policy research chair at the University of British Columbia.\n\n“We don’t want to create a situation where the Americans hate us. … You want to have Americans kind of rally around us and make our case.”\n\nEven curtailing oil and gas exports, which Moe and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have strongly resisted, would be a less extreme move than cutting off potash, Antweiler said.\n\nCanada imported $32 billion in agricultural products from the U.S. in 2023, and many of those items are now subject to Canadian counter-tariffs.\n\nCarol McAusland, a professor of land and food systems at the University of British Columbia, said a better tactic would be to put an export tax on potash sold to the U.S. That would further raise prices for American farmers but ensure Canada collects some of that money, she said.\n\n“What we want to do is let them know that we’re not just going to accept this,” she said.\n\nShe agreed that an export ban would be “kind of like going to the nuclear option.”\n\nShe added consumers may not see the impact of higher prices related to potash for some time, as the import cost increases work their way into the food supply chain. That will make it important for both Canadian and American stakeholders to make clear why consumers are paying more.\n\nGrowing domestic unrest may convince Trump to lift the tariffs or at least exempt agricultural products, UBC professor and global policy research chair Kristen Hopewell said.\n\n“There is no question that Trump’s trade wars will severely hurt American farmers, one of his key constituencies,” she said in an email.\n\n“American farmers are going to be squeezed on both sides. Their growing anger will put considerable pressure on Trump to remove his tariffs.”","summary":"Potash is a key ingredient in fertilizer, and roughly 85 per cent of the supply used by American farmers comes from Canada — particularly Saskatchewan.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11065293/donald-trump-tariffs-potash/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CP13220997.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:12:55","author":"Kyle Benning,Sean Boynton","authors":["Kyle Benning","Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":296750610,"title":"Arab leaders endorse counterproposal to Trump’s Gaza plan, with ceasefire uncertain","text":"Arab leaders on Tuesday endorsed Egypt’s postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain, in a counterproposal to US President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.\nIt was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan whose endorsement by Arab leaders, announced by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, amounted to a widespread rejection of Trump’s proposal. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.\nTuesday’s summit in Cairo included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. UN Secretary-General António Guterres also attended.\nAddressing the summit, el-Sissi said that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.”\nArab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n“Peace is the Arabs’ strategic option,” he told a news conference, adding that the communique rejected the transfer of Palestinians and endorsed Egypt’s reconstruction plan.\n“The Egyptian plan creates a path for a new security and political context in Gaza,” he said.\nIsrael has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.\nThe suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.\nThe new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.\nEgypt’s postwar plan\nEgypt’s $53 billion plan foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.\nThe final communique said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the United Nations for Gaza’s reconstruction, and a World Bank-overseen trust fund will be established to receive pledges to implement the early recovery and reconstruction plan.\nAccording to a 112-page draft of the plan obtained by The Associated Press, hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up for Gaza’s population while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to expand land on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.\nIn the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.\nIt also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.\nUnder the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.\nIsrael has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament. Hamas, which doesn’t accept Israel’s existence, has said it’s willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won’t give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.\nSpeaking at the summit, el-Sissi said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a “comprehensive, just and lasting settlement” to the Palestinian cause.\n“There will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,” the Egyptian leader said. “It’s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.”\nIsrael has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.\nTrump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”\nNetanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.\nRiccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said Egypt was “trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US.”\nJordan offers to treat children from Gaza\nTrump has suggested Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan.\nMeeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children, accompanied by up to two family members, left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.\nJordan said the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land.\nThe war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead.\nMost of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements.

Yes, Volodymyr Zelensky has belatedly accepted President Trump's blueprint for a peace deal.\n\nAnd yes, the citizens of Ukraine will breathe a collective sigh of relief amid hopes that US military aid is likely to be restored and the 'roadmap to peace' is back on track.\n\nBut my countrymen are still left with a president whose behaviour over the past week and beyond has shown that he simply does not have the qualities necessary to lead his nation when it is under threat from the evil and rapacious marauder Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhen Zelensky travelled to Washington last week, he went with my best wishes. Like every other patriotic Ukrainian, I hoped that he would make a success of his visit. And so I watched what unfolded during that now notorious meeting in the Oval Office with mounting horror.\n\nMost European commentators have concentrated their fire on Donald Trump and his vice-president JD Vance, with many describing their approach as an 'ambush'. But, for me, the villain of the piece was Zelensky.\n\nThe first rule of great power diplomacy is to make sure your personal demeanour doesn't get in the way of achieving your goals.\n\nWith his display of truculence and intransigence, Zelensky sabotaged a rare-earth minerals deal that promised to bring peace to his homeland and lay the foundations for post-war reconstruction.\n\nHe failed to understand that Trump is a businessman – and what Zelensky perceived to be cynical extortion was in fact clever leadership and canny negotiation. Zelensky of all people should realise how delicate and difficult it is to force a brutal dictator like Putin to talk peace.\n\nZelensky initially rejected the White House's deal largely on the basis that it did not come with any security guarantees attached.\n\nBut while the Americans were not offering F35s to police the air nor Marines to patrol the ground, they were proposing something that could be almost equally effective.\n\nBy putting US contractors in the region, Trump was effectively saying to Putin: 'Hands off Ukraine; it's my business partner now, and worth nearly your entire GDP.' The idea that the Kremlin might ever authorise attacks on American civilians working in Ukraine is absurd.\n\nNor was the deal a bad one for Kyiv economically. As US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued, the minerals plan was a 'win-win' 'We make money if the Ukrainian people make money,' he said on Sunday.\n\nNow that Zelensky has come to his senses, Ukraine can look forward to the future with renewed confidence. Without US military backing or a minerals deal, Ukraine's fate would have been left in the hands of European allies hopelessly ill-equipped to maintain its security.\n\nAs things stand, 55 per cent of Ukraine's military hardware is produced in-country, 25 per cent comes from Europe and other nations, and 20 per cent from the US.\n\nBut the US equipment is considered to be by far the the most lethal and cutting-edge.\n\nIn the absence of American weaponry such as GPS-guided missiles, Himars shoot-and-scoot multiple rocket launchers and air defence ordnance, the country would have been fatally compromised.\n\nIt would have taken at least three years to develop Europe's defence industry to the point that it might be in a position to support Ukraine without American assistance. In that time the Russians might well have captured huge swathes of territory.\n\nSo, yes, my country may have been saved at the 11th hour. But following his latest display of bad judgment, I believe Zelensky's leadership has become a liability.\n\nThe atmosphere of mutual goodwill that once cloaked Ukraine's dealings with America has now given way to one of distrust and resentment.\n\nI say this with a heavy heart – but it's time for him to go.\n\nHis latest blunder is only the most recent mistake in what has become an error-strewn presidency.\n\nIn February last year, he fired Ukraine's commander-in-chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi after a long-running clash about political interference in his military operations.\n\nZaluzhnyi built a world-class, Nato-level general staff and military, able to stop the Russian army in its tracks. Even today, the Ukrainian army, though outnumbered, outclasses the Russians in terms of skill and valour at every turn. But arguments between the military and and the government came to a head as political appointees increasingly exploited their positions to profiteer from procurement contracts – a running sore in the Trump White House.\n\nZelensky also undermined his legitimacy by cancelling the presidential election that was due to be held in the spring of last year.\n\nMany people argue that it is inappropriate to hold an election in wartime, often citing Britain's decision not to hold a General Election until the Nazis had been defeated in the Second World War.\n\nBut that was then and this is now. In the digital era, it cannot be beyond the wit of man to stage an election that could even take in the millions of Ukrainian refugees scattered around the world.\n\nThere are many issues to be addressed, of course. The national voter registry will have to be updated. Decisions will have to be taken over who will represent disenfranchised voters living in the occupied territories. Arrangements will have to be made for absentee voting.\n\nBut these are bureaucratic challenges and should not be insurmountable if the political will is there.\n\nThis is Donald Trump's position, too: After the mineral deal, he wants an immediate ceasefire lasting at least a year to allow for elections in Ukraine.\n\nI would like to see Zelensky step down to make way for a government of national unity.\n\nThis would take in representatives of all the major parties and major political figures, from ex-President Petro Poroshenko and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko to former Parliament Chair Dmytro Razumkov and ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko — but not including any pro-Russian parties for obvious reasons.\n\nIt should also include senior members of the military, as – apart from the fact they have vital knowledge of the situation on the ground – they are the one element of Ukrainian society that is beyond reproach.\n\nIndeed, if I had my way, the post of president would go to a former soldier: General Valerii Zaluzhnyi.\n\nDespite his sacking by Zelensky over political interference, he remains a national hero and, as he is now Ukraine's ambassador to London, I am fortunate enough to meet him regularly.\n\nI am not blind to Zelensky's talent and accomplishments. He showed exemplary bravery at the outset of the war when he memorably turned down the offer of an evacuation flight with the rousing slogan: 'I need ammunition, not a ride.'\n\nAnd don't get me wrong: I'm no friend of Putin. I was forced to flee Russia in 2004, when I was vice chairman of Russia's biggest oil and gas company Yukos, after he ordered the arrest of the company's chairman, my friend Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\nMikhail went on to spend 10 years behind bars, much of it served in a Soviet-era labour camp in eastern Siberia, 3,000 miles east of Moscow.\n\nPutin was so determined to imprison me, too, that in 2005 he sought to have me extradited from the UK – my new home – but failed after a judge ruled that the action was 'politically motivated'.\n\nSince then I have worked in the energy business in Britain and, after Russia made its first incursion into Ukraine in 2014, I have done my best to foster British and European support for the land of my birth.\n\nThe silver lining of Zelensky's mishandling of Trump is that it brought Europe's big beasts together for the first time since Brexit, and galvanised Europe to rearm in the face of the Russian threat. But, with Ukraine's future at a crossroads, I can only hope that he has the good sense to realise that it is time to make way for a new leader.\n\n- Alexander Temerko is a Ukrainian-born British businessman and a member of the advisory council of the Institute of Economic Affairs.","summary":"Forgive me if I do not share in the general air of jubilation.

He has played down the threat from Russia and threatened to end U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia’s invasion.\n\nIn the aftermath of Trump’s contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week at the White House, European NATO members have been scrambling to assess their defense arrangements, while insisting there is no thought of going it alone without the United States.\n\nWhitaker evaded Democratic senators’ prodding for a more detailed discussion of Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Asked if he agreed that Russia started the war by invading Ukraine, Whitaker cited Vice President JD Vance’s statement that that was the case.\n\nWhitaker, however, spoke positively of NATO. He was asked specifically about the U.S. commitment to the alliance and its bedrock Article 5, by which NATO countries pledge to treat an attack against one as an attack on them all.\n\n“It will be ironclad,” he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nU.S. administrations have long complained about European allies and Canada relying too much on the United States in NATO. Trump has taken that further, questioning the value to the U.S. of being in the bloc.\n\nNATO leaders say Trump’s criticism in his first term, and the Ukraine war, have led to a majority of NATO states meeting the alliance’s target of spending at least 2% of their gross domestic product on building up their militaries.\n\nTrump recently upped that demand to 5% of GDP. Democratic lawmakers at Tuesday’s hearing noted the U.S. spends about 3.4% of its GDP on its military. NATO countries bordering Russia spend the biggest share, including Poland, at 4%.\n\nWhitaker framed getting allies to meet Trump’s 5% goal as a primary mission for him at NATO.\n\n“I have no concern that our European allies and Canada can do more and want to do more,” Whitaker said. “I fully expect they will do what’s necessary to continue to make NATO the strongest alliance ever in the history of the planet.”","summary":"Matt Whitaker told senators at his confirmation hearing he will push NATO allies to meet Trump’s demand to increase their own defense spending.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11066230/nato-matt-whitaker-trump-russia/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024112011114-2024112011114-673e08e9cf7215d53e87c613jpeg_5886d2.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:12:13","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":296744988,"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene repeats defense of Canada tariffs already dubbed ‘bogus’ by Trudeau","text":"Marjorie Taylor Greene has, unsurprisingly, backed Donald Trump’s exorbitant tariffs on Canada, using a defense previously described “bogus” by Justin Trudeau.\n\nSpeaking hours before the president’s address to a joint session of Congress, the Georgia representative told The Independent that the Canadian PM needed to “step up” and do more to solve the alleged problem of harmful opioids entering the U.S. from the north.\n\n “What would be important is for Prime Minister Trudeau to focus on the fentanyl problem, and the cartels who are producing fentanyl in Canada.\n\n“We hope that he steps up and secures the border and protects Americans lives. There's 200 to 300 Americans that die every single day from fentanyl.

It also aims to attract tourists by building resorts and enhancing the enclave’s Mediterranean coast.\nEgypt estimates Gaza’s reconstruction costs at $53 billion. Of that, $3 billion would be allocated for rubble removal, clearing unexploded munitions, and constructing temporary housing. An additional $20 billion would fund the first two years of reconstruction, focusing on utilities and permanent housing. The remaining $30 billion would go toward developing a seaport, airport, and industrial zones.\nThe proposal also calls on the United Nations Security Council to consider deploying international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect both Palestinians and Israelis.\nIt acknowledges the difficulties that could be faced in disarming militants in the strip.\n“It is something that can be dealt with, and even ended forever, only if its causes are removed through a clear horizon and a credible political process,” it says.\nOn Tuesday, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that the group’s arms were non-negotiable.\n“The weapon of the resistance is a red line, and it is not negotiable,” he said. “We will not accept (any deal) to trade it for reconstruction or the entry of aid.”\nHamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza in recent weeks. Analysts have said that while the group has shown that it is willing to discuss demilitarization as an end goal of a peace process, it is keen not to allow it to become a prerequisite of the process.\nOsama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, said last month that the group will not disarm and may even grow after the war in Gaza.\nOn Wednesday last week, Hamas official Husam Badran said that the group was willing to step aside from governing Gaza. “Our only condition is for this to be an internal Palestinian matter – we will not allow any regional or international party to get involved,” he told Al Arabiya. “As long as there is national consensus, Hamas will not be involved in the governance.”\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu still refuses to say what he envisions for Gaza’s post-war future, except to say that he endorses Trump’s plan for “a different Gaza.” And he thinks neither the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority nor Hamas should govern Gaza.\nIt is unclear whether Trump intends to carry through on his expulsion plan. After receiving forceful pushback from Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, Trump told Fox News last month: “The way to do it is my plan. I think that’s the plan that really works. But I’m not forcing it. I’m just going to sit back and recommend it.”\nThe plan also comes as a delicate truce between Israel and Hamas hangs by a thread after Israel blocked humanitarian aid into Gaza, in response to Hamas rejecting a new Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire without any commitment to end the war or fully withdraw troops.\nHamas has accused Israel of violating the agreement, calling its decision to halt humanitarian aid “cheap blackmail” and a “war crime.”\nThe summit comes as talks to extend the Gaza ceasefire have entered “a crucial 48 to 72 hours,” an Israeli official told CNN on Tuesday. If Hamas does not accede to Israel’s conditions, “then yes it’s on the table that they can go back to war,” the official said of the military.","summary":"A plan for Gaza formulated by Egypt would exclude Hamas from governance of the enclave once the war ends, a draft of the plan obtained by CNN shows.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. Recently, there’s been a lot of controversy because five former secretaries of defense—that would be Lloyd Austin, Jim Mattis, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, and William Perry—have all written a letter to Congress criticizing President Donald Trump’s administration, and in particular, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump, for firing a number of officers, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Brown.\n\nAnd they said, “This is reckless, it hurts morale, and it will depress recruitment.” Let’s analyze that just for a second. \n\nRecruitment reached near-record levels after the election of Donald Trump. It’s on the way up. It was depressed prior to that. Why would it be depressed? If you go through the Pentagon data, it’s very hard to decipher. \n\nThey keep records on race, gender, sexual orientation, on promotion, on units, composition, but they don’t like to do it on combat fatalities or the particular demographics that are not signing up, according to their past percentages. \n\nIf you wade through that, you will learn that recruitment was off among white males who die disproportionately at double their numbers in the demographic. So, it’s an important demographic and they were not signing. Why? I think for two reasons. \n\nEighty-five hundred of them, in the majority, I think, were white males who refused to get the vaccination and most had natural immunity. That was a very poor decision to drum them out of the military. Now we’re trying to get some of them back. \n\nThe second is, when you had that testimony by Gen. Mark Milley and Lloyd Austin about suggestions to read professor, now the discredited professor Ibram X. Kendi, the DEI emphasis, the idea that we’re going to run an investigation of the rank and file to see if there were white supremacists, white rage, white privilege—that depressed recruitment. And now, that has been swept away, recruitment is coming back up. \n\nSo, I don’t quite understand their worry about recruitment. \n\nWhat I’m getting at is, this is not the politicalization of the Pentagon. It’s the depoliticalization. And it’s not new. Generals have been fired by prior presidents.\n\nGen. David McKiernan—the theater commander of Afghanistan—fired by President Barack Obama with very little explanation. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, an untoward remark, fired his replacement. And one of the signees of the letter, Jim Mattis, fired by Obama without much explanation. He was CENTCOM commander. He was doing a good job. He was fired. He signed the letter.\n\nI could go on. There were three or four other generals that were prominent that Obama fired. So, it’s not new. President Joe Biden came in and he fired all of the 18 political appointments on the defense advisory board. That just happens. I was on the nonpolitical American Battlefield Monuments Commission. As soon as Obama came in 2009, he fired all of us. \n\nSo, this idea that we’re relieving commanders or defense personnel or advisory boards—it’s not, it’s not. \n\nThe next thing is, the Pentagon has real problems. With this emphasis on DEI, they have flunked—they have neglected things. \n\nWe are short 155 mm shells. We are short certain types of cruise missiles—Javelins. Our munitions stockpiles are depleted. DEPLEATED. We have failed three outside audits in the Pentagon since they were initiated in 2017. \n\nWe allowed a Chinese balloon to traverse the continental United States with impunity. I think the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz, the South China Sea, and the Black Sea were pretty much off-limits to international shipping for a time because we had lost deterrents. We didn’t reply to over a hundred attacks on U.S. installations in Syria and Iraq. \n\nSo, there are fundamental problems in the Pentagon—budgetary, military—and they need to be addressed. \n\nThe other thing that I thought was strange about the letter is, very quickly, Lloyd Austin was AWOL for several days. He signed the letter. He could have been fired for that, lower-ranking officers were. Jim Mattis and Chuck Hagel were fired as defense secretaries. I mean, you could argue whether it was fair or not, but they were dismissed. \n\nBut more importantly, Leon Panetta signed this letter. He was one, also, of the 51 intelligence authorities that said, right on the eve of the election and on a few days before the 2020 debate, that Hunter [Biden’s] laptop, which was in the hands of the FBI and authenticated, had all the hallmarks of a Russian information, which meant disinformation, campaign.\n\nSo, in other words, Leon Panetta is now decrying the politicalization of the Pentagon when he went out before an election and tried to use his fee days as a former CIA director and defense secretary to basically lie to the American people in order to arm Joe Biden before the debate so he could deny what was factual: The laptop was authentic. That affected the 2020 election. \n\nSo, where am I coming to in conclusion? Very quickly, this will all be adjudicated. Either the new Pentagon, for the first time, will pass an audit or it won’t. Whether recruitment, which has reached almost record numbers since the election, 350 per day in the military—whether we restore recruitment or not, it will be adjudicated. Whether the defense cuts are wise or not will be adjudicated. Whether we have deterrence in the Red Sea, the Middle East, Ukraine will be adjudicated. \n\nBut before they are adjudicated, it seems to be highly irresponsible for a number of former secretaries to accuse the administration of politicalization.\n\nI have one last statement. Gen. Brown was a political Joint Chiefs chairman, general. He, on a number of occasions, pontificated about race and gender. And that was not central to his mission. He gave editorialization to the American people about DEI. And more importantly, he followed from a Joint Chief who was very political.\n\nRemember Mark Milley? He contacted his Chinese counterpart in the People’s Liberation Army to warn him that if he, Milley, diagnosed Donald Trump as erratic, he would first warn the Communist Chinese general. \n\nHe also, remember, interrupted the chain of command. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he has no role in the chain of command. Milley usurped that role and told theater commanders to report to him first, not the defensive secretary. And then, upon retirement, he called the former president and active presidential campaign a fascist. \n\nI could go on and on. But we know that we have seen numerous violations of Article 88 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, in which retired generals have called then-President and Commander in Chief Trump a fascist, Nazi-like, Mussolini-like, a congenital liar, and comparable to the architects of Auschwitz.\n\nBottom line: We don’t need any more letters from so-called experts. They’re always partisan. And they’re to no effect.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see...

January 2025 set an all-time high, with 222 CEOs stepping down from their posts. This number is 14% higher than last year at the same time - and the highest number since the tracking metric was implemented in 2003. The results are on the heels of 2024’s record number of CEO departures, with 2,221 executives leaving their posts, according to the executive recruiting firm of Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The annual data for CEO departures in 2024 marks a 16% increase from the previous year - surpassing the prior record of 1,914 exits in 2023.\n\nEconomic and Political Turbulence: A Catalyst for CEO Departures\n\nCEOs are resigning in record numbers.\n\nThe surge in CEO resignations is closely linked to the current economic and political climate. The implementation of sweeping tariffs by President Donald Trump on imports from major trading partners such as Mexico, Canada, and China has led to heightened global trade tensions. The U.S. election was a mandate for change, and new tariffs are ushering in a new world order. Uncertainty and unpredictability has made leadership difficult, as economic challenges have already begun to take effect.\n\nBut chief executives specialize in leading through change. Uncertainty is part of the job description when you sit in the top spot. Still, the unpredictability around economic trade decisions has caused ripple effects that have changed the game for many leaders. The resulting market volatility and economic uncertainty have created challenging environments, prompting many CEOs to reconsider their options.\n\nInvestor pressure has also played a pivotal role in the uptick of CEO departures. Activist investors, who acquire significant stakes in companies to influence management decisions, have become increasingly assertive. In 2024, approximately 27 CEOs from companies targeted by activist campaigns stepped down, exceeding the four-year average and highlighting the growing effectiveness of these investors in driving leadership changes. Barclay’s reports that 243 activist campaigns were launched worldwide in 2024, the highest since 2018.\n\nSector-Specific Trends: CEO Resignations in Technology and Beyond\n\nWhile the increase in CEO resignations spans various industries, the technology sector has experienced a notably higher turnover rate. In 2024, 40 tech CEOs left their positions, a 50% increase compared to the six-year average, underscoring the sector’s heightened vulnerability to leadership changes amid rapid technological advancements and market pressures.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nGoogle Starts ‘Silently’ Tracking Your Phone—How To Stop It\n\nTrump Threatens More Tariffs Against Canada—Here’s How The New Levies Could Impact Prices\n\nThe Department Of Education May Shut Down In Two Weeks, And Student Loan Programs Could Suffer\n\nPrivate Equity is also playing a role in influencing CEOs. In the retail sector, store closures are expected to spike to 15,000 in 2025 - driven, in large part, by private equity investors that can’t find returns in the marketplace. When money doesn’t materialize, some PE firms file for bankruptcy, where the CEO role must transform - or sometimes disappear, when a company shuts their doors. Private equity firms played a role in 56% of the largest corporate bankruptcies in 2024.\n\nAdditional Factors Driving CEO Resignations\n\nBeyond economic and investor-related pressures, other factors have contributed to the rise in CEO departures:\n\nPersonal Conduct and Ethical Standards: Increased scrutiny over personal conduct has led to several high-profile resignations. For instance, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following a board investigation into personal conduct inconsistent with the company’s ethics policy. Kroger is embroiled in an ongoing lawsuit after its failed merger attempt with Albertsons, which happened on McMullen’s watch.\n\nStrategic Misalignment and Performance Issues: CEOs facing challenges in executing company strategies or underperformance have also stepped down. The inability to adapt to changing market conditions or to meet shareholder expectations can lead to leadership changes. Pat Gelsinger at Intel resigned in December 2024, after four years in the role. Intel’s stock price was down 61% at the time.\n\nMassive Payouts Despite Market Results: In late 2024, Peter Rawlinson resigned as CEO of Lucid Group, an electric car maker. His total compensation in 2022 was approximately $379 million - making him the highest-paid CEO in the auto industry for that year. Despite some impressive products, Lucid suffered a $2.7 billion loss on a cash burn of $3 billion last year. Upon tendering his resignation, Rawlinson transitioned to an advisory role (payment of $1.44 million per year) plus a $2 million stock grant.\n\nImplications for Corporate Governance\n\nThe record-high CEO turnover has significant implications for corporate governance and succession planning. Companies are increasingly appointing interim CEOs, with 19% of new chief executives in January 2025 being interim appointments, compared to 6% in January 2024. This trend reflects the challenges organizations face in finding suitable long-term leadership amid uncertain economic conditions. But also, it’s a reminder that anyone can be replaced.\n\nThe heightened turnover and increase in interim CEOs are emphasizing the need for robust succession planning. The development of internal leadership pipelines to ensure organizational stability is crucial, amidst the current economic uncertainty. The CEO role is the ultimate leadership responsibility, as leaders must balance between the needs of multiple stakeholders. However, with the amount of change in the market today, the demands of the CEO role are shifting rapidly - and many in the top spot are choosing to move on.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Since then, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe has always been a senior US general.\n\nBut it is now understood Mr Trump, 78, is ready to take Mr Musk's advice, a disconcerting move which would be unprecedented. The US has recently insisted European allies take more responsibility for Europe's security.\n\nThe US leader has already ordered the temporary pause of US military aid for Ukraine after his Oval Office blowup with Volodymyr Zelensky. US Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, has accused Mr Zelensky of having a \"certain sense of entitlement\".\n\nMr Trump's historic spat with the Ukrainian leader stunned Western allies but he has since warned he will \"not put up with\" Mr Zelensky, 47, for much longer. It is believed the debacle has led to Keir Starmer hatching a plan to return to Washington DC - but with Mr Zelensky - to present a \"united front\" on the peace plan.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports Mr Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, President of France, have spoken to Mr Zelensky about a trip to the US as soon as next week. Following the showdown there on Friday, Mr Zelensky told Ukrainian media he \"really values\" America's support and is \"ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts\".\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, is about to deliver a major speech to Congress. It is unclear what exactly the world leader will address but sources told the Mail it may concern plans for American firms to exploit Ukrainian reserves of rare minerals \"at any time\".\n\nMr Trump's decision to suspend aid for Ukraine is a major blow to Mr Starmer's four-step plan for Ukraine, which begins with: \"Keeping military aid flowing into Ukraine while the war is ongoing.\" President Macron, meanwhile, had initially suggested a one-month pause in the fighting in the air and at sea, but the proposal is now expected to be open ended.","summary":"Donald Trump's latest action come as a defiant Keir Starmer reportedly plans to return to Washington DC - with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky - to present a &quot;united front&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-verge-alarming-nato-34796996","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34797027.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_President-Trump-Makes-An-Investment-Announcement-In-The-Roosevelt-Room-Of-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 00:04:35","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.018}]}
