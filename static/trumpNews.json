The decline came amid thin liquidity and limited buying interest, deepening a drawdown that has erased more than 30% from the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin fell as much as 7.1% to $78,159.41 at midday during New York trading hours Saturday, while other tokens posted steeper losses. Ether, the second-largest digital asset, shed more than 10%, while Solana fell over 11%.The selloff knocked about $111 billion off the crypto market’s total value in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. About $1.6 billion in short and long positions were liquidated in the same timeframe, according to market tracker Coinglass — much of which occurred in the last four hours, mainly around Bitcoin and Ethereum. The retreat — recalling levels hit in the aftermath of the “Liberation Day” fallout - a adds to weeks of macro disappointment for Bitcoin, which has failed to respond to a series of market developments that previously would have supported the asset. The dollar weakened for much of January as investors grow increasingly wary of policy risks posed by the Trump administration, but the move did little to lift sentiment in crypto markets. Likewise, Bitcoin offered no meaningful response during gold’s rally to record highs — nor has it attracted inflows in the wake of gold and silver’s sharp reversal on Friday. Delay in new US market-structure regulations for the crypto sector has also undermined appetite for digital assets. “Silver and gold have become the vehicle for investors concerned about fiat currencies,” said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates. That absence of bid has raised fresh questions over Bitcoin’s role in broader portfolios. Once pitched as both a momentum play and a hedge against monetary debasement, the token is now struggling to serve either function. Spot ETF outflows have persisted, geopolitical risks have not triggered demand, and traditional safe-haven flows remain concentrated in metals and cash.Bitcoin’s price may also be impacted by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran’s army chief renewed warnings that Tehran could strike Israel, just as Donald Trump threatens potential US military strikes against the Islamic Republic. “The levels right now are reading in pretty extreme disinterest” from retail investors, said Needham analyst John Todaro, adding trading volumes may remain depressed for “another quarter or two.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/bitcoin-plunges-below-80-000-as-the-crypto-slide-deepens-11769884923939.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market_2_1733466021722_1733466033367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 18:42:03","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":398109588,"title":"Blast in Iran port city kills 1, wounds 14 before Strait of Hormuz naval drill watched by US","text":"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An explosion tore through an apartment building Saturday in Iran 's port city of Bandar Abbas, killing a 4-year-old girl as local media footage purportedly showed a security force member being carried out by rescuers.The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. Already, the U.S. military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait, on which Bandar Abbas sits.State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting.

A history of US global intervention","text":"Half a century after the US declared independence from Britain in 1776, its fifth president—James Monroe—articulated what became the young republic's first clear geopolitical stand. The eponymous Monroe Doctrine reflected America's growing prosperity, confidence and awakening interest in global affairs. It committed the US to opposing any further European colonial expansion in its own sphere of influence, the western hemisphere, particularly Latin America. This marked a profound shift. The US was founded by European immigrants who, content with building a new and prosperous society, wished to remain largely detached from the rivalries of the Old World. Many historians view that noble-sounding shift as the first crack in the door that eventually led to the modern era's version of imperialism. By the early 20th century, the US had overtaken Britain economically and militarily, along with developing appetite for global influence. After World War II, American geopolitical footprint became visible across the globe. Even during the Cold War's balancing act with the Soviet Union, the US intervened far beyond the western hemisphere. From overt wars in Indochina aimed at containing communism, to covert operations across Southeast Asia and the Middle East, Washington pursued its national interests with unmistakable muscle. This, of course, is how great powers have always behaved. Ancient Greece, Rome, imperial China, Britain—history is replete with examples of dominant states shaping their environment to suit their interests. What made the American era distinctive was that it coincided with the widest spread of democracy the world has ever seen. As a result, interventions by the US were often couched in the language of democratic transitions, people's movements and popular uprisings. Regime-change operations are hardly new, and have frequently been preceded by mass street protests—from Iran in the 1950s, to Ukraine in 2005, to the Arab Spring of 2011. What is striking today is the return to blunt unilateralism of such actions. Targeted regime-change operations by the US that stop short of full-scale war have rarely been as overt as the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in January, echoing—to the exact date—the removal of Panama's Manuel Noriega 36 years ago. The message is unmistakable: restraint is no longer a defining feature. None of this is uniquely American. Whether China or Russia, or regional powers like Israel and Iran, similar strategies are commonplace. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the world experienced a phase of unipolar American dominance, followed by a more complex multipolar order marked by Russia's persistence and China's rapid ascent in world affairs. Now, in President Donald Trump's second term, dramatic policy shifts, under his so called 'Donroe Doctrine', are dismantling several long-standing tenets of US foreign policy. Solid alliances are being undermined, norms rewritten, and power exercised more transactionally. Against this backdrop, whispers about 'deep state' involvement in political upheavals across South Asia—in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal—have grown louder. More troublingly, some activists have begun openly romanticising similar outcomes for India. A few opposition political leaders have even encouraged such dangerous musings, either through careless rhetoric or calculated ambiguity. The current geopolitical churn—marked by assertive American actions, Chinese strategic expansion and Russian determination—poses challenges for every nation. India has so far navigated these cross-currents better than others. It has maintained economic robustness, balanced relationships and preserved strategic autonomy. But this equilibrium cannot be taken for granted. It will require sustained alertness, political will and clarity in our national discourse to ensure that India remains resilient. In an era when the gloves are unmistakably off, complacency is a luxury no nation can afford.

army chief warned Washington against launching military strikes.\n\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed the two sides were talking, while keeping the threat of an attack in the foreground.\n\nWashington has deployed warships led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier off Iran's shores, after Trump threatened to intervene in the wake of Tehran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.\n\n\"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,\" said Ali Larijani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council.\n\nHe was speaking a day after the Kremlin said he held talks in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday a broader conflict would hurt both Iran and the United States.\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought, and in no way seeks, war and it is firmly convinced that a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region,\" he said in a call with Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, according to the Iranian presidency.\n\nLater Saturday, Trump confirmed that there was a dialogue between Washington and Tehran.\n\n\"(Iran is) talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there,\" he told Fox News.\n\n\"They are negotiating,\" he added.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry said its premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as foreign minister, held talks in Tehran with Larijani on Saturday to try to \"de-escalate tensions in the region\".\n\nFears of conflict\n\nThe arrival of the US flotilla has raised fears of a direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies -- notably Israel -- in the event of an attack.\n\nTrump has said he believes Iran will make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face US military action.\n\nTehran has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missiles and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.\n\nIranian army chief Amir Hatami has warned the United States and Israel against any attack, saying his forces were \"at full defensive and military readiness\".\n\n\"If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime,\" Hatami said, official news agency IRNA reported.\n\nIran's nuclear technology and expertise \"cannot be eliminated\", he added.\n\nWith tensions heightened, Iranian authorities rushed to deny that several incidents on Saturday were linked to any attack or sabotage.\n\nThey included an explosion in the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas that local firefighters said was caused by a gas leak.\n\nNaval exercise\n\nOn Friday, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct \"a two-day live-fire naval exercise\" in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.\n\nCENTCOM warned the IRGC against \"any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces\", drawing a sharp response from Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.\n\n\"The US military is now attempting to dictate how our Powerful Armed Forces should conduct target practice in their own turf,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday, prompting angry reactions from Tehran.\n\nThe United States carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel's 12-day war against its regional foe.\n\nNationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9 in what authorities called \"riots\" blamed on the United States and Israel.\n\n'Serve the people'\n\nThe official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117.\n\nHowever, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it has confirmed 6,713 deaths, including 137 children.\n\nOn Saturday, Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances and \"serve the people\".\n\nSome Iranians at the Kapikoy border point separating Iran and Turkey, where a little over 100 people crossed on Saturday, said they wanted to be free of the clerical leaders in Tehran.\n\n\"They were shooting us in the back.

We're very sensitive to that pressure.\n\n'Ministers have set out an ambitious agenda of what the BBC should be and we are open to all ideas that, as the consultation says, ensures the organisation \"not just survives, but thrives\" in this competitive media landscape.'\n\nCurrently, Brits must pay the licence fee if they watch live television or any programme on BBC iPlayer. \n\nHowever, it is not required to tune in to any of the BBC's radio channels, to listen to podcasts or to access its website. \n\nLast year, furious Brits spoke to the Daily Mail about why they are no longer paying their licence fees amid a series of scandals at the broadcaster. \n\nFormer Tory MP and ex-BBC staffer Matthew Offord revealed that he stopped paying his licence fee after standing down from his position.\n\nHe said: 'I stopped paying the licence fee in April, having struggled to do so for many years.\n\n'I concluded that I would pay it while I was an MP, but when it expired, I could not bring myself to do so. I also withdrew all my pension contributions from the scheme at the BBC.\n\n'The atmosphere was toxic when I was employed, but the continuing behaviour of individuals, the groupthink and the rejection of anti-Semitism in their reporting was too much for me.'\n\nAnother former BBC staffer, Robin Whelan, 53, from Surrey, also said he stopped paying the fee when he left the corporation.\n\nHe said: 'After many years of paying as a BBC staff member, I stopped. I took stock of what I actually used the BBC for. Its website, radio and a little catch-up.'\n\nThe future of the licence fee has come under scrutiny amid a sharp decline in the number of people watching traditional TV channels as viewers.\n\nIn November, it emerged that Panorama edited footage of a speech by Donald Trump to make it look like he encouraged supporters to 'fight' in the Capitol riots, culminating in the resignation of boss Sir Tim Davie.\n\nA report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee revealed that 2.9million BBC viewers evaded paying the £174.50-a-year fee, costing the broadcaster an estimated £550million in lost income. \n\nWhile £617million was lost from 3.6million households declaring they don't need a licence.\n\nThe Daily Mail has contacted the BBC for comment.","summary":"The corporation is currently looking at alternative ways to fund its operations amid a fall in the number of people paying the fee each year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15516649/Brits-forced-pay-licence-fee-use-BBC-website.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/01/01/106003403-0-image-m-85_1769910016758.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:58:19","author":"Editor,Olivia Christie","authors":["Editor","Olivia Christie"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":398155940,"title":"Stay Away from Protests in Democratic-Led Cities Unless Asked for: Trump to DHS","text":"WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to \"under no circumstances\" get involved with protests in Democratic-led cities unless they ask for federal help or federal property is threatened.The announcement follows weeks of unrest and protests sparked by a large deployment of Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minnesota, and the killings of two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, by federal agents who said they were reacting to threats.Many observers have said bystander videos contradict those claims of self-defense.

The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.\n\nThe surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and led to the killings of Alex Pretti on January 14 and Renee Good on January 7 by federal agents, who said they were reacting to threats.

The outage cut water supplies to the Ukrainian capital, officials said, while the city’s subway system was temporarily suspended because of low voltage on the network.\n\nMoldova also experienced major power outages, including in the capital Chisinau, officials said.\n\n“Due to the loss of power lines on the territory of Ukraine, the automatic protection system was triggered, which disconnected the electricity supply,” Moldova’s Energy Minister Dorin Junghietu said in a post on Facebook. “I encourage the population to stay calm until electricity is restored.”\n\nWeaponizing winter\n\nThe large-scale outage followed weeks of Russian strikes against Ukraine’s already struggling energy grid, which have triggered long stretches of severe power shortages.\n\nMoscow has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nWhile Russia has used similar tactics throughout the course of its almost four-year invasion of Ukraine, temperatures throughout this winter have fallen further than usual, bringing widespread hardship to civilians.\n\nForecasters say Ukraine will experience a brutally cold period stretching into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other Ukrainian towns amid the extreme weather.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this … extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Sunday “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nTalks are expected to take place between U.S., Russian and Ukrainian officials on Feb. 1 in Abu Dhabi. The teams previously met in late January in the first known time that officials from the Trump administration simultaneously met with negotiators from both Ukraine and Russia. However, it’s unclear how many obstacles to peace remain. Disagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, Zelenskyy said Thursday.\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev said on social media Saturday that he was in Miami, where talks between Russian and U.S. negotiators have previously taken place. Russian state news agencies later reported that he was meeting with an “American delegation” but did not provide further details.\n\nA pause in strikes\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks, and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump has framed Putin’s acceptance of the pause in strikes as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday.\n\nIn the streets of Kyiv Saturday, many Ukrainians shared Zelenskyy’s skepticism.\n\nOn the banks of the Dnipro River in the northern part of the city, several hundred people gathered to unwind and enjoy a DJ set. The river is frozen solid enough for people to run, dance and ride sleds across its surface. Some have brought their dogs, while others have set up picnics and lit grills. At the same time, their homes remain cold, often without water or electricity.\n\nSpeaking with The Associated Press, Serhii Kupov, 57, said he did not believe peace could be achieved through negotiations as Russia was “putting forward unrealistic demands.” Gathered around a small camping table, Kupov and his friends raised glasses of alcohol and said they were ready to endure the temporary lack of heating in their homes.\n\nAlbina Sokur, 35, has also been without heating for nearly three weeks. She is the mother of six-year-old Tymur and is originally from Donetsk, a city Russia occupied in 2014 at the start of its military aggression against Ukraine. She says that despite the constant instability, she still tried to live life “to the fullest.”\n\nSokur said that she hoped peace could be achieved through negotiations, but said she did not believe that she would ever be able to return home.\n\n“I think there could just be a freezing of the front line, like it was before 2022 … It would only give the other side time to build up strength. This needs to be finished once and for all,” she said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Kamila Hrabchuk in Kyiv, Ukraine, and Stephen McGrath in Leamington Spa, England, contributed.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

New START, the last nuclear treaty between Washington and Moscow after decades of agreements dating to the Cold War, is set to expire, and with it restrictions on the two top nuclear powers. The expiration comes as President Donald Trump, vowing \"America First,\" smashes through international agreements that limit the United States, although in the case of New START, the issue may more be inertia than ideology. Russian President Vladimir Putin in September suggested a one-year extension of New START. Trump, asked afterward by a reporter for a reaction while he was boarding his helicopter, said an extension \"sounds like a good idea to me\" -- but little has been heard since. Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev, who as Russia's president signed New START with counterpart Barack Obama in 2010, said in a recent interview with the Kommersant newspaper that Russia has received no \"substantive reaction\" on New START but was still giving time to Trump. A White House official said on condition of anonymity that Trump would like to see \"limits on nuclear weapons and involve China in arms control talks.\" The way to do that, the official said, Trump \"will clarify on his own timeline.\" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which supports reducing nuclear risks, said Trump's second administration, which has sidelined career diplomats and entrusted decision-making only to a handful of people, is not functioning in a normal way that would allow complex negotiations. Trump \"seems to have the right instinct on this issue but has thus far failed to follow through with a coherent strategy,\" Kimball said. Jon Wolfsthal, director of global risk at the Federation of American Scientists, said Trump and Putin could pick up the phone and agree immediately at a political level to extend New START. \"This is a piece of low-hanging fruit that the Trump administration should have seized months ago,\" he said. Wolfsthal is among experts involved in the \"Doomsday Clock\" meant to symbolize how near humanity is to destruction. It was recently moved closer to midnight in part due to New START's demise. - 'Empty formality'? - Trump called in October for the United States to resume nuclear testing for the first time in more than 30 years, although it is not clear he will carry it out. Russia in 2023 already suspended a key element of New START, allowing inspections, as relations deteriorated sharply with US President Joe Biden's administration over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Alexander Khramchikhin, a Russian military analyst, said the two powers already had indicated they will do as they like. \"It's clear that the treaty has reached its end,\" he said. \"It's just an empty formality that will disappear.\" Vassily Kashin, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies in Moscow, said Russia would watch if the United States ramps up its nuclear arsenal and, if so, would decide measures in response. \"But if the Americans don't take any drastic measures, such as installing warheads, Russia will most likely simply wait, observe and remain silent,\" he said. - China factor - New START restricted Russia and the United States to a maximum of 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each -- a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002. It also limits launchers and heavy bombers to 800 each, although the number is still easily enough to destroy Earth. During his first term, also faced with New START's expiration, Trump insisted a new treaty bring in China -- whose arsenal is fast growing, although well below the other two powers. A US negotiator even provocatively put an empty chair with a Chinese flag. Biden on taking office in 2021 quickly agreed to extend New START by five years to 2026. Despite his stance on New START, Trump has enthusiastically restarted diplomacy with Russia that Biden cut off over the war, inviting Putin to an August summit in Alaska and unsuccessfully trying to broker a deal in Ukraine. US allies France and Britain also have established nuclear arsenals on a smaller scale, while India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have known nuclear weapons but are not part of international agreements. bur-sct/msp","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/with-trump-mum-last-us-russia-nuclear-pact-set-to-end-1233355014","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/d56dd75/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x512+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fea%2F4a9196b6d2c6fe9e6ad43505b3d0%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:39:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.034},{"id":398156854,"title":"Narco violence dominates as Costa Rica votes for president","text":"Costa Rica, a beacon of stability in Central America that is battling a surge in violence related to drug trafficking, goes to the polls on Sunday in elections that are expected to bring a tough-on-crime right-winger to power. Laura Fernandez, the 39-year-old candidate of outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves's party, is the runaway favorite to become the next leader of the country flocked to by tourists for its sandy beaches, especially from the United States. Polls showed Fernandez, who takes inspiration from the iron-fisted president of nearby El Salvador, could win the 40 percent of votes needed to win outright, avoiding a runoff with any of her 19 rivals. A former minister and chief of staff under outgoing President Rodrigo Chaves, she is hoping for a sweep in legislative elections. Her popularity is tied to that of Chaves, who dodged blame for a surge in the murder rate -- on his watch the number of homicides rose 50 percent in the past six years to 17 per 100,000 inhabitants -- by blaming the judiciary. Fernandez has echoed his claim that judges too often let criminals go free. Costa Rica holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday (768x512, AR: 1.50)\"We are going to win in the first round and we'll do so with 40 seats in parliament!\" Fernandez declared at the close of her campaign, referring to the number of seats in the 57-seat Legislative Assembly needed to overhaul the judiciary. \"I like Laura because she's close to the president. There’s a lot of theft here, a lot of kids selling drugs,\" Jessenia Ordonez, a resident of the crime-blighted San Jose neighborhood of Alajuelita, told AFP. - Cocaine smuggling hub - Costa Rica, a country of 5.2 million people, has gone from being a transit point for cocaine shipments to a logistics hub infiltrated by Mexican and Colombian cartels, according to authorities. The trade has spilled over into the high-density \"precarios\" (informal settlements) of cities like San Jose, where shootouts between rival drug gangs are increasingly frequent. Fernandez has vowed to complete construction of a maximum-security prison modelled on Bukele's brutal CECOT penitentiary. She has also vowed to stiffen prison sentences and to impose a state of emergency in areas worst hit by crime. Fernandez served as both planning minister and presidential chief of staff under Chaves -- an ally of Trump. In 2025, Chaves blocked Chinese companies from operating Costa Rica's 5G network over alleged espionage risks highlighted by Washington. - Switzerland or El Salvador - A victory for Fernandez would confirm a rightward trend in Latin America, where leftist parties in Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Honduras have lost elections fought on issues like corruption and organized crime. Detractors compare the confrontational style of Fernandez and Chavez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election, to that of Bukele and US President Donald Trump. Bukele is a hero for many in Latin America, credited with restoring security to a nation traumatized by crime. He has rounded up over 90,000 people since March 2022, many of them innocent or minors, according to rights groups, as part of his war on gangs. Center-right economist Alvaro Ramos is in a distant second place (768x512, AR: 1.50)About 8,000 of those arrested were later released. \"At what point did we go from dreaming of being the Switzerland of Central America to dreaming of being El Salvador?\" left-wing presidential presidential Ariel Robles, who is running a distant second behind Fernandez, asked during the campaign. Another contender, centrist economist Alvaro Ramos, warned that \"modern dictatorships don’t always arrive with tanks.\" axm-mis/cb/sla","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/narco-violence-dominates-as-costa-rica-votes-for-president-1269871887","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/f2941dc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x512+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F33%2F6e%2Fc4dcac5a5b5c8f8bc3c3067dca99%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:37:36","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":398157038,"title":"Trump orders federal agents to stay away from protests in Democrat cities  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily","text":"United States President Donald Trump has ordered the ‍Department of Homeland ⁠Security (DHS) to avoid getting involved ​in protests in Democrat-run cities unless they ask for federal help.\n\nThe announcement on Saturday followed weeks of protests sparked by a large deployment of Border Patrol and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ​to the city of Minneapolis, and the killing of two US citizens by federal agents there.\n\nTrump, a Republican, said on his Truth Social platform that he has instructed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem that “under no circumstances are we going to participate” in Democrat-run cities with regard to protests “unless, and until, they ask us for help”.\n\nBut ICE and Border Patrol will act aggressively to protect federal buildings, he wrote.\n\n“There will be no spitting in the faces of our Officers, there will be no punching or kicking the headlights of our cars, and there will be no rock or brick throwing at our vehicles, or at our Patriot Warriors. If there is, those people will suffer an equal, or more, consequence,” he said.\n\n“We will not allow our Courthouses, Federal Buildings, or anything else under our protection, to be damaged in any way, shape, or form,” he added.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the DHS or the office of Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey.\n\nTrump launched the immigration crackdowns last year, targeting Democrat-led states and cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, saying the militarised operations were necessary to remove criminals from the US.\n\nThe crackdown in Minneapolis, the biggest city in the state of Minnesota, is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to federal officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.\n\nThe surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and led to the killings of Alex Pretti on January 14 and Renee Good on January 7 by federal agents, who said they were reacting to threats.

You go out and find them,' Miguel Angel Martin, president of the Mexican Toy Industry Association, told AFP.He noted that the Lego sets purchased in the United States and Canada are all made in Mexico and said he hoped that the USMCA review would 'be fair and benefit to all three countries.''Playing both sides' China is the elephant in the room in the USMCA negotiations.Canada has been working to diversify its trade relations after being walloped by Trump's tariffs offensive. In mid-January, it signed a preliminary trade agreement with Beijing.The agreement sparked a furious reaction from Trump, who threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on Canada if it becomes a 'drop off port' for Chinese products destined for the United States.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney downplayed Trump's broadside as part of the hurly burly of the USMCA negotiations.Juan Francisco Torres Landa, a partner at the international law firm Hogan Lovells who focuses on deal making, said Sheinbaum was under pressure to stop 'playing both sides' between the United States and China.At the same time, he said, 'given our economic dependence (on the United States and China), there is no other option' to working with both.Survival mode Some Mexican industries clearly stand to benefit from Sheinbaum's tariffs blitz, such as the textile and footwear sectors.'In recent years, we have been hit hard by... unfair competition in international trade,' Juan Carlos Cashat, president of a footwear manufacturers' association in central Guanajuato state, told AFP.“We hope this can have a positive effect in the medium or long term,' he said.Toy manufacturers, by contrast, are in 'survival' mode, according to the toy industry association's Martin.He added that while the USMCA is being renegotiated, the industry will try to absorb most of the costs of its higher inputs.But if the review, due to be completed by July 1, 'does not produce a reasonably good outcome for the industry,' he said, 'then the consumer will be the one to pay the costs.","url":"https://www.manilatimes.net/2026/02/01/business/foreign-business/how-lego-got-swept-up-in-us-mexico-trade-frictions/2269208","image":"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/02/01/920291.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:31:00","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":398154756,"title":"Iranian official says “structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing” with US amid “armada” buildup","text":"Amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran and a growing US military presence in the region, a senior Iranian official on Saturday (local time) said that preparations for negotiations with the US are moving forward, dismissing what he described as media-driven hype.Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani, in a post on X, said that despite speculation and reports of military escalation, the groundwork for talks is advancing.“Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing,” Larijani said in his post.However, the Secretary did not mention any details on the framework of the matter.His remarks come at a time when regional tensions remain elevated between the two sides, with US President Donald Trump stating that “a massive Armada is heading to Iran” on January 28, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln. In a post on Truth Social, Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran over stalled nuclear talks, saying any future strike would be “far worse”.He stated that the US naval deployment was larger than the previous fleet sent to Venezuela, describing its advance as marked by “great power, enthusiasm, and purpose”.“A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary.

That’s an aim Mr Warsh, an inflation hawk in his prior term as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, may find too aggressive, and which economic data and the views of his 18 policymaking colleagues may make impossible. \n\nRate futures remained priced for just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2026 from the current 3.50 per cent to 3.75 per cent range, and did not move appreciably after Mr Trump announced the nomination in a social media post.\n\nLikewise, Mr Warsh’s years of Fed criticism, begun after he left the board in 2011 and intensified over the past year as Mr Trump considered him to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, now meet the challenge of how to turn think-tank speeches and newspaper op-eds into reform that can get through the Fed’s Board of Governors, get sign-off from Mr Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and clear the US Congress if it involves amending the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nChange, in other words, may be easier said than done.\n\nMr Warsh “is a pragmatist who won’t want to lose market trust by making cuts that aren’t warranted. His long history of concern about inflation suggests that he won’t allow the economy to overheat,” said Ms Heather Long, chief economist for Navy Federal Credit Union. \n\n“He’s been an outspoken critic of the Fed’s balance sheet and groupthink. More clarity is needed on how far he intends to go” in pursuing other changes at the Fed.\n\nIt also may take more than just “breaking some heads” at the Fed, as Mr Warsh put it in a July interview on Fox News, speaking of the people who are about to become his colleagues.\n\nThe Fed particularly in the last 20 years has become a complex, hybrid beast that grew with an expansion of power during the financial crisis and through the pandemic. That may be just what Mr Warsh and Treasury’s Bessent, in recent writing, have in mind in their criticisms.\n\nThe Fed’s mix of monetary policy powers, considered its sole province, along with the sort of regulatory authority that is usually situated in the executive branch, and controlling legislation set by Congress, has left even Supreme Court justices puzzled about exactly where the Fed fits in the federal system. \n\nIt’s a nerdy legal issue with deep ramifications. The question came up as the court considered whether Mr Trump could fire Governor Lisa Cook, a question that becomes more tangled the more distant the Fed is seen as being from the US administration.\n\nSome parts of what Mr Warsh and others have criticized as “institutional drift” could be resolved internally. Under Mr Powell, and given the direction of the Trump administration, for example, the Fed already stopped its involvement in a global climate change consortium and scaled back its work on issues around diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe chair could shift the tone of Fed communications, discourage the array of speeches from the 12 reserve bank presidents or even other governors to more closely control the messaging, or work more closely with Mr Bessent and recast the Fed’s relationship with the Treasury.\n\nMr Warsh “appears to be predisposed to make more fundamental changes...particularly in the way the committee approaches forward guidance, relying too much on near-term forecasting and increased data-dependence,” analysts with TD Securities wrote in an analysis of Mr Warsh’s nomination.\n\nMr Warsh’s criticism of Fed modeling and forecasting in fact could provide an early test of his intentions. At his last press conference, Mr Powell issued a challenge for the next chair: “If it’s a question of using better models, bring them on. Where are they? We’ll take them.”\n\nThe Fed’s large balance sheet has been a particular focus for Mr Warsh. He opposed some of the “quantitative easing” conducted while he was at the Fed, supporting Chair Ben Bernanke in public votes but eventually resigning partly in protest.\n\nHe may find his hands tied there as well.\n\nThe balance sheet is now intimately interwoven with the Fed’s control of interest rates, and provides liquidity for banks and dollars for the world. Unless that changes, it can only shrink so far.\n\nIts size, the market “footprint” critics cite, “is about right,” outgoing Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Friday on CNBC. “When the economy grows the balance sheet needs to grow with it.” REUTERS","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/warsh-regime-change-faces-steep-hurdles-at-a-sprawling-us-central-bank","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/61804b888554757746b195ca257b650d0b76872c6c2e568724ac981c2fe6f653","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:29:15","author":"Sph Media Limited","authors":["Sph Media Limited"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.204},{"id":398156842,"title":"Morning Digest: Nirmala Sitharaman to present her ninth straight Budget; Centre denies Epstein claim about U.S. role in PM Modi’s 2017 Israel visit, and more","text":"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to present her ninth straight budget\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her ninth Budget in the Parliament today (February 1, 2026).

But they indicated that Rehmet’s trend of over-performing in what is considered a safe Republican district continued. He had 56.2% of the vote to Wambsganss’ 43.8%.\n\nPolitical leaders in Texas and Washington were watching the race closely as a possible midterm bellwether for the two major parties. \n\nDespite the northern Tarrant County district heavily favoring Republicans, Rehmet, a Fort Worth union leader, came within 3 percentage points of flipping the seat in November’s election. \n\nBefore Saturday’s runoff, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who led the GOP-dominated Senate in Austin, warned that Democrats would spend heavily in Texas if Rehmet pulls off the upset. \n\nConservative alarm even pushed President Donald Trump to call attention to a race once expected to be a GOP romp.\n\n“Leigh Wambsganss, a Republican running for the State Senate in the suburbs of Fort Worth, Texas, will be a GREAT Candidate and has my Complete and Total endorsement,” Trump said on social media.\n\nWambsganss, 58, is a Southlake resident. Along with Trump’s endorsement, she had nods from many of Texas’ leading Republicans, including Patrick, Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz. She is a vice president of Patriot Mobile, a cellphone service provider that promotes conservative ideas, such as preserving bans on abortion and fighting gun control.\n\nRehmet, 33, is an Air Force veteran, an aircraft mechanic who works on F-35s for Lockheed Martin and a labor organizer. His campaign has drawn support from the state’s top Democrats, including Senate candidate James Talarico, an Austin state representative.\n\nBoth Rehmet and Wambsganss are seeking an elected office for the first time. The Senate district, where voters heavily backed Trump in 2024, covers most of northern Tarrant County, including parts of Fort Worth, Southlake and North Richland Hills. \n\nWambsganss’ campaign has focused on reducing property taxes, and Rehmet has emphasized affordability.\n\nThe district’s former senator, Republican Kelly Hancock, resigned in June and is now acting state comptroller. \n\nThat vacancy forced a special election in November, drawing three challengers: Rehmet, Wambsganss and another Republican. Rehmet’s 47.6% showing fell short of a majority, triggering a runoff with Wambsganss.\n\nThe contest was expected to have low turnout, but freezing weather last week that shut down several early-voting locations could further dampen the final count. At the end of early voting on Tuesday, about 7.5% of eligible voters had cast ballots, according to Tarrant County’s election department.\n\nNo matter who wins, there will be a rematch in November. The winner will serve out the final year of Hancock’s four-year Senate term. Rehmet and Wambsganss are on the ballot again March 3 in their respective party’s primary.

But she was handed an order of removal by an immigration judge in 2019, which became final after the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed her appeal in 2022, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nIn April, Ramirez Veliz was served a notice stating she would be fined, and she failed to file an appeal within the necessary 30-day window, according to government lawyers.\n\nOfficials arrived at the nearly $1 million figure by assessing a $998 penalty for each day between the Board of Immigration Appeals’ dismissal and her notification in April.\n\n“Defendant has not paid any of the penalty and remains liable to the United States for the full penalty amount plus statutory additions,” officials said.\n\nSome legal experts have condemned the nearly seven-figure fine, calling it one of the largest of its kind on record.\n\n“That does sound like the largest number we have heard when we were tracking this,” Charles Moore, an attorney with Public Justice, a public interest law group, told Politico. “We know that the amounts were as low as $3,000 and as high as several hundred thousand but, no, we hadn’t heard of anything close to $1 million.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent. An attorney for Ramirez Veliz could not be reached.\n\nAs of this summer, the Trump administration had handed out about 21,500 fines, totaling more than $6 billion, to immigrants who allegedly disregard orders to leave the country, The Independent previously reported.\n\nImmigrants who don’t pay the levies have been threatened with lawsuits, debt collectors and huge tax bills.\n\nThe Republican administration implemented the new system in June under a process authorized by a 1996 immigration law. Yet for much of the past three decades, such fees have rarely been enforced, as officials have generally prioritized removal over severe financial penalties. \n\nA senior DHS official previously told The Independent that the message from Secretary Kristi Noem “is clear: if you’re in the country illegally, leave now or face the consequences.”\n\nImmigrants who choose to “self-deport” will not be required to pay the levies imposed on them, according to DHS. The administration advertises “cost-free travel, forgiveness of any failure to depart fines, and a $2,600 exit bonus to facilitate travel back to their home country or another country where they have lawful status” if immigrants choose to “self-deport” through CBP Home app.\n\nThe app was formerly the CBP One app, a Joe Biden-era product that allowed more than 1 million immigrants to begin their immigration process before reaching the country. The Trump administration revoked legal status for all immigrants who entered the country with that app.\n\nThe American Immigration Lawyers Association has criticized Homeland Security’s claim that people who “self-deport” will be allowed to return “legally,” calling it a “a deeply misleading and unethical trick.”\n\nImmigrants with a record of deportation are more likely to face lengthy waiting periods, or outright denials, when applying for future visas.\n\nSome hit with the fines say they deepen the stress and uncertainty undocumented immigrants already live with.\n\nEarly last year, a Honduran woman who has resided in the U.S. for 20 years was slapped with nearly $2 million in fines for failing to leave the country despite being handed a removal order in 2005.\n\n“I live with anxiety… I can’t sleep… I don’t feel,” the 41-year-old mother-of-three American citizens told CBS News.\n\nPolls show the public is largely divided over the mass deportation effort under President Trump, who has vowed to carry out what he called the “largest deportation operation” in American history.\n\nAbout half of voters support Trump’s handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, but 61 percent believe Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics have gone too far, according to a results of a recent survey from The New York Times. Reuters polling also found a record-low 39 percent of Americans approve of the president’s handling of immigration.","summary":"Administration’s broader strategy to pressure immigrants to leave the country includes pushing severe financial penalties","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-lawsuit-immigrant-self-deport-order-b2911580.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/31/23/16/GettyImages-2232883103.jpeg?crop=3405,2270,x55.5,y0&trim=0,56,0,55&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TWcBF76m-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:23:54","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":398156614,"title":"‘H‑2B employers paying $9‑$11’: Immigration expert says Americans are denied work even in construction","text":"An immigration policy expert has raised concerns that American workers are losing out on jobs in sectors such as construction because of the way H-2B visas are used and paid.

Jenks said she had spoken with families who feel left behind by the system. “I spent the morning talking to moms who put their kids through trade school so they could get construction jobs and they’re being denied work,” she said. She added that the wages offered to H‑2B visa workers are extremely low and can easily be considered as cheap labour: “H‑2B employers are paying $9 or $11 an hour, even $15 for construction jobs. You can’t live in America on those wages.”JENKS: I spent the morning talking to moms who put their kids through trade school so they could get construction jobs and they’re being denied work.

She argued that if cheap foreign labour were reduced, employers would have to raise wages to attract American workers. “These companies are going to have to raise their wages to recruit Americans. And that’s exactly what should happen,” she said.What is H-2BThe H-2B visa is a non‑immigrant work visa that allows US employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non‑agricultural jobs when there are not enough American workers available. It is commonly used in fields such as hospitality, landscaping, construction, seafood processing and tourism.

Epstein even seems to have secured audiences with Putin after his 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution.\n\nThe sources say it could explain why Epstein appeared to enjoy an ultra-wealthy lifestyle out of kilter with his career as a financier, although there is no documentary evidence linking Putin and his spies directly to Epstein's illicit activities. \n\nBut the sources also claim that while US security services 'monitored' Epstein's Russian connections for years, their UK equivalents were hesitant due to Epstein's connection to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe cache includes an email claiming Bill Gates asked one of Epstein's advisers to provide medicine to treat sexually transmitted diseases due to 'sex with Russian girls' - something he has dismissed as 'completely false'.\n\nIt also contains a document confirming The Mail on Sunday's October report that Epstein offered to introduce Andrew to a 'beautiful' 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010 - two years after Epstein's conviction.\n\nAmerican intelligence experts believe Epstein was inducted into the world of espionage via business deals with Robert Maxwell, the disgraced media magnate who - like Epstein - died in murky circumstances; in Maxwell's case his body was found floating in the Atlantic in 1991, having apparently fallen overboard from his yacht. \n\nEpstein was found hanged in 2019, but relatives believe he was murdered to silence him.\n\nMaxwell's daughter, Ghislaine, is serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking and other offences linked to her association with Epstein, who she is said to have met shortly after her father's death. \n\nSecurity sources say Robert Maxwell was a Russian asset from the 1970s, when he worked to extradite Soviet Jews to Israel, with the involvement of Israeli intelligence service Mossad.\n\nIn return, they say, Maxwell laundered Russian money into the West - with the help of Epstein.\n\nThey think the financier was introduced to Maxwell and the KGB by an oil tycoon also in the pay of Russian intelligence. Probes into Robert Maxwell's business dealings have uncovered links not only to the KGB and Mossad - but also MI6. \n\nUS security officials also believe Epstein had long-standing ties with Russian organised crime, who could have been blackmailing him. That could explain the ease with which Epstein appeared to be able to fly in 'girls' from Russia. \n\nA source said: 'You have Andrew, Bill Gates, Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and all the rest placed in compromising positions on an island bristling with technology. It's the world's largest honey trap operation. \n\n'The Americans have been on this for years, but our lot have seemed more queasy about it, presumably because of the Royal link.' All the high-profile figures named in the files deny any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a startling email, sent to Epstein on September 11, 2011, an unidentified associate discusses an 'appointment with Putin' during a forthcoming trip to Russia. The individual tells Epstein: 'Spoke with Igor. He said last time you were in Palm Beach, you told him you had an appointment with Putin on Sept 16 and that he could go ahead and book his ticket to Russia to arrive a few days before you.'\n\nEpstein appears to have had another meeting scheduled with Putin in 2014. In an email to Epstein, Japanese entrepreneur Joi Ito tells the paedophile that another US billionaire named Reid Hoffman, co-founder of website LinkedIn, was unable to join.\n\n'Hey Jeffrey,' Ito writes. 'I wasn't able to convince Reid to change his schedule to go meet Putin with you.' It is unclear whether this meeting took place. \n\nA subsequent email sent by Ito suggested it was cancelled after Russian-backed forces shot down a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet over Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing 298 people. \n\nWriting to Epstein three days later, Ito said: 'Bad idea now after the plane crash.' Meanwhile, in the 2010 exchange regarding the former Duke of York, Epstein told Andrew that he has a 'friend who I think you might enjoy having dinner with'. \n\nWhen pressed by Andrew for more details, Epstein replied: 'She's 26, Russian, clever, beautiful, trustworthy and yes, she has your email.' \n\nThe MoS previously revealed how this woman, a blue-eyed blonde, was 'not only abused by Epstein but trafficked by him for many years', according to her legal representative.\n\nAnd in another email sent in November 2010, Epstein asks an individual whether he needs a Russian visa, adding: 'I have a friend of Putin's, should I ask him?' \n\nOther messages revealed Epstein claimed he could give the Kremlin valuable insight into Donald Trump ahead of a summit with Putin in Helsinki.\n\nThe financier messaged Thorbjorn Jagland, then secretary general of the Council of Europe, suggesting he could pass on a message to Putin about how to handle the US President. \n\nIn a June 2018 exchange, Epstein indicated that Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, 'understood Trump after our conversations'. \n\nHe advised that Mr Jagland, the former prime minister of Norway, could 'suggest to putin, that lavrov [Sergei Lavrov, Russia's veteran foreign minister], can get insight on talking to me [sic].'\n\nEpstein told Mr Jagland that Mr Trump 'must be seen to get something'. Mr Jagland responded that he would meet Mr Lavrov's assistant on the following Monday and relay the message.\n\nEarlier that month Epstein had also messaged Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, to tell him Mr Jagland was due to meet Putin and Lavrov and was then staying overnight with him at his mansion in Paris.\n\nThe extraordinary exchanges took place before the totemic Helsinki summit between Mr Trump and Putin in July 2018, during which Trump insisted he did not think that Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election.\n\nAnother document reveals the FBI was warned that Epstein was believed to be a Mossad spy.\n\nA report by FBI bosses highlighted how a source told the agency: 'Epstein was close to the former prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak and trained as a spy under him.' In June 2013, Epstein sent an email to Mr Barak saying: 'Putin will re do his staff in the summer, bringing only very trusted people closer... more info on phone or face to face.'\n\nThe agency's unnamed source also highlighted how Epstein was linked to a former leader of Putin's youth organisation named Masha Drokova, a San Francisco-based businesswoman who was once an ardently pro-Putin teenager - and starred in a documentary that featured her kissing the autocrat.\n\nThe source concluded that Ms Drokova's company, Day One Ventures, was 'in Silicon Valley to steal technology'. It also details how the FBI spy discussed Epstein with Ms Drokova.\n\n'CHS and Drokova spoke, but Drokova did not talk at all about technology; instead, she looked at CHS and said 'You knew Epstein didn't you.' She said Epstein was a 'wonderful man' and that it was a crying shame what had being [sic] done to him.'\n\nIn 2021 a book by investigative reporter Craig Unger alleged that, before he was President, Mr Trump established links with the Putin camp via his 15-year friendship with Epstein.\n\nIn 'American Kompromat: How the KGB Cultivated Donald Trump', Unger also claimed Epstein relied on Russian pimps to supply him with many of the girls he abused. Unger believes the FSB - the KGB's successor - may have acquired blackmail material from the many videos Epstein reportedly recorded of his famous friends with the girls.","summary":"The release of more than three million new documents relating to the late sex offender gives credence to claims made by senior security officials: that Epstein was working on behalf of Moscow.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15516349/Epsteins-sex-empire-KGB-honeytrap-Paedophile-financier-Putin-Russian-girls.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/31/23/106001565-0-image-m-71_1769902028427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:22:19","author":"Daisy Graham-Brown,Dan Hodges,Editor,Glen Owen,Mark Hookham","authors":["Daisy Graham-Brown","Dan Hodges","Editor","Glen Owen","Mark Hookham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.003},{"id":398155184,"title":"Cubans scramble to survive as US vise on island tightens in push to oust government","text":"HAVANA (AP) — Cubans are hustling to become more self-sufficient as the US government tightens its economic noose over the communist-run island in a move experts say is meant to force a popular uprising and usher in a new government. \n\nA sharp increase in US sanctions was already suffocating Cubans when critical oil shipments from Venezuela were disrupted after the US attacked the South American country and arrested its leader.\n\nThe long-term repercussions of those halted shipments have yet to hit Cuba, but its people are not waiting.\n\nSome are installing solar panels while others are growing their own crops or returning to a simpler way of life, one that doesn’t rely on technology or petroleum.\n\n“It’s how you survive,” said Jose Ángel Méndez Faviel. “It’s best to depend on yourself.”\n\nMéndez recently moved from the centre of Havana to a farm in the rural community of Bacuranao because of Cuba’s severe blackouts. \n\nAt the farm, he can cook with firewood and charcoal, something unthinkable in a darkened city apartment.\n\nMéndez said he doesn’t know what to make of US President Donald Trump’s threats against Cuba, but he’s not taking any chances. He’s stocking up on gasoline, charcoal and produce, which he began planting three months ago at his farm.\n\nMéndez also is thinking of buying back his old horse that he sold in favour of motorized equipment to transport vegetables he sells at local markets.\n\n“You don’t need fuel for a horse,” he said. “We need to go back in time.”\n\nBefore the US attacked Venezuela and disrupted oil shipments to Cuba, the island already was struggling with chronic blackouts, soaring prices and a lack of basic goods.\n\nWith experts warning of a potentially catastrophic economic crisis, some wonder if Cuba is reaching its breaking point. For Trump, who signed an executive order Thursday that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, it’s all but guaranteed.\n\n“Cuba is really a nation that is very close to failing,” he recently said.\n\n Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

The drop came amid thin liquidity and limited buying interest, deepening a drawdown that has erased more than 30% from the world's largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin fell as much as 10% to $75,709.88 during New York afternoon trading hours, while other tokens posted steeper losses. Ether, the second-largest digital asset, shed as much as 17%, and Solana at one point dropped over 17%.The selloff knocked about $111 billion off the crypto market's total value in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. About $1.6 billion in short and long positions were liquidated in the same timeframe, according to market tracker Coinglass — much of which occurred in the last four hours, mainly around Bitcoin and Ethereum. The retreat — recalling levels hit in the aftermath of the “Liberation Day” fallout - adds to weeks of macro disappointment for Bitcoin, which has failed to respond to a series of market developments that previously would have supported the asset. The dollar weakened for much of January as investors grow increasingly wary of policy risks posed by the Trump administration, but the move did little to lift sentiment in crypto markets. Likewise, Bitcoin offered no meaningful response during gold's rally to record highs — nor has it attracted inflows in the wake of gold and silver's sharp reversal on Friday. Delay in new US market-structure regulations for the crypto sector has also undermined appetite for digital assets. \"Silver and gold have become the vehicle for investors concerned about fiat currencies,\" said Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates. That absence of bid has raised fresh questions over Bitcoin's role in broader portfolios. Once pitched as both a momentum play and a hedge against monetary debasement, the token is now struggling to serve either function. Spot ETF outflows have persisted, geopolitical risks have not triggered demand, and traditional safe-haven flows remain concentrated in metals and cash.Bitcoin's price may also be impacted by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Iran's army chief renewed warnings that Tehran could strike Israel, just as Donald Trump threatens potential US military strikes against the Islamic Republic. \"The levels right now are reading in pretty extreme disinterest” from retail investors,\" said Needham analyst John Todaro, adding trading volumes may remain depressed for \"another quarter or two.\"ALSO READ: Bitcoin Drops Below $86,000 As Traders Retreat From Risk Assets","url":"https://www.ndtvprofit.com/world/bitcoin-plunges-below-80-000-as-the-crypto-slide-deepens-10922375","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2026-02/6ck62cmo_bitcoin_625x300_01_February_26.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1080,height=607","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:21:07","author":"Soumil Mohit Kamat","authors":["Soumil Mohit Kamat"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":398156324,"title":"Cuba decries Trump’s ‘genocidal’ threat and girds for calamity","text":"Cuba hit back at Donald Trump’s plans to use tariffs to choke off all oil supplies to the struggling island, calling it extortionary and declaring an emergency with conditions on the ground set to become even more dire.'This new measure demonstrates the fascist, criminal, and genocidal nature of a clique that has hijacked the interests of the American people for purely personal gain,” President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Friday in a post on X.His top diplomat also decried the move as 'blackmail and coercion.” Washington is using its might against countries in the hemisphere to 'plunder their resources, cripple their sovereignty and deprive them of their independence,” Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in a statement hours after Trump’s announcement.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/01/world/politics/cuba-trump-genocidal-threat/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/01/520479.JPG?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:20:42","author":"The Japan Times","authors":["The Japan Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":398153970,"title":"Formation of negotiations structure with US is ‘progressing,’ says top Iranian official","text":"Cairo, Feb 1 (SocialNews.XYZ) A senior Iranian security official said that a structure for talks with the United States is being set up.\n\n\"The formation of a structure for negotiations is progressing,\" Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani wrote on social media platform X, without elaborating.\n\nLarijani's remarks followed his meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, which focused on economic cooperation and significant regional and international issues, Xinhua news agency reproted.\n\nThe remarks also came amid rising tensions between Iran and the United States, with the latter bolstering its military presence in the Middle East.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said a \"massive armada,\" led by the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and larger than the fleet sent to Venezuela, is heading toward Iran.

US District Judge Kate Menendez in ​Minneapolis handed down the ruling on Saturday. The lawsuit by the Minnesota Attorney General's Office sought to block or rein in a US Department ⁠of Homeland Security operation that sent thousands of immigration agents to Minneapolis-St Paul, sparking weeks of protests and leading to the killings of two US citizens by federal agents. Meanwhile, Trump ‍has ordered the Department of Homeland ​Security to \"under no circumstances\" get involved with protests in Democratic-led cities, ⁠unless they ask for federal help or federal property is threatened. Cities must protect their own state and local properties, Trump wrote in a social media post. ICE and Border Patrol personnel will ‌continue to guard ​federal buildings, Trump wrote on Truth Social. The announcement came on Saturday, ‍a day after thousands of protesters took to the streets of Minneapolis and across the country to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agencies from Minnesota, following the fatal shootings of two US ​citizens. The Trump administration had sent 3000 ‌federal officers to the Minneapolis area as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration, ​and many of those officials found themselves facing off with ‍protesters and activists. It's the most recent example of Trump's willingness to use federal personnel in cities. He has ​sent ​federal law enforcement officers or ​National Guard members to a number ​of cities largely governed by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, and Portland, Oregon. He has said the moves are necessary to enforce immigration laws and control crime. Local leaders in most of those cities have disputed that assertion. Menendez noted in her ruling the federal appeals court recently stayed a much narrower injunction curtailing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minnesota. \"If that injunction went too far, then the one at issue here - ‌halting the entire operation - certainly ​would,\" she wrote. The lawsuit accused federal agents of racially profiling citizens, unlawfully ‍detaining lawful residents for hours and stoking fear with heavy-handed tactics. The Trump administration said the operation was aimed at enforcing federal immigration laws pursuant to the Republican president's policies. Some administration officials said the surge would end if Minnesota acquiesced to certain demands, including ending legal ​protections for people living in the US without legal authorisation. Tensions in Minneapolis-St. Paul ramped up after the January 7 killing of Renee Good, who was ‍shot in her car by a federal immigration agent in an incident captured in widely circulated bystander videos. The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent on January 24 further inflamed tensions. The Trump administration defended the agents, ​saying ​they had acted in self-defence. But videos of the ​events cast doubt on those narratives and fuelled calls for the ​agents to be criminally prosecuted. Federal authorities refused to co-operate with local law enforcement investigations of the killings. Meanwhile, another judge ordered the release of a five-year-old boy and his father from a Texas detention centre where they were taken after being detained in Minneapolis last month. Images of Liam Conejo Ramos, with a bunny hat and Spiderman backpack being surrounded by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers, sparked even more outcry about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota. It also led to a protest at the family detention centre and a visit by two Texas Democratic members of Congress. US District Judge Fred Biery said in his ruling \"the case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children\". A judge had previously ruled that the boy and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, could not be removed from the US, at least for now.

Located 1,700km from India’s southern tip — as far as Chennai is from Delhi — it had no tourists or jet-skis, no fighter jets or bombs. Just the azure waters of Indian Ocean, lapping the shores of more than 65 islands.Coconut farmers of African and southern Indian origin lived on Chagos’ seven atolls. After French colonial rule and as part of Mauritius, the Chagossians had sworn their allegiance to the UK. They sang in Creole but hoisted the Union Jack, pressed oil from copra, went to church, fished, played with their dogs, and watched sunsets for entertainment.Then one day, armed British ships arrived. As the bewildered farmers and their petrified children watched, their house pets were gassed to death. Chagossians were stuffed into the holds of ships and dumped on the shores of Mauritius and Seychelles.Mahatma Gandhi had shown the way. Nearly all British colonies, including Mauritius, gained independence. But Chagos — part of Mauritius — was hastily ‘cleansed’ and recolonised as British Indian Ocean Territory, part of a sordid trade-off. In classified notes, the British foreign office in London sniggered at its successful evacuation of “some few Tarzans and Man Fridays”.The UK handed over Chagos’s largest island, Diego Garcia, to the US on a 99-year lease and gleefully took possession of Pershing missiles in exchange. A diabolical deal was sealed.While 2,000-odd Chagossians fought poverty, drugs and depression in the slums of Port Louis and Port Victoria, the US turned Diego Garcia and its deep, natural harbour into a formidable military base to keep an eye on the Soviet Union.Armed with little other than Gandhi’s motto of non-violence and the generosity of some of the world’s best lawyers, Chagos refugee groups subsequently spent more than three decades in courts. Over that time, Diego Garcia, America’s largest and most important overseas military base, went from strength to strength. Even after the Cold War ended, it remained indispensable for the US — to monitor the Taliban, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Al Qaida and ISIS.Meanwhile, the Chagossians won in every court. Even when the UK Foreign Office got the Queen to overturn an unfavourable order in its Supreme Court, the Chagossians persisted. They took the case to the International Court of Justice in Den Haag and won again.In 2024, Britain finally conceded sovereignty of Chagos to Mauritius. For native Chagossians, the concession included their right to return to their islands. The agreement had a caveat: that Diego Garcia would remain a UK/US joint military base under another extended lease.Everybody was content. The US, the UK, Mauritius and the Chagossians themselves. At the time, an elated Olivier Bancoult, leader of the Chagos Refugees Group in Port Louis, had told this writer that his people were willing to work for the US base at Diego Garcia while developing the rest of their beautiful atolls to welcome tourists.Last week, close on the heels of taking President Nicolas Maduro captive in Venezuela and staking claim for Greenland, US President Donald Trump dropped an explosive bombshell. “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant’ Nato Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital US Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” he wrote on Truth Social. “There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness... The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.”What if Trump now orders his troops on Diego Garcia to occupy all of uninhabited Chagos overnight? “There are only about 850 of us nativeborn Chagossians. Our fight was to go home. We won that fight. I’ve seen President Trump’s remarks. We’re fine with the US staying on Diego Garcia. We’ll live on the other islands like Peros Banhos and Salomon. As for Diego Garcia, let the UK and US talk and sort it out,” Bancoult said.Legally, the Chagossians are on solid ground. “Transfer of sovereignty is no longer on the table, the UK committed to it in 2024,” pointed out Mauritian advocate Sivakumaren Mardemootoo, who has fought for the rights of Chagossians for decades. “As for the homecoming, Port Louis recognises Bancoult and his group as legitimate representatives of the returnees to Chagos.”Mardemootoo is unperturbed by Trump’s utterances. “President Trump is a real estate developer. He’s viewing Diego Garcia as real estate. That’s actually an act of great stability. He has a point. I’m surprised that the Americans were not more involved in the UK agreement to hand back Chagos to Mauritius. It sorted out the sovereignty issue for sure. But what about geopolitical questions, the economic zone and the use of the islands? Mauritius, and the Chagossians, could benefit a lot from having the US as a commercial partner in Chagos,” the advocate added.No one needs reminding that there’s a dragon sprawled across the Indian Ocean.More than 16% of Mauritius’s imports are from China. Port Louis has not signed on to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, but its geographical position and far-reaching free trade agreement with Beijing has long made it a significant gateway for ChinaAfrica trade. Ever since 2024, there’s been talk about the gigantic potential the Chagos archipelago (without Diego Garcia) would hold for Chinese investors in tourism, hospitality as well as — in Chinese whispers — for strategic surveillance.“China may not be an immediate trigger for President Trump, but it is certainly a background driver,” says Gen Ata Hasnain. The Indian security analyst points out that the trajectory of China’s armed forces in the Indian Ocean is unmistakable. “The Indian Ocean is no longer secondary, but primary, to the US. Trump’s utterance on Diego Garcia was preemptive.”Besides, Iran’s port of Chabahar is at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. Could Trump’s words have also been trained at Iran? “But of course,” says Indian security analyst Gen Shokin Chauhan. “China is expanding its naval reach in Pakistan’s Gwadar and in Djibouti, at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden. Bang in the centre of the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia is the cornerstone of US counterbalancing posture. Centrality allows rapid response in all directions. The US can reach West Asia, Iraq and Afghanistan but also the Straits of Hormuz as well as Malacca, both crucial shipping lanes for energy supplies between east and west.Chauhan says the US military base in the Indian Ocean has a crucial advantage as opposed to others it has across the globe, like in Cyprus. “Diego is America’s own base and now has the blessings of all parties. The US can deploy long range bombers from here, without running into a barrage of political issues as it would do elsewhere.” There are other advantages in monitoring Iran. “Iran is key to all of the Middle East, which is full of its proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas. Importantly, and unlike Venezuela, Iran has crude, light oil, the best possible kind. Stability in Iran is important,” Chauhan says.India has been cautious on “Indo-Pacific” alliances. Rapprochement with China over many contentious issues is on. South Block had welcomed the UK’s return of Chagos’s sovereignty to Mauritius in calibrated terms. On the other hand, relations with America are not at their rosiest right now. If the US digs its heels in Chagos, right in the middle of India’s ‘own’ ocean, how should New Delhi react? “China will always be India’s competitor, it will always support Pakistan, it will always mess with us,” says Chauhan. “The current state of Indo-US relations is irrelevant. US presence in the Indian Ocean will keep China occupied, so we should be happy. If I were a strategic thinker in the US, I would never give up Diego Garcia.”The writer’s 25-year-long work on Diego Garcia has appeared in Der Spiegel, NYT, TOI and in an anthology of reportage by foreign correspondents in South Asia, published by Penguin","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-special/could-trump-do-a-venezuela-in-indian-ocean/articleshow/127830706.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127830726/127830726.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:11:00","author":"Padma Rao Sundarji","authors":["Padma Rao Sundarji"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.17},{"id":398155864,"title":"US special envoy for Iraq Mark Savaya no longer in the post, sources say","text":"WASHINGTON/RIYADH - Mr Mark Savaya, named by US President Donald Trump as special envoy for Iraq in October, is no longer in that role, sources familiar with the move said.\n\nThe move comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Baghdad over Washington’s push to curb Iranian influence in Iraqi politics.\n\nMr Savaya, a Christian Iraqi-American entrepreneur, was among a handful of Arab Americans named to senior posts by Mr Trump, who campaigned heavily during the 2024 presidential election to win the Arab and Muslim vote in Detroit and around the country.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what prompted Mr Savaya’s departure or whether a replacement would be appointed. \n\nOne of the sources pointed to Mr Savaya’s “mishandling” of key situations, including his failure to prevent the nomination of former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to be the country’s next premier, a move Mr Trump openly warned Baghdad against.\n\nUS. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack, who travelled to Erbil earlier this week to meet with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is believed to be taking over the State Department’s Iraq portfolio, according to the source and a senior Iraqi official.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr Barrack declined to comment.\n\nThe State Department referred queries to the White House, which declined to comment on Mr Savaya’s status or any replacement.\n\nReached by Reuters on Jan 29, Mr Savaya denied any change in his role, saying that he was still working on administrative procedures required for him to officially assume the role. \n\nHe said he expected that process will conclude soon.\n\nMr Savaya’s X account, which was active until recently, has not been available since Jan 29.\n\nHe did not respond to follow-up messages on Jan 30 and Jan 31 asking him to clarify whether he was still in his appointed role and explain why his X account was taken down.\n\nMr Savaya, who ran a cannabis business in Detroit and has close ties to Mr Trump, was a surprising choice for envoy because he has no diplomatic experience. \n\nHe has not travelled to Iraq officially since being named to the role, two of the sources said.\n\nHe was set to visit Iraq and hold meetings with senior officials on Jan 30, but abruptly cancelled them, two Iraqi officials said.\n\nThe personnel move comes days after Mr Trump warned Iraq that if it again chose Mr Maliki as its prime minister, Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close US ally. \n\nMr Maliki, accused by the US of stoking sectarian strife and allowing the rise of the Islamic State during his time in office, had been tapped for the role by Iraq’s largest parliamentary bloc days earlier.\n\nMr Trump’s comments were the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

Mr. Lajcak wasn’t accused of wrongdoing but left his position after photos and emails revealed he had met with Epstein in the years after Epstein was released from jail.\n\nThe disclosures also have revived questions about whether long-time Epstein friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, should cooperate with U.S. authorities investigating Epstein.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday (January 31, 2026) suggested Mountbatten-Windsor should tell American investigators whatever he knows about Epstein’s activities. The former Prince has so far ignored a request from members of the U.S. House Oversight Committee for a “transcribed interview” about his “long-standing friendship” with Epstein.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department said it would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images under a law intended to reveal most of the material it collected during two decades of investigations involving the wealthy financier.\n\nThe files, posted to the department’s website, included documents involving Epstein’s friendship with Mountbatten-Windsor, and Epstein’s email correspondence with onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and other prominent contacts with people in political, business and philanthropic circles, such as billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk.\n\nOther documents offered a window into various investigations, including ones that led to sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019 and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in 2021, and an earlier inquiry that found evidence of Epstein abusing underage girls but never led to federal charges.\n\nRobert Fico, Slovakia’s Prime Minister, said on Saturday (January 31, 2026) that he had accepted the resignation of Mr. Lajcak, his national security adviser.\n\nMr. Lajcak, a former Slovak Foreign Minister, hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing, but emails showed that Epstein had invited him to dinner and other meetings in 2018.\n\nThe records also include a March 2018 email from Epstein’s office to former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler, inviting her to a get-together with Epstein, Mr. Lajcak and Bannon, the conservative activist who served as Mr. Trump’s White House strategist in 2017.\n\nMr. Lajcak said his contacts with Epstein were part of his diplomatic duties.

If there is, those people will suffer an equal, or more, consequence,” he said.\n\n“We will not allow our Courthouses, Federal Buildings, or anything else under our protection, to be damaged in any way, shape, or form,” he added.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the DHS or the office of Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey.\n\nTrump launched the immigration crackdowns last year, targeting Democrat-led states and cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, saying the militarised operations were necessary to remove criminals from the US.\n\nThe crackdown in Minneapolis, the biggest city in the state of Minnesota, is the largest federal immigration enforcement operation ever carried out, according to federal officials, with some 3,000 agents deployed. The operation began in November, with officials tying it in part to allegations of fraud involving residents of Somali origin.\n\nThe surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, prompted daily clashes between activists and immigration officers, and led to the killings of Alex Pretti on January 14 and Renee Good on January 7 by federal agents, who said they were reacting to threats. Bystander videos and witness accounts contradict those claims, however.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets of Minneapolis and other US cities on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and others also challenged the immigration enforcement surge in the state, arguing that DHS is violating constitutional protections.\n\nBut a federal judge has said she will not halt enforcement operations as the lawsuit proceeds. Department of Justice lawyers have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Manuel Rapalo, reporting from Minnesota, said Trump’s latest announcement signals a softer tone from the White House on the immigration crackdown.\n\nHe noted that it followed the Trump administration’s decision to replace the senior Border Patrol commander, Greg Bovino, who had been leading the crackdown in Minneapolis, with border tsar Tom Homan.\n\nThe top official said on Thursday that federal agents would focus on targeted operations in Minneapolis, shifting away from broad street sweeps that have drawn outrage, and that he would reduce the number of agents deployed to the city if he received “cooperation” from state and local leaders.\n\n“All of this signals more cooperation between local authorities and federal officials, which has created a little bit of a sense of optimism here in the city that tensions may be beginning to calm down,” said Rapalo.\n\n“But that doesn’t mean that the unrest is over. If anything, what we’re hearing from protesters here is that without a full withdrawal of federal troops, there won’t be an end to these protests that we’re seeing on a daily basis,” he added.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/trump-orders-federal-agents-to-stay-away-from-protests-in-democrat-cities/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-31T194836Z_1650437849_RC2ICJACI7LZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1769905601-gWxETN.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:06:17","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":398157972,"title":"Jeffrey Epstein claimed President Trump called Melania 'a hot piece of a**' shortly after their first meeting","text":"Jeffrey Epstein claimed President Trump called Melania 'a hot piece of a**' shortly after he met her for the first time.\n\nIn one of the most extraordinary emails in the new dump, Epstein sent an email on November 9, 2016 - the day after the Presidential election Mr Trump won - to an unidentified friend, expressing bemusement that Hillary Clinton lost.\n\nThe paedophile wrote: 'I simply cannot believe this victory.

The move comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Baghdad over Washington's push to curb Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. Savaya, a Christian Iraqi-American entrepreneur, was among a handful of Arab Americans named to senior posts by Trump, who campaigned heavily during the 2024 presidential election to win the Arab and Muslim vote in Detroit and around the country. It was not immediately clear what prompted Savaya's departure or whether a replacement would be appointed. One of the sources pointed to Savaya's \"mishandling\" of key situations, including his failure to prevent the nomination of former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to be the country's next premier, a move Trump openly warned Baghdad against. U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack, who traveled to Erbil earlier this week to meet with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is believed to be taking over the State Department's Iraq portfolio, according to the source and a senior Iraqi official. A spokesperson for Barrack declined to comment. The State Department referred queries to the White House, which declined to comment on Savaya's status or any replacement. Reached by Reuters on Thursday, Savaya denied any change in his role, saying that he was still working on administrative procedures required for him to officially assume the role. He said he expected that process will conclude soon. Savaya's X account, which was active until recently, has not been available since Thursday. He did not respond to follow-up messages on Friday and Saturday asking him to clarify whether he was still in his appointed role and explain why his X account was taken down. Savaya, who ran a cannabis business in Detroit and has close ties to Trump, was a surprising choice for envoy because he has no diplomatic experience. He has not traveled to Iraq officially since being named to the role, two of the sources said. He was set to visit Iraq and hold meetings with senior officials last Friday, but abruptly canceled them, two Iraqi officials said. The personnel move comes days after Trump warned Iraq that if it again chose Maliki as its prime minister, Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally. Maliki, accused by the U.S. of stoking sectarian strife and allowing the rise of the Islamic State during his time in office, had been tapped for the role by Iraq's largest parliamentary bloc days earlier. Trump's comments were the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

Other documents offered a window into various investigations, including ones that led to sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019 and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in 2021, and an earlier inquiry that found evidence of Epstein abusing underage girls but never led to federal charges. Slovakian official resigns Robert Fico, Slovakia's prime minister, said Saturday that he had accepted the resignation of Lajcak, his national security adviser.

Lajcak said his contacts with Epstein were part of his diplomatic duties. Pressure mounted for his ouster from opposition parties and a nationalist partner in Fico's governing coalition. Draft indictment detailed Epstein's abuse The FBI started investigating Epstein in July 2006 and agents expected him to be indicted in May 2007, according to the newly records released. A prosecutor wrote up a proposed indictment after multiple underage girls told police and the FBI that they had been paid to give Epstein sexualized massages. The draft indicated prosecutors were preparing to charge not just Epstein but also three people who worked for him as personal assistants. According to interview notes released Friday, an employee at Epstein's Florida estate told the FBI in 2007 that Epstein once had him buy flowers and deliver them to a student at Royal Palm Beach High School to commemorate her performance in a school play. The employee, whose name was blacked out, said some of his duties were fanning $100 bills on a table near Epstein's bed, placing a gun between the mattresses in his bedroom and cleaning up after Epstein's frequent massages with young girls, including disposing of used condoms.

One group of Epstein accusers said in a statement that the new documents made it too easy to identify those he abused but not those who might have been involved in Epstein's criminal activity. \"As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein's enablers continue to benefit from secrecy,\" it said. Meanwhile, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, pressed the department to let lawmakers review unredacted versions of the files as soon as Sunday. He said in a statement that Congress must assess whether the redactions were lawful or improperly shielded people from scrutiny. Department officials have acknowledged that many records in its files are duplicates, and it was clear from the documents that reviewers took different degrees of care or exercised different standards while blacking out names and other identifying information. There were multiple documents where a name was left exposed in one copy, but redacted in another. Epstein's ties to powerful on display The released records reinforced the Epstein was, at least before he ran into legal trouble, friendly with Trump and former President Bill Clinton. None of Epstein's victims who have gone public has accused Trump, a Republican, or Clinton, a Democrat, of wrongdoing. Both men said they had no knowledge Epstein was abusing underage girls. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in August 2019, a month after being indicted.

U.S. prosecutors never charged anyone else in connection with Epstein's abuse.

This movement aimed to galvanize nationwide protests demanding ICE’s withdrawal from cities.\n\nProtesters in Eugene assembled outside a federal building around noon, brandishing signs expressing their opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration policies.\n\nAs evening fell, federal officers began using tear gas and other crowd-control measures against the protesters.\n\nBy approximately 9 p.m., the Eugene Police Department declared the gathering a riot after some protesters breached the federal building, which houses various offices, including that of the IRS.\n\nEugene Police Chief Chris Skinner noted that the limited presence of federal agents to secure the building prompted local officers to intervene and prevent further property damage.\n\nBy around 10.15pm, tear gas pellets were deployed in the courtyard outside the building, which largely forced protesters to evacuate the area. Eugene Police did not make any arrests.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Trump called the protesters in Eugene ‘highly paid Lunatics, Agitators, and Insurrectionists,’ adding that he has instructed ICE and Border Patrol to be ‘very forceful’ in protecting federal government property.\n\n‘Last night in Eugene, Oregon, these criminals broke into a Federal Building, and did great damage, also scaring and harassing the hardworking employees. Local Police did nothing in order to stop it. We will not let that happen anymore!’ Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n‘There will be no spitting in the faces of our Officers, there will be no punching or kicking the headlights of our cars, and there will be no rock or brick throwing at our vehicles, or at our Patriot Warriors. If there is, those people will suffer an equal, or more, consequence,’ he added.\n\nAt the same time, he also instructed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to not help ‘poorly run Democrat Cities’ experiencing rowdy protests unless ‘they ask us for help’.\n\n‘Therefore, to all complaining Local Governments, Governors, and Mayors, let us know when you are ready, and we will be there – But, before we do so, you must use the word, “PLEASE,”‘ he wrote.\n\nSimilar protests unfolded in Los Angeles on Friday. Demonstrators stormed the outside of a federal prison in downtown LA and came face-to-face with police officers, who stood behind shields before unleashing pepper balls and tear gas. \n\nIn one dramatic image, a protester struck an officer’s shield with a skateboard. Another showed police firing non-lethal rounds at protesters in an effort to disperse the growing crowd. \n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department issued a warning just before 9pm, ordering all protesters near Union Station to disperse within 10 minutes.\n\nOfficers then infiltrated the scene and said they were met with bottles and rocks hurled at them, according to the LAPD’s social media account.\n\nLAPD Central Division announced a ‘tactical alert’ after federal authorities were hit with debris, bottles, and other objects.\n\nAs the night continued, the LAPD arrested ‘violent agitators’ who were allegedly ‘fighting with officers,’ one of whom was accused of ‘using a sling shot to shoot hard metal objects at officers who were standing on the line.’\n\nMayor Karen Bass later confirmed that five people were arrested during the dramatic confrontation. \n\nThe LAPD told Daily Mail on Saturday afternoon that the arrests increased to eight, six for failure to disperse, one for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and one for violating curfew.\n\nBass urged protesters in the city to remain peaceful during a press conference on Friday, adding that violence was ‘exactly what I believe this administration wants to see happen.’ \n\n‘I think the protests are extremely important, but it is equally important for these protests to be peaceful, for vandalism not to take place,’ she said.\n\nProtest movements have been ramping up all over the country after federal agents fatally shot Minneapolis residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month.\n\nThousands of people flooded the streets of Minneapolis on Friday chanting, ‘Whose streets? Our streets!’\n\nIn New York City, there were also widespread protests starting in Foley Square, where multiple federal buildings are located.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Friday night, a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chaos in Oregon: Trump Responds to Escalating Protests and Riots first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/chaos-in-oregon-trump-responds-to-escalating-protests-and-riots/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Oregon-city-protests-turn-into-violent-riots-as-Trump-vows.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 01:02:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":398152764,"title":"Saturday's Final Word","text":"He might be thrillin' baby, but my tabs (my tabs) so doggone willin' ... \n\nJust a guy doing journalism. https://t.co/juxCZrmVcN— Stephen L. Miller (@redsteeze) January 31, 2026\n\nEd: This is background for the credibility of Don Lemon rather than evidence in the charges he faces. Even opinion journalists and TV hosts have First Amendment rights, and \"reporting\" is an action rather than an identity. However, Lemon's own video shows clearly that he wasn't reporting on this church invasion but actively part of the conspiracy to commit the act. The fact that he's a clown is a separate but still satisfying matter. \n\nScott Johnson at Power Line: Two of the defendants are journalists: Don Lemon and Georgia Fort. The fog machine at the Star Tribune is working overtime to obscure the issue raised by their alleged illegal misconduct. Assuming they committed the misconduct in issue, does the First Amendment shield them from the law? In other words, do they have a First Amendment right to interfere with the civil rights of others? I think the question answers itself.\n\nYesterday the Star Tribune reported “Minnesota law professors call arrests of journalists for documenting church protest an attack on free press.” The story quotes Professor Julie Jonas of the University of St. Thomas Law School opining, for example, “What the administration is basically saying is that you can’t report on this unless we approve of what you’re reporting on. They are trying to chill journalistic endeavors, and they’re successful in many ways.”\n\nNow that is stupid. The indictment treats Lemon and Fort as citizens subject to the law like their fellow rioters — like Nekima Levy Armstrong. Hey, she used to teach at the UST law school too. Shouldn’t that shield her? ...\n\nIn days of old I devoted many thousands of words trying to explain the falsity of claims such as those promoted in the Star Tribune story in the context of the recurring violations of law committed by the New York Times. I wrote one such column for the Weekly Standard. I titled the column “Is the New York Times a law unto itself?” In the Cities Church case we would ask whether Don Lemon is a law unto himself. If so, it would give new meaning to the term Lemon law.\n\nEd: Scott links to a previous column regarding the limits of the First Amendment in regard to journalism. It's worth reading this post in its entirety. \n\nDon Lemon’s attorney Abbe Lowell is outraged by how Lemon was arrested:“They wanted it to be terrifying. They waited until he went to Los Angeles. They waited until 11:30 at night. There was a bevy of agents.\"Did Abbe sleep through the four years of the Biden FBI? pic.twitter.com/kMdFI50AaS— Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) January 31, 2026\n\nEd: I'm not going to begrudge Lowell doing his job. He is supposed to provide a robust defense of his clients in both court and in public, and he gets paid very well to do so. But let's see someone challenge Lowell on the arrest of Mark Houck for an alleged FACE Act violation that consisted of a sidewalk argument outside an abortion clinic, and not a full-scale invasion of a church during worship services. The FBI sent an armed team to raid Houck's house at dawn while his family slept. \n\nShipwreckedcrew: At the time I’m writing this the indictment filed against Don Lemon has not yet been released. I’ll save an analysis for the charges after we see exactly what they are, and the nature of the factual allegations that are included.\n\nThis article addresses the claims being made online by opponents in the media of the Trump Administration in general, and the immigration law enforcement efforts in particular, about the decision to charge Don Lemon for his involvement with the group that stormed and occupied the Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota 12 days ago.\n\nSteve Baker was a freelance journalist on January 6, 2021 — and had worked in that regard for several years. Steve was also a professional musician who toured with various jazz bands as a very highly regarded trumpet player. But with COVID closing down most live-music venues, Steve devoted more of his time to his efforts to cover stories that were overlooked by the legacy media. He sold rights to his video to numerous national media companies — in fact, some of the video he took on January 6 was licensed to the NYT and other legacy media outlets, as well as for use by HBO in the making of its documentary about that day. ...\n\nSteve ultimately entered a guilty plea without admitting most of the factual characterizations attributed to him by the DOJ. It was a bit of a “struggle session” in front of Judge Cooper. But the hearing took place on November 12, after President Trump had won the 2024 election, and we were very confident that his case would never reach the sentencing hearing. That turned out to be true, and the Trump DOJ moved to dismiss his case on January 25, 2025.\n\nI recall no outpouring of outrage from the legacy media and their friends in liberal/progressive politics over the indictment of Steve Baker.\n\nEd: As usual, it's well worth the time to read the entire essay about Steve Baker's prosecution related to the January 6 riot, when Baker acted as a journalist rather than a participant. Democrats have a real J6 problem in defending Lemon in this instance, because Lemon participated far more actively in the church invasion than Baker ever did in the J6 riot. And the FACE Act is much more specific to Lemon's actions, too. \n\nDon Lemon and Georgia Fort have been released.But the procedural history now emerging is unusual. Before the arrests, a federal magistrate judge found no probable cause to arrest them. The government appealed anyway.Here’s why that matters—and what it signals more broadly.— Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) January 31, 2026\n\nIn a functioning system, that ends it. Instead, the DOJ appealed to a higher court to override the magistrate’s ruling and force the warrants through.That procedural move—seeking arrests after a judge said the evidence didn’t support them—is the anomaly.— Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) January 31, 2026\n\nEd: What anomaly? Appeals are a normal part of the judicial process. In turning down the mandamus request, the Eighth Circuit acknowledged that prosecutors had enough evidence to establish probable cause and get an arrest warrant for Lemon, but that they needed to escalate the request to the district court first. That doesn't sound anomalous, does it? And as it turned out, the DoJ got the arrest warrant a few days later with a more substantial evidentiary showing. \n\nJonathan Turley: That inexorable pattern will soon play out as Democratic establishment leaders fuel the rage in the streets of cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. A glimpse of this reality was seen this week at Sarah Lawrence College. The college has long pandered to the far left and has virtually purged any conservatives or libertarians from its faculty ranks. Without a conservative to cancel, students set upon liberal columnist Ezra Klein, disrupting his talk, as Cristle Judd, president of Sarah Lawrence College, sat obediently in silence next to him.\n\nAfter disrupting the event, the students left to carry on their protests outside. What was notable was Klein’s surprise, who (to his credit) remained calm and tried to engage the protesters. Klein attempted to object that he was not a “denier” of alleged atrocities in Gaza. The students were not there for a dialogue but a disruption. They ignored Klein’s efforts to tamp down the rhetoric and yelling.\n\nJudd was entirely useless, remaining a mere pedestrian watching the protest. After the students left, she quipped, “Welcome to Sarah Lawrence College.” There was no pledge to suspend or expel the students: just a shrug and a joke.\n\nEd: Of course there was no pledge to punish the perps. Academia exists to groom poorly educated teens into mindless cannon fodder for street violence. This is exactly what Judd aspires to forming, and \"Welcome to Sarah Lawrence College\" is not really a \"quip\" in the humorous sense. It is an admission. \n\nRonan is arguing that it’s not a crime to go into a church and violate the congregation’s civil rights if the pastor has a job leftwingers don’t like. https://t.co/wbEu4HxM3g— RBe (@RBPundit) January 31, 2026\n\nEd: Not only is this an absurd argument, it has literally been negated for 135 years after the passage of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1970. The FACE Act has also been around for decades, and it makes clear that protests against abortions cannot extend into the clinics themselves. And pro-lifers have been prosecuted under it since its passage, even with the argument that abortionists work inside the clinics. \n\nReal Clear Politics: It’s true, as Democratic Party officials and liberal commentators would have us believe, that a critical mass of Americans are dissatisfied – many passionately so – with the harsh immigration policies emanating from Washington. In a new survey by RealClear Opinion Research, 48% of respondents said they think immigration policy is worse off than a year ago, while only 41% think it is better off. (Eleven percent think it is about the same.)\n\nIt’s hardly an endorsement of the Trump regime. That said, when asked whether they preferred the Biden administration’s immigration policies, the answer was a resounding “no.” By a margin of 43%-28% (with 29% answering “neither”), voters chose Donald Trump’s approach over Joe Biden’s. The obvious implication here is that while voters look askance at the over-zealous enforcement of immigration law that has turned Minneapolis and Chicago and a couple of other places into war zones, they were even more turned off by the previous administration’s gambit of essentially opening the southern border.\n\nThe RCP survey also found that only 27.6% of self-described independent voters believe the Republican Party is doing a “good job” handling immigration, compared to 37.2% who say the GOP is “not doing a good job.” Again, not encouraging numbers for Trump and his political party. Except that even fewer independents (19.7%) say the Democrats are doing a good job on immigration, as contrasted with 37% who say they aren’t doing a good job. So Democrats are nearly 10 percentage points underwater with the voting bloc that tends to settle all close elections. And 2026 is an election year.\n\nEd: And let's not forget that voters made it clear in 2024 that they wanted the border secured and illegal aliens ejected from the US. Donald Trump won the election, with immigration being perhaps the most important difference between the two parties. Voters do not want to \"abolish ICE,\" or return to the Biden Regency's malign neglect of the border and another tsunami of border-crossers totalling eight figures. Trump's shift to Homan came at a good time, and as RCP goes on to posit, the effort to find cooperation on this will likely strengthen the GOP's position on immigration in the weeks and months to come. \n\n🚨 BREAKING: Journalist @LizCollin reports that WALZ and KLOBUCHAR may have made an INSIDE DEAL to appoint him as SENATOR 🚨“Governor Walz you’ll notice, was careful to say he will not run for public office again. However, he could be appointed to a Senate seat.” pic.twitter.com/8Q3Ko52j2z— Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) January 30, 2026\n\nEd: A few people sent me this, but this isn't much more than ordinary politics. Rod Blagojevich got prosecuted for trying to score personal financial benefits from his \"f*****g valuable\" opportunity. I'm skeptical about this for other reasons. When (not if) Klobuchar becomes governor, she won't want to have the stench of the Minnesota fraud schemes that will be attached to Walz' administration. Also, Walz says he doesn't want to run for office, and that seat will come up for a regular election in 2028. It would make far more sense for Klobuchar to appoint someone who can run for a full term in 2028 with a two-year head start, rather than force a primary fight. \n\nI bet if you were to ask her, she'd rather have healthy, functioning breasts than $2 million. Nonetheless, a huge victory for all who will inevitably realize they were lied to in the name of \"affirmation\".Bankrupt every single one of these monsters. https://t.co/YapSoYNGbg— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) January 31, 2026\n\nEditor's note: If we thought our job in pushing back against the Academia/media/Democrat censorship complex was over with the election, think again.

It is also the second full Budget since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) returned to power for a third straight term in 2024.\n\nThe FY27 Budget comes at a time of heightened complexity for the Indian economy. While domestic demand has remained resilient and inflation has moderated from recent peaks, the global environment remains deeply uncertain.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, volatile commodity prices, uneven monetary easing by major central banks and rising trade fragmentation continue to weigh on the outlook. Adding to the challenge are punitive 50 per cent tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian goods, which have unsettled financial markets and contributed to sustained foreign investor outflows and a record low rupee.\n\nSo far, sweeping income tax and GST cuts, higher infrastructure spending and interest rate reductions by the Reserve Bank of India have helped cushion the economy against these external shocks. However, those tax cuts have also dented government revenues, narrowing the fiscal space available to support growth in the new Budget.\n\nEconomists expect this year’s Budget to focus on defence, infrastructure, capital expenditure, power and affordable housing, while carefully balancing social welfare priorities with fiscal prudence.

On the odd occasion you find yourself walking against the flow, it leaves a curious sense of unease, says Deutsche Bank chief economist for Australia Phil O'Donaghoe. \"I know it is the right way to my meeting but subconsciously, it still feels like I am going the wrong way. A human condition, I guess. Going with the flow can be comforting,\" he writes in a research note. \"Deutsche Bank's base case for the RBA's February meeting feels a bit like that Wynyard walkway right now.\" Mr O'Donaghoe is one of a handful of economists who expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to hold the cash rate steady at 3.6 per cent when its board wraps up its first meeting of 2026 on Tuesday. The crux of his heterodox argument is that most analysts have focused on a rise in core inflation in the Australian Bureau of Statistics long-running quarterly consumer price index series, the RBA's preferred measure. But doing this ignores a downward trend in the ABS's newly-minted monthly data series, which shows inflationary pressures are more temporary than permanent, although the RBA has stated it will pay less heed to the monthly measure while kinks in the data are ironed out. Also swimming against the tide are Goldman Sachs' Andrew Boak and Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP. Dr Oliver acknowledges all key measures of inflation are well above target and the jobs market remains tight. Yet inflation is expected to slow this year, housing price increases slowed in December, consumer spending is likely to dip if the RBA goes from cuts to hikes so quickly and a stronger dollar will help lower imported inflation. \"Given the cross currents and in particular the downtrend in trimmed mean inflation, the RBA should and probably will leave rates on hold and wait for more information but it's a close call and not one we have a lot of confidence in,\" he said. \"We would put the probability of a hike ... around 49 per cent versus 51 per cent for a hold.\" Money markets put the probability of a hike much higher, implying about a 70 per cent chance of a 25-basis point increase. Economists at JPMorgan, HSBC, RBC Capital Markets, Challenger, Jarden, EY, Deloitte Access Economics, Rabobank and all four big banks are tipping a hike as well. If they are right, the RBA would become the first major central bank to U-turn from rate cuts to hikes following the post-COVID inflation spike. \"The economy has improved over the past 12 months and we're now close, if not above, Australia's speed limit for economic growth,\" Commonwealth Bank head of Australian economics Belinda Allen told AAP. \"That's continuing to put upward pressure on inflation and the RBA needs to act to bring inflation back down towards target.\" While the decision dominates the week's agenda, economists will also scrutinise building approvals data on Tuesday and Australia's balance of trade, due Thursday. Federal politicians will grill RBA officials on their rate decisions on Friday, when governor Michele Bullock, deputy Andrew Hauser and three assistant governors front a committee hearing in Canberra. Wall Street investors are meanwhile trying to figure out what Donald Trump's nomination to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will mean for interest rates. Former Fed governor Kevin Warsh should favour lower rates but stop short of more aggressive monetary easing linked to other potential nominees.

The appointment has been closely watched in the context of Trump’s ongoing conflict with the Fed and its current chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nThe immediate reaction to the announcement was a significant crash in gold and silver markets. After months of record highs and stretched valuations, spot prices for gold and silver dropped 9% and 28% respectively after the announcement. The US stock market also fell, with major indexes all reporting modest losses.\n\nHowever, in the context of concerns over Trump’s interference with the Fed, the market crash can ironically be understood as an early vote of confidence in Warsh’s independence and suitability for the role.\n\nUnderstanding why requires the context of Trump’s ongoing conflict with the Federal Reserve, and the importance of central bank independence to our current global financial system.\n\nTrump’s war with the Fed\n\nThe last year has seen Trump in an unprecedented conflict with the Federal Reserve. \n\nTrump appointed current Chairman Jerome Powell back in 2017. However, the relationship quickly soured when Powell did not cut interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted. In characteristically colourful language, Trump has since called Powell a “clown” with “some real mental problems”, adding “I’d love to fire his ass”.\n\nThe war of words descended into legal threats. Trump’s Justice Department announced an investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged fraud in historical mortgage documents. Then last month, in a shocking escalation the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Powell relating to overspending in renovations of the Federal Reserve offices.\n\nBoth sets of allegations are widely viewed as baseless. However, Trump has tried to use the investigation as grounds to fire Cook. The case is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nPowell has hit back strongly at Trump, saying the legal threats were\n\na consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\n\nPowell received support from 14 international central bank chiefs, who noted “the independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability”. \n\nHistorically, presidential interference with the Fed was a major cause of the stagflation crisis in the 1970s. More recently, both Argentina and Turkey have experienced significant financial crises caused by interference with central bank independence.\n\nWho is Kevin Warsh?\n\nKevin Warsh is a former banker and Federal Reserve governor, who previously served as economic advisor to both President George W Bush and President Trump.\n\nOriginally Trump seemed likely to favour the current director of Trump’s National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, for the job. However, Hassett was widely viewed as being too influenced by Trump, intensifying fears about Fed independence.\n\nWarsh appears more independent and brings a reputation as an inflation “hawk”.\n\nWhat is an inflation hawk?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is responsible for setting US interest rates. Put simply, lower interest rates can increase economic growth and employment, but risk creating inflation. Higher interest rates can control inflation, but at the cost of higher unemployment and lower growth.\n\nGetting the balance right is the central role of the Federal Reserve. Central bank independence is essential to ensure this delicate task is guided by the best evidence and long-term needs of the economy, rather than the short-term political goals.\n\nAn inflation “hawk” refers to a central banker who prioritises fighting inflation, compared to a “dove” who prioritises growth and jobs. \n\nFrom Warsh’s previous time at the Federal Reserve, he established a strong reputation as an inflation hawk. Even in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008, Warsh was more worried about inflation than jobs.\n\nGiven Trump’s past conflict with Powell around cutting interest rates, Warsh might seem a curious choice of candidate. \n\nMore recently though, Warsh has moderated his views, echoing Trump’s criticism of the Fed and demands for lower interest rates. Whether this support will continue, or if his hawkish tendencies return leading to future conflict with Trump, remains to be seen.\n\nThe market reaction\n\nThe crash in gold and silver, and decline in stock markets, suggests investors view interest rate cuts as less likely under Warsh than alternative candidates. \n\nGold and silver prices typically rise in response to instability or fears of inflation. \n\nThe previous record highs were driven by many factors, including global instability, concerns over Fed independence, and a speculative bubble.\n\nThat Warsh’s appointment has triggered a market correction in precious metals means investors expect lower inflation, and greater financial stability. The US dollar trading higher also supports this view.\n\n Read more:\n Silver and gold hit record highs – then crashed.

Smith gives passionate defense of Don Lemon after his arrest and tells critics they 'don't support the First Amendment'","text":"Stephen A. Smith has furiously criticized the arrest of journalist Don Lemon and told anybody in favor of it that they 'don't support the First Amendment'.\n\nLemon has been released without bail after appearing in a Los Angeles court Friday on federal charges relating to his coverage of anti-ICE protests at a church in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\nThe 59 year-old, an independent journalist, is accused of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshipers.\n\nAddressing the incident on his YouTube channel, an animated Smith said: 'Whether you like it or not, Don Lemon is a member of the press. Don Lemon has been in journalism for 30 years. Don Lemon worked at CNN for 17 years.\n\n'And just because you don't have a specific organization that you're working for, that's where the word independence comes from.\n\n'It doesn't mean that your journalism credentials are stripped. Not when you've been doing it for decades like him. This is straight BS what he's going through.'\n\nHe continued: 'I'm a member of the press too and ain't no way in hell anyone in the field of journalism shouldn't be supporting Don Lemon today. And that's including anyone on the right. Anybody in journalism.\n\n'I'm not saying it was wise, I'm not saying I would have done it. I'm not saying he should have walked into a church to do interviews and stuff like that for a couple of minutes. \n\n'But it don't warrant this. You support this, you don't support the First Amendment. You don't support freedom of the press.' \n\nThe arrests brought sharp criticism from news media advocates and civil rights activists including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who said the administration of President Donald Trump is taking a 'sledgehammer' to 'the knees of the First Amendment.'\n\nA grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the January 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.\n\nIn court in Los Angeles, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Robbins argued for a $100,000 bond, telling a judge that Lemon 'knowingly joined a mob that stormed into a church.'\n\nHe was released, however, without having to post money and was granted permission to travel to France in June while the case is pending.\n\nLemon struck a confident, defiant tone while speaking to reporters after a court appearance in California, declaring: 'I will not be silenced.'\n\n'I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.'\n\nDefense attorney Marilyn Bednarski said Lemon plans to plead not guilty and fight the charges in Minnesota.\n\nLemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he has no affiliation to the organization that went into the church and he was there as a solo journalist chronicling protesters.\n\n'Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,' his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement earlier Friday.\n\nSince he left CNN, Lemon has joined the legion of journalists who have gone into business for themselves. He posts regularly on YouTube and has not hidden his disdain for Trump.\n\nYet during his online show from the church, he stressed: 'I'm not here as an activist. I'm here as a journalist.' He described the scene before him and interviewed churchgoers and demonstrators.\n\nThe indictment names nine defendants including Lemon. It says two of them posted their planned action on social media the day before and gave the others instructions in a shopping center parking lot the following morning.\n\nLemon started live-streaming and told the audience he was with a group gearing up for a 'resistance' operation against federal immigration policies, according to the document. \n\nLemon 'took steps to maintain operational secrecy by reminding co-conspirators to not disclose the target of their operation,' the indictment says, and stepped away so his microphone would not accidentally divulge the planning.\n\nDuring the briefing before the operation, prosecutors say, Lemon thanked an activist who is among the nine indicted for what she was doing and assured her he was not saying what was going on.\n\nInside the church the defendants shouted slogans and blew whistles after the pastor was about to begin the sermon and gestured in a hostile and aggressive manner, according to prosecutors, and the pastor and congregants perceived 'threats of violence.'\n\nLemon told the livestream he saw a young man who was frightened, sad and crying and it was understandable because the experience was traumatic and uncomfortable, the indictment says. The defendants then surrounded the pastor and Lemon 'peppered him with questions to promote the operation's message.","summary":"Lemon has been released without bail after appearing in a Los Angeles court Friday on federal charges relating to his coverage of anti-ICE protests at a church in Minneapolis earlier this month.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-15516655/stephen-smith-defends-don-lemon-arrest-minneapolis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/01/00/106002821-0-image-m-59_1769907387392.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 00:59:09","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":398153628,"title":"The vibe in the crypto market right now: ‘Stay alive’","text":"After a disappointing end to 2025, major cryptocurrencies have languished to start the new year. Bitcoin has shed roughly one-third of its value since hitting a record high in October, including a 4.2% drop in January. Ether has slid more than 40% from last summer’s all-time highs.\n\n The slump has continued even though stocks are still near records, with the gains broadening throughout the market and investors betting the economy will keep growing. A weakened dollar had also pushed investors toward alternative assets for safety in the so-called debasement trade.\n\n Yet prices for cryptocurrencies have slid while old-fashioned bets such as blue-chip stocks and gold have paid off. On Friday, bitcoin slipped further after President Trump announced Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair.\n\n “It’s a mess out there,\" said Gennaro Salemme, a 32-year-old car salesman in Chicago. “The vibe right now is ‘stay alive.’\"\n\n Salemme still keeps roughly 40% of his $200,000 portfolio in crypto investments including ether, XRP and bitcoin ETFs. He first bought bitcoin nine years ago when the price was $3,000, and said he’s “100%\" still bullish on it for the long term. But holding on can be excruciating when everyone else is abandoning ship.\n\n “Everyone wants to leave when things go south,\" Salemme said. “A lot of this is emotionally driven.\"\n\n After rallying in early 2025, digital assets have surrendered much of the spotlight to the artificial-intelligence race, which sucked up investors’ capital and powered a third straight year of double-digit gains in stocks. A weakening job market and escalating geopolitical tensions also forced crypto investors to rethink their riskier holdings.\n\n Some traders are hoping for relief ahead. Warsh, Trump’s Fed pick, has made supportive comments about bitcoin in the past, but some investors fear he could support tighter monetary policy and hurt riskier assets.\n\n Wall Street’s stomach for those riskier bets could be tested next week, with earnings reports due from crypto-treasury company Strategy. Big tech names like Palantir, Amazon.com and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices are also slated to report their financial results, and a jobs report from the Labor Department is due this coming Friday.\n\n Investors have yanked a net $227 million out of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds through Jan. 28, according to Morningstar Direct data. On Friday, bitcoin dropped to its lowest level since the tariff turmoil that roiled markets last April, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\n The bleak mood in cryptoland is in stark contrast to the start of last year, when investors cheered what many believed would be a new golden era for digital assets. Major Wall Street firms had already launched spot bitcoin ETFs, pushing digital tokens into the mainstream. And Donald Trump was back in the White House, promising to turn America into a “bitcoin superpower.\"\n\n Then last summer, President Trump signed into law a measure to regulate stablecoins, fueling expectations that clearer rules could help boost the crypto industry.\n\n “It was almost like it was 2021 all over again,\" said Lewis Carr, a 19-year-old college student in Texas who sold gaming consoles on Facebook Marketplace to fund his crypto investments. “Like you couldn’t lose money.\"\n\n But the celebratory mood eventually gave way to a hangover.\n\n Carr keeps about a quarter of his roughly $6,000 portfolio in crypto and still puts about $50 a week into bitcoin, ether and XRP. But the slide has tempered his optimism.\n\n “Crypto right now is a total gamble,\" he said. “I think everybody realizes that.\"\n\n Will Warden had similarly high expectations not so long ago. The commercial real-estate broker, 44, had watched crypto from the sidelines for years, then jumped in after Trump took office last January.\n\n “My expectations were that by late spring, summer of 2025, I would have had a huge return,\" he said. “But that didn’t happen.\"\n\n Warden has decided to ride out the downturn, but his father and brother have cashed out of their crypto holdings. “A lot of people are exhausted, or irritated, or angry,\" he said.\n\n Adding insult to injury, crypto’s rout has continued as a retro alternative—precious metals—has stolen the show. Gold and silver prices have soared in the past several weeks, skyrocketing past stock-market returns and notching record after record, though they slid on Friday after Trump named Warsh as his Fed pick.\n\n But in crypto, “a lot of people gave up, they lost hope,\" said Maryah Kulaylat, a 26-year-old client manager at a crypto asset-management firm.\n\n Kulaylat is holding on through the downturn, citing a lesson learned buying meme coins and gaming tokens in the earlier days of her crypto-investing career: “There’s no point in selling when you’re down 90% on something,\" she said.\n\n Write to Dalvin Brown at dalvin.brown@wsj.com and Hannah Erin Lang at hannaherin.lang@wsj.com","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/the-vibe-in-the-crypto-market-right-now-stay-alive-11769907328058.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/01/1600x900/logo/im-16352492_1769907331746_1769907346604.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 00:56:40","author":"Dalvin Brown","authors":["Dalvin Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":398153610,"title":"Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Gold rate sees biggest slide in four decades; silver price crashes 30%; Budget 2026 eyed","text":"Gold, Silver Rate Today LIVE: Gold prices slumped more than 12% to slump below $5,000 an ounce in its biggest daily decline since the early 1980s.

Lajcak wasn't accused of wrongdoing but left his position after photos and emails revealed he had met with Epstein in the years after Epstein was released from jail.The disclosures also have revived questions about whether long-time Epstein friend Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, should cooperate with US authorities investigating Epstein..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday suggested Mountbatten-Windsor should tell American investigators whatever he knows about Epstein’s activities. The former prince has so far ignored a request from members of the US House Oversight Committee for a “transcribed interview” about his “long-standing friendship” with Epstein.President Donald Trump's Justice Department said it would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images under a law intended to reveal most of the material it collected during two decades of investigations involving the wealthy financier.The files, posted to the department’s website, included documents involving Epstein's friendship with Mountbatten-Windsor, and Epstein’s email correspondence with onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and other prominent contacts with people in political, business and philanthropic circles, such as billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk.Other documents offered a window into various investigations, including ones that led to sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019 and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in 2021, and an earlier inquiry that found evidence of Epstein abusing underage girls but never led to federal charges.SLOVAKIAN OFFICIAL RESIGNS Robert Fico, Slovakia’s prime minister, said Saturday that he had accepted the resignation of Lajcak, his national security adviser.Lajcak, a former Slovak foreign minister, hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing, but emails showed that Epstein had invited him to dinner and other meetings in 2018.The records also include a March 2018 email from Epstein’s office to former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler, inviting her to a get-together with Epstein, Lajcak and Bannon, the conservative activist who served as Trump’s White House strategist in 2017.Lajcak said his contacts with Epstein were part of his diplomatic duties. Pressure mounted for his ouster from opposition parties and a nationalist partner in Fico’s governing coalition.DRAFT INDICTMENT DETAILED EPSTEIN'S ABUSE The FBI started investigating Epstein in July 2006 and agents expected him to be indicted in May 2007, according to the newly records released. A prosecutor wrote up a proposed indictment after multiple underage girls told police and the FBI that they had been paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.The draft indicated prosecutors were preparing to charge not just Epstein but also three people who worked for him as personal assistants.According to interview notes released Friday, an employee at Epstein’s Florida estate told the FBI in 2007 that Epstein once had him buy flowers and deliver them to a student at Royal Palm Beach High School to commemorate her performance in a school play.The employee, whose name was blacked out, said some of his duties were fanning $100 bills on a table near Epstein’s bed, placing a gun between the mattresses in his bedroom and cleaning up after Epstein’s frequent massages with young girls, including disposing of used condoms.Ultimately, the US attorney in Miami at the time, Alexander Acosta, signed off on a deal that let Epstein avoid federal prosecution. Epstein pleaded guilty instead to a state charge of soliciting prostitution from someone under age 18 and got an 18-month jail sentence. Acosta was Trump's first labor secretary in his earlier term.EPSTEIN OFFERS TO SET ANDREW UP ON A DATE The records have thousands of references to Trump, including emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles, commented on his policies, or gossiped about him and his family.Mountbatten-Windsor's name appears at least several hundred times, including in Epstein’s private emails. In a 2010 exchange, Epstein appeared to set him up for a date.“I have a friend who I think you might enjoy having dinner with,” Epstein wrote.Mountbatten-Windsor replied that he “would be delighted to see her.”Epstein, whose emails often contain typographical errors, wrote later in the exchange: “She 26, russian, clevere beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email.”CONCERNS OVER HOW JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HANDLED RECORDS The Justice Department is facing criticism over how it handled the latest disclosure.One group of Epstein accusers said in a statement that the new documents made it too easy to identify those he abused but not those who might have been involved in Epstein’s criminal activity.“As survivors, we should never be the ones named, scrutinized, and retraumatized while Epstein’s enablers continue to benefit from secrecy,” it said.Meanwhile, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, pressed the department to let lawmakers review unredacted versions of the files as soon as Sunday. He said in a statement that Congress must assess whether the redactions were lawful or improperly shielded people from scrutiny.Department officials have acknowledged that many records in its files are duplicates, and it was clear from the documents that reviewers took different degrees of care or exercised different standards while blacking out names and other identifying information.There were multiple documents where a name was left exposed in one copy, but redacted in another.EPSTEIN'S TIES TO POWERFUL ON DISPLAY The released records reinforced the Epstein was, at least before he ran into legal trouble, friendly with Trump and former President Bill Clinton. None of Epstein’s victims who have gone public has accused Trump, a Republican, or Clinton, a Democrat, of wrongdoing. Both men said they had no knowledge Epstein was abusing underage girls.Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in August 2019, a month after being indicted.In 2021, a federal jury in New York convicted Maxwell, a British socialite, of sex trafficking for helping recruit some of his underage victims. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.US prosecutors never charged anyone else in connection with Epstein’s abuse. One victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, sued Mountbatten-Windsor, saying she had sexual encounters with him starting at age 17. The now-former prince denied having sex with Giuffre but settled her lawsuit for an undisclosed sum.Giuffre died by suicide last year at age 41.- EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Feb 1, 2026Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/epstein-files-spark-resignation-in-slovakia-pressure-on-former-uk-prince-to-cooperate-2861047-2026-02-01","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202602/prince-andrew-305441374-16x9.png?VersionId=aiMchwdaoQuHX0k9B8evG.O1IvdE2.Ip?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 00:54:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.037},{"id":398158008,"title":"Oregon city on a knife edge after protests erupt into violent riots as Trump vows 'very forceful' consequences for 'insurrectionists'","text":"Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a small Oregon city turned violent on Friday night, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to send more manpower to protect federal property around the country.\n\nThe protest in Eugene, a city roughly 110 miles south of Portland, was part of yesterday's 'National Shutdown,' meant to be a nationwide rallying cry to demand ICE leave cities.\n\nIn Eugene, protesters gathered outside a federal building at around noon, with many of them holding signs showing their distaste for the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategies.\n\nAs day turned into night, federal officers began intermittently deploying tear gas and other irritants against the protesters.\n\nAt around 9pm, the Eugene Police Department declared the protest a riot, citing the fact that some rally attendees had breached the federal building, which contains an IRS office among other agency offices.\n\nEugene Police Chief Chris Skinner said there were not many federal agents to protect the building, necessitating his officers to come to help prevent property damage. \n\nBy around 10.15pm, tear gas pellets were deployed in the courtyard outside the building, which largely forced protesters to evacuate the area. Eugene Police did not make any arrests.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Trump called the protesters in Eugene 'highly paid Lunatics, Agitators, and Insurrectionists,' adding that he has instructed ICE and Border Patrol to be 'very forceful' in protecting federal government property.\n\n'Last night in Eugene, Oregon, these criminals broke into a Federal Building, and did great damage, also scaring and harassing the hardworking employees. Local Police did nothing in order to stop it. We will not let that happen anymore!' Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n'There will be no spitting in the faces of our Officers, there will be no punching or kicking the headlights of our cars, and there will be no rock or brick throwing at our vehicles, or at our Patriot Warriors. If there is, those people will suffer an equal, or more, consequence,' he added.\n\nAt the same time, he also instructed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to not help 'poorly run Democrat Cities' experiencing rowdy protests unless 'they ask us for help'.\n\n'Therefore, to all complaining Local Governments, Governors, and Mayors, let us know when you are ready, and we will be there - But, before we do so, you must use the word, \"PLEASE,\"' he wrote.\n\nSimilar protests unfolded in Los Angeles on Friday. Demonstrators stormed the outside of a federal prison in downtown LA and came face-to-face with police officers, who stood behind shields before unleashing pepper balls and tear gas. \n\nIn one dramatic image, a protester struck an officer's shield with a skateboard. Another showed police firing non-lethal rounds at protesters in an effort to disperse the growing crowd. \n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department issued a warning just before 9pm, ordering all protesters near Union Station to disperse within 10 minutes.\n\nOfficers then infiltrated the scene and said they were met with bottles and rocks hurled at them, according to the LAPD's social media account.\n\nLAPD Central Division announced a 'tactical alert' after federal authorities were hit with debris, bottles, and other objects.\n\nAs the night continued, the LAPD arrested 'violent agitators' who were allegedly 'fighting with officers,' one of whom was accused of 'using a sling shot to shoot hard metal objects at officers who were standing on the line.'\n\nMayor Karen Bass later confirmed that five people were arrested during the dramatic confrontation. \n\nThe LAPD told Daily Mail on Saturday afternoon that the arrests increased to eight, six for failure to disperse, one for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and one for violating curfew.\n\nBass urged protesters in the city to remain peaceful during a press conference on Friday, adding that violence was 'exactly what I believe this administration wants to see happen.' \n\n'I think the protests are extremely important, but it is equally important for these protests to be peaceful, for vandalism not to take place,' she said.\n\nProtest movements have been ramping up all over the country after federal agents fatally shot Minneapolis residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month.\n\nThousands of people flooded the streets of Minneapolis on Friday chanting, 'Whose streets? Our streets!'\n\nIn New York City, there were also widespread protests starting in Foley Square, where multiple federal buildings are located.","summary":"The small city was host to anti-ICE protests on Friday that later turned into riots after some rallygoers breached a federal building.

The move comes almost one month after a military action ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump removed the South American country’s then-leader Nicolás Maduro from office. “My team and I are ready to work,” Dogu said in a message posted by the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela's account on X. It also posted pictures of her upon her landing at Maiquetia airport. Venezuela and the United States broke off diplomatic relations in February 2019 in a decision by Maduro. They closed their embassies mutually after Trump gave public support to lawmaker Juan Guaidó who claimed to be the nation’s interim president in January that year. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, one of Venezuela’s most powerful politicians and a Maduro loyalist, said earlier in January that reopening the U.S. embassy would give the Venezuelan government a way to oversee the treatment of the deposed president, who is jailed in the U.S. Venezuela’s foreign minister Yván Gil said in a message on Telegram that Dogu’s arrival is part of a joint schedule to “deal with and resolve existing differences through diplomatic dialogue, in a foundation of mutual respect and (based on) international law.” Dogu, who was previously ambassador in Nicaragua and Honduras, arrived in Venezuela one day after the country’s interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, announced an amnesty bill to release political prisoners. That move was one of the key demands of the Venezuelan opposition.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/venezuela/new-us-charge-daffaires-arrives-venezuela-reopen-diplomatic-mission-7-rcna256889","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-02/260131-venezuela-embassy-cc-0749p-3e21b8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-01 00:52:35","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285}]}
