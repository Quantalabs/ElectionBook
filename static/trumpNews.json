Maduro and Flores were flown out of the country in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement. Later the White House has stated that it is considering a range of options to acquire Greenland and that the use of military is not off the table. The development coupled with Trump’s strong statements and unpredictable stance on international affairs has raised eyebrows.\nAs the US continues to consider military action to annex Greenland the countrys defense ministry issued a warning stating that Danish forces will instantly respond to any invasion with force. This statement follows the discussion concerning the potential for United States military intervention in establishing control of Greenland. \nAccording to the military’s rules of engagement soldiers would have to repel any foreign invasion without waiting for orders the ministry was told to the Danish publication Berlingske.\nIt claims that a Cold War-era regulation mandating that soldiers immediately engage in combat in the event of an attack is still in effect. Leaders in Europe are debating how to react to Donald Trumps persistent threats to annex Greenland. According to the 1952 rule the military must react to an attack without waiting for or seeking orders even if the relevant commanders are not aware that hostilities have officially started or that a state of war has been declared.\nThe European Allies of Denmark came together to provide support and are currently pursuing a collective response to statements made by the White House indicating that President Trump continues to contemplate the option of acquiring the territory of Greenland through military action. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stated he would confer with his German and Polish Foreign Minister counterparts regarding this matter. He added that France will be coordinating with its European partners to develop an appropriate response. While speaking to France Inter radio French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot stated “We want to take action but we want to do so together with our European partners.”\nIn contrast several European countries have opposed Trump’s plan. On January 6 a group of European leaders joint statement opposing the U.S. proposal asserting that Arctic Security should be a collective responsibility of all nations and that any activities regarding the Arctic should be undertaken within the framework of international law.\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen French President Emmanuel Macron German Chancellor Friedrich Merz Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk signed the statement. It also received support from the leaders of the Netherlands Greece Luxembourg and Slovenia.\nJohannes Koskinen Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of Finland’s Parliament has called for discussion of this situation at both the upcoming North Atlantic Council meeting (scheduled for Thursday) and at NATO. Greenland is not an independent member of NATO; it is represented through Denmarks membership in NATO as reported by The Independent. Senator Rubio stated on Wednesday that at the request of both the Foreign Ministers of Greenland and Denmark he will be meeting with Danish officials next week to discuss this issue.\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night Trump said Greenland was critical to US security due growing presence of Russia and China in the Arctic region.\nMeanwhile Trump has stated We need Greenland. … It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. He further added “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.","summary":"French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stated he would confer with his German and Polish Foreign Minister counterparts regarding this matter.","url":"https://www.india.com/news/world/shoot-first-ask-questions-later-denmark-issues-deadly-stark-warning-amid-donald-trumps-repeated-greenland-acquisition-remarks-what-is-the-1952-rule-all-about-8261133/","image":"https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/title-2026-01-09T063942.021.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-09 01:10:08","author":"Sumaila Zaman","authors":["Sumaila Zaman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.085},{"id":392008056,"title":"B.C., Washington poised to launch bilateral discussion group later in 2026","text":"B.C. and Washington legislators have reached an agreement to establish an interparliamentary group between the two governments.\n\nSigned in Vancouver Thursday (Jan. 8), the deal establishes a bilateral group meant to “promote dialogue between the two legislators, explore solutions to common challenges, address cross-border constituency matters, and engage in discussions about areas of mutual interest and accomplishment.”\n\nThe group will be co-chaired by B.C.

We don’t know why she was where she was; that will come out in the days ahead. And there is plenty of video. So Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice President JD Vance, and even President Donald Trump can spin their lies, but we will know what occurred.\n\nWhat’s disturbing is the rush to cover their asses and disparage the victim. Makes me want to throw up. This is what our nation has to face daily: an administration of liars and an agency that appears to believe they can do whatever they want and face no accountability. What’s next?\n\nDeborah Harvey, Thornton\n\nI am writing to express serious concern about recent public attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement following an incident where a woman attempted to use her vehicle to strike an ICE agent and completely disobeyed law enforcement instructions. Regardless of immigration policy views, attempting to injure or kill law enforcement is a grave act of violence and must be unequivocally condemned.\n\nWhat is troubling is the rhetoric from some Democratic officials and commentators appearing to excuse violent conduct directed at ICE personnel. This is deeply problematic. The rule of law depends on consistent moral standards: violence and attempted homicide are unacceptable regardless of the identity of the victim or the political controversy surrounding their role. Clearly the vehicle was driven toward the agent.\n\nSocial science research on political violence and moral disengagement shows sustained rhetorical delegitimization of institutions increases the likelihood of real-world harm. When elected officials frame federal agents as inherently illegitimate or malicious, it erodes public trust and lowers social inhibitions against attacking them. This dynamic has historically preceded escalations in political violence, domestically and internationally.\n\nCriticism of federal agencies is legitimate in a democratic society. However, ethical leadership requires a clear boundary between policy disagreement and the normalization — or tacit justification — of violence.\n\nI urge our society to publicly affirm attempted vehicular assault against any law-enforcement officer is indefensible, and to encourage responsible rhetoric that does not endanger public servants or the public at large.\n\nSilence or equivocation in moments like this is itself consequential. Clear moral leadership matters.\n\nKriss Perras, Colorado Springs\n\nAs a former member and chair of our city’s police Citizen Review Board, I am sharing thoughts on the Minneapolis ICE shooting videos I have watched. It did not appear to me that the ICE agents were in any physical danger unless they placed themselves in it.\n\nI did not hear any commands from the agents to the driver who was killed. There were no de-escalation tactics, instead they escalated to the lethal use of force.\n\nThere are rules for the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies that direct officers not to pursue fleeing cars unless life is in danger or similar.\n\nThe assessments from the president and his administration do not comport with the evidence I have seen.\n\nTo me, this was an unnecessary escalation of the use of force that resulted in an unnecessary death.\n\nAs to the protesters who were maced, if you impede the legal actions of law enforcement, you can be arrested, or they can use non-lethal means such as mace.\n\nThe killing leaves me wondering whether ICE agents have been trained properly and I suspect there will be civil and criminal litigation to sort out officer immunity issues.\n\nJohn W. Thomas, Fort Collins\n\nInterfering with a federal ICE agent is a serious federal felony that can result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Assuming that the Colorado resident driver had a Colorado state driver’s license, the recommended actions when stopped by law enforcement are to stay calm, keep hands visible, provide your physical license, registration, and insurance when asked, but politely decline searches and self-incriminating answers. Comply with exiting the vehicle if ordered, but do not argue; dispute violations later in court. This AI-Gemini generated advice does not recommend trying to run the officer down!\n\nThe Colorado resident, nice as they might have been, made a fatal error in judgment.\n\nNo one should be defending activists who engage in the most foolish and dangerous actions! These activists would be much wiser to write letters to the editor of local papers or to relevant federal and state legislatures and officials. Officials should not be supporting kinetic protestors at all!\n\nTake note of successful non-violent protests that worked (i.e., Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.). Once violence is initiated by the protester, much of the argument is lost.\n\nIn this case, a life was lost by not complying with law enforcement. One can contest law enforcement in court, but not adjudicate from behind the wheel of a motor vehicle. To support such actions is irreverent and, for an elected official, malicious.\n\nSteven D.

As she hits him with the car, Ross opens fire. Good’s Honda Pilot subsequently crashed nearby, leading to her being pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nAmy Swearer, a senior legal fellow at conservative nonprofit Advancing American Freedom, told the Daily Mail that under the law, the use of deadly force is justified when an officer can reasonably perceive a threat of serious bodily harm or death.\n\n‘You have an officer who is trying to conduct a lawful detention of a driver who is blocking the road, trying to impede law enforcement as they’re going down that road. That driver is not being compliant with these lawful commands, and, in fact, seems to be trying to escape that situation,’ Swearer explained.\n\n‘She puts the car in reverse, as another officer is trying to open the door, and then begins moving the car – which is a deadly weapon, a 3,000 or 4,000 pound car that can accelerate very quickly and be very deadly even at short distance – towards the officer in front of the car.’\n\nThere has been much speculation online over the direction of the wheels as Good appears to be turning down the road away from the officers.\n\nOthers have questioned why Ross was standing in front of the car.\n\nSwearer explained that both points are irrelevant to the law.\n\n‘He explicitly does not have a duty to retreat in the way that a civilian would under these circumstances,’ she told the Mail.\n\n‘It doesn’t matter whether that driver subjectively was not trying to hit the officer,’ Swearer added. ‘It matters what the officer can reasonably perceive. He can’t read her mind. He just knows that you have someone who’s ignoring lawful commands, who is moving the car toward him. That is deadly force.’\n\nShe compared it to a cop being confronted by a suspect who is reaching for a gun in his waistband while being asked to keep his hands up.\n\n‘They don’t have to wait until they’re actually being shot or actually being run over to respond,’ she said.\n\nSwearer added that the officer does not have the benefit of hindsight or six different camera angles to assess the danger; the law only considers whether he ‘perceived that he was facing a serious threat of violence for himself.’\n\nOther legal analysts state that while federal charges are unlikely, Minnesota prosecutors are not legally barred from pursuing the case.\n\nIan Millhiser, a legal correspondent for Vox, focused not on whether the shooting was morally justified but on jurisdictional questions.\n\nHe wrote that ‘there’s virtually no chance that President Donald Trump’s Justice Department will bring federal charges’ but added that local officials such as Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are furious.\n\n‘If further investigations reveal that the shooting was not legally justified, state prosecutors could potentially charge the officer responsible with a homicide crime,’ Millhiser said.\n\nHe wrote that although federal officers enjoy broad protections, the Supreme Court recently narrowed immunity for federal officers to actions deemed ‘necessary and proper’ within the scope of their duties.\n\nBut he warned that a state prosecution would face steep legal and political challenges because federal law says criminal charges against ‘any officer of the United States or agency thereof’ may be removed from the state court and heard by a federal judge.\n\n‘This statute does not prevent state prosecutors from bringing charges or from prosecuting a case,’ Millhiser explains, but it does ensure ‘this case would be decided by federal courts that are increasingly dominated by conservative Republicans.’\n\nFederal cases out of Minnesota appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, where 10 of the 11 active judges were appointed by Republicans.\n\nAny decision by the Eighth Court could subsequently be appealed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans control six of the nine seats.\n\nMinnesota civil rights attorney Paul Applebaum said it was unclear who, if anyone, would prosecute the officer.\n\n‘The possibility of the officer being prosecuted by Pam Bondi are slim to none,’ ‍Applebaum said of the attorney general.\n\nHe said if state officials tried to charge the officer, it would set up a constitutional ⁠conflict between the state and the federal government.\n\nCourts have increasingly narrowed the ability to sue federal officers for damages for civil rights violations to the point it was ‘almost an empty exercise,’ Applebaum said.\n\nThe Trump administration says Good was a ‘professional agitator’ who had been stalking federal agents.\n\nState and local officials demanded ICE leave Minnesota after Good’s death.\n\nBut DHS boss Kristi Noem has said agents are not going anywhere.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the shooting.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLegal experts suggest that the ICE agent involved in the fatal shooting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Uncovering the Truth: The Controversial ICE Incident Sparking Outrage and Political Debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/uncovering-the-truth-the-controversial-ice-incident-sparking-outrage-and-political-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dems-cry-murder-after-ICE-kills-mom-but-law.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 21:45:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.676},{"id":392006078,"title":"We stand by Iranian people who are advocating for their rights: US VP JD Vance","text":"Washington DC [US], January 9 (ANI): US Vice President JD Vance on Thursday (local time) reiterated support for the Iranian people, saying that the United States stands by anybody who is engaged in peaceful protests and trying to exert their rights for free association.While addressing presspersons at the White House, VP Vance said that the United States would stand by the citizens of Iran, and when asked if the US would take part if Israel decides to strike the nuclear sites in Iran, the US Vice President said that the United States would stand by anybody who is engaged in peaceful protests and that the \"smartest thing\" for Iran to have negotiations with the United States on its nuclear programme.

Federal officers armed with pepperball guns and teargas jostled with a large crowd of protesters beside a government facility in Fort Snelling just outside Minneapolis.\n\nThe noisy crowd chanted slogans attacking the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency as officers pushed against protesters, detaining several including one who struck an agent with a cardboard sign. The victim of Wednesday’s shooting, identified as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was hit at point-blank range as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car, which they said was blocking their way.\n\nFootage of the incident shows a masked ICE agent attempt to open the woman’s car door before another masked agent fired three times into the Honda SUV. The vehicle then hurtled out of control and smashed into stationary vehicles, as horrified onlookers hurled abuse at the federal officers. Her bloodied body is then seen slumped in the crashed vehicle.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and senior officials quickly claimed Good was trying to kill the agents, an assertion Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called “bull****”. “I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either,” Trump said in an interview with The New York Times. He earlier said that the shooting was self-defense. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chief Kristi Noem called the incident “domestic terrorism”.\n\nMinneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara told CNN that Good was not the target of immigration enforcement action and that she was only suspected of blocking traffic. Vice President JD Vance described the victim on social media as “a deranged leftist”. Protests grew after Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz called it a “patriotic duty” to demonstrate for justice. “But it needs to be done safely,” Walz said.\n\nICE federal agents have been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s immigrant deportation drive, despite the objections of some state officials. DHS launched a recruitment campaign last summer to add 10,000 additional ICE agents to the existing 6,000-strong contingent. That sparked criticism that new officers in the field were insufficiently trained.\n\nMinneapolis public schools were closed on Thursday and Friday as a precautionary measure. With classes canceled, 17-year-old Addie Flewelling attended the Minneapolis protest on Thursday to condemn the shooting and show her opposition to the immigration crackdown, including a raid at her high school earlier this week. “Students were chased off of their place of education,” she said. “This is not ok. I’m scared to go to school.”\n\nWednesday’s incident came during protest action against immigration enforcement in the southern part of Minneapolis. Witness Brandon Hewitt said he heard three shots. “I got a bunch of video of them carrying the body to the ambulance,” he told MS NOW. Another witness interviewed by local station FOX9 described a grisly scene, saying “the surviving passenger got out of the car covered in blood”. He recounted seeing a man who identified himself as a doctor attempting to reach Good but being refused access by officers.\n\nThere have been widespread protests against immigration operations of the Trump administration, which has vowed to arrest and deport what it says are “millions” of undocumented migrants. The victim’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter “was probably terrified”. Good was “not part of anything like” challenging ICE officers, Ganger added. Good was a mother and a poet who studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, US media reported.\n\nThe Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on Thursday it had initially agreed with the FBI to conduct a joint investigation into the shooting, but that the federal agency had \"reversed course\" and taken sole control over the probe. The decision, according to the BCA's superintendent, Drew Evans, means the state bureau will no longer have access to the scene evidence, case materials or interviews. \"As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" Evans said.\n\nKeith Ellison, the state's Democratic attorney general, told CNN the FBI's decision was \"deeply disturbing\" and said state authorities could investigate with or without the cooperation of the federal government. He added that the evidence he has seen, including some that has not yet been made public, indicates that state charges are a possibility.

Several officers then surround the vehicle on foot and tell her to exit. When she begins to drive away, an agent opens fire through the windshield, prompting Good’s vehicle to crash into a parked car.\n\n Amid footage of Good's killing circulating online, Trump took to TruthSocial with his response, defending the ICE agent who fired at least two shots into the vehicle by claiming it was an act of self-defense.\n\n \"The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"The reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.

Experts upset over Greenland acquisition plans","text":"Can Donald Trump send the US military to capture Canada and make it the 51st state of the country? Is Canada making preparations for the worst? Many people, including defence hawks and security experts, think it is the right time to rethink defence strategy and prepare for the worst-case scenario from a powerful neighboring state. Defence mandarins and former senior officials of the armed forces are upset with Donald Trump's reported plans to acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. They recall how the US president asked Canada to join it as its 51st state to avoid increased tariffs.\n\nUS-Canada Ties\n\nThe US and Canada have been long-time defence partners in the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). This cooperation is aimed at protecting the North American airspace and maritime. However, the North American country is modernising its air force and making investments in next-generation sensors, command and control systems, and air-defense assets. \n\nCanada is upgrading its fighter aircraft and planning to buy sixth-generation stealth fighter F-35. It is funding advanced technologies and surveillance systems like air defence and anti-drone systems. It has also increased its defence budget to 2% of the GDP as demanded by Donald Trump. On the other hand, Canada is prioritizing its northern territories for strategic significance. It has made the strategy of increasing its Arctic presence by developing infrastructure. It will also increase surveillance and develop a system for rapid response capabilities. \n\nCanada defence modernization in Arctic\n\nThe North American country has also set up the Canadian Joint Forces Command (CJFC) for better coordination in joint military operations, including integrated air and missile defence and drone warfare capabilities. It also participated in multinational exercises like Operation Reassurance in Europe and continues to work with NATO allies. Though these steps have been taken to increase its presence in the Arctic region, defence experts now do not rule out the possibility of getting ready for a war. \n\nTalking to the CBC, Adam Gordon, a visiting fellow of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University, indicated mounting evidence suggesting a real risk of the Trump administration using military coercion against Canada. He talked of \"a pattern of behaviour and statements\" from the Trump administration, including the U.S. president's calls for Canada to become the 51st state. He served as a senior adviser to Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand and her predecessor Melanie Joly. \n\nUS Canada Greenland geopolitics\n\nOther observers of U.S. foreign policy have also cautioned that Trump's actions elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere put Canada in the crosshairs of U.S. military action. They are upset over the White House's announcement of plans to acquire Greenland, keeping military action as one of the options. It said in a statement Tuesday, \"The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief's disposal.\" The options include outright purchase of the Arctic island, signing an agreement to form a Compact of Free Association with the territory. The COFA agreement would be short of making the island of 57,000 people a part of the US. The last option is to capture Greenland by force.\n\nAfter imposing a 25% tariff on Canada in 2025, Donald Trump expressed his desire to annex Canada as its 51st state. He also said that once it becomes a US state, it will not have to pay any tariffs at all. Later, he also said that it was not a joke and he was serious when he said this.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/explainer/report-can-trump-send-us-military-to-capture-canada-experts-upset-over-greenland-acquisition-plans-3196390","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2026/01/08/2737662-donald-trump-us-president-at-unga.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 20:21:00","author":"Mukesh Ambani","authors":["Mukesh Ambani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.162},{"id":392004832,"title":"House to vote on ACA subsidies extension after 9 Republicans help get it to the floor","text":"Ahead of Thursday's vote on a three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, Democrats are boasting that several Republicans are expected to defy their leadership team.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries expressed pride in the \"bipartisan coalition\" created ahead of Thursday's vote on a three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies after nine Republicans crossed the aisle Wednesday night to set up passage in the House.\n\n\"I hope today there will be more Republicans joining this leader,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, gesturing towards Jeffries at a news conference Thursday.\n\nJeffries called the vote \"an opportunity to take a meaningful step forward to lower the high cost of living for everyday Americans, particularly as it relates to health care, but it's a battle that we will continue to wage on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nWednesday's procedural vote passed by a 221-205 margin. Nine Republicans -- Reps. Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York, Rob Bresnahan, Ryan Mackenzie and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Maria Salazar of Florida, David Valadao of California, Thomas Kean of New Jersey, and Max Miller of Ohio -- voted with Democrats to pass it. \n\nThe subsidies, which expired at the end of 2025, were enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase the amount of financial assistance to those who were already eligible and to expand eligibility to more people.\n\nA tangible path forward that sends legislation through Senate to the Resolute Desk to address the expired subsidies remains in question.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that there's \"no appetite\" in the upper chamber for an extension and pointed instead to ongoing bipartisan talks between senators and House members.\n\n\"We've had that vote, as you know, already,\" Thune said. \"But we'll see what happens from the working group, and if they can come up with something that has reforms. And we'll go from there.\n\nThe Senate last month rejected a three-year extension of the subsidies when the measure fell short of the 60-vote threshold, though four Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska -- all crossed the aisle in support of the measure.\n\nAn estimated 22 million of the 24 million ACA marketplace enrollees are currently receiving enhanced premium tax credits to lower their monthly premiums, and many are seeing their premiums soar in 2026.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase the federal deficit by about $80.6 billion over the next decade. \n\nIf the measure is enacted, the number of people with health insurance would increase by 100,000 people in 2026, 3 million in 2027, 4 million in 2028 and 1.1 million in 2029, relative to current law, the CBO reported.\n\nAccording to the CBO, the 4 million increase in 2028 would result from changes in several types of coverage: 6.2 million more people would be enrolled through ACA health insurance marketplaces; 400,000 million more people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program; 500,000 fewer people would purchase nongroup coverage outside the marketplaces; and 2.1 million fewer people would have employment-based coverage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has publicly expressed his opposition to extending the enhanced subsidies. \n\n\"I'd like not to be able to do it. I'd like to see us get right into this. I don't know why we have to extend -- this can be done rapidly if the Democrats would come along,\" Trump said on Dec. 18 in the Oval Office.\n\nAfter Speaker Mike Johnson resisted pressure to allow a vote on the subsidies late last year, a quartet of House Republicans -- Fitzpatrick, Lawler, Bresnahan and Mackenzie -- banded together before the holiday break and signed on to a Democratic discharge petition to force a vote on an ACA extension, much to the chagrin of GOP leaders. \n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/house-vote-aca-subsidies-extension-9-republicans-help-get-floor/18373443/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18373457_mike-johnson-sad-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 19:55:05","author":"Lauren Peller, Emily Chang And John Parkinson","authors":["Lauren Peller, Emily Chang And John Parkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.125},{"id":392005564,"title":"Mike Pence gives ominous warning about Trump's 'very likely' fate after midterms","text":"Former Vice President Mike Pence offered a grim outlook for his one-time running mate, Donald Trump, should things go poorly for the GOP, per a report from the Daily Beast, echoing the president's own recent predictions.\n\nPence previously served as vice president during Trump's first term and ran for reelection alongside him in his failed 2020 campaign.

Trump became the first president ever impeached twice in 2021 following his involvement in the events of January 6. Both times, Republicans were able to vote down his conviction in the Senate, preventing him from being removed from office and barred from running in the future.\n\nAs Trump has moved more and more in his second term to seize powers delegated to Congress, act without congressional approval and use his office to personally enrich himself, Democrats have raised the prospect of impeachment countless times. Though these threats have been prevented from moving forward due to GOP majorities in the House and Senate, Trump's skyrocketing unpopularity with voters has increased the odds of Democrats retaking the House in 2026, which would clear the way for a third impeachment. \n\n“You gotta win the midterms,” Trump said at a speech on Tuesday marking the fifth anniversary of January 6. “Because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be, I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”\n\nThough fewer pundits predict that Democrats will be able to retake the Senate, the idea is gradually becoming more plausible as Trump continues to alienate voters. His potential conviction following impeachment, however, would remain a tall order, as it would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate.","summary":"Former Vice President Mike Pence offered a grim outlook for his one-time running mate, Donald Trump, should things go poorly for the GOP, per a report from the Daily Beast, echoing the president's own recent predictions.\n\nPence previously served as vice president during Trump's first term and ran for reelection alongside him in his failed 2020 campaign.

Trump, however, continues to double down on his tariffs, claiming that they will enable the United States to pay down its federal deficit and even eliminate federal income taxes.\n\nTrump is also saying that tariffs can be used to pay for an increased military budget, but MS NOW's Steve Benen takes issue with that claim in a January 8 column.\n\n\"Making matters worse is the fact that Trump has told Americans that he intends to use tariff revenue to reduce the national debt,\" Benen argues. \"And to pay for 'dividend' rebate checks.

But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said agents won't be going anywhere.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has deployed more than 2,000 officers to the area in what it says is its largest immigration enforcement operation ever. Noem said more than 1,500 people have already been arrested.\n\nDozens of protesters gathered Thursday outside of a federal building on the edge of Minneapolis that is serving as a major base for the immigration crackdown. They shouted \"No More ICE,\" \"Go Home Nazis,\" \"Quit Your Job,\" and \"Justice Now!\" as Border Patrol officers pushed them back from the gate, doused them with pepper spray and fired tear gas.\n\n\"We should be horrified,\" protester Shanta Hejmadi said. \"We should be saddened that our government is waging war on our citizens. We should get out and say no. What else can we do?\"\n\nGregory Bovino, a senior U.S. Customs and Border Patrol official who has been the face of the crackdowns in other cities, walked along the long line of officers, looking at the crowd as protesters yelled at him, including a man who shouted, \"Border Patrol should be along the border!\" Many activists tried to converse with the officers and persuade them that the job they were doing was wrong.\n\nVideos spark anger\n\nThe anti-immigration enforcement protests weren't confined to Minneapolis, as demonstrations also took place or were expected to Thursday in New York City, Seattle, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Antonio, New Orleans and Chicago. Protests were also scheduled for later this week in Arizona, North Carolina, and New Hampshire.\n\nBystanders captured video of Good's killing in a residential neighborhood south of downtown, and hundreds of people turned up for a Wednesday night vigil to mourn her.\n\nThe videos of the shooting show an officer approaching an SUV stopped across the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle. The Honda Pilot begins to pull forward, and a different ICE officer standing in front of it pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.\n\nIt isn't clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer, and there is no indication of whether the woman had interactions with ICE agents earlier. After the shooting the SUV speeds into two cars parked on a curb before crashing to a stop.\n\nIn another recording made afterward, a woman who identifies Macklin Good as her spouse is seen crying near the vehicle. The woman, who is not identified, says the couple recently arrived in Minnesota and that they had a child.\n\nState shut out of the investigation\n\nNoem called the incident an \"act of domestic terrorism\" against ICE officers, saying the driver \"attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump made similar accusations on social media and defended ICE's work.\n\nNoem alleged that the woman was part of a \"mob of agitators\" and said the officer followed his training. She said the FBI would investigate.\n\nBut Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem's version of events \"garbage.\"\n\n\"They are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,\" Frey said. \"Having seen the video myself, I wanna tell everybody directly, that is bullshit.\"\n\nHe also criticized the federal deployment and said agents should leave.\n\nMinnesota authorities had expected to work with the FBI on the shooting investigation. But the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Thursday that the U.S. attorney's office changed course Wednesday and barred it from taking part.\n\n\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands. As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,\" Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday demanded that the state be allowed to take part, as it would be the only way the public could be confident in its findings, noting it would be \"very, very difficult for Minnesotans\" to accept that an investigation that excludes the state could be fair.\n\n\"And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,\" Walz said.\n\nAsked about whether the state would be included, Noem said Minnesota authorities \"don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation.\"\n\nThe shooting marked a dramatic escalation of the latest in a series of immigration enforcement operations in major cities under the Trump administration. Wednesday's is at least the fifth death linked to the crackdowns.\n\nThe Twin Cities have been on edge since DHS announced the operation's launch Tuesday, at least partly tied to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents.\n\nIn a scene that hearkened back to crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago, people chanted \"ICE out of Minnesota\" and blew whistles that have become ubiquitous during the operations.\n\nWalz said Wednesday that he was prepared to deploy the National Guard if necessary. He expressed outrage over the shooting but called on people to keep protests peaceful.\n\n\"They want a show,\" Walz said of the Trump administration. \"We can't give it to them.\"\n\nAssociated Press reporters Steve Karnowski, Giovanna Dell'Orto and Mark Vancleave in Minneapolis, Ed White in Detroit, Valerie Gonzalez in Brownsville, Texas, Graham Lee Brewer in Norman, Oklahoma, Michael Biesecker In Washington, Jim Mustian in New York and Hallie Golden in Seattle contributed.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/minneapolis-ice-shooting-community-edge-fatal-woman-federal-immigration-officer/18371827/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18372950_ICE-Arrest-Minn-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 19:17:45","author":"Tim Sullivan And Giovanna Dell'orto","authors":["Tim Sullivan And Giovanna Dell'orto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":392004850,"title":"Trump threatens to ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes","text":"President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he intends to ban large institutional investors from buying additional single-family homes.\n\n\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote in a post on social media.\n\nLarge institutional investors such as Blackstone, JPMorgan Chase, and other banks and investment firms have increasingly snapped up family homes in recent years, eyeing rising returns on home prices. These investors often buy and rent out homes, and their presence grew after the foreclosure wave during the Great Recession in 2008, particularly in the Sun Belt states.\n\nShares of Blackstone fell by as much as 9% on Wednesday after the president's social media post.\n\nTrump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in the coming weeks, noting: \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to deliver an address at the World Economic Forum later this month in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nUS housing market in a deep freeze\n\nThe cost of buying a home in the United States has surged in recent years, largely because of a housing market that has remained historically stuck due to low inventory, combined with mortgage rates north of 6%.\n\nBeyond the general lack of housing, many sellers have been unwilling to give up the ultra-low mortgage rates they locked in during the pandemic, when the Federal Reserve brought down interest rates to near zero.\n\nBetween the start of 2020 and the third quarter of 2025, home prices climbed nearly 55% nationwide, according to a recent report from the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nNo investor owned 1,000 or more single-family rental homes as of 2011, according to the Government Accountability Office. However, by 2015, institutional investors collectively owned up to 300,000 homes.\n\nIn Atlanta; Jacksonville, Florida; and Charlotte, North Carolina, large investors controlled more than 15% of the market for single-family homes as of 2022, according to the GAO.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have proposed barring certain corporate investors from the home-buying market, arguing that their practice of buying houses en masse has pushed up prices and made it harder for individual Americans to find homes.\n\nBut some housing experts and economists have panned the idea to ban large investors, contending that it would have little impact on overall housing stock and risk depressing investment in the market.\n\n\"This will not fix housing affordability. It may boost single-family purchases, but it will come at the cost of reducing single-family rentals,\" said Jaret Seiberg, analyst at TD Cowen, in a note Wednesday.\n\nThe CNN Wire™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It’s so strategic. Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,” the US president told reporters on Sunday.\n\nBut Trump’s push has drawn strong rebukes from Greenland and Denmark, the European Union, and other major US allies, including Canada.\n\nOn Tuesday, the foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden stressed their commitment “to preserving security, stability and co-operation in the Arctic”.\n\n“Security in the Arctic rests on respect for the fundamental principles of the UN Charter and international law, including the inviolability of borders,” the ministers said in a joint statement.\n\n“We collectively reiterate that matters concerning Denmark and Greenland are for Denmark and Greenland to decide alone.”\n\nYet despite that opposition, the Trump administration continues to float the possibility of taking over Greenland – and it has refused to rule out the possibility of military action.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday that “all options are always on the table for President Trump”.\n\n“But I will just say that the president’s first option always has been diplomacy,” she said.\n\nFears of a US military operation to take control of Greenland have grown after the Trump administration sent the US military into the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to abduct President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday after a months-long pressure campaign.\n\nThe abduction, which has been denounced as a violation of international law, comes amid Trump’s push to exert US dominance in the Western Hemisphere in line with a 19th-century US policy known as the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nSome experts say the US president’s plan to take over Greenland aligns with that doctrine.\n\nAsked about Washington’s stance towards Greenland, Rubio told reporters on Wednesday that Trump is not the first US president to look at how to “acquire” the territory. He also did not rule out using military force.\n\n“If the president identifies a threat to the national security of the United States, every president retains the option to address it through military means,” Rubio said.\n\nIt remains unclear who exactly will meet with Rubio next week for talks on the situation.\n\nBut Greenland’s Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said on Tuesday that she and Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen had requested a meeting with the US secretary of state.\n\n“The purpose of the meeting is to reflect the US’s significant statements on Greenland,” Motzfeldt wrote on social media.\n\nChemnitz, the Danish lawmaker, told Al Jazeera on Thursday that the planned talks are an opportunity to address rising tensions over the US position.\n\n“I think it’s important to focus on diplomacy,” she said. “This is a very strange situation for us, and many of us have been concerned about everything that has happened.”\n\nBut Chemnitz stressed that the discussions must be conducted with respect. “We need respect,” she said. “In order to have diplomacy, you also need to have respect.”","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/greenland-is-not-for-sale-lawmaker-says-amid-trumps-escalating-threats/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2026/01/reuters_695e55ea-1767790058-E4mK2V.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 18:40:03","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":392003556,"title":"House Set To Pass Bill Extending ACA Subsidies For 3 Years","text":"Source: zimmytws / Getty One of the biggest issues in American politics late last year was the expiration of COVID-era subsidies for insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The expiring subsidies triggered the longest government shutdown in American history last October. While the shutdown ended without a deal to extend the subsidies, the House of Representatives is set to pass a bill extending them for three years. According to CBS News, after House Speaker Mike Johnson initially refused to hold a vote on extending the subsidies, four House Republicans broke ranks and signed onto a discharge petition that forces a vote on the extension. A procedural vote was held on Wednesday to advance the measure, where five more House Republicans voted in favor of the extension. “We’ll get this off of the House floor, if the Republicans stay true to their word, and we look forward to passing that in a bipartisan way,” Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told reporters on Wednesday. The majority of Republicans have argued against a clean, three-year extension of the ACA subsidies without reforms, which is why the shutdown ended without a deal to extend them. The Republicans who have broken ranks feel that a clean extension is better than simply letting them expire and drastically raising prices for millions of Americans. You know, it would’ve been nice if they had this energy in the first place. The subsidies did wind up expiring at the end of last year, with millions of Americans nationwide either paying substantially higher monthly premiums (like ya boy) or being forced to go without insurance because they couldn’t afford the price hike. Truly a bold move by the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterms. While the bill is expected to pass the House, it will face a difficult journey in the Senate, where Republicans remain staunchly opposed to an extension. After the shutdown, Democrats and Republicans both introduced separate bills to address the expiring ACA subsidies. The Democrats’ bill was a clean extension of ACA subsidies, while the Republican bill created health savings accounts for Bronze-level plans under the ACA. Neither bill received the votes necessary to pass. Despite that, centrists in both parties have been steadily negotiating a compromise bill that will hopefully address the issue. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters on Tuesday that “we’re continuing to work hard” on a compromise measure. She added that the bill would likely extend the subsidies for two years, with some mild reforms in the first year, and more substantial reforms in the second. Even if the Senate gets it together and passes the subsidies, it’s unclear if President Donald Trump would even sign the bill. According to ABC News, Trump expressed just last month that he didn’t want to extend the subsidies. “I’d like not to be able to do it. I’d like to see us get right into this. I don’t know why we have to extend — this can be done rapidly if the Democrats would come along,” Trump said in the Oval Office. Crazy how the dude who ran on affordability is against Americans, many of whom voted for him, having affordable health care.

Internet access and telephone lines in Iran cut out immediately after the protests began.\n\nThe protest represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran’s ailing economy.\n\nThursday saw a continuation of the demonstrations that popped up in cities and rural towns across Iran on Wednesday. More markets and bazaars shut down in support of the protesters. So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 39 people while more than 2,260 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.\n\nThe growth of the protests increases the pressure on Iran’s civilian government and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. CloudFlare, an internet firm, and the advocacy group NetBlocks reported the internet outage, both attributing it to Iranian government interference. Attempts to dial landlines and mobile phones from Dubai to Iran could not be connected. Such outages have in the past been followed by intense government crackdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, the protests themselves have remained broadly leaderless. It remains unclear how Pahlavi’s call will affect the demonstrations moving forward.\n\n“The lack of a viable alternative has undermined past protests in Iran,” wrote Nate Swanson of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who studies Iran.\n\n“There may be a thousand Iranian dissident activists who, given a chance, could emerge as respected statesmen, as labor leader Lech Wałęsa did in Poland at the end of the Cold War. But so far, the Iranian security apparatus has arrested, persecuted and exiled all of the country’s potential transformational leaders.”\n\nThursday’s demonstration rallies at home and in street\n\nPahlavi had called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. local (1630 GMT) on Thursday and Friday. When the clock struck, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. The chants included “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the Islamic Republic!” Others praised the shah, shouting: “This is the last battle! Pahlavi will return!” Thousands could be seen on the streets.\n\n“Great nation of Iran, the eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands,” Pahlavi said in a statement. “I warn the Islamic Republic, its leader and the (Revolutionary Guard) that the world and (President Donald Trump) are closely watching you. Suppression of the people will not go unanswered.”\n\nPahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call. His support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn’t clear whether that’s support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIranian officials appeared to be taking the planned protests seriously. The hard-line Kayhan newspaper published a video online claiming security forces would use drones to identify those taking part.\n\nIranian officials have offered no acknowledgment of the scale of the overall protests, which raged across many locations Thursday even before the 8 p.m. demonstration. However, there has been reporting regarding security officials being hurt or killed.\n\nThe judiciary’s Mizan news agency report a police colonel suffered fatal stab wounds in a town outside of Tehran, while the semiofficial Fars news agency said gunmen killed two security force members and wounded 30 others in a shooting in the city of Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province.\n\nA deputy governor in Iran’s Khorasan Razavi province told Iranian state television that an attack at a police station killed five people Wednesday night in Chenaran, some 700 kilometers (430 miles) northeast of Tehran.\n\nIran weighs Trump threat\n\nIt remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” America “will come to their rescue.”\n\nTrump’s comments drew a new rebuke from Iran’s Foreign Ministry.\n\n“Recalling the long history of criminal interventions by successive U.S. administrations in Iran’s internal affairs, the Foreign Ministry considers claims of concern for the great Iranian nation to be hypocritical, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the numerous crimes committed against Iranians,” it said.\n\nBut those comments haven’t stopped the U.S. State Department on the social platform X from highlighting online footage purporting to show demonstrators putting up stickers naming roads after Trump or throwing away government-subsidized rice.\n\n“When prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,” the State Department said in one message. “It makes no difference if this rice is thrown away.”\n\nMeanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi remains imprisoned by authorities after her arrest in December.\n\n“Since Dec. 28, 2025, the people of Iran have taken to the streets, just as they did in 2009, 2019,” her son Ali Rahmani said. “Each time, the same demands came up: an end to the Islamic Republic, an end to this patriarchal, dictatorial and religious regime, the end of the clerics, the end of the mullahs’ regime.”\n\nBiggest protests since Mahsa Amini’s death\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran’s theocracy.\n\nPrior to Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial was broadly stable, trading at around 70 to $1. At the time of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, $1 traded for 32,000 rials. Shops in markets across the country have shut down as part of the protests.","summary":"Internet access and telephone lines in Iran cut out immediately after the protests began.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/08/iran-demonstrations/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26006456436955.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 18:25:39","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":391995798,"title":"US says it will dictate Venezuela decisions, oil sales","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks to the press as Secretary of State Marco Rubio looks on following US military actions in Venezuela, at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, on January 3, 2026. (Photo: AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 8, 2026\n\n\n\n\n US says it will dictate Venezuela decisions, oil sales \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump’s administration said Wednesday it will dictate decisions to Venezuela’s interim leaders and control the country’s oil sales “indefinitely” after toppling Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe United States could effectively run Venezuela and tap into its oil reserves for years, Trump later told the New York Times.\n\nThe American leader’s assertion of US dominance over the oil-rich South American country comes despite its interim leader Delcy Rodriguez saying there is no foreign power governing Caracas.\n\n“There is a stain on our relations such as had never occurred in our history,” Rodriguez said about the US attack to depose her predecessor.\n\nUS special forces snatched president Maduro and his wife on Saturday in a lightning raid and whisked them to New York to face trial on drug and weapons charges, underscoring what Trump has called the “Donroe Doctine” of US dominance over its backyard.\n\n“We obviously have maximum leverage over the interim authorities in Venezuela right now” following the capture operation, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing.\n\n“We’re continuing to be in close coordination with the interim authorities, and their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”\n\nTrump has said the United States will “run” Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.\n\n“They’re giving us everything that we feel is necessary,” Trump told the Times. “Don’t forget, they took the oil from us years ago.\n\nWhen asked if US control of the country would last three months, six months or a year, Trump told the paper: “I would say much longer.”\n\nBut Washington has no boots on the ground, and appears to be relying on a naval blockade and the threat of further force to ensure the cooperation of the interim president.\n\nMeanwhile Caracas announced Wednesday that at least 100 people were killed in the US attack and a similar number injured.\n\nAmong those hurt were Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said.\n\nThe couple were seen walking on their own power during a New York court arraignment earlier this week.\n\nAccording to Havana, the death toll includes 32 members of the Cuban military. Maduro, like his firebrand predecessor Hugo Chavez, employed specialised Cuban soldiers as bodyguards.\n\n– ‘Not just winging it’ –\n\nTrump’s administration — which has so far indicated it intends to stick with Rodriguez and sideline opposition figures, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado — has given few details about its plans.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio insisted on Wednesday, after meeting lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have been critical about the post-Maduro planning, that the United States was “not just winging it.”\n\nBut so far, the US plan relies heavily on what Trump said on Tuesday was an agreement for Venezuela to hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil to the United States for it to then sell.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that under the deal Venezuela “is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive” from the oil profits they receive.\n\nThat would include agricultural products, machinery, medical devices and energy equipment, he added.\n\nRubio said that in a second “recovery” phase, US and Western companies would have access to the Venezuelan market and “at the same time, begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally within Venezuela.”\n\nVenezuela’s state oil firm said it was discussing oil sales with the United States for the “sale of volumes of oil” under existing commercial frameworks.\n\nBut Washington is looking at longer term control, according to Energy Secretary Chris Wright.\n\n“We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela, first this backed-up stored oil, and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela,” Wright said Wednesday.\n\n– ‘Immense opportunity’ –\n\nTrump will on Friday meet executives from US oil companies, whom he has said will invest in Venezuela’s crumbling facilities, despite no firm having yet made such pledges amid the turmoil in the country.\n\n“It’s just a meeting to discuss, obviously, the immense opportunity that is before these oil companies right now,” Leavitt told reporters.\n\nTrump also invited leftist Colombian President Gustavo Petro to meet at the White House “in the near future,” after the two leaders had their first phone call Wednesday since Trump took office last year.\n\nWashington moved further to stamp its authority on Venezuela when it seized two oil tankers, including a Russian-linked vessel that it pursued from Venezuela to the North Atlantic.\n\nMoscow condemned the operation but Leavitt insisted the oil tanker had been “deemed stateless after flying a false flag.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: conflict US Venezula \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA

Moscow has intensified its attacks on Ukraine’s energy system as Ukrainian forces fend off Russian advances on the battlefield and Kyiv faces US pressure to quickly secure a peace deal.\n\nNearly 500,000 households in the industrialized region of Dnipropetrovsk, one of Ukraine’s largest, were still without power on Thursday afternoon, according to private energy provider DTEK.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba had said more than 1 million consumers in the region had no heating or water supply. “This is Russia’s war specifically against our people, against life in Ukraine - an attempt to break Ukraine,” Zelensky wrote on X after a European tour aimed at rallying support for Kyiv. “Diplomatic discussions cannot be a pretext for slowing down the supply of air defence systems and equipment that helps protect lives.”\n\nPower has been restored to the other affected region, Zaporizhzhia, after a blackout there forced critical infrastructure to rely on reserves, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. Governor Ivan Fedorov said it was the first time in “recent years” that his region had faced a total blackout.\n\nIn the regional capital of Dnipro, generators hummed outside storefronts downtown, where residents interviewed by Reuters said they had grown used to the frequent disruptions. “This is not the first blackout, and I suspect that it will not be the last, so we are working - we are prepared,” said a barista who introduced herself as Iryna.\n\nInterior Minister Ihor Klymenko said more than 1,500 charging and heating points had been rolled out across the Dnipropetrovsk region. He added that police were announcing air-raid alerts via megaphone in parts of the region where sirens were not working.\n\nIn Kryvyi Rih, Zelensky’s hometown, key steel maker ArcelorMittal said it had temporarily suspended some of its production. Zaporizhstal, another major producer, also reported a temporary suspension and said it was preparing for a safe restart. Ukraine’s energy ministry said eight mines across Dnipropetrovsk had faced blackouts overnight, but that workers had been evacuated.\n\nMeanwhile, water supplies to the strategic city of Pavlohrad and nearby areas were expected to take up to a day to repair, said Mykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional council.\n\nUkraine is bracing for colder weather later this week, which Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko has said is likely to compound disruptions to power and heating. The energy ministry said on Wednesday that weather conditions had already cut power to some settlements in at least four regions of Ukraine.\n\nRussia on Thursday slammed a plan for European peacekeepers to be deployed to Ukraine as “dangerous”, branding Kyiv and its allies an “axis of war” and dousing hopes it could be a step towards ending the almost four-year-long war. US President Donald Trump has been pushing the warring sides to strike a deal to halt the conflict, running shuttle diplomacy between Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia’s Vladimir Putin to try to get an agreement across the line.\n\nAn initial 28-point plan that largely adhered to Moscow’s demands was criticized by Kyiv and Europe. Now Russia has condemned attempts to beef up protections for Ukraine should an elusive deal be reached. Ukraine’s allies said they had agreed key security guarantees for Kyiv at a summit in Paris earlier this week, including a peacekeeping force. But in its first comments since the summit, Moscow said the statements were far from anything the Kremlin could accept to end its assault. — Agencies","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/38230/top-stories/russian-strikes-plunge-ukraines-industrial-southeast-into-blackouts/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2026/01/08/344751.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 18:11:00","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"kw","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":391995794,"title":"Macron accuses US of &#8216;turning away&#8217; from allies","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron gestures as he delivers a speech to French ambassadors during the Ambassadors' Conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris on January 8, 2026.

(Photo: AFP) \n\n International, Latest News \n\nJanuary 8, 2026\n\n\n\n\n US withdrawal from UN climate treaty ‘regrettable’ — EU’s Hoekstra \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPARIS, France (AFP) — The European Union’s (EU) climate chief said Thursday that Europe would keep working with other nations to tackle global warming despite the United States (US) announcing its exit from a bedrock United Nations (UN) climate treaty.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the United States would withdraw from dozens of global organisations and treaties, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nThe treaty adopted in 1992 is a global pact by nations to cooperate to drive down planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nEuropean Union Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC “underpins global climate action” and lamented the US move to walk away from the cornerstone agreement.\n\n“The decision by the world’s largest economy and second-largest emitter to retreat from it is regrettable and unfortunate,” Hoekstra said in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n“We will unequivocally continue to support international climate research, as the foundation of our understanding and work. We will also continue to work on international climate cooperation.”\n\nTrump, who has thrown the full weight of his domestic policy behind fossil fuels, has openly scorned the scientific consensus that human activity is warming the planet, deriding climate science as a “hoax”.\n\nHis administration sent no representative to the most recent UN climate summit in Brazil in November, which is held every year under the auspices of the UNFCCC.\n\nTeresa Ribera, the EU’s vice-president for the clean transition, said the Trump administration “doesn’t care” about the environment, health or the suffering of people.\n\n“Peace, justice, cooperation or prosperity are not among its priorities,” she wrote on the social media network Bluesky.\n\nTrump has already withdrawn from the landmark Paris climate accord since returning to office, just as he did during his first term from 2017–2021 in a move later reversed by his successor, Democratic president Joe Biden.\n\nExiting the underlying treaty could introduce additional legal uncertainty around any future US effort to rejoin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: climate environment EU UN US \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Some food preservatives linked to higher cancer, diabetes risk \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2026 \n\n\n PARIS, France (AFP) — Eating some common food preservatives is linked to a slightly higher risk of eventually developing cancer and diabetes, accordin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Startups go public in litmus test for Chinese AI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2026 \n\n\n HONG KONG, China (AFP) — Leading Chinese artificial intelligence startup Zhipu AI soared as it went public in Hong Kong on Thursday, a day before riva... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man arrested in $7 million overseas employment scam \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The police have arrested and charged a 52-year-old man who was wanted in connection with an overseas employment scam that allegedl... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PM urges church partnership to help further reduce Jamaica’s murder rate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Prime Minister Andrew Holness, is urging the church to partner with the Government in reducing Jamaica’s murder rate to align with... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 48-hour curfew imposed in sections of St Andrew North Police Division \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 7, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A 48-hour curfew has been imposed for the communities of Brooks Level and Airy Castle in Stony Hill, St Andrew.

It mobilises and channels large-scale financing, strengthens institutional capacities, supports transformative climate action, and brings together global partnerships to deliver meaningful and lasting impact.This decision by the US Treasury Department comes a day after US President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum on Wednesday directing the withdrawal from 66 international organisations, conventions and treaties that his administration has determined to be \"contrary to the interests of the United States\".The memorandum stated that the decision follows a comprehensive review ordered under Executive Order 14199, issued on February 4, 2025, which mandated an assessment of all international intergovernmental organisations, conventions and treaties involving US membership, funding or support.According to the memorandum, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in consultation with the United States Representative to the United Nations, submitted a report identifying organisations and agreements \"found to be inconsistent with US interests\".After reviewing the findings and consulting Cabinet members, the President concluded that continued participation in certain bodies, both within the United Nations and in non-UN bodies, was no longer in the country's interest.According to the White House, the 66 organisations consist of 35 non-United Nations organisations and 31 United Nations entities.The list also consists of India-France-led International Solar Alliance (ISA), lauched in order to bring countries together to address climate change by promoting and deploying solar energy solutions. According to the ISA website, the idea was conceived on the sidelines of the COP21 climate conference in Paris in 2015. After an amendment to its Framework Agreement in 2020, membership was opened to all United Nations member states. The Alliance aims to mobilise USD 1 trillion in solar investments by 2030 while lowering the costs of solar technologies and financing.Following this development, the Indian government has noted reports that the US has decided to withdraw from 66 international organisations, including the ISA, sources said, adding that the Alliance remains focused on its objective of supporting its member countries in scaling up solar energy in line with their needs.Sources said the Solar Alliance comprises 125 member and signatory countries and will continue to work in line with its members' needs to achieve universal energy access.Sources said the ISA will continue to prioritise cooperation with Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the development and deployment of solar energy solutions.Trump's dismissals of organisations battling climate change have been evident since his inauguration.In November, during his address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Trump launched a sharp critique of climate science, terming climate change the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\" and dismissing global efforts to tackle it as misguided.While several world leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, used their speeches to call for urgent climate action, Trump's remarks took a markedly different tone.Addressing the gathering, Trump described climate change as a \"fake energy catastrophe\" and criticised what he called a growing dependence on renewable energy sources.He asserted that the concept of a carbon footprint was a hoax and accused unnamed groups of having \"evil intentions\" in pushing environmental agendas.\"The carbon footprint is a hoax, made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction,\" Trump said, in a speech that lasted more than 45 minutes - almost three times the UN's suggested 15-minute limit for world leaders.Trump also launched a lengthy tirade against renewable energy, dismissing clean energy policies as wasteful and ineffective.Besides calling climate change \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\", Trump mocked renewables as a costly failure.\"If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,\" Trump said, criticising European countries, including Germany, Greece, and Switzerland, for their investments in renewables.

It needed 51 votes to move forward.\n\nRepublican Sens. Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Todd Young, Susan Collins and Josh Hawley voted with all Democrats in favor of the legislation. \n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, pushed for the resolution to receive a vote immediately after President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces carried out a large-scale attack in Venezuela, capturing dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, who are facing federal charges including narcoterrorism conspiracy and conspiracy to import cocaine.\n\n\"Where will this go next? Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people's elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk,\" Kaine said in a statement on Jan. 3.\n\nKaine added it was \"long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Republican Sen.

It does not reassert Congress's powers. It does not make America stronger. It makes America weaker and less safe,\" Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"It would weaken the President's legitimate, constitutional authority. This body, the United States Senate, is being asked whether the President of the United States has the authority to arrest indicted criminals. Of course he does.

The DHS' are a bit more nuanced, but it talks about de-escalation.\"\n\n \"What's most disturbing to me is this,\" Griffin continued, citing social media vitriol she said she witnessed moments after the shooting happened. \"Within minutes of this video being published.... it felt like there was such a mad dash to confirm one's partisan opinion\" to \"fit their partisan narrative,\" Griffin observed.\n\n \"When did we become a country that a woman my age and a mother of three is killed — the facts will play out, we may learn more — but is killed and our first thought is, how do I make this a win for the party I vote with? I find it sickening the way it played out,\" she continued.\n\n Joy Behar said she felt that the video is evidence of America becoming \"a dictatorship in the making\" and that \"we are now in it\" beyond questioning.\n\n Legal expert and former federal prosecutor Sunny Hostin alleged that, \"When I looked at the video from several different angles, I saw an unlawful killing,\" calling her assessment \"very clear\" given the videos circulating online.\n\n \"We need to be at a point in this country where we call a thing a thing and stop listening to propaganda and being Orwellian in terms of not believing what your eyes are seeing,\" she said, referencing right-wing reaction to the videos.\n\n Goldberg attempted to bring the conversation back to a relatable point, turning toward the studio crowd around her as she said, \"That young lady could've been anybody in this audience. Forget color, it could've been anybody, and if they can do this to her, they can do it to you, too.\"\n\n Hostin then cited a 1985 Supreme Court ruling after a police officer shot and killed a man fleeing the scene of a crime, with the case finding that \"a police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect only if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.\"\n\n The panelist summarized it as a law enforcement agent not being able to \"use deadly force to shoot at a moving vehicle with an unarmed person in it,\" before doubling down on her assessment of it being an \"unlawful killing\" of an American citizen.\n\n \"When that woman went in reverse and moved away from the officers... all that officer needed to do was move out of the way,\" Hostin said.\n\n Entertainment Weekly has reached out to representatives for ICE, Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.\n\n Countering criticism lobbed at political figures defending the ICE agent, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good's driving an \"act of domestic terrorism\" targeted at ICE officers, claiming that Good “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle. An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively, shot, to protect himself and the people around him.\"\n\n Donald Trump claimed on his Truth Social platform that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense,\" and said that the ICE agent who shot at Good was \"recovering in the hospital\" despite not being struck by the car in reported footage from the scene.\n\n A later New York Times report noted that Trump told reporters at the White House, \"I want to see nobody get shot. I want to see nobody screaming and trying to run over policemen either.\"\n\n Other celebrities have weighed in on the shooting after viewing footage of the incident that, as many said on social media, contradicts how Noem and Trump have characterized the incident. Actor Patton Oswalt posting a sardonic reply on X after Fox News host Jesse Watters mockingly pointed out that Good had \"pronouns in her bio\" and pointed out her \"lesbian partner\" and \"child from a previous marriage.\"\n\n \"Pronouns in her bio? A POET?!?!! Why didn’t that brave ICE agent empty his full clip?\" Oswalt shared on the social media site.\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Fellow View cohost and TV personality Ana Navarro, who wasn't at the Hot Topics table on Thursday, as she typically only appears on Mondays and Fridays, reacted to the news on social media as well.\n\n \"This is tragic. Unnecessary. A young woman was killed, leaving a 6 year-old boy, an orphan,\" Navarro shared on Instagram. \"She was a white US citizen, who showed-up in support of her immigrant neighbors. Her name is Renee Nicole Good.\"\n\n The View airs weekdays on ABC.","summary":"\"I saw an unlawful killing,\" Sunny Hostin said after ICE killed a 37-year-old Minnesota mother, while Whoopi Goldberg said \"if they can do this to her, they can do it to you, too.\"","url":"https://ew.com/the-view-cohosts-condemn-ice-shooting-renee-nicole-good-11881487","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/Ds0_s0bymYYp3CujEW04weMF6dc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-View-010826-1-da77b72f86ba4ff78bcc85faadbdd991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-08 17:38:32","author":"Joey Nolfi","authors":["Joey Nolfi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.11},{"id":392007996,"title":"Is US planning an indefinite control on Venezuelan oil?

Ron DeSantis Announces Special Session For Redistricting","text":"Source: Joe Raedle / Getty The nationwide redistricting continues into the new year, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis calls for a special session focused on redistricting. According to AP News, Republicans already control 20 of Florida’s 28 districts, so it’s unclear how many seats they intend to gain with a new map. While the legislative session doesn’t start for a week, DeSantis called the special session to get ahead of a Supreme Court ruling over a key provision in the Voting Rights Act that bars discrimination in voting systems. “I don’t think it’s a question of if they’re going to rule. It’s a question of what the scope is going to be,” DeSantis said at a news conference on Tuesday. “So, we’re getting out ahead of that.” Florida is only the latest state to join the prolonged, nationwide redistricting battle. This all began last July when Texas Gov. Greg Abbott used the Kerr County floods to launch a special legislative session focused on redistricting. Typically, redistricting only occurs every 10 years in response to new Census data. President Donald Trump has no respect for norms or precedent, though, and pressured Abbott into the redistricting effort. Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House, with Democrats initially only needing a net gain of three seats to flip control. With Trump’s policies proving deeply unpopular, and midterms historically favoring the opposition party, the GOP has decided that the only way to win is to manipulate voting maps in their favor. After Texas successfully passed a new map that created five new seats in districts favored for Republicans, several Republican state legislatures began redistricting efforts of their own. Missouri and North Carolina both passed new Congressional maps that give Republicans an extra House seat in each state. The Republican redistricting effort hasn’t gone on without any speed bumps, though. Missouri voters introduced a ballot petition that would place the new map on the ballot for the 2026 midterms, meaning that the state would have to conduct its election using the old map. Republicans in Indiana rejected a redistricting attempt that would give the state another House seat. Democratic state legislatures have also responded to the redistricting push with their own redistricting efforts. California Gov. Gavin Newsom introduced Prop 50 in response to Texas’ redistricting effort. The proposition, which voters overwhelmingly passed during a November special election, temporarily transfers control of the state’s congressional maps from an independent redistricting committee to the state legislature. California has implemented a new map that neutralizes the gains made in the Texas redistricting effort. Virginia announced a surprise redistricting effort in November, and with Democrats maintaining control of the General Assembly and taking the Governor’s office, they intend to implement a map that gives Democrats two to three new House seats. When it comes to Florida, the success of its redistricting effort may not be so cut-and-dry. Miami-Dade just elected the first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years, signaling the Republican stronghold could gradually revert to its former status as a purple state. The refusal of Republican congressmembers to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies affected Florida voters the most, as the state had the highest number of people insured through the ACA. They can redraw the districts all they want, but if the 2024 election taught us anything, it’s that people vote with their wallets, and Republicans made it significantly more expensive for Florida voters to access decent health insurance. No amount of redistricting can change that.

Videos taken by bystanders and posted to social media show an officer approaching an SUV stopped in the middle of the road, demanding the driver open the door and grabbing the handle.\n\nThe Honda Pilot begins to pull forward and a different ICE officer standing in front of the vehicle pulls his weapon and immediately fires at least two shots into the vehicle at close range, jumping back as the vehicle moves toward him.\n\nIt is not clear from the videos if the vehicle makes contact with the officer. The SUV then speeds into two cars parked on a curb nearby before coming to a stop. Witnesses can be heard shouting in shock.\n\nVictim was a ‘wife and mom’\n\nGood died of gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nShe described herself on social media as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado. Calls and messages to her family were not immediately returned.\n\nPublic records show Good had recently lived in Kansas City, Missouri, where she and another woman with the same home address had started a business last year called B. Good Handywork.\n\nIn a video posted from the scene on social media, a woman who describes Good as her wife is seen sitting near the vehicle sobbing. She says the couple had only recently arrived in Minnesota and they have a 6-year-old child.\n\nHer killing is at least the fifth death to result from the aggressive U.S. immigration crackdown the Trump administration launched last year.\n\nNoem says officer followed training\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday in New York that there would be a federal investigation into the shooting, adding that she believes the officer followed his training and the shooting was justified. She again called the woman’s actions “domestic terrorism.”\n\n“This vehicle was used to hit this officer,” Noem said. “It was used as a weapon, and the officer feels as though his life was in jeopardy.”\n\nThe ICE officer has not been publicly identified. Noem said he was taken to a hospital after being hit by the vehicle and has since been discharged.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara gave no indication that the driver was trying to harm anyone when he described the shooting to reporters Wednesday.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called Noem’s description of the events “garbage,” saying he had watched videos of the shooting that show it wasn’t self-defense and was avoidable.\n\nFederal and state leaders dispute jurisdiction to investigate\n\nDrew Evans, head of Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said Thursday that federal prosecutors have barred the state agency from jointly investigating the shooting alongside the FBI. He said state investigators were being denied access to evidence, witness interviews and other case materials.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz demanded that state investigators be given a role, telling reporters that residents would otherwise have a hard time accepting the findings of federal law enforcement.\n\n“And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment from the president to the vice president to Kristi Noem,” Walz said.\n\nNoem denied that Minnesota authorities were being shut out, saying: “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”\n\nProtest met with pepper spray, tear gas\n\nDozens of protesters Thursday morning outside a Minneapolis federal building being used a base for the immigration crackdown. Border Patrol officers fired tear gas and doused demonstrators with pepper spray to push them back from the gate.\n\nArea schools were closed as a safety precaution.\n\nA vigil Wednesday night for the victim drew hundreds of people.

The measure would also almost certainly face a presidential veto, as reported by The Hill.The resolution is co-sponsored by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (New York), along with Senators Tim Kaine (Virginia) and Adam Schiff (California), underscoring rare bipartisan opposition to the administration's approach toward Venezuela.This comes days after the US launched a \"large-scale strike\" in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas on Saturday and captured its President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.Maduro and Flores were flown out of the country in a joint operation involving intelligence agencies and US law enforcement. They were indicted on charges of alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies\" in the Southern District of New York and are currently facing trial.Following their capture, Trump said that Washington will run the country \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition\".He said that the US action was aimed at bringing \"outlaw dictator Nicolas Maduro to justice\".\"We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition. We want peace, justice and liberty for the great people of Venezuela... We can't take a chance if somebody else takes over Venezuela, doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. We're not going to let that happen. We are there now, but we are going to stay until such time as a proper transition takes place. We're going to run it essentially until such time,\" he said.

Layoffs also dropped as companies seem to be retaining workers even as they are reluctant to add staff, a trend economists refer to as “low hire, low fire.”\n\nRecent government data has revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in a spike of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the 12 months ended in March.\n\nIn an attempt to stabilize a softening labor market, the Federal Reserve last month trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell said members of the committee are increasingly concerned that the job market is even weaker than it appears.

In that same spirit, the Trump administration is excited to announce the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025-2030, marking the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in our nation’s history. The message is simple and should be non-controversial: eat real food. That means more protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains. Paired with a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods — which are often laden with refined carbohydrates, added sugars, excess sodium, unhealthy fats and chemical additives — this approach has the potential to improve the health trajectory of Americans. These improvements are long overdue. It’s no secret that the United States is currently facing a national health emergency. Nearly 90% of healthcare spending goes toward treating people with chronic diseases. Many of these illnesses are not due to genetic destiny; they are the predictable result of the standard American diet — a diet high in processed foods, added sugars, unhealthy fats and sodium, while being low in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING IMPORTANT, STRATEGIC STEPS TO PROTECT AMERICAN CONSUMERS The consequences have been devastating. More than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, and nearly one in three American adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 has prediabetes. While these statistics constitute a tragedy for the individuals directly affected, they have also put our national security at risk. Diet-driven chronic disease now disqualifies large numbers of young Americans from military service, undermining national readiness and cutting off a historic pathway to opportunity and upward mobility. For decades, federal incentives have promoted low-quality, highly processed foods and pharmaceutical intervention instead of prevention. This has been a recipe for disaster, and it was the inevitable outcome of poor policy choices, inadequate nutrition research and a lack of coordination across federal, state, local and private partners. Thanks to the bold leadership of President Donald Trump, this string of failure ends today. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION At long last, we are realigning our food system to support American farmers, ranchers and companies that grow and produce real food. Farmers and ranchers are at the forefront of the solution, whether they raise beef, provide dairy, or harvest nourishing fruits and vegetables. These Dietary Guidelines recognize that the national health crisis affects us all and must be addressed through a holistic nationwide effort. We are calling on everyone — especially healthcare professionals, insurers, educators, community leaders, industry and lawmakers across all levels of government — to join in.

The least the media could do is ask them about it,\" Vance wrote. NOEM ALLEGES WOMAN KILLED IN ICE SHOOTING 'STALKING AND IMPEDING' AGENTS ALL DAY Chaos erupted in Minnesota on Wednesday after an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good tried to \"weaponize her vehicle\" and \"attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.\" She also accused Good of \"stalking and impeding\" federal agents all day. Noem told reporters that Good was instructed to get out of her car and stop \"obstructing\" law enforcement, but she did not comply. The agency is labeling the incident as an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" On Thursday, in a separate post on X, Vance expanded on his defense of the officer's actions, slamming critics for engaging in \"gaslighting.\" The post was made in response to comments from Jenin Younes, the national legal director for the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, who argued that the officer was not in danger and had time to get out of Good's way. Vance said Younes' arguments were \"preposterous.\" \"The gaslighting is off the charts, and I'm having none of it. This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job. When he approached her car, she tried to hit him,\" Vance wrote. \"A tragedy? Absolutely. But a tragedy that falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with.\" DEMOCRATS LOOK AT DEFUNDING ICE, IMPEACHING NOEM AFTER MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING Several Democratic lawmakers, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and several others, have slammed ICE in the wake of the shooting. In a news conference immediately after the fatal shooting, Frey told ICE to \"get the f--- out\" of the city and rejected DHS' claim that the shooting happened in self-defense, calling it \"garbage.\" The mayor also claimed ICE was \"creating the kind of dysfunction and chaos that they claimed to be trying to help with.\" \"Get the f--- out of Minneapolis,\" Frey said. \"We do not want you here. Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt, families are being ripped apart.\" Walz also rejected DHS's statement on the shooting, dismissing the agency as a \"propaganda machine.\" During a news conference, the governor vowed the state would \"seek accountability and justice\" following the shooting. He also rejected further assistance from the federal government, calling out President Donald Trump and Noem by name during a news conference on Wednesday. The governor then announced that he had issued a warning order to the National Guard and that members were prepared for deployment if and when necessary. WALZ PREPARES NATIONAL GUARD AFTER WOMAN KILLED IN ICE OPERATION: 'NEVER BEEN AT WAR' WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT Omar, a fierce critic of ICE, took to social media to slam the agency, saying that the officer's actions were \"unconscionable and reprehensible.\" \"I am beyond outraged that their reckless, callous actions led to the killing of a legal observer in Minneapolis. My heart breaks for the victim’s family, who will have to forever live with the pain caused by the Trump administration's reckless and deadly actions,\" Omar wrote. \"This administration has shown, yet again, that it does not care about the safety of Minnesotans... This is not law enforcement. It is state violence. It is simply indefensible, and ICE must be held accountable.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Klobuchar, who is reportedly considering a run for Minnesota governor after Walz dropped his bid for a third term, said the shooting was \"the result of the administration sending federal agents onto our streets against the wishes of local law enforcement.\" \"While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe,\" the senator added. Several Democrat lawmakers from outside Minnesota have also weighed in. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the shooting \"absolutely horrific\" and accused multiple Trump administration officials, including the president, of lying about the incident. Additionally, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani accused the ICE officer of committing murder.
