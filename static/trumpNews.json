Camden had its first murder-free summer in 50 years. We drove down crime, took violent offenders off the streets, caught terrorists, and put away child predators,” Habba wrote, highlighting the Trump administration's achievements in the city.The 41-year-old lawyer went on to say that while she was focusing on delivering real results, judges in New Jersey “took advantage of a flawed blue slip tradition and became weapons for the politicized left”.“For months, these judges stopped conducting trials and entering sentences, leaving violent criminals on the streets. They joined New Jersey senators, who care more about fighting President Trump than the well being of residents which they serve,” Habba explained.Trump's former lawyer further said that she was relinquishing the post and stepping down “to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love.”“But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,” she asserted, adding, “I will continue to serve the Department of Justice as the Senior Advisor to the Attorney General for U.S. Attorneys.”Habba's history of serving TrumpA New Jersey-born lawyer, Habba served as Trump's legal spokesperson and as a senior advisor for his super PAC MAGA, Inc. from 2021 to 2025.Shortly after being hired into Trump's legal team in 2021, Habba filed a $100 million lawsuit against The New York Times, three of its reporters, and the current US President's niece Mary L Trump.The 41-year-old lawyer was also among the attorneys who represented Trump and his co-defendants in the lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The lawsuit accused the current US President and the Trump Organization of falsely representing the value of their assets for economic benefit, and landed Trump and defendants from his company a nearly $500 million fraud liability, which they are appealing.She also defended Trump in the second defamation lawsuit brought by author E Jean Carroll, who claimed to have been sexually abused by Trump in the 1990s. While Trump denied the charges, Carroll initiated defamation proceedings, and the two lawsuits resulted in her being awarded $88.3 million in damages. Both, however, are under appeal.Habba was also famously involved in a lawsuit filed by Trump against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, and others, alleging a conspiracy to rig the 2016 US Presidential Election. The case, however, was dismissed, and Habba and others were sanctioned by a court for filing a frivolous lawsuit.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trump-aide-alina-habba-to-step-down-as-us-attorney-for-new-jersey-after-court-ruling-11765220008642.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/08/1600x900/logo/USA-TRUMP-HABBA-0_1764604299201_1764604310068_1765220234025.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 18:57:41","author":"Shiladitya Ray","authors":["Shiladitya Ray"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":386310456,"title":"Ja-Cirt analysts win top honours at ‘SheSecures’ cybersecurity competition","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister of State in the Ministry of National Security and Peace, Juliet Cuthbert Flynnand Resident Representative of the Organization of American States (OAS) Office of the General Secretariat in Jamaica, Jeanelle van Glannen Weygel (front row, third left), join winners of the ‘SheSecures’ Jamaica Cybersecurity Competition for a photo opportunity during the recent awards ceremony at the University of the West Indies (UWI) Regional Headquarters in Mona, St Andrew. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 8, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Ja-Cirt analysts win top honours at ‘SheSecures’ cybersecurity competition \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Monique Satchwell and Rheana Hagigal are more than just work colleagues. Both young women, Tier Two National Security Operations Centre Analysts at the Jamaica Cyber Incident Response Team (Ja-CIRT), recently won first place in the overall team category of the ‘SheSecures’ Jamaica Cybersecurity Competition, beating out dozens of teams from across the country.\n\nThe competition, which was undertaken in partnership with the Ministry of National Security and Peace and the Organization of American States (OAS), is designed to provide Jamaican women and girls, aged 16 and older, with hands-on cybersecurity training, while testing and sharpening their technical skills.\n\nIt also aims to empower more women and girls in the growing cybersecurity sector, thereby bolstering Jamaica’s cyber resilience.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, cybersecurity is considered the second fastest-growing skill category, behind artificial intelligence and big data.\n\n“Take courage; you’re talented… talent knows no gender; don’t be afraid,” Satchwell urged, noting that women make up only a small fraction of the workforce in the male-dominated profession.\n\nHagigal told JIS News that her love and fascination with technology began in high school, driven by her conviction that the future would be shaped and powered by a rapidly digitalising world.\n\n“I did cyber-security and digital forensics in university. I knew that the future was going to be cybersecurity, because everything is now digitalised. So that’s why I chose that path, because that’s the way the future is going,” she shared.\n\nSatchwell discovered her passion for the profession during her studies at the University of the West Indies (UWI).\n\n“I wasn’t always into security. I was an actuarial science major… so math is where I was primarily. But for some reason, computers really got my interest, so I ended up switching to a computer science major. After that, I started to learn about the cybersecurity field and I became very intrigued with that and I said to myself, ‘why not?’… so here am I,” she said.\n\nSatchwell further noted that people often focus on technology itself, while overlooking the critical need to secure it.\n\nIn preparing for the competition, both women recalled the sleepless nights, the unwavering partnership, and the intensive training sessions.\n\n“I’m proud of us. It was very rigorous… but it was well done,” Satchwell said.\n\nHagigal also shared: “This really means a lot. We trained, practised, and then we persevered.”\n\n“We did a week’s training. We actually partnered with the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) for our trainings, but we did some personal training here and there. When I left the JDF, I went home and I practised as well… two to three hours more,” she adds.\n\nAnother Ja-CIRT team distinguished itself by securing second place in the competition, represented by members Zoe Duncan and Daneel Downer.\n\nThird place was awarded to La-Shawn Richards and Donishe Williams of the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA).\n\nIn the school category, Giselle Duncan of Immaculate Conception High School captured first place, followed by Jessica Lewis of Northern Caribbean University (NCU) in second place, and Rhia Lacroix and Kimberlie Lawes of the University of Technology (UTech) in third.\n\nIn the individual category, Kelleshia Fender of MOCA emerged as the top-scoring solo competitor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: cyber security technology women in Stem \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Truck driver charged with murder of St Andrew businessman \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 8, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 35-year-old truck driver has been charged with the murder of St Andrew businessman, Khalil Martin.

new sporting spectacle prepares to launch in May 2026 seven new athletes have joined the Enhanced Games including Liberia’s fastest man over 100 metres, Emmanuel Matadi.\n\nMatadi set a 100m National Record of 9.91s in the event in 2024.\n\nHis participation in the Enhanced Games, which will allow athletes to use performance-enhancing drugs to compete and challenge records for large cash prizes, was announced on Monday.\n\nMatadi is the third sprinter confirmed for the Games, after the United States’ Fred Kerley and France’s Mouhamadou Fall.\n\nJoining Matadi are:\n\nPolish National Finalist and Collegiate sprinter Natalia Fryckowska (swimming)\n\nPan American Champion & World Championship Bronze Medalist Beatriz Pirón (weightlifting)\n\nBrazilian World Championship Medalist & Pan Am Gold Medalist Felipe Lima (swimming)\n\nColumbian Olympian & Multiple National Record Holder Isabella Arcila (swimming)\n\nRussian Olympian, World Junior Champion & ACC Champion Evgenii Somov

It also endangered the success of the mission. That is more than enough reason to get rid of him.\n\n“That kind of dangerous incompetence puts everyone at risk. His claim of exoneration is based on the fact that he has the authority to declassify information, and he is deeming it declassified because he went through this reckless step of texting it out on Signal to a journalist and family members and others.\n\n“But the threat to our service members and to the mission remained whatever you call it. That material was classified before he sent it out, and I think it was classified when he did. So, there needs to be some accountability, or other people are going to be put in harm’s way,” Schiff said.\n\nHe called on the Trump administration to publicly release the full video of the second attack on survivors of the suspected drug-trafficking boat in the Caribbean Sea in early September, stating that he and his colleagues will call for a War Powers Resolution to force a debate and vote in the US Congress that would block the use of US forces in hostilities against or within Venezuela, if Trump should follow through on his threat to strike Venezuela on land “very soon.”\n\nSchiff stressed that the US military continued strikes on suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean Sea are “unauthorised and illegal.\n\n“They’re unlawful. They’re unconstitutional, and killing two people who are shipwrecked at sea is also morally repugnant.”\n\nSchiff said, while he agrees that the US “should do everything lawfully” to stop the scourge of drugs coming into the country, the boat strikes are “not at all lawful or constitutional.\n\n“And, frankly, if the Pentagon and our defence secretary is so proud of what they’re doing, let the American people see that video. Let the American people see two people standing on a capsized boat or sitting on a capsized boat and deliberately killed and decide for themselves whether they’re proud of what the country is doing. I can’t imagine people will be proud of that.”\n\nSchiff said the manual on the law of war “makes it explicit that killing people who are shipwrecked is illegal, is a violation of law. They’re a form of extrajudicial killing.\n\n“These boats are not invading the United States in an armed assault. They are thousands of miles away. Some of them, maybe even this vessel —if reports are accurate — wasn’t even heading to the United States.\n\n“And for us to be engaged in this kind of unauthorised campaign of extrajudicial killing couldn’t be, I think, a more clear violation of the law.”\n\nThe US lawmaker said the American people don’t want to go to war with Venezuela.\n\nSchiff predicted that more legislators may support the third War Powers Resolution that he plans to introduce soon, as more legislators are able to view footage of the boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: boat strikes Caribbean death United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tsunami affects north Japan following magnitude 7.5 earthquake \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 8, 2025 \n\n\n TOKYO, Japan — A tsunami was triggered in Japan late Monday after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck off the northern coast of the country, injuring mo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Digicel to resume service disconnections Tuesday \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 8, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Telecommunications provider Digicel has announced it will resume normal billing processes and service disruptions for non-payment ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DLW Foundation gives back to St Elizabeth \n\n\n\n\n Howard Campbell \n\n\n\nDecember 8, 2025 \n\n\n St Elizabeth means the world to Gurvan Whitely.

Her former duties will, for now, be split between three Justice Department lawyers.\n\nMs. Habba, 41, was appointed in March to serve a temporary term as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law.\n\nRepresenting Trump\n\nOnce a partner in a small New Jersey law firm, Ms. Habba was among Mr. Trump’s most visible legal defenders before his return to the White House, representing him in court and frequently appearing on cable TV news on his behalf.\n\nBut she had a partisan bent and no experience as a prosecutor. New Jersey’s two Democratic senators indicated they would block her confirmation in the U.S. Senate.\n\nShe brought a trespassing charge, eventually dropped, against the Democratic mayor of Newark, New Jersey, stemming from his visit to an immigration detention centre. Habba later charged Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting a federal agent during the same incident. Ms. McIver says she didn't assault anyone. The case is pending. \n\n‘Horrible thing’: Trump reacts\n\nAsked about Ms. Habba’s resignation on Monday, Mr. Trump lashed out at the Senate over its tradition of refusing to act on nominees if they are opposed by the senators representing the state involved.\n\n“It’s a horrible thing. It makes it impossible to appoint a judge or a U.S. attorney,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"I guess I just have to keep appointing people for three months and then just appoint another one, another one. It’s a very sad situation. We’re losing a lot of great people.”\n\nWhen Ms. Habba's term expired in July, a panel of federal judges appointed one of her subordinates to the role. But Ms. Bondi promptly fired the replacement, blaming Ms. Habba’s removal on “politically minded judges.”\n\nA lower-court judge’s finding that Ms. Habba was unlawfully serving in the position soon triggered a monthslong legal standoff, prompting confusion and delays within New Jersey’s federal court system.\n\nThen, earlier this month, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia disqualified her from serving in the role, writing in their opinion that “the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.”\n\nMr. Trump's critics say he has been exploiting legally questionable loopholes to put unqualified loyalists in jobs that require U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nMs. Bondi said Ms. Habba will return as U.S. attorney if the administration's court appeals are successful.\n\n“These judges should not be able to countermand the President’s choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch’s core responsibility of prosecuting crime,” she said.\n\nOther prosecutors challenged\n\nBesides Ms. Habba, several other Trump administration prosecutors have had their appointments as U.S. attorneys challenged including those in eastern Virginia, Nevada, Los Angeles and northern New York.\n\nIn Virginia, a judge dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the interim U.S. attorney who filed the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.\n\nIn September and October, federal judges disqualified the acting U.S. attorneys in Nevada and Southern California, Sigal Chattah and Bill Essayli, saying they had stayed in the temporary jobs longer than allowed by law.\n\nOn Thursday, another federal judge heard an argument by New York Attorney General Letitia James that the administration also twisted the law to make John Sarcone the acting U.S. attorney for northern New York.","summary":"Alina Habba is one of several acting U.S. attorneys around the country to have their appointments by the Trump administration challenged on the basis that they stayed in the temporary jobs longer than the law allows.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-former-lawyer-alina-habba-resigns-as-us-attorney-for-new-jersey-after-court-ruling/article70374700.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ybysc2/article70374702.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_New_Jersey_Prosecutor_95720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 01:19:33","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":386312358,"title":"Honduras resumes releasing election results, Trump-backed Asfura maintains lead","text":"Honduras’ conservative National Party candidate Nasry Asfura, backed by Donald Trump, edged ahead in the count of the Central American nation’s presidential election on Monday (December 8, 2025), in an extended process marked by delays and accusations of fraud. \n\nWith 97% of the ballots tallied, Mr. Asfura, a 67-year-old former Tegucigalpa Mayor, had 40.52% of the vote as election officials resumed releasing updated results for the November 30 vote, leading his closest competitor by just 42,100 votes. Salvador Nasralla, a television host and three-time presidential hopeful, trailed with 39.18%. The two have repeatedly traded the lead during the count, but on Monday (December 8) afternoon Mr. Asfura’s lead began to widen slightly. Rixi Moncada, the ruling Libre Party’s candidate and a former leftist Minister, was in third place with 19.32%, roughly half the support of her two main rivals.\n\n“After carrying out the necessary technical actions [with external auditing], the data is now being updated in the results,” Ana Paola Hall, president of the National Electoral Council (CNE), said on X.\n\nShe urged candidates to remain alert and file any legal challenges as required. The count was frozen on Friday afternoon with some 88% of the ballots processed. About 16% of tally sheets showed inconsistencies and will be reviewed, according to the CNE.\n\nThe prolonged count has prompted international election monitors to call on Honduran authorities to speed up the process and take steps to restore public confidence in the results.\n\nMr. Nasralla has alleged fraud, while Ms. Moncada has demanded the annulment of the entire election and said her party is calling for protests and strikes.\n\nOn Monday, streets in Tegucigalpa and other cities remained calm. But memories linger of the contested 2017 vote, when security forces opened fire on protesters, killing at least 16 people, according to a U.N. report. About 30 people were killed in total as mass protests swept the country.\n\nThe November 30 vote unfolded peacefully, according to independent observers. But the release of results has been chaotic, with fluctuations fueling frustration over the tight race. CNE officials have blamed the company behind the tabulation platform for the slow count.\n\nTrump factor\n\nThe election has been further complicated by the involvement of Mr. Trump, who has strongly backed Mr. Asfura and alleged fraud earlier on during the count. He also signaled he could cut funds to Honduras should another candidate win. Days before voting began, Trump also announced he would pardon a former president of Mr. Asfura’s National Party: Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. after being convicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges. \n\nOn Monday, Honduras’ attorney general said he had issued an international warrant for Hernandez’ arrest. His wife, who maintains his innocence, said last week he would not immediately return to Honduras for security reasons and was in a “safe place” in the U.S.","summary":"With 97% of the ballots tallied, Asfura, a 67-year-old former Tegucigalpa mayor, had 40.52% of the vote as election officials resumed releasing updated results for the November 30 vote","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/honduras-president-election-results-update-nasry-asfura-december-9-2025/article70374704.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/scg8hp/article70374705.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-08T183002Z_652948337_RC27CIAAHC3S_RTRMADP_3_HONDURAS-ELECTION.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 01:13:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":386312364,"title":"Homan Defends Operations Against Illegal Somalis In Minnesota","text":"The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown on Somalis in Minnesota is targeted at illegal immigrants and felons, White House border czar Tom Homan said in a Dec. 7 interview with CNN, dismissing concerns of unjust targeting.\n\n“There’s a large illegal Somali community there … if you’re a U.S. citizen, you will have nothing to fear. We’re looking for criminal aliens. And, also, if you’re a resident alien, you have a felony conviction, by statute, you could be set up for deportation,” he said.\n\nHoman said authorities don’t know how many illegal Somalis there are in Minnesota, citing the more than 2 million gotaways who entered the United States under the Biden administration.\n\nGotaways are illegal immigrants who successfully evade Border Patrol and law enforcement after crossing the border and end up residing all across the United States. These people were detected by authorities but could not be vetted, Homan said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is fixing the previous four years of open border policies, he added, stating that authorities were going to focus on illegal alien public safety threats in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Twin Cities region.\n\n“And if they weren’t a sanctuary city, I mean, many of these people would be apprehended in the safety and security of the county jail. But because they’re a sanctuary city, we have got to send more resources there to flood the zone, because it takes a whole team to find somebody in the community, where it would take one agent arrest one bad guy in a county jail,” Homan said.\n\nSanctuary jurisdictions are places where local or state officials refuse to enforce federal immigration laws or cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Minnesota is one of the states that follow such sanctuary policies, according to an Aug. 5 statement from the Department of Justice.\n\nHoman dismissed accusations that agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stop people just because they look Somali.\n\nICE agents undergo Fourth Amendment training every six months, he said, adding that Border Patrol also undergoes such training. The Fourth Amendment protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by government authorities.\n\n the border czar said.\n\nHoman was asked about Trump’s allegedly referring to Somali migrants in the United States as “garbage.”\n\nThe president’s statement triggered opposition from Democrats.\n\nResponding to the controversy, Homan said Trump was “referring to public safety threats and national security threats from Somalia and every other country.”\n\n“I mean, he’s been clear from day one,” he said.\n\nHoman said he was “not aware what President Trump was thinking when he said that” in response to whether Trump’s statement covered the entire Somali community.\n\nSome of the countries from where illegal immigrants are flowing into America “don’t have the databases we have,” Homan said, adding that they don’t “even do the proper checks before they issue a passport to their citizens.”\n\nWhen asked about “aggressive tactics” employed by ICE, Homan said there was a significant uptick in violence against law enforcement officials.\n\n“Threats on ICE officers are up 1200 percent. They’re being doxxed on social media. They’re getting death threats every day. They have been attacked. They have been shot at,” Homan said.\n\n“And these officers are out there looking for the worst of the worst. So they’re protecting themselves. And I think they’re following the law. And if any ICE officer or Border Patrol agent acts out of policy or does something inappropriate, they will be held accountable.\n\nICE Enforcement\n\nThere are nearly 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota, according to data from Minnesota Compass, a social indicators project. The Minneapolis–Saint Paul Twin Cities region accounted for around 78 percent of Somali immigrants in the state.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Trump announced he was rescinding the temporary protected status for Somali immigrants living in Minnesota.\n\n“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social, while suggesting that Minnesota was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized ongoing ICE operations in the Twin Cities.\n\n“We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem,” he said in a Dec. 2 post on X.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said a string of arrests had been made as part of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, detaining individuals considered the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.”\n\nAssistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused local officials of instituting sanctuary policies, allowing “pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets and terrorize Americans.”\n\nMany of the individuals arrested as part of the immigration crackdown are Somali nationals.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/homan-defends-operations-against-illegal-somalis-minnesota","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/image%20%2834%29.jpg?h=5ef2ba8e&amp;itok=aAYRSA5n","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.529},{"id":386312272,"title":"Thailand-Cambodia fighting spreads along contested border","text":"BANGKOK/PHNOM PENH - Thailand said it was taking action to expel Cambodian forces from its territory on Dec 9, as renewed fighting between the two South-east Asian neighbours spread along ‍the ​disputed border.\n\nEach side has blamed the other for the clashes, which ‍have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July.\n\nCambodia's ​Defence Ministry ​said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six.

The bureau notched a major success by announcing the long-awaited arrest of a suspect in the placing of pipe bombs, neither of which exploded, outside the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the Republican and Democratic National Committees on January 5, 2021.\n\nStill, the arrest presented a complication for the Trump administration. The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., reportedly recently told investigators that he was a Donald Trump supporter who believed Trump’s bogus claims of fraud in the 2020 election. But various people in conservative media and politics have insisted for years that the pipe bombs were actually planned or placed by the government in order to make Trump look bad—which was why no one had been apprehended.\n\nOne of the most prominent backers of that claim was the podcaster and radio host Dan Bongino. Even the Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of the administration’s most sycophantic pundits, had to point this out during an interview on Thursday night, noting that before joining the FBI, Bongino had called the bombs an “inside job.” Bongino’s answer was astonishing.\n\n“I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions, that’s clear, and one day I will be back in that space—but that’s not what I’m paid for now,” he said. “I’m paid to be your deputy director, and we base investigations on facts.”\n\nSome liberal critics have been braying for years that the conservative press is full of hacks who will say anything in order to froth up their audience, regardless of truth. (Rage bait isn’t just the word of this year.) This criticism can feel shamelessly partisan and uncharitable. And yet, here Bongino is, blithely admitting that in his case, the critics are right: He was saying things he didn’t have evidence for and maybe didn’t even believe.\n\nThe problem here is not that Bongino is engaging in punditry. When properly done, pundits make arguments—like the one I am making here—based on facts and reasoning. Bongino, by his own account, was doing something else entirely: He was telling his audience that a claim (that the bombing was an inside job) was a fact, when it was not only not true but also not based on any real circumstantial evidence.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Bongino’s prior pundit life has complicated his current role as No. 2 at the FBI. While working as a podcaster, Bongino frequently discussed Jeffrey Epstein and questioned the official narrative about his prosecution and death, which was ruled a suicide. Since joining the FBI, however, he has endorsed many of the Epstein claims he ridiculed.\n\nNor is this the first time that a major conservative figure has admitted that they’re just making stuff up. In a 2019 lawsuit, a woman who alleged a sexual relationship with Trump sued Fox News for defaming her by accusing her of extorting the president. Fox News’s lawyers argued—and convinced a judge—that the then-host Tucker Carlson couldn’t be held liable, because he was not “stating actual facts” and instead engaging in “exaggeration” and “non-literal commentary.” There are other words for this. Lying is one of them.\n\nWhat Fox News said in court, moreover, was not what it broadcast on air. During his show, Carlson didn’t simply offer opinions—he insisted that they were not opinions. At one point, he prefaced a riff by telling viewers, “Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed.” Really, they weren’t even facts.\n\nThe revolving door between conservative media and Republican administrations—especially the second Trump administration—might explain why the same behavior also pops up from spokespeople. During the first Trump administration, then–Press Secretary Sarah Sanders claimed that “countless” FBI agents had told the White House that they had lost faith in FBI Director James Comey prior to his firing. This was true only insofar as the agents literally could not be counted: Sanders admitted to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team that her statement was “not founded on anything.” In another instance, she dismissed a false claim that she’d made in the briefing room with a self-negating “I’m an honest person.” (She is now the governor of Arkansas.)\n\nNo party has a monopoly on lying, but the right has an unusual habit of happily admitting to spreading nonsense. In 2011, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a Republican, said that abortion accounted for “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” Putting a faux-precise number on a false claim is a classic technique for trying to make the claim seem more legitimate, but that kind of statement also attracts scrutiny; Politifact has the real number closer to 12 percent. Kyl’s office explained away his remark by saying that it was “not intended to be a factual statement,” which is perhaps true in a deeper sense than intended: He had no interest in reality or in conveying it accurately to the public.\n\nThe right’s worst factual offenders are forced to make these kinds of admissions all the time, which one might think would undermine their credibility among their audiences. But thanks to our siloed media environment, these statements are usually made in places—federal court, mainstream media, left-of-center outlets—where Tucker Carlson and Dan Bongino fans don’t tread. What is unusual about Bongino’s admission last week is that he made it on Fox News, where right-wing viewers could hear it. Then again, he didn’t seem too worried, given that he told Hannity he’d be back in his old role someday. When that day comes, everyone should know how seriously to take whatever he says.\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nDispatches \n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nLife for 30-Somethings Is Getting More Stressful\n\nBy Faith Hill\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nExplore.

The statement does, however, contain one theological error about the Incarnation. It says God became man when Christ was born, although Catholic doctrine recognizes God becoming man at the Incarnation: when Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary’s womb.\n\n“Today, I recognize every American celebrating Dec. 8 as a holy day honoring the faith, humility, and love of Mary, mother of Jesus and one of the greatest figures in the Bible,” the statement said. Trump, who is not Catholic and describes himself as a nondenominational Christian, has forged strong bonds with a broad range of Christians and referenced religious holidays and symbols in ways that resonate with supporters.\n\nCNA could not find similar proclamations on the Immaculate Conception from other presidents, including none from the only two Catholic presidents: John F. Kennedy and Joe Biden. Other presidents have spoken about Mary and the Immaculate Conception, sometimes in messages relating to Christmas or other topics, but not in a formal recognition of this feast.\n\n“On the feast of the Immaculate Conception, Catholics celebrate what they believe to be Mary’s freedom from original sin as the mother of God,” the statement read.\n\nThe feast day celebrates the miracle in which Mary was conceived without the stain of original sin. Every person — with the exception of Mary and Jesus Christ — receives the hereditary stain of original sin, which was brought onto humanity through the first sin of Adam and Eve when they disobeyed God by eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.\n\nMary’s Importance to Humanity and the United States\n\nThe presidential statement said Mary’s agreement at the Annunciation to conceive and bear Christ was “one of the most profound and consequential acts of history,” and Mary “heroically accepted God’s will with trust and humility.” \n\nIt cites Luke 1:38: “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.” \n\n“Mary’s decision forever altered the course of humanity,” the statement read, adding that Christ “would go on to offer his life on the Cross for the redemption of sins and the salvation of the world.”\n\nPresident Trump's statement also describes the Annunciation by the archangel Gabriel, who calls the Blessed Mother “favored one” and tells her, “You will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.”\n\nLater in the document, the presidential message says that “we remember the sacred words that have brought aid, comfort, and support to generations of American believers in times of need” and includes the text of the Hail Mary.\n\nTrump's statement also acknowledges the “distinct role” Mary has played “in our great American story.”\n\nThe president's statement also specifically references Bishop John Carroll’s consecration of the United States to the Blessed Mother. Carroll was the only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence. In addition, the statement references the annual Mass of thanksgiving in New Orleans on Jan. 8, in which Catholics celebrate Mary’s perceived assistance to U.S. troops under the command of Gen. Andrew Jackson in winning the Battle of New Orleans.\n\nThe message notes that “American legends,” including St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, St. Frances Xavier Cabrini and Venerable Fulton Sheen, “held a deep devotion to Mary,” and that many American churches, hospitals, universities and schools bear her name. It adds that many Americans will also celebrate Our Lady of Guadalupe on Dec. 12.\n\n“As we approach 250 years of glorious American independence, we acknowledge and give thanks, with total gratitude, for Mary’s role in advancing peace, hope, and love in America and beyond our shores,” the presidential message reads.\n\nThe presidential message also recognizes Pope Benedict XV dedicating a statue of Mary, Queen of Peace, to encourage Christians “to look to her example of peace by praying for a stop to the horrific slaughter” occurring in World War I, which then ended just a few months later.\n\n“Today, we look to Mary once again for inspiration and encouragement as we pray for an end to war and for a new and lasting era of peace, prosperity, and harmony in Europe and throughout the world,” Trump’s statement added.\n\nCatholics React to Trump’s Message\n\nChad Pecknold, a political science professor at The Catholic University of America, said he welcomed the president’s recognition of the feast day.\n\n“The more America publicly honors Christian feast days such as Christmas, Good Friday and Easter, and the more we remember our greatest saints, as well as our national heroes, the better oriented our nation will be to God,” he said. “This is the spiritual key to raising up the Res Americana for the next 250 years.”\n\nSusan Hanssen, a history professor at the University of Dallas (a Catholic institution), called the presidential message “a jaw-droppingly historic event.” For a president to celebrate Mary as “full of grace” and celebrate “the centrality of the Incarnation,” she said, “goes beyond anything that Americans have ever heard in presidential public speeches.”\n\n“This pronouncement, along with the first American pope in world history, marks a watershed moment in American cultural history,” Hanssen said. \n\nCaleb Henry, a political science professor at Franciscan University, told CNA that Trump’s message appears to be an extension of the president’s America Prays campaign, which asks Americans to pray for the country ahead of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year.\n\nHenry said the initiative seeks to “reconnect America’s people of faith with ... the signing of the Declaration of Independence.” He said the Immaculate Conception statement appears to be “a message to America’s Catholic faithful” that the country’s history, “while complicated, is rooted in these truths of natural law, laws of nature, and of nature’s God.”\n\n“We have a Marian tradition here in our country as well,” he said. \n\nThe statement comes as the nation's Catholic bishops have welcomed some of Trump’s policies, such as regarding gender ideology. Bishops also have expressed dismay about indiscriminate immigration enforcement and a plan to expand in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a unified special pastoral message against “indiscriminate mass deportations” on Nov. 12.\n\nHenry said a message like the one issued on the Immaculate Conception is “a typical Trump move” by “ignoring all existing hierarchies and going straight to the people.”\n\nTheological Error in the Message\n\nThe statement contains a theological error. After discussing the Annunciation, the message states, “nine months later, God became man when Mary gave birth to a son, Jesus.”\n\nChrist became man at the moment of the Incarnation, when he was conceived in the womb of Mary (“conceived solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary,” as the Catechism of the Catholic Church explains in No. 496), not when he was born. \n\nDominican Father Aquinas Guilbeau told CNA that although early councils clarified this teaching, the misunderstanding “endures today.” He said: “Even among Christians, sadly. It remains a favorite of poets.” \n\nHe noted that even in Silent Night, the verse that says “Jesus, Lord, at thy birth” falls into this error because: “Jesus is Lord before his birth. He is Lord at his conception.”\n\nFather Guilbeau said, “Wherever it appears, the error may be pious and well-intentioned, but it remains theologically inaccurate.”\n\nRegister staff added to this report.","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/trump-2025-immaculate-conception-message","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20251208181228_f46d1dce8816c411eebb0469a7716ca24a852373a18ed20bfe83dc34f9ed2fea.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:51:34","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.593},{"id":386310814,"title":"Indiana state senators advance GOP-drawn congressional map, setting up a final vote","text":"A committee of Indiana state lawmakers advanced a Republican-drawn congressional map Monday, sending it to the floor of the state Senate, where its outcome remains uncertain. After more than six hours of testimony, the map passed out of the committee on a 6-3 vote, with one Republican, Sen. Greg Walker, joining with two Democrats in opposition. Half of the Republicans who voted \"yes\" suggested they did so to ensure a full vetting of the legislation on the Senate floor and hinted that their votes may change after further debate. The map, which passed the House last week, is designed to net the GOP two seats in next year's midterm elections. The Senate is expected to vote on it this week. The new district lines were drawn at the urging of President Donald Trump, who has been pressuring Republican legislators across the country to enact maps that shore up the party's narrow U.S. House majority. But while Republicans in states like Texas, Missouri and North Carolina went along with Trump's wishes, Senate GOP leaders in Indiana have been resisting a mid-decade redistricting push for months, repeatedly saying there are not enough votes to pass a new map. The White House and national Republicans have continued to escalate their pressure campaign. Trump has said he would back primary challengers to any Indiana Republicans who oppose the redrawn map. \"Why would a REAL Republican vote against this when the Dems have been doing it for years???,\" Trump posed on Truth Social over the weekend. \"If they stupidly say no, vote them out of Office — They are not worthy — And I will be there to help!\" The increased attention has led to an uptick in threats and harassment against lawmakers in the state. At least 11 elected Republicans in Indiana have been the victims of “swatting” attempts, in which false police reports are made to draw responses from law enforcement, since Trump called on them to enact a new map. Walker, the lone Republican on the panel who voted against the map, gave lengthy and tearful remarks about the national influence being exerted on the Legislature, the threats that he and other lawmakers have faced and his concerns about the constitutionality of the map. “I fear for this institution, I fear for the state of Indiana, I fear for all states if we allow intimidation, threats to become the norm,\" he said. Walker had said he won't seek re-election next year, though he suggested the redistricting fight has made him consider running again. More than 100 people filed into a packed committee hearing room Monday to testify about the map, which seeks to carve up Indiana's two Democratic-controlled districts and give Republicans all nine seats. Marion County Clerk Kate Sweeney Bell, a Democrat, said that it was not feasible to implement the new map ahead of the election and that it would cost more than $1 million. “There is not enough time to complete the process,” she said, adding that important precinct data was missing from the bill. Megan Robertson, testifying on behalf of Indiana Conservation Voters, argued the map divides communities in \"ridiculous\" ways. “I grew up in Porter County, which this map splits in half and then divides us from our friends right next door in Lake County. Now I live in Indianapolis, which this map splits in fourths,\" she said. “The people who drew these maps, who are apparently in Washington, D.C., and have never been to our state, may not know how ridiculous these things may be, but everyone in this room understands it.” After Republicans were criticized for not defending their map in a House committee hearing last week, several people testified in support of the proposal Monday. “Just a hair over 60% of all Indiana voters in 2024 elected the current president to a four-year term. That’s the only poll that matters,” said Gregory Katter, a resident of Marion County. “Having a Speaker Johnson over a Speaker Jeffries makes a difference. It’s a choice between the president your voters elected 60 to 40 having a full term or being a lame duck fighting endless nonsense impeachments and investigations for the last half.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/indiana-state-senators-advance-gop-drawn-congressional-map-rcna247996","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251201-indiana-redistricting-protest-mn-0935-f30c68.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:48:52","author":"Jane C.

He said imports were challenging domestic producers and reiterated his intent to address the issue.Trump said he would \"take care\" of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. \"They shouldn't be dumping,\" Trump said. \"I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.\"He also suggested possible tariff measures on fertiliser coming from Canada to encourage local production. \"A lot of it does come in from Canada, and so we'll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to, because that's the way you want to bolster here,\" he said, adding, \"And we can do it here. We can all do that here.\"The comments came amid ongoing economic pressures, including concerns about inflation and consumer prices. Farmers, a key support base for Trump, have faced rising costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies.Negotiations with both Canada and India aimed at stabilising trade ties have encountered difficulties. Earlier this year, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, citing trade barriers and energy purchases. A US delegation is expected to visit India this week for further talks, although no major breakthrough is anticipated.Trump has also previously raised tariff concerns with Canada, including threats to increase duties on products not covered by the North American trade deal. Recent statements have suggested the possibility of revisiting the agreement itself.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-should-not-be-dumping-rice-trump-signals-fresh-tariffs-as-us-farmers-decry-cheap-imports/articleshow/125854789.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125854946/125854946.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:46:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.013},{"id":386309996,"title":"MAGA senator refuses to rule out voting for Dem health care bill if GOP fails to offer one","text":"With a deadline fast approaching for the Senate to vote on the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, far-right Sen.

His previous multiyear contract was set to expire in May 2026.\nThe news is likely welcome to Kimmel, 58, whose future at ABC was thrown into question in September after he was briefly removed from the air following comments he made after the shooting death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.\n\"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on-air, after mocking president Donald Trump’s response to the shooting by praising his multi-billion dollar White House ballroom.\nKimmel was then removed after Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, publicly threatened ABC, Disney and Kimmel in response to the host’s monologue.\nAfter Kimmel’s suspension, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to praise the decision.\n“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” he wrote at the time. “Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible,” Trump also wrote. “That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.”\nAfter six days off the air, Kimmel returned to his show on September 23, 2025.\n\"It’s been overwhelming.

Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.”\nThe president continued, “He is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings.”\nKimmel’s return to the air in September brought in a reported 6.26 million viewers, despite the fact that major media groups Sinclair and Nexstar did not air the episode, making it the “highest regularly scheduled episode in over 10 years.” During his six days off the air, Disney+ is said to have lost 1.7 million subscriptions, per Mashable.","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jimmy-kimmel-signs-1-year-jimmy-kimmel-live-extension-after-suspension/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/jimmy-kimel-2213132736.jpg?crop=0px%2C242px%2C2328px%2C1316px&resize=1200%2C675&quality=74&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:37:26","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":386307350,"title":"Paramount counters Netflix with US$108B hostile bid for Warner Bros","text":"Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nParamount's bid would include acquisition of Warner Bros.

U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston sided with a group of 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in finding that agencies had failed to sufficiently explain why they had indefinitely paused all federal approvals of wind-energy projects. Saris, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said an indefinite halt on issuing or denying all authorizations related to wind projects violates a statutory requirement that agencies proceed to conclude matters presented to them \"within a reasonable time.\" The U.S. Departments of the Interior and Commerce as well as the Environmental Protection Agency had been implementing a directive Trump made on his first day back in office to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop issuing permits, leases and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects. New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose state led the legal challenge, called the ruling \"a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis\" in a social media post.Live Events Interior Department and White House officials were not immediately available for comment. An offshore wind energy trade group welcomed the ruling. \"Overturning the unlawful blanket halt to offshore wind permitting activities is needed to achieve our nation's energy and economic priorities of bringing more power online quickly, improving grid reliability, and driving billions of new American steel manufacturing and shipbuilding investments,\" Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said in a statement. Trump has sought to boost government support for fossil fuels and maximize output in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, after campaigning for the presidency on the refrain of \"drill, baby, drill.\" The states, led by New York, sued in May, after the Interior Department ordered Norway's Equinor to halt construction on its Empire Wind offshore wind project off the coast of New York. While the administration allowed work on Empire Wind to resume, the states say the broader pause on permitting and leasing continues to have harmful economic effects. The states said the agencies implementing Trump's order never said why they were abruptly changing longstanding policy supporting wind energy development. The agencies also departed from government findings that wind projects can proceed with minimal adverse effects on the environment, the states said. Saris agreed, saying the policy \"constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies' issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects.\" She said the agencies never provided a reasoned explanation for adopting the change. \"Indeed, the Agency Defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the President's direction to do so,\" Saris wrote.

Dhillon said in a statement. “We are committed to upholding our federal civil rights laws so that no one is subject to unconstitutional mistreatment when held in state custody.”\n\nThe Justice Department, in a letter Monday to Gov. Jared Polis, said the investigation will determine whether Colorado engaged in a “pattern or practice of violating the constitutional rights of prisoners held at DOC facilities by failing to provide adequate medical care and safe and sanitary physical conditions of confinement, and whether Colorado violates the rights of detainees by failing to protect youth in DYS facilities from use of excessive force and failing to provide adequate nutrition to detainees.\n\n“The Department will also consider whether Colorado violates prisoners’ and detainees’ right to free exercise of religion by housing biological males in units designated for females,” the letter continued.\n\nA Polis spokesperson could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\nThe government’s investigation comes on the heels of The Denver Post’s reporting about the conditions inside the state’s juvenile detention facilities.\n\nLast month, 10 parents told The Post that their kids were losing concerning amounts of weight at the Youthful Offender System facility in Pueblo due to a lack of food. One individual, a 22-year-old, was hospitalized after going into renal failure due to malnourishment, his family said.\n\nThe allegations prompted state correctional staff to change inmate privileges concerning the purchase of food.\n\nIn March, The Post found internal, nonpublic critical incident reports showed rampant allegations of excessive force by staff members at the state’s youth detention and commitment facilities, serious injuries sustained by teens while being physically restrained, a litany of illicit drugs entering secure facilities, and several allegations of staff members engaging in sexual relationships with youth in their care.\n\nThe Division of Youth Services in August removed all youth serving sentences at the Lookout Mountain Youth Services Center in Golden over what staff and advocates called deteriorating safety conditions.\n\nThe Justice Department’s announcement also comes on the heels of Colorado officials denying President Donald Trump’s request to move former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters from a state facility to a federal prison. A federal court on Monday denied Peters’ latest request to leave prison. She’s currently serving a nine-year sentence on election-related charges.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for Peters’ release, and a senior Justice Department official has said he’s working to free her. After Colorado officials rejected the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ transfer request last month, the president called Polis a “sleazebag” and said Peters had been “unfairly convicted.”\n\nPeters’ attorneys, in court filings, say her health has declined during her time in the Colorado prison.\n\nSign up to get crime news sent straight to your inbox each day.","summary":"The Department of Justice, in a letter to Gov.

Donald Trump exclaims 'I'll be involved in that decision too but...'","text":"Two of the most popular streaming services have agreed to combine, in a move that could change the streaming service landscape.\nNetflix said Friday it will acquire the studio and streaming business of Warner Bros. Discovery, the legacy Hollywood giant behind “Harry Potter” and “Friends,” for $72 billion.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the next 12 to 18 months — after Warner completes its previously-announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal are networks like CNN and Discovery.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Warner Bros. Discovery said in October it was open to selling all or parts of its business.\nHere’s a look at what the two streaming services offer and what might change if the deal completes regulatory hurdles and closes.\nMore from Entertainment SS Rajamouli's 'Varanasi': Mahesh Babu and Priyanka Chopra's film creates history, streaming rights may go for Rs 1000 crore globally Dhurandhar ending, post credit scene explained: What is the real identity of Ranveer Singh's Hamza Netflix\nNetflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is the world’s biggest streaming service, although its growth has slowed from peak years. It stopped giving specific subscriber numbers in 2024, but quarterly results in October signaled its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of 2024.\nAlthough it is best known for its scripted TV shows and movies such as “Stranger Things,” “Squid Game,” “Bridgerton,” and “KPop Demon Hunters,” Netflix has been expanding into other arenas. It started offering a low-priced option of its service with advertising three years ago and has introduced video games and live sports, too.\nIn a statement on Friday Netflix said the acquisition will add shows and movies including “The Big Bang Theory,” “The Sopranos,” “Game of Thrones,” “The Wizard of Oz” and the DC Universe comic book franchise to its library.\nWarner Bros. Discovery\nWarner Bros. Discovery, based in New York, was formed just three years ago after when AT&T spun off WarnerMedia and it was merged with Discovery Communications in a $43 billion deal.\nIn June, the company outlined plans to split its cable and streaming offerings — with HBO, HBO Max, as well as Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, to become part of a new streaming and studios company; while networks like CNN, Discovery and TNT Sports and digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report would make up a separate cable counterpart.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Warner expected the split to be complete by mid-2026, and the Netflix acquisition is expected to close after that.\nThe deal would add classic movies to the Netflix library, including “Casablanca,” “Citizen Kane,” and the Harry Potter franchise.\nWhat Donald Trump has said\n“There’s no question about it,” the American President said, answering questions about the deal and various other topics as he walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n“Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man,” Trump said of Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos, noting that they met in the Oval Office last week before the deal was announced Dec. 5. “I have a lot of respect for him but it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”\nAsked if Netflix should be allowed to buy the Hollywood giant behind “Harry Potter” and HBO Max, the president said, “Well that’s the question.”\n“They have a very big market share and when they have Warner Bros., you know, that share goes up a lot so, I don’t know,” he said. “I’ll be involved in that decision, too. But they have a very big market share”\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Sarandos made no guarantees at their meeting about the merger if it is approved, Trump said, adding that the CEO is a “great person” who has “done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies and other things.”\nHe repeated that a merger would create a “big market share” for the company.\n“There’s no question about it. It could be a problem,” Trump said.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/what-changes-for-subscribers-amid-netflix-buying-warner-bros-for-72-billion-donald-trump-exclaims-ill-be-involved-in-that-decision-too-but-13957892.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/12/image-1764938544992-1-2025-12-df64211f1b2598fe81ab5be018bdf2f1.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:30:54","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.174},{"id":386306212,"title":"Letters: Lawsuit shows Congress must fully fund EPA in budget","text":"Congress must fully\nfund EPA in budget\n\nRe: “Apple, Tesla facing lawsuits” (Page C9, Dec. 4).\n\nThe article about a lawsuit filed against Tesla and Apple for environmental abuses shows that environmental oversight of corporations is vital.\n\nThat’s why members of Climate Hope Affiliates are encouraging our congressional representatives and senators to fund the Environmental Protection Agency as they create a budget for fiscal year 2026.

Is there any doubt that he would do whatever it takes to stay in power once his term is up?\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author David Cay Johnston, who has written books on Trump dating back to the 1980s, has said, years before Trump ever got elected, that if Trump ever became president, he would never leave office peacefully. Trump’s behavior on Jan. 6, 2021, proved that conclusively. Even though the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution clearly states that a president is prohibited from staying in office after being elected twice, it’s all but certain that Trump will initiate a repeat performance of Jan. 6, 2021, once his term is up.\n\nArthur Straus\nWalnut Creek\n\nWith peace plan, Trump\ntakes role of appeaser\n\nRe: “Ukraine faces ‘difficult choice’ over U.S. plan to end war, Zelenskyy says” (Page A7, Nov. 22).\n\nDonald Trump covets a Nobel Peace Prize so much that he’s willing to appease Vladimir Putin in order to end the war in Ukraine.

It’s competing in the Globes’ category for comedy and musicals.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Close on its heels was Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value,” a Norwegian family drama about a filmmaking family. The Neon release’s eight nominations included nods for four of its actors: Stellan Skarsgård, Renate Reinsve, Elle Fanning and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas.\nMore from Entertainment SS Rajamouli's 'Varanasi': Mahesh Babu and Priyanka Chopra's film creates history, streaming rights may go for Rs 1000 crore globally Dhurandhar ending, post credit scene explained: What is the real identity of Ranveer Singh's Hamza The Globe nominations, a tattered but persistent rite in Hollywood, are coming on the heels of the a potentially seismic shift in entertainment. On Friday, Netflix struck a deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for $72 billion. If approved, the deal would reshape Hollywood and put one of its most storied movie studios in the hands of the streaming giant.\nWarner Bros., Netflix and the Golden Globes\nBoth companies are prominent in this year’s awards season. Along with “One Battle After Another,” Warner Bros. has “Sinners,” Ryan Coogler’s acclaimed vampire hit. It was nominated for seven awards by the Globes, including box office achievement, best actor for Michael B. Jordan and Coogler for best director.\nNetflix’s contenders include Noah Baumbach’s “Jay Kelly” (which landed nods for George Clooney and Adam Sandler), Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” (five nominations) and the streaming smash hit, “KPop Demon Hunters.” Arguably the most-watched movie of the year, the three nominations for “KPop Demon Hunters” included one for cinematic and box office achievement — an oddity for Netflix, which typically gives its films only small, limited theatrical runs but found a No. 1 box office weekend in singalong screenings for the animated film.\nThe two studios led all others in nominations across film and television on Monday. Netflix landed 35 nominations, boosted by its expansive film slate and television nominees like the British limited series “Adolescence” (five nominations). Warner Bros. had 31 nominations, including 15 from HBO Max for series such as “The White Lotus,” the lead TV nominee with six.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The proposed deal for Warner Bros. has stoked concern throughout the industry that Netflix might devote one of the most theatrical-focused studios to streaming. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pledged a theatrical commitment to many Warner releases, but the leading trade group for exhibitors has called the deal “an unprecedented threat.” On Sunday, President Donald Trump said the market share created by the merger “could be a problem,” and Paramount said Monday it was mounting a hostile bid for Warner Bros.\nYet the studio that triumphed on the movie side of the Globe nominations was Neon. The indie specialty film company has emerged as a dominant force in international releases, winning a string of Palme d’Or awards at the Cannes Film Festival. It earned 21 nominations Monday, including five of the six international film nominees.\nSome of those nominations came at the expense of some high-profile studio films. “Wicked: For Good” was nominated for five awards, including two nods for its songs and acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. But it was overlooked for an award it was presumed to be in contention for: best comedy or musical.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The nominees instead were “One Battle After Another,” Yorgos Lanthimos’ “Bugonia,” Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme,” Park Chan-wook’s “No Other Choice” (a Neon release) and a pair of Richard Linklater movies in “Blue Moon” and “Nouvelle Vague.”\nIn the drama category, Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet” scored six nominations, including nods for its stars, Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal. It was nominated for best film, drama, along with “Frankenstein” and three Neon titles: “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value” and “It Was Just an Accident.”\nJafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident,” the acclaimed Iranian revenge drama, was nominated for a total of four awards. At different times, Panahi has often been imprisoned, put under house arrest and prohibited from leaving Iran by the Islamic Republic while making films over the past two decades. Earlier this month, while traveling outside of Iran with the film, he was sentenced to a year in prison and a new two-year travel ban.\nAs the Globes continue to transition out of their scandal-plagued past, there’s one notable change this year. For the first time, the Globes are giving a best podcast trophy. The inaugural nominees are “Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard,” “Call Her Daddy,” “Good Hang With Amy Poehler,” “The Mel Robbins Podcast,” “SmartLess” and NPR’s “Up First.”\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Many of those nominees aren’t exactly outsiders to Hollywood. But they’ll mingle with a wide array of stars that the Globes, long known for packing their red carpet with A-listers, were sure to nominate.\nThose include Timothee Chalamet, nominated for his performance in “Marty Supreme,” Jennifer Lawrence (“Die My Love”), Julia Roberts (“After the Hunt”), Tessa Thompson (“Hedda”), Jeremy Allen White (“Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere”), Emma Stone (“Bugonia”), Ethan Hawke (“Blue Moon”) and the two stars of “The Smashing Machine,” Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.\nAfter a series of controversies for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that previously put on the ceremony, the Globes were sold in 2023 to Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, a part of Penske Media. A new, larger voting body of more than 300 people now vote on the awards, which moved from NBC to CBS on a shorter, less expensive deal.\nNikki Glaser is returning as host to the Jan. 11 Globes, airing on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. This past January, Glaser won good reviews for her first time emceeing the ceremony. Ratings were essentially unchanged, slightly dipping to 9.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen, from 9.4 million in 2024.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Helen Mirren will receive the Cecil B.

Habba, in 2021, joined Donald Trump's personal legal team after a meeting with him at a Bedminster, New Jersey golf club.2. Soon after being hired, she filed a lawsuit against The New York Times on Trump's behalf. The lawsuit was also filed against three of their reporters and Mary L Trump, her boss' niece who has been a vocal critic of his politics.3. She had also sued Summer Zervos, a woman who had accused Trump of sexual misconduct, where Habba claimed Zervos was trying to stifle Trump's freedom of speech.4. Habba went on to represent Trump in a number of cases from 2022, including serving as the lead attorney for Trump in the E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump trial.5. Trump named Habba as his counselor to the president after winning the 2024 presidential elections.6. Habba was appointed the US attorney for the District of New Jersey in March 2025.7. In July 2025 District Court for the District of New Jersey said they could not retain Habba in her position, and instead appointed her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, to the post. However, Pam Bondi fired Gace only hours later.8. Trump then went on to withdraw his nomination of Habba, in order for her to continue working in the acting capacity.9. In August 2025, a judge in New Jersey ruled her appointed as invalid starting 1 July, 2025. However, stayed his order pending appeal.10. On 1 December, the New Jersey judge's ruling was upheld by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which disqualified Habba saying that she was not lawfully appointed.11. On 8 December, Habba announced her resignation from the post.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/from-appointment-to-exit-timeline-of-what-led-to-alina-habba-s-resignation-as-acting-us-attorney-for-new-jersey-11765239241812.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/09/1600x900/logo/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-HABBA-0_1765239366901_1765239384293.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:29:19","author":"Sayak Basu","authors":["Sayak Basu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":386309352,"title":"Trump announces $12bn tariff bailout for farmers","text":"Donald Trump has announced a $12bn aid package to farmers amid mounting concern over damage to local economies caused by the trade war with China.\n\n“This relief will provide much-needed certainty to farmers as they get this year’s harvest to market and look ahead to next year’s crops, and it’ll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families,” the president said on Monday at a White House press conference.\n\nHe was joined by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, and members of Congress, who have been urging the president to release the funds, as he did during his first term.\n\nThen too, producers of foodstuffs such as soybeans, were hurt by a trade war with China resulting from the imposition of tariffs.\n\nIn 2019, he provided more than $22bn in assistance, and gave even more in 2020, partly in funds linked to the Covid pandemic.\n\nIt is estimated that there are around 3.4 million farmers in the US, with many of them living in now-Republican states and supporting the president.\n\nIn October, the president of the National Farmers Union, Rob Larew, wrote to the president and members of Congress asking for help.\n\n“Family farmers and ranchers face severe economic challenges and a deepening crisis if they do not receive immediate assistance,” he wrote. “Recently enacted trade policies and the resulting actions by other countries have wreaked havoc on our markets, driving commodity prices far below the cost of production.”\n\nIn 2024, China was the biggest buyer of US soybeans, many of which are produced in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, and Ohio. Its purchases were worth $12.6bn in sales, according to the department of agriculture.

The remarks, made at a White House event announcing additional support for US farmers, pointed to growing tensions over agricultural imports that American producers say are pushing down domestic prices.According to a Bloomberg report, Trump said he would “take care” of what he described as dumping of Indian rice into the US market. Farmers in parts of the country have argued that cheaper imports from India, Vietnam and Thailand are hurting their competitiveness and adding pressure to a sector already affected by inflation and past trade actions.“They shouldn’t be dumping,” Trump said. “I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can’t do that.”The comments underline a broader push by the US administration to respond to farmer complaints ahead of next year’s midterm elections. While farmers have been a loyal base for Trump, many have struggled with higher costs and uncertain prices, some linked to his tariff measures.The president also suggested he could target Canadian fertilizer to support domestic production. “A lot of it does come in from Canada, and so we’ll end up putting very severe tariffs on that, if we have to, because that’s the way you want to bolster here,” he said. “And we can do it here. We can all do that here.”Live EventsAny move against fertilizer imports could add to concerns for American growers who have already faced higher input costs. Canada is the largest supplier of potash to the US, and while products under the North American trade agreement receive tariff carveouts, any additional fees would raise expenses further. Farmers have also dealt with hurdles on phosphate, another input mostly sourced from abroad.Both potash and phosphate were placed on the US critical minerals list in November. Farmers had hoped that designation would stabilize global supply and encourage domestic production.For India, Trump’s warning comes at a sensitive moment. New Delhi has sought a broader trade arrangement with Washington, but discussions have not led to a breakthrough. The US imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods in August over trade barriers and India’s purchases of Russian oil. A US delegation is scheduled to visit India this week, though expectations for an agreement to reduce those tariffs remain low.Canada, another major US partner seeking trade stability, has also faced tariff threats from Trump in the past. He has floated raising duties on Canadian goods outside the USMCA framework by up to 10%, which would have pushed some rates to 45%.With both India and Canada negotiating to protect market access, Trump’s latest comments signal that trade frictions with key partners may continue, particularly in sectors affecting politically important farming regions in the US.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump tariffs on Indian riceforeign agricultural dumpingUS farming sectortrade negotiations US Indiatrumptrump tariffstrump tariffs on india\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onTrump tariffs on Indian riceforeign agricultural dumpingUS farming sectortrade negotiations US Indiatrumptrump tariffstrump tariffs on india \n\nPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth Edition123View all Stories","summary":"President Trump indicated potential new tariffs on Indian rice, citing \"dumping\" concerns and aiming to support US farmers.

The remarks were made during a White House roundtable meeting where the administration unveiled a $12 billion bailout package for US farmers.According to Bloomberg, Trump said the government would investigate claims that low-priced rice was being dumped into the US market. Farmers at the meeting urged the administration to take stronger action, arguing that subsidised imports were pushing down domestic prices and hurting American producers.During the roundtable, farmers directly pressed Trump to act against countries they believe are flooding the US market with cheap agricultural products. The focus was largely on rice imports, which farmers said were being sold at prices that made it difficult for US producers to compete.Trump responded to these complaints by stating that countries were “cheating” and suggested that tariffs could follow. He said the administration would examine whether dumping practices were taking place and take appropriate action if confirmed.The President also raised concerns beyond rice imports, saying fertiliser imported from Canada could be targeted next. He suggested that severe duties could be imposed to support domestic fertiliser production if necessary.Meryl Kennedy, CEO of Louisiana-based Kennedy Rice Mill, told Trump that India, Thailand and China were among the main countries responsible for low-priced rice entering the US market. He noted that shipments from China were being routed to Puerto Rico rather than the mainland United States.Kennedy told Trump that US producers had not shipped rice to Puerto Rico in years and said rice growers in the southern United States were struggling to compete. He added that existing tariffs were helpful but argued that stronger measures were needed.“The tariffs are working, but we need to double down,” Kennedy said.In response, Trump questioned whether farmers wanted even more trade action. He later said that dumping practices should not be allowed and asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to record the countries identified by farmers as sources of unfair competition.As Kennedy began explaining how India could be supporting its rice industry through unlawful subsidies, Trump interrupted to ask for a direct list of countries. He instructed Secretary Bessent to note them down.Bessent again named India, Thailand and China as the main countries involved, adding that there were others and that a full list could be provided. Trump assured the group that he would take care of the issue quickly.Bloomberg reported that Canada and India have both been trying to push forward trade agreements with the United States to stabilise economic relations, though negotiations have seen limited progress so far.The report comes ahead of the resumption of trade discussions between India and the United States. A senior delegation from the US Trade Representative’s office, led by Deputy USTR Rick Switzer, is scheduled to meet Indian officials on December 10 and 11.India’s Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agarwal will lead the Indian delegation. Talks will cover a wide range of issues as both sides attempt to move the Bilateral Trade Agreement forward.New Delhi is aiming to finalise the first tranche of the agreement before the end of the year. Speaking at the FICCI Annual General Meeting on November 28, Agarwal said he remained optimistic and hopeful that an agreement could be reached within the calendar year.","url":"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/donald-trump-signals-new-tariffs-on-indian-rice-and-canadian-fertiliser-heres-what-farmers-say-is-hurting-us-prices/articleshow/125854319.html","image":"https://staticimg.publishstory.co/thumb/125854421.cms?imgsize=45186&width=1280&height=720&resizemode=8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:27:51","author":"Nancy Jaiswal","authors":["Nancy Jaiswal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.483},{"id":386309354,"title":"ICE threatened to dump migrants in Mexico after ‘mental torture’ and ‘crushed genitals’ at Fort Bliss, complaint alleges","text":"Cuban immigrants detained inside a military compound in Texas were severely beaten by guards before they tried to illegally coerce them into crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a complaint to Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed by civil rights groups.\n\nFour Cuban immigrants inside a makeshift facility at Fort Bliss were among dozens of immigrants loaded into buses and pressured by masked federal agents to cross the border or risk being deported to Africa or a brutal prison in El Salvador – or face the prospect of indefinite detention at the military base, the letter says.\n\nThe filing from the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups is based on interviews with 45 detainees at the facility, a sprawling $1.2 billion project that Donald Trump’s administration has designed to hold 5,000 people to support his mass deportation agenda.\n\nA series of sworn testimonials describes the facility’s deteriorating conditions and routine beatings that have left several people hospitalized, including detainees whose testicles were “firmly crushed” by guards.\n\n“This place does not seem designed for humans to be here,” a 32-year-old detainee from Venezuela wrote.\n\nIsaac, a 43-year-old Cuban man who lives with his 5-year-old daughter and her mother in Florida, said a group of 30 guards beat him after he resisted his removal to Mexico.\n\n“My fear is that one day they will take us on a bus and they will put bags over our heads and they will drop us in the middle of the desert to fend for ourselves,” he said.\n\nBenjamin, a 49-year-old Cuban hibachi chef who lives in Florida, wrote in his statement that guards threatened to do exactly that.\n\n“They threatened me by saying I have a bad record and the only solution is to go to Mexico,” he said. “They said they would handcuff us, put bags over our heads and send us to Mexico. I refused to sign the papers.”\n\nBenjamin is among several Cuban detainees who said they were cuffed at the wrists, hands and waists when they were loaded on buses bound for the border. “These threats feel like mental torture,” he wrote.\n\n“I started feeling very anxious at this point and I started yelling and screaming at the immigration guard in Mexico that this is a kidnapping and I don’t want to be taken,” wrote Abel, a 51-year-old Cuban truck driver who has lived in the United States since 1994.\n\n“The guard from Mexico then said that they don’t want anyone who was going to be forced to go to Mexico,” he wrote. “If I hadn’t started kicking and screaming at that moment, I believe I might have been taken to Mexico.”\n\nEduardo — a 35-year-old electrician and father of three U.S. citizen children, including a five-month-old — said guards drove him and others to a portion of the border wall and told them to jump over.\n\nHe said they threatened to charge him with federal crimes and “never get out” of Fort Bliss if he didn’t cross.\n\n“These actions by federal officers are clear violations of statutory, regulatory, and due process protections, including mandatory protections that require meaningful notice and an opportunity to contest a third-country removal on the basis of fear,” according to the letter from the ACLU and other human rights groups.\n\nIn more than a dozen testimonials, detainees describe losing consciousness after being repeatedly kicked in the ribs, overflowing toilets, “rotten juice” and food that makes them vomit to think about, and spending weeks indoors.\n\n“I have not seen the sun in more than three months,” a 44-year-old Cuban man wrote.\n\n“Lately, I’ve been scared to ask for anything because I’ll just get beaten. I feel ostracized, like I am an animal,” said Eduardo.\n\nA 52-year-old construction worker from Mexico who has lived in the United States for 24 years said he endured “serious delays” getting his diabetes medicine and went more than two weeks without it.\n\nDetainees routinely go on hunger strike, feeling that the only way to have their needs met is if they are on the verge of severe illness or death, another detainee wrote.\n\nA 19-year-old Venezuelan detainee said he chipped his tooth when guards tossed him to the ground, while an officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” he wrote. Another guard forced his fingers deep into his ears and another pulled fingers back, he said.\n\nAfter his release from a hospital, he was placed in solitary confinement, or “the hole,” which guards call a “center for discipline,” where he was held for eight days without speaking to anyone, he said.\n\n“I feel like I don’t know who to trust or what to do,” Abel wrote.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from Homeland Security.\n\nThe allegations echo lawsuits and sworn statements from immigrants in detention centers across the country, including litigation against ICE makeshift facilities in Chicago and New York, where federal judges have ordered the administration to swiftly address decaying conditions that have left immigrants without adequate food and water in cramped cells near open toilets under lights that stay on at all hours, and with little to no time spent outside.\n\nHuman rights groups are calling on the administration to close the Fort Bliss camp.\n\nIn July, ICE instructed agency personnel to deport immigrants to a so-called third country with as little as six hours’ notice.\n\nThat guidance followed a Supreme Court’s order that overruled a lower-court judge’s decision that immigrants must be given “meaningful opportunity” to contest their removal to a third country where immigrants have no claim of citizenship or connections.\n\nThat temporary decision has opened the door for Homeland Security to swiftly remove immigrants to war-torn African nations and other countries with poor human rights records and no due process.\n\nIn their letter to ICE, human rights groups demanded an immediate end to the “coercive and abusive attempts” at third-country removals from Fort Bliss to Mexico, as well as “a thorough investigation” into the allegations in the complaint.\n\n“I am scared of retaliation for speaking about my experience here,” wrote Abel, “but I believe the whole world should know what is happening.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ice-threatened-dump-cuban-immigrants-001232554.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.HZAkAsRh8sTmR4kH_kxDA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2c8cc33fdf991432e405431bec2ca37f","video":"","publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:26:42","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":386307332,"title":"Megyn Kelly Attacks Jimmy Kimmel’s Wife With Callback to Trump’s Menstruation Jab: ‘Bleeding Out of Our Wherevers’ | Video","text":"Megyn Kelly made a callback to Donald Trump’s infamous menstruation jab leveled at her back in 2015 while going after Jimmy Kimmel’s wife.\n\nOn Monday’s episode of “The Megyn Kelly Show,” the host took another shot at Molly McNearney following her keynote speech at The Hollywood Reporter’s 2025 Women in Entertainment breakfast. Kelly railed against the fact that McNearney was being celebrated for talking about menstruation in her speech while Trump got blasted for it back in 2015.\n\n“She’s on a tear,” Kelly said. “She’s in front of women. So we have to talk about bleeding out of our wherevers, because that’s what defines us. Okay, we got it. Didn’t President Trump take a whole lot of s–t for making that point?

It's a weird new duty that shows just how messy things can get when sweeping political promises meet the strange reality of the modern gig economy.A Loophole In The 'Beautiful Bill'The headache began with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Trump signed into law back in July. The big selling point was the 'no tax on tips' rule, meant to help service workers keep more of their cash. To clarify, the government listed nearly 70 jobs that make the cut, covering everything from traditional service roles to modern gig work.This list includes 'dancers' and 'digital content creators'—categories that ostensibly cover the millions of individuals monetising their content on platforms like OnlyFans. However, the legislation includes a significant caveat: any income derived from 'pornographic activity' is strictly excluded from the tax break. This exclusion has created a massive grey area, or 'jiggle room,' regarding where legitimate digital creation ends and pornography begins. Without clear definitions, the IRS is left to police the boundary.From Yoga Mats To Bare FeetOnlyFans is the main platform in the crosshairs, hosting around 4.6 million creators worldwide. While the site is synonymous with adult entertainment, it hosts a significant volume of non-sexual content. This diversity complicates any blanket ruling by the tax authorities. A creator might offer exclusive cooking tutorials, fitness instruction, or personal vlogs, all of which would theoretically qualify for the tip exemption under the 'digital content creator' label.Katherine Studley, an accountant who represents numerous OnlyFans creators, emphasised this difficulty. 'Where's the line? Just because you're on OnlyFans, that doesn't necessarily mean it's pornographic,' she stated. 'You could have a cooking channel or a yoga channel.'The distinction is rarely black and white; some accounts blend lifestyle content with 'spicy' imagery, while others cater to specific fetishes that may not involve explicit sexual acts, such as the lucrative market for photographs of feet.The Impossible Definition Of PornographyThe core of the problem lies in the lack of a concrete federal standard. The US government has struggled historically to define pornography for tax and regulatory purposes.Legally, obscenity is often determined by the 'Miller Test', a standard established by the Supreme Court in 1973, which relies on 'contemporary community standards'. However, applying a subjective community standard to a decentralised digital platform accessible nationwide presents a logistical nightmare for federal auditors.This definitional vacuum creates a significant hurdle for the Trump administration. They cannot simply disqualify all OnlyFans creators from the tax break without unfairly penalising those producing non-adult content. Consequently, the task of filtering eligible taxpayers from ineligible ones falls to individual judgment rather than objective metrics.An Awkward Audit For AgentsIn practice, this means IRS agents will likely have to conduct manual audits of specific accounts. To verify a taxpayer's claim, an examiner may need to log in, subscribe, and review the content directly—no matter how bizarre or explicit it may be. Experts warn that this places an absurd burden on civil servants who are trained in finance, not media censorship.Thomas Gorczynski, a tax preparer and educator, noted that the decision will effectively come down to personal opinion. 'Ultimately, it would be the subjective determination of an IRS examiner or a tax-court judge,' he explained.The subjectivity of these audits could lead to inconsistent enforcement. 'Sometimes you look at something, and it's clearly pornography, but sometimes you look at something and you think, \"Eh it's subjective. Somebody might be really into it\",' Gorczynski added.Financial Thresholds And ExemptionsFor those who do manage to survive the content audit, the financial perks only go so far. The new rules cap the tax deduction for tips at $25,000 (£18,750), and high earners are shut out completely. If a single person makes over $150,000 (£112,500), or a couple brings in more than $300,000 (£225,000) combined, do not qualify.This means the policy primarily benefits low-to-middle income creators. While this keeps the Treasury from losing too much revenue, it effectively means the top tier of OnlyFans creators—some of whom pull in upwards of $1 million (£750,000) a year—won't see a penny of relief anyway, regardless of what they post.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/onlyfans-puts-irs-awkward-spotlight-over-trump-tax-perk-agents-decide-which-kinky-tips-stay-1761368","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1774401/irs-wil-audit-onlyfans-content-distinguishing-tax-exempt-digital-creation.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3eaf5dae1f331fcb2d24bcddec095522","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:24:42","author":"Daniel Joshua Flores","authors":["Daniel Joshua Flores"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":386310002,"title":"Trump's war on wind dealt a blow as executive order deemed 'arbitrary and capricious'","text":"A federal judge dealt President Donald Trump's administration a significant legal blow on Monday, striking down his ban on wind power project approvals on federal lands and waters.\n\nJudge Patti B.

In the meantime, Group of Seven countries and the European Union are in talks to replace a price cap on Russian oil exports with a full maritime services ban, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nThat would likely further curb supply from the world's second-largest oil producer.

We have no legal right to do so, under Ukrainian law, our constitution and international law. And we don’t have any moral right either,” Zelensky said.\n\nHe added that the US was trying to find a compromise on the issue.\n\n“Russia is insisting that we give up territories, but we don’t want to cede anything. We are fighting for that, as you well know… There are difficult problems concerning the territories and so far there has been no compromise.”\n\nZelensky did not make clear why he chose to visit Rome after the meetings in Brussels and London, but an audience with the Pope was on the agenda in the morning, and with Italy’s conservative prime minister Giorgia Meloni in the afternoon.\n\nMeloni does hold the rare distinction as one European leader who historically has had US President Donald Trump’s ear.\n\nItaly was not one of the seven signatories on Sunday to push ahead with the frozen-asset-backed-loans, and – outside of European sanctions on Russian fossil fuels, on which it had been heavily reliant – appears to have been cautious about upsetting the Trump administration with full-throated support of Ukraine.\n\nBut, as Italy’s leading daily, Corriere Della Sera, put on Sunday: “[Tuesday’s] meeting between Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Zelensky aims to disprove the narrative of Italy being lukewarm in its support against the Russian invasion, supposedly to avoid displeasing Donald Trump. Instead, it confirms Italy’s commitment to defending Kyiv. However, the fact that the meeting is taking place the day after the summit between Germany, France, and Great Britain in London, also with Zelensky but without Meloni, cannot be overlooked.”\n\nPope Leo XIV is set to meet with Zelensky at Castel Gandolfo at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Italy’s leading daily Corriere reported.\n\n“We will continue to support Ukraine as long as the war continues, but we are all working for peace,” Italy’s foreign minister Antonio Tajani was quoted by Corriere as saying.\n\nTajani noted last week that it would be “premature” for Italy to take part in a NATO program to buy US weapons for Ukraine in light of ongoing diplomatic efforts.\n\n“It’s obvious that before starting negotiations, the two sides are naturally inclined to harden their positions,” he continued in his Sunday interview with Corriere, “but then we need to see, when the actual negotiations begin, what the point of agreement will be between the Russians and the Ukrainians, with American mediation and a European presence, given that we have imposed sanctions on Russia and peace cannot be achieved without the lifting of these sanctions. \n\n“Therefore,” Tajani continued, “Italy is ready to do everything necessary to achieve a ceasefire and end a war that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths.”","summary":"After meeting with a select few EU leaders and UK Prime Minister, Zelensky continues his European tour to promote retention of sovereign territory and future of Kyiv-bound funds.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/65842","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/07/09/d38bcc8fd2d0e8cfedca351ef841cca7.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:14:42","author":"John Moretti","authors":["John Moretti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":386311560,"title":"US stocks end lower as investors wait for Fed rate decision","text":"WALL Street's main indexes closed lower on Monday, with most S&P 500 industry sectors in the red, while Treasury yields gained as investors waited nervously for the Federal Reserve monetary policy update due in two days.\n\nHopes for a December rate cut were solidified after last week's data that showed consumer spending increased moderately toward the end of the third quarter.

This was something he never imagined possible while growing up in his village in the Indian state of Gujarat, where his family survived on small fields of fennel, castor and cumin, with their earnings barely enough to cover basic needs.\n\nHe had studied in a public school, where, he recalled, “teachers were a rarity, and English almost didn’t exist”.\n\n“Maybe if I knew English, I would have been some government worker. Who knows?”, he said, referring to the dream of a majority of Indians, as government jobs come with tenure and benefits.\n\nHis finances improved once he joined the diamond cutting industry in Surat, a city perched along India’s Arabian Sea coast, where nearly 80 percent of the world’s diamonds are cut and polished. Monthly earnings of 35,000 rupees ($390) for the first time brought Alpesh a sense of stability, and with it, the means to give his children the education he never had.\n\n“I was determined that at least my children would get the kind of private education I was deprived of,” he said.\n\nBut that dream did not last. The first disruption to business came with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sanctions on Russia hurt supply chains, as India sourced at least a third of its raw diamonds from Russia, leading to layoffs.\n\nAlpesh’s earnings fell to 18,000 rupees ($200) a month, then to 20,000 rupees ($222). Soon, the 25,000 rupees ($280) annual school fee became unmanageable. By the time his older daughter reached grade three, just as his younger child started school, the pressure became impossible.\n\nEarlier this year, he pulled both children out of private school and enrolled them in a nearby public one. A few months later, when new United States tariffs deepened the crisis as demand slumped further, his polishing unit laid off 60 percent of its workers, Alpesh among them.\n\n“Seems like I’ve come back to where I started,” he said.\n\nSurat, India’s diamond hub, employs more than 600,000 workers, and hosts 15 large polishing units with annual sales exceeding $100m. For decades, Surat’s diamond‑polishing industry has offered migrant workers from rural Gujarat, many with little or no education, higher incomes, in some cases up to 100,000 rupees ($1,112) a month, and a path out of agrarian hardship.\n\nBut recent shocks have exposed the fragility of that ladder, with close to 400,000 workers having faced layoffs, pay cuts, or reduced hours.\n\nEven before Russia’s war on Ukraine began in February 2022, Surat’s diamond industry faced multiple challenges: disrupted supplies from African mines, weakening demand in key Western markets, and inconsistent exports to China, the second-largest customer. With the onset of the war, India’s exports of cut and polished diamonds in the financial year ending on March 31, 2024, fell by 27.6 percent, with sharp declines in its top markets – the US, China, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe 50 percent tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump have worsened the downturn.\n\nAlpesh now works loading and unloading textile consignments for about 12,000 rupees ($133) a month, barely enough to cover food and rent.\n\n“If I had kept them in the private school, I don’t know how I would have survived,” Alpesh said. “People here have killed themselves over debts and school fees. When you don’t have enough to eat, how will you think of teaching your children well?”\n\nHis daughters are still adjusting. “They sometimes tell me, ‘Pupa, the studies aren’t as good now’. I tell them we’ll put them back in the private school soon, but I don’t know when that will happen.”\n\n‘An exodus’\n\nSome workers have returned to their villages, as many migrant families in Surat can no longer afford rent or find alternative work.\n\nShyam Patel, 35, was among them. When exports slowed and US tariffs hit in August, the polishing unit where he worked shut down. With no other work available, he returned to his village in the Banaskantha district the following month.\n\n“What other option was there?” he said. “In the city, there’s rent to pay even when there’s no work.”\n\nHe now works as a daily-wage labourer in cotton fields in his village. His son, who was in the final year of high school, dropped out after four months of the new academic session.\n\n“We’ll put him back in school next year,” Shyam said. “The government school said they can’t take new students in the middle of the term. Till then, he helps me in the fields.”\n\nAcross the city, the disruption is evident in government data. More than 600 students left school mid-session last year as their parents lost work or returned to their villages, mostly in Saurashtra and north Gujarat.\n\n“Most migrants come to Surat to settle – the city has entire [neighbourhoods] and housing clusters built for diamond workers,” said Bhavesh Tank, vice president of the Diamond Workers Union Gujarat. “An exodus in the middle of the year is unprecedented, and the drop in school enrolment suggests many are not coming back soon.”\n\nThe union estimates that about 50,000 workers have left Surat over the past 12 to 14 months.\n\nThe Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu nationalist group allied with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has been closely observing the diamond industry crisis in Surat.\n\n“The number of dropouts has reached a point where even government schools are struggling to take in new students, said Purvesh Togadia, a VHP representative in the city. “The poor quality of education is making the transition even more disheartening for families.”\n\nThe poor quality of education in public schools is well established. In 2024, only 23.4 percent of grade three students could read at a grade two level, compared with 35.5 percent in private schools. By grade 5, the gap persisted – 44.8 percent in government schools versus 59.3 percent in private ones.\n\nKishor Bhamre, director at Pratham, an organisation working on children’s rights across education and labour, said the setback is not just academic but psychological.\n\n“Children moving from private to government schools lose the environment they grew up in – their friends, familiar teachers, and a sense of community. For many, it also means shifting from an urban to a rural setting, which makes the adjustment even harder and affects their learning,” he said.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to the Surat Municipal Corporation and the state’s education minister for comment, but did not receive a response.\n\nLimited help\n\nThe Diamond Workers Union has repeatedly appealed to the state government to provide an economic relief package and revise salaries in line with inflation. The union has also urged authorities to address the equally pressing situation of the growing number of school dropouts among workers’ children.\n\nThe Gujarat government in May introduced a special assistance package for affected diamond workers – a rare move in the industry.\n\nUnder the scheme, the state government committed to paying for one year of school fees for diamond polishers’ children, up to 13,500 rupees ($150) annually. To qualify, workers must have been unemployed for the past year and have at least three years of experience in a diamond factory. The fees will be paid directly to the schools.\n\nThe government received nearly 90,000 requests from diamond workers across Gujarat, including about 74,000 from Surat alone. After a slow start – it had provided assistance to only 170 children by July – officials reported disbursing 82.8 million rupees ($921,000) towards school fees for 6,368 children of jobless diamond workers in Surat by mid-September.\n\nBut about 26,000 applicants were rejected, reportedly due to “improper details mentioned” in the forms, leading to frustration and anger among workers. In the past few days, nearly 1,000 diamond polishers have filed applications with the local government, demanding to know who rejected their forms and on what grounds, and alleging opacity in the process.\n\nThe scheme’s rigid eligibility criteria have also excluded workers.\n\n“The scheme only covers those who have completely lost their jobs, but it leaves out many who are facing partial cuts or reduced work,” said Tank. “They’re struggling just as much and need support equally.”\n\nTank added that education remains one of the most common concerns among workers reaching out to the union’s suicide prevention helpline, which was set up by the Diamond Workers Union after Surat had already recorded at least 71 suicides among diamond workers by November 2024. It has received more than 5,000 calls so far.\n\nDivyaben Makwana, 40, lost her 22-year-old son, Kewalbhai, who had been working as a diamond polisher for three years. On June 14, he died by suicide.\n\nKewalbhai had been under immense mental stress after losing his job in the diamond market, his mother told Al Jazeera.\n\n“He was earning around 20,000 rupees ($220) a month, and when even that collapsed,” he took his life, she said. “We took him to the hospital and did everything we could. I borrowed 500,000 rupees ($5,560) from relatives and friends, but we couldn’t save him. Now, I don’t have a son – only a loan.”\n\nShe lives in Surat with her husband, who has been unable to work due to prolonged illness, and their younger son, Karmdeep, 18. With no means to return to their village in Saurashtra, Divyaben has begun working as a domestic worker to make ends meet. Karmdeep dropped out after grade 11, and now attends a local coaching centre, where he is learning diamond faceting while looking for work.\n\n“Education has become so expensive,” Divyaben said. “At least with coaching, he’ll learn a skill. By the time the market recovers, if he’s trained as a craftsman, maybe we’ll be able to repay some of our debts.”\n\nShe paused, her voice low. “I don’t know if education, whether taken on loan or given free, can really change our fate. Our only hope is still the diamond.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is at risk of suicide, these organisations may be able to help.","summary":"For decades, India&#039;s diamond industry offered workers a way to a better income and life for their families.
