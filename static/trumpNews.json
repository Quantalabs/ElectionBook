This is according to a new HarrisX/Forbes Poll released Thursday.\n\nHarrisX founder and CEO Dritan Nesho explained that while the race is incredibly close both nationally and within battleground states, Trump’s strength with “couch potato voters” could win him the election should he mobilize them to show up to the polls.\n\n“There is an unseen advantage that Trump could have and he could tap into, which is with those voters that are not planning to vote–the couch potato voters, for lack of a better term,” Nesho told Forbes breaking news reporter Brittany Lewis in a Forbes Newsroom segment Thursday. “He's up by seven points with them, 47% to 40%. And if he's able to move these voters off the couch and into the voting booth, then that could make all the difference.”\n\nNesho explained that this demographic helped put Trump over the top in 2016, and brought him close to victory in 2020. “These people are generally representative of the country, but they tend to be lower income voters. They tend to skew fairly heavily male and they tend to skew white,” he said.\n\nMobilizing this group may be absolutely necessary for Trump, considering the early votes already cast greatly favor Harris.\n\n“As The New York Times reports, 30% of voters have already voted to date and 70% remain to vote,” Nesho said. “Kamala Harris is winning by 20 points, 59% to 39% compared to Trump.

One of the clips was edited to include a longer section of her response to a question about the conflict in the Middle East. Trump's lawsuit contends this editing decision was meant to intentionally assist his opponent and mislead the public, something CBS News has disputed.\"To paper over Kamala's 'word salad' weakness, CBS used its national platform on 60 Minutes to cross the line from the exercise of judgment in reporting to deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news,\" the lawsuit claims. The suit says the former president seeks a jury trial and at least $10 billion in damages.\"Former President Trump's repeated claims against 60 Minutes are false,\" the network statement says. \"The Interview was not doctored.\"Trump's legal complaint was filed Thursday in federal court in the Northern District of Texas Amarillo division, a remote venue where the lone judge is a 2019 Trump appointee. Republican-led states and special interest groups have directed at least 14 politically sensitive cases to that court since January 2021, according to progressive watchdog group Accountable.US.The lawsuit does not claim Trump was defamed by the network, said Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, who reviewed the complaint. Instead, the suit attempts a novel use of a Texas statute that is meant to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold — the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act.Stone called it a \"misapplication\" of the law.\"That statute is about sales — a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't,\" Stone said. \"But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, a constitutional law expert, said he was mystified by the Trump claims and called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"\"This is a complaint so ill grounded that it comes close to being sanctionable as frivolous,\" Feldman said.The former president has for weeks been voicing his displeasure about the interview on the campaign trail. \"Millions of Americans, including residents of Texas and this District, were confused and misled by the two doctored Interview versions,\" the suit alleges.In an earlier statement released by 60 Minutes, the network explained the two clips were edited differently because one segment, which appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" afforded more time to accommodate a longer section of Harris's answer.\"Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response,\" the Oct. 20 statement from 60 Minutes said. \"When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.\"Trump had been invited to sit for his own interview on 60 Minutes but declined.The former president has previously filed several lawsuits against media organizations, including a March defamation case against ABC News over a question asked by anchor George Stephanopoulos during an interview. He has lost prior defamation lawsuits against CNN, The Washington Post and The New York Times.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump has sued CBS News over a recent 60 Minutes interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.

From the Russo-Ukraine war to conflicts in the Middle East and the geopolitics of Africa and Asia, the election outcome will shape events far beyond the shores of the US.\n\nWith most polls suggesting razor-thin margins between Trump and Harris, this election is turning out to be one of the most closely contested elections in American history. Undecided or hesitant voters have become critical in breaking the tie between closely matched support bases on both sides come 5th November 2024. The race to the White House is driven by an intense war of words, where rhetorical framing is the key weapon being deployed by both sides to shape opinions and influence voting decisions. Here are my thoughts on how Trump and Harris employ rhetorical framing to tip the scale in this neck-to-neck race for the White House.\n\nBoth candidates assign prominence to issues they believe resonate with their audiences. Kamala Harris emphasises the significance of economic support for the middle class and working families, framing her vision for reform as an “opportunity economy” that serves ordinary Americans. She also focuses on themes of unity and inclusivity, pledging “to be a president for all Americans,” and stating that regardless of differences, Americans “all have the same dreams and aspirations.” Additionally, Harris’ campaign rhetoric always essentialises her commitment to protecting reproductive rights, and the need to “chart a course for the future and not go backward to the past.”\n\nOn the other hand, Trump prioritises illegal immigration, crime, and economic decline, rhetorically framing the situation as one of severe crises. He often employs emotive\n\nrhetoric to project fear of “criminal immigrants” stressing that “millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums” ar\n\ne taking jobs meant for Americans. By framing immigration and crime as national crises, Trump aims to rile up his base and discontented voters against the political establishment.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris rely heavily on identity framing to connect with voters. Kamala Harris often frames herself as an advocate for middle-class and working families. Referencing her childhood during her live debate with Trump, she said, “I was raised as a middle-class kid. And I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America.”\n\nThroughout her campaign, Harris consistently amplifies her experience as a prosecutor and her capacity to unify America in contrast to Trump’s leadership. She said: “Americans see in each other a neighbour…they don’t want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other.”\n\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump positions himself as a strong leader fighting against the political establishment to protect American borders and restore its greatness on the global stage. During his debate against Harris, he touted his strong relationship with world leaders to underscore his influence on the global stage. Trump boasted, “He (Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban) said the most respected, most feared person is Donald Trump. We had no problems when Trump was president… China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.” Trump often refers to his political opponents as ‘weak.’ By framing himself as a strong leader, Trump seeks to amplify the contrast between his image and the characterisation of weak leadership he ascribed to Harris on fundamental issues like immigration, crime, and the economy.\n\nTrump and Harris regularly employ oppositional framing to diminish the credibility of the opponent. Harris frames Trump as a failed, divisive, and self-serving leader unfit to lead America. For example, she stressed that ”Trump will not talk about people’s needs, dreams, and desires” and that America deserves a leader who “puts them first” positioning herself as such a leader. She also consistently frames Trump as dangerous to American democracy, referencing the January 6th Capitol riots as Trump’s attempt to upend the will of the American people. Furthermore, she refers to Trump as a liar, warning their debate audience from the start of the debate to expect “a bunch of lies” from Trump, in a pre-emptive tactic to undermine his credibility. In the last few weeks leading to the election, Harris’ campaign has ramped up rhetoric that frames Trump both as a fascist and mentally unstable.\n\nTrump’s framing of Harris is equally pejorative, often using rhetoric that positions her as weak and incompetent on the economy, crime, immigration, and foreign policy. He also characterises Harris as unintelligent, mentally unfit, a radical leftist, and a Marxist, who would confiscate guns, stop fracking, and allow “transgender operations on illegal aliens.” By framing Harris this way, Trump reinforces the portrayal of Harris as a radical leftist who has lost touch with American values.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris often employ a range of emotional, logical, and credibility-based appeals. Harris uses vivid imagery to emphasise concerns about women impacted by restrictions on reproductive rights. She rhetorically painted an image of “pregnant women…bleeding out in a car in the parking lot” to connect with the emotions and struggles of American women and underscore her commitment to their plight. She also uses fear rhetoric to describe a potential Trump presidency for the second time.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, employs fear and a sense of urgency to drive emotional appeal. He frequently uses hyperbole and repetition to amplify issues and frame them as major crises. For example, he often claims that “millions of criminals, and terrorists are pouring into America and destroying the country.” By invoking fear and a sense of urgency, he seeks to play on people’s anxieties about national security.\n\nIn terms of logical appeal, Harris’ rhetoric regularly seeks to drive persuasion by presenting logical arguments. She cited Goldman Sachs’ endorsement of her economic plan to suggest that her policies are supported by independent expert evaluation. She also employed logical appeal to discredit Trump’s economic plan, arguing that reputable entities like Goldman Sachs’, Wharton School, and 16 Nobel Laureates all declared that Trump’s plan would worsen the US economy.\n\nTrump, in contrast, appeals to logic whenever he declares that he “created one of the greatest economies in the history of America” and that he would do it even better again if given a second chance.\n\nApplying credibility-based appeal, Harris often emphasises her credentials as a prosecutor to demonstrate her capacity to fight crime and maintain the rule of law. Similarly, Trump appeals to credibility by consistently highlighting his achievements as a strong leader on the global stage, touting his ability to negotiate and stop what he alleged to be a rip-off from China, Europe, and NATO.\n\nOverall, this US election looks set to be decided by swing or undecided voters, the majority of whom will not conduct granular scrutiny of each candidate’s policies. Instead, they will respond to key soundbites and rhetorical framing that collectively shape their view of both candidates and consequently, their voting decision. While some argue that campaign rhetoric has limited influence on core voter bases, the rhetorical framing of arguments and counter-arguments that resonate with swing voters will ultimately tilt the scales towards Democrats or Republicans.\n\nDr Ogbe is a Strategic Communications consultant and an academic whose research focuses on rhetorical leadership","summary":"Both Trump and Harris rely on identity framing to connect with voters, argues TOLU OGBE As Americans head to the polls to elect their next president, the world is reminded","url":"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/11/01/how-rhetorical-framing-could-decide-the-2024-election/","image":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/2022/02/f15e7f8e-this-day-live-logo.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:54:00","author":"Ayo Yusuf","authors":["Ayo Yusuf"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.187},{"id":261874160,"title":"Dollar steady as investors eye US jobs report, election","text":"TOKYO : The dollar steadied against major peers on Friday, as investors awaited the U.S. jobs report to confirm economic resiliency heading into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting and a close-call U.S. presidential election next week.\n\nThe yen held onto to Thursday's gains as investors continued to digest a less dovish message from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the previous session.\n\nThe U.S. dollar started November off at a lower level after coming under pressure against the yen and on Thursday.\n\nNonfarm payrolls data closes out the week, with economists polled by Reuters estimating 113,000 jobs were added in October, although analysts say that the number could be impacted by recent hurricanes in the U.S.\n\nThat's likely to make the October jobs report \"incredibly hard to read,\" Tapas Strickland, head of market economics at National Australia Bank, wrote in a note.\n\nThe unemployment rate, expected to come in at 4.1 per cent, may offer a clearer picture of labour markets.\n\n\"Such an outcome would likely see the unemployment rate coming in well below the FOMC’s September projections of the unemployment rate lifting to 4.4 per cent in Q4 2024.

Rose - Eye of the Needle \r\n\nNovember 1, 2024\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n Winken, Blinken and Nod (US Presidential elections) \r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nGiven the power of the international media, both the traditional ones and those in social media now under the direct control of some of the worst species of today’s billionaires, it is hard to ignore the coverage of next week’s Presidential elections. Literally, “every move you make, every step you take…” you are bombarded with news about Trump, Harris and the relative nonentities at their sides.\n\nI had resolved not to make any comment on the Presidential race 2024, yet so much is at stake that that at least a couple points must be made. First, I must make it plain that not for one moment do I overlook the significance of the possibility of a black woman breaking through the glass ceiling and becoming the first woman to be President of the USA. Whilst I do not expect any great things, not even for women, moreso black women, should this occur, it will be a milestone in US politics, undeniably so. The pity is that like many Democrats in whom many hopes were pinned, the slavish obeisance of the Democratic party to big capital can yield at the best, mere cosmetic changes. Not even Barack Obama could change that. There may be cosmetic changes and certainly a rejection of the racist and backward utterings and actions of the Donald Trump camp. But substantive changes?\n\nKamala Harris has been a sort of sidekick to outgoing President Joe Biden, and frankly has not put her own stamp on the Vice-Presidecy or the administration. On the evidence of the past four years, on matters of democracy and human rights, Biden has been a major disappointment. Apparently, these should exist only for people in Ukraine, on whom billions of tax dollars are being spent, enriching the criminal military industrial complex, purveyors of arms and profiteers of wars and destruction. However, when it comes to life and death issues for non- white people, the approach is radically different. Biden himself speaks often, very softly one must say, these days about “human rights”, yet it is palpably plain that this term is not applicable to the peoples of Palestine (Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon). Nor does it apply to Haitians or Cubans in our hemisphere. The western media tell us that Biden “detests” Netenyahu, but this supposed “detestation” certainly does not apply to policy. Netenyahu winks, US Secretary of State, Anthony Binken does what his surname says, and Joe Biden gives the nod – genocide carried out in full view of the world. Can Harris afford to buck the trend?\n\nAt the same time, one cannot afford to ignore Trump’s irrationality and glaring racism. If black people, in the\n\nUSA or here in the Caribbean, cannot perceive his insults to black people, coined to justify racial superiority and slavery, when accusing black Haitians as “pet eaters”, then we are in a very bad state indeed.\n\nThen there is also the threat that his erratic and irrational behaviour poses to world peace. Worse, a victory for him would encourage every would-be dictator around the world, from Argentina to eastern Europe, to say “to hell with democracy” in their quest for power. Already a trend has evolved among such would-be autocrats, to refuse to accept the results of every election they lose and to instead, with outside support, force their way into power. A Trump administration would only give further encouragement.\n\nYet there is not much empirical evidence that US imperialism would change its spots with a Harris victory.\n\nInitially it may inspire and encourage women and even some democrats around the world, but as happened so many times before, the honeymoon would be short-lived. The winking, blinking and nods would continue because the likes of Elon Musk are determined to use their enormous wealth to subjugate the rest of us. There is no easy road towards making the world a better place for all of us, no alternative but independent organizing. Whether Trump or Harris, can we look upon the US to throw its weight behind the efforts by black people the world over to literally force Britain and the\n\nEuropean former colonial and slave masters to accept their role in reparatory justice, while racism is still alive in the USA?\n\nSo, while I listen to the “lesser of two evils” theory, our reality is that we cannot afford more masters, however benign they might be. We have had too much experience with tagging along in the hope that good might come some day. Try telling a Palestinian survivor of the genocide that! While it is important that the Trump train must be stopped in its tracks, the balance of forces is not so aligned that Harris will be able to do what Obama and even Kennedy failed to accomplish.\n\nOne may welcome the change but be under no illusion that there will be fundamental change.

The same one in which comedian Tony Hinchcliffe spewed racist remarks about Puerto Rico, the same one a speaker referred to as a “Nazi rally,” the same one where one of Trump’s top advisers directly quoted Hitler, and more. Yeah, that one. And you know who watched all of it go down from the audience? Vinny. He was in the FRONT ROW!\n\n\"Jersey Shore\" Vinny Guadagnino and his family are in the front row of Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, per a source at the venue. pic.twitter.com/d83v6OuVWt\n— Kadia Goba (@kadiagoba) October 27, 2024\n\nThe reality star got called out for it by disappointed Jersey Shore fans!\n\nNow, he’s defending his appearance at the rally. However, it’s not to apologize. He’s defending himself instead, saying he’s “Dark MAGA” so it’s OK. Uh… huh… Vinny explained on his Something Went Wrong podcast Tuesday:\n\n“Today is an interesting day because last night I attended the ‘pro-Israel Nazi’ rally. I was getting confused. There was the Jewish flag, and then on the other side, there [were] swastikas. It was a little bit of an oxymoron you know what I mean? I attended the Trump rally in MSG, Madison Square Garden. It was pretty cool.”\n\nWe would say it was the complete opposite of “cool”… but OK. He continued:\n\n“There [were] a lot of great speakers there. Obviously, you guys know what it was, and yeah I guess some people are shocked that I was there. Some people are not shocked that I was there. I didn’t think it was kind of going to globally make so much noise. I thought that it would just kind of be a thing that people are like, ‘Oh that’s whatever.’ I think that people who hate him so much, they cling on to whatever they can to hate him and to go viral for hating him and I was that viral thing of the moment.”\n\nThe MTV personality pointed out there are “not a lot” of celebrities who attend Trump rallies, but he wanted to go to see the “lineup of these amazing people.” “Amazing” is not the word we use… “Disgusting” and “racist” and “wannabe fascist” are just some of the words that first come to mind instead.\n\nIn Vinny’s mind though, whether people “like it or not,” he feels the event had a “historic lineup” of speakers, specifically naming Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk, Dana White, and Tucker Carlson. Seriously? Did this man not hear about the horrifying whale story involving RFK Jr.? Or Elon Musk’s awful transphobic comments about his own daughter recently? Anything? Again, these are who he considers “amazing people”?\n\nVinny went on to say he was just “a regular guy” there, and although he is on a reality show, he is “not a Hollywood guy.” He added:\n\n“People are allowed to have political beliefs and believe in different things. It doesn’t mean that you should hate them. It doesn’t mean anything it’s just allowed. It’s just what makes the world go around is disagreements and stuff like that.”\n\nThis is what’s called the paradox of tolerance. If someone’s political beliefs include racism, homophobia, misogyny, transphobia, etc… Are we being intolerant by not tolerating them? Should we agree to disagree? (The answer is no. It’s not a trick question. Sigh.)\n\nAnyway, Vinny went into more detail about his political leanings. While he’s voting Republican now, he says he didn’t always. The Dancing With the Stars alum said he grew up Democrat, studied political science in college, and was not “brainwashed into being a Republican.” Hmm. He even voted for former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2016. In fact, he revealed this is the first time he is voting Republican. Why the sudden switch? Vinny is “scared of World War III,” explaining:\n\n“I think over the last four years, there has been crazy escalation in the world and we’re f**king with nuclear weapons, bro. The Middle East is going f**king crazy. Every time we see missiles going in all different directions, it’s f**king terrifying. Russia and Ukraine are fighting, we forgot about terrifying that one was there’s another one that broke out. North Korea’s getting involved now. China’s f**king facing off with Taiwan. This is crazy, and this did not happen when Trump was president for four years. Yeah, of course, there [were] conflicts here and there or whatever. I’m not going to say, ‘No wars at all! But on that factor alone … that’s my No. 1 policy.”\n\nThis is your No. 1 thing, yet you chose the candidate who incited violence leading to the Capital riots. The same who even encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to put an end to the Palestinians. The one who constantly praises Putin and Kim Jong-Un and all the aggressors? Really??\n\nJust because Vinny is a Trump supporter these days, he repeatedly insisted he is not the “culty” kind:\n\n“I live in rational thought; people talking about policies, but respectfully disagreeing. That’s the world I live in, but it still might end up falling on the right.”\n\nHe stressed once again he is “not joining a religious cult,” but does understand there are very extreme supporters of Trump out there. And he saw “a lot of people like that” at the rally, including someone who was arrested for participating in the January 6 insurrection. Yet he reiterated he is “not part of a religious cult” before adding:\n\n“I don’t vote for as much as the person because the person’s not God — not Kamala or Trump — they’re not God. They just represent a group of policies that you’re either in favor of or you’re not. And you only get two choices.”\n\nAnd get this. Vinny noted Trump was not his “first choice.” Instead, he wanted one of the others like Gabbard, RFK Jr., and Ramaswamy. That said, he’s still voting for Trump:\n\n“I’m voting for the people who are endorsing Trump as much as I am voting for Trump.”\n\nAnd there’s more. As we mentioned, Vinny was adamant he was not in the “culty” part of the Trump supporters. What he calls himself is a “Dark MAGA,” just like Elon:\n\n“I’m not a MAGA guy. I’m a Dark MAGA. Dark MAGA is different. Dark MAGA is a little bit of a subset of MAGA. It’s a little more nerdy. It’s less religious, less culty. It’s more of just like, ‘I think putting a 30% tariff on China is going to reduce inflation by 7%.’ Regular Trump supporters aren’t saying that. They’re just like, ‘Storm the Capitol!’ Not Dark MAGA.”\n\nOof. They should call it DIM MAGA. Tariffs are not taxes to be paid by other countries, they’re taxes on US businesses — who pass the price hikes down to consumers. Experts say they’re going to make everything cost more — raising the cost of living by around $4,000 AT LEAST for most families.\n\nVinny then stressed once more that he believes Dark MAGA is about “rational thought, not a cultish religious, angry, outrageous political thing.” It’s not a good sign if you have to keep saying over and over you’re not in a cult… Just saying.\n\nLast but not least in this wild rollercoaster of a podcast episode from Vinny, he addressed Tony Hinchcliffe’s vile “joke” onstage at Madison Square Garden. You know, when he said:\n\n“I don’t know if you guys know this, but there is literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico?”\n\nSo awful. His racist comment angered and hurt many Puerto Ricans, even causing many well-known people in the music industry to publicly endorse Kamala Harris — and not Trump. What does Vinny have to say about the disgusting display at his candidate’s rally? He noted his “spicy Latinas are angry today,” adding:\n\n“So I’m a comic. I do comedy every night so I’m never gonna clutch my pearls at a joke. I’m more upset at the Trump campaign for even putting an insult comic up at Madison Square Garden in front of a holy Southern conservative crowd at 1:00 p.m. on the Lord’s Day, on a Sunday. I don’t even see the benefit [of] it. Tony’s going to do what Tony does. If this was in the context of Kill Tony, the set would have been a thousand times worse, and nobody would have batted an eye, but taking out Tony, the insult comic, and then putting him at the top, it was a weird placement. I was there, it was nowhere even near the other speakers and s**t.”\n\nVinny confirmed what we could see from the video — some people in the room laughed, others didn’t:\n\n“It was more of just like, ‘What is going on?’ ‘Is this okay?’”\n\nNo, it was not OK. But that was the point. He was picked because he’d say that kind of racist stuff, and his material was approved by the campaign. These “jokes” are in line with the stuff Trump has always said about Latinos.\n\nDespite how racist the remark was, he didn’t expect a huge reaction from the public:\n\n“I didn’t know it was going to be this whole complete eruption into the whole world to where that’s all they’re talking about. All they’re talking about is that, and seeing me!”\n\nWe were a little surprised, too. But it seems a lot of folks finally realized the white supremacist platform didn’t have room for THEM.\n\nAs far as why everyone was talking about Vin? What can we say? You disappointed and angered a lot of fans, many of whom never expected to see you attending a rally for Trump. Wrapping up the conversation, Vinny said:\n\n“You have the right to vote for whoever you vote for, and I’m not going to attack anybody who votes the other way. I’m not going to throw eggs at them, and I’m not going to say you’re a f**king warmonger or criminal because you’re on the side of Dick Cheney. It’s just like, ‘You do you. Imma do me.’”\n\n“On the side of Dick Cheney.” Ugh. Watch the podcast episode (below):\n\nThoughts, Perezcious readers?

A poll from The New York Times/Siena College indicated that Harris has the support of 78 percent of likely black voters, with Trump at 15 percent. President Joe Biden won black voters by 92 percent four years ago.\n\nHarris has also struggled with garnering more support among black men in particular, with a survey from the University of Chicago’s GenForward showing that 26 percent of black men ages 18–40 said they would vote for Trump. Roughly 12 percent of black women also said they would vote for the former president.\n\nDue to delays in counting mail-in ballots in some key states, a winner may not be called on election night, which is what happened in 2020. The Harris campaign did not say if the vice president would remain at Howard in the days following election night.","summary":"Trump is holding his election night event at a convention center in West Palm Beach, Florida.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-to-hold-election-night-event-at-her-alma-mater-howard-university-5751704","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/01/id5751814-Harris-Howard-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:50:54","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":261873590,"title":"I love America, but I’m fearful of how this baffling election might shape the world","text":"Only seven states count in this race.

Krasner’s team challenged the notion that the founder of SpaceX could not make it to Philadelphia, prompting a quick retort from the judge.\n\n“Counsel, he’s not going to get in a rocket ship and land on the building,” Foglietta replied.\n\nThe huge giveaways to registered voters come from Musk’s political organization, which aims to boost Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nAfter his lawyers argued that claims of federal election interference are involved, Foglietta put the state case on hold pending a decision in federal court, where the case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerald J. Pappert, a Republican former Pennsylvania attorney general appointed to the federal bench by President Barack Obama. No hearings there were immediately scheduled.\n\nBut in a new emergency filing Thursday night, Krasner asked the judge to “immediately” send the case back to state court – asking them to do so Thursday, “if at all possible” so it can continue in state court.\n\nIn their filing, the DA’s team says Musk’s claims are “meritless” and reiterates that their lawsuit makes “only state law claims,” therefore making it not subject to federal removal.\n\nThey say Musk’s last-minute effort is “a stunt to obtain a procedural advantage to avoid a ruling…and run the clock until Election Day.”\n\nJudge Gerald J. Pappert ordered Musk to respond to the DA’s filing by 10 a.m. Friday.\n\nKrasner, a Democrat, has accused Musk and his PAC of running a dubious lottery in the tense run-up to Tuesday’s election.\n\nKrasner’s lawyers noted that four of the first dozen winners appeared to be from Pennsylvania, perhaps the key prize in the tight presidential race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“Is it just a coincidence that this is the state that has the largest electoral votes? I don’t think so,” lawyer John Summers argued.\n\nPosts by Musk’s America PAC on X, the social media platform he purchased, indicate he’s given away 13 checks of $1 million since the first one in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19. Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan.\n\nKrasner’s lawyers noted that Musk and the America PAC had “brazenly” continued the lottery every day this week, including Thursday morning, despite Krasner’s legal bid to shut it down. The sweepstakes is set to run through Election Day, open to people in too-close-to-call states who can show that they’re registered to vote and sign a petition supporting the Constitution.\n\n“They’re doing things in the dark,” Summers told the judge. “We don’t know the rules being followed. We don’t know how they’re supposedly picking people at random … It’s an outrage.”\n\nElection law experts have raised questions about whether it violates federal law barring someone from paying others to vote. Musk has cast the money as both a prize as well as earnings for work as a spokesperson for the group.\n\nKrasner has said he could still consider criminal charges, as he’s tasked with protecting both lotteries and the integrity of elections. In the lawsuit, he said the defendants are “indisputably violating” Pennsylvania’s lottery laws.\n\nBoth Trump and Kamala Harris have made repeated visits to the state as they fight for Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.\n\nMusk, who also owns Tesla and X, has gone all in on Trump this election, saying he thinks civilization is at stake. He is undertaking much of the get-out-the-vote effort for Trump through his super PAC, which can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.\n\nHe has committed more than $70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"PHILADELPHIA &#8212; The Philadelphia District Attorney&#8217;s effort to shut down Elon Musk&#8217;s&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/elon-musks-legal-battle-philadelphia-district-attorney-takes-billionaires-1-million-daily-election-challenge-to-federal-court/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Elon-Musk-court-case-Philadelphia-DAs-challenge-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:30:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":261872554,"title":"‘Nickelodeon Kids Pick the President’ Poll Results Are In —  It Has Only Been Wrong Twice Since 1988","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as the winner of the Nickelodeon 'Kids Pick the President' poll, with 52% of the vote against former President Donald Trump’s 48%. While children can’t vote in the upcoming election, Nickelodeon’s long-running poll has an amazing track record for correctly predicting election outcomes. Since 1988, the poll has only been wrong twice, in 2004 and 2016. Given its impressive accuracy, Harris' narrow victory should make Democrats happy. \n\nThe poll, which ran online from October 3 through October 23, with over 32,000 votes submitted, was hosted by Nate Burleson and his daughter Mia. As per The Independent, the father-daughter duo also gave young voters an outlet to share and discuss topics shaping their generation, such as the economy, AI, and healthcare. The program also highlighted young activists advocating for causes they’re passionate about, including educational access and heart health awareness. Interestingly, the kids’ choice for president differs vastly from that of young adults in more formal polls. A recent Harvard survey showed that among likely voters under 30, Harris leads Trump by a solid 28 points, with a 60% to 32% preference margin.\n\nAs per the Daily Mail, this difference has stirred quite a reaction online, as social media users weighed in on what the kids’ close poll might mean. One X (formerly Twitter) user who leaned Left, wrote, “52% is so f***ing low...this is insane. The parents of these kids must be VILE.” In agreement, another added, “The parents of the 48% need to be talked to, because what the f-.” Echoing the sentiment, another penned, “52% isn’t the landslide I needed it to be. These kids are down bad.” A netizen also quipped, “Civics classes help make sure young kids aren’t influenced like their parents. That’s why the GOP hates that kind of education.”\n\nAs the comments poured in, one read, “I know this isn't meant to be taken seriously but this is not great.” Meanwhile, a MAGA supporter chimed, “That is the only poll she will win...” The Nickelodeon poll, at its core, is a way to introduce children to the democratic process. A while ago, Nickelodeon’s former 'Nick News' host, Linda Ellerbee, emphasized, “It is important to take note of who won the Kids’ Vote, simply because so many kids vote the way their parents will. But what really counts is this: They participated in democracy. They voted. How can this be anything but good?”\n\nWith Election Day less than a week away, recent national polls place Harris and Trump neck-and-neck, much like the Kid's Vote. Harris has slim leads in some battleground states, but Trump’s betting odds show growing strength in swing states like Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada.","summary":"The poll, which ran online from October 3 through October 23, with over 32,000 votes submitted, was hosted by Nate Burleson and his daughter Mia.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/nickelodeon-kids-pick-the-president-poll-results-are-in-it-has-only-been-wrong-twice-since-1988","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/722399/uploads/7b12bb20-97b3-11ef-8e00-6f19307784e0_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.057},{"id":261872588,"title":"US rapper Young Thug released after guilty plea on gang charges","text":"US rapper Young Thug will be released from prison after he pleaded guilty to gang, drug and gun charges in Atlanta.\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, was sentenced to 40 years with five to be served in prison but commuted to time served.\n\nThat is to be followed by 15 years on probation and if he successfully completes that, a further 20 years will be commuted.\n\nIf he violates the conditions, he will have to serve those 20 years.\n\nThe Grammy-winning artist pleaded guilty to one gang charge, three drug charges and two gun charges.\n\nHe also entered a no-contest plea to another gang charge and a racketeering conspiracy charge.\n\nThe prosecution asked the judge to sentence him to 45 years, with 25 years in prison and the remaining 20 years on probation.\n\nThey said some of Young Thug's rap lyrics proved his guilt but lead defence attorney Brian Steel said they \"vehemently\" disagreed with that.\n\n\"Gave the lawyer close to two mil, he handle all the killings,\" was one line of Young Thug's lyrics admitted into the trial.\n\nMr Steel said the evidence against his client was weak and accused prosecutors of misrepresenting and hiding evidence.\n\n\"He [Young Thug] told me, 'I can't wait another three months if there is any possibility I could go home because I have children that are hurting.

It is a bulwark of the self-regarding, progressive establishment, still – 52 years on – fiercely proud of its role in exposing the Watergate scandal that brought down Richard Nixon.\n\nFor more than three decades, it has endorsed every single Democratic candidate, from the priapic Bill Clinton to the senile Joe Biden. This time round it won’t back anyone.\n\nAnd the Post is not unique in provoking Left-wing indignation by failing to support Kamala Harris. \n\nThere were also staff resignations and protests from readers at the Los Angeles Times, which had backed Biden in 2020, when its proprietor refused to endorse the Democratic contender.\n\nA similarly neutral stance was taken by America’s largest newspaper chain, USA Today, despite backing Biden four years ago. \n\nOther previous Democrat supporters refusing to cheerlead for Harris include Florida’s Sun Sentinel, the Minnesota Star Tribune and the Tampa Bay Times.\n\n‘Disgraceful journalism’ was one liberal response to this wave of impartiality. ‘This is how democracy dies,’ moaned a hand-wringing academic.\n\nSuch comments reveal not only the partisanship of the Left-wingers but also their belief that newspapers have a duty to act as propaganda tools for their cause.\n\nLike a Puritan witch-hunt of the past, the Left now imposes its own ideological purity tests and hurls the accusation of heresy at those who fail to show compliance.\n\nWhat makes the Washington Post’s decision all the more extraordinary is that the paper has long been ferocious in its condemnation of Trump and equally lavish in its praise of Harris.\n\nOne absurd recent article maintained that her ‘ebullient laugh has the same tempo as some truly excellent dance songs’.\n\nThe Post’s British publisher Will Lewis – formerly an editor of the Daily Telegraph – justified the move on the grounds of wanting to return to the paper’s earlier tradition of political independence.\n\nSceptics, however, detected the hand of the paper’s billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, who made his fortune with Amazon and is now said to be concerned about retaining his lucrative federal contracts if Trump wins the White House.\n\nWhatever the motivation, the reaction from the Left to this non-endorsement has been explosive. \n\nThe Post’s former executive editor Marty Baron called the step ‘a moment of darkness that will leave democracy a casualty’, while the Pulitzer Prize-winning associate editor David Maraniss said it was ‘a contemptible act of cowardice’.\n\nThere have been at least three resignations, while 18 columnists signed a collective statement which claimed the policy ‘represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper’.\n\nSome elements of progressive opinion are so infused with moral superiority that they even reject the concept of free expression, which is meant to be the keystone of the US constitution.\n\nWhen the cable news channel CNN held a live, televised ‘town hall’ meeting with Trump in May 2023, the Left went into meltdown. ‘CNN should be ashamed of themselves,’ said the far-Left congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe Left’s attachment to groupthink was summed up in a video from Rick Wilson, founder of the fanatically anti-Trump Lincoln Project. ‘This insanity should be pulled off the f***ing air,’ he said.\n\nThis kind of hostility to diversity of opinion was also highlighted by the demented wail that greeted billionaire maverick Elon Musk’s acquisition of the social media giant Twitter (now X) in 2022.\n\nMusk’s professed aim was to make the platform a bastion of free speech after years of creeping Left-wing censorship – a trend epitomised by a ban on Trump himself – but that was precisely what terrified parts of the Left.\n\n‘It’s like the gates of hell opened tonight,’ shrieked Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz.\n\nSimilar attitudes can be found in Britain, where Left-wing ideologues seek to crush any deviation from the fashionable orthodoxy. That is especially true of the Guardian, the strident Left-wing paper.\n\nWriters who fail to conform to the ruling creed are forced out, as happened to columnists Suzanne Moore and Hadley Freeman, both distinguished by their willingness to question the Left’s dogma when it came to gender self-ID.\n\nOne column by Moore, in March 2020, provoked such opposition that 338 Guardian employees signed a letter demanding that the paper ‘do more to become a safe and welcoming workplace for trans and non-binary people’.\n\nMoore later wrote that her enemies wanted her replaced by writers who ‘simply think the right things’.\n\nThe Left’s demand for uniformity can be seen in so many other aspects of British life: the cancel culture at universities, the corporate training courses that promote indoctrination, the branding of alternative views as ‘disinformation’, and in the chilling pressure for censorship.\n\nDuring the summer, Adam Boulton, a former Sky News presenter, openly called for action against the Right-leaning GB News.\n\n‘I think there is a delicate and important broadcast ecology in this country. I think GB News is trying to bust that ecology and frankly what Ofcom (the media regulator) should do is shut it down,’ he told BBC Newsnight.\n\nAmerica, the land of the free, is infected by the same sinister contagion. During the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, the New York Times published an article by the military veteran and senator Tom Cotton, which called for troops to be deployed to restore order and prevent looting.\n\nYet again, the Left went berserk, with journalists at the paper claiming that the piece was ‘a clear threat to health and safety’.\n\nThe most senior editor at the Times, Dean Baquet, was stunned at the whirlwind of grievance and aggressive victimhood. ‘Are we truly so precious?’ he asked. But he could not prevent the head of the paper’s editorial pages, James Bennet, from being forced out.\n\nWithin a month of Bennet’s exit, another member of his department, Bari Weiss, quit. She went not with a whimper but a bang, in the form of a devastating resignation letter.\n\nShe said: ‘The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people.\n\n‘This is a galaxy in which, to choose just a few recent examples, the Soviet space program is lauded for its ‘diversity’; the doxxing [posting of personal information on the internet] of teenagers in the name of justice is condoned; and the worst caste systems in human history includes the United States alongside Nazi Germany.’\n\nAs the prospect of a Trump presidency looms ever closer, if he does reclaim the White House, of one thing we can be sure: the Left will reach new heights of derangement.","summary":"In 2003, during President George W Bush&#8217;s first term, a psychiatrist who&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/why-the-left-wing-media-reacts-strongly-to-challenges-against-its-ideological-groupthink/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/31/21/91531747-14027329-image-a-16_1730410643062.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:21:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":261872220,"title":"Analyzing the 2024 gender divide and Trump's approach to women voters","text":"Analyzing the 2024 gender divide and Trump's approach to women voters\n Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign seized on former President Donald Trump's comments saying he'll protect women whether they \"like it or not.\" Politics reporter at Semafor Shelby Talcott joins CBS News to discuss how the gender gap could impact the presidential election, and how both campaigns are framing the abortion issue.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign seized on former President Donald Trump's comments saying he'll protect women whether they \"like it or not.\" Politics reporter at Semafor Shelby Talcott joins CBS News to discuss how the gender gap could impact the presidential election, and how both campaigns are framing the abortion issue.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/analyzing-the-2024-gender-divide-and-trumps-approach-to-women-voters/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/01/4b6278fb-de68-4e9e-9a99-4aeec3e1244a/thumbnail/1200x630/6fb4c58e90816954391d0fe99e85d0b3/cbsn-fusion-analyzing-the-2024-gender-divide-and-trumps-approach-to-women-voters-thumbnail.jpg?v=379420b9063a2aad","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:21:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":261871890,"title":"Killer queens and troubled psychos: why we love an anti-hero","text":"No doubt there are real-world ramifications here. The bargain has always been this: we indulge in an anti-hero’s escapades on the condition that we recalibrate our own moral compasses once the movie’s over. But cultural history is littered with wilful misinterpretations. To this day, there are those who view Fight Club as a sigma male instruction manual and not a broad satire of the very kind of masculinity they aspire to.\n\nAnd while there’s no place in modern storytelling for Hays Code-era censorship or literality, it’s interesting to consider how our over-developed anti-hero empathy might have seeped into the real world. All villains consider their own causes to be righteous. Donald Trump has “America”. Elon Musk has “free speech”. Without an omniscient narrator to point a finger and explicitly tell us who we’re meant to be rooting for, we have to figure out for ourselves what these public figures stand for versus what they actually represent.\n\nPerhaps the pendulum is beginning to swing back. Look at 2019’s Joker: a billion-dollar box-office behemoth lauded by many as a defining snapshot of our times, decried by others as an incel manifesto; a film that squarely blamed society for its troubled protagonist’s violent uprising without laying a lick of personal responsibility on him (something even Natural Born Killers managed to do). That film’s legacy seems to have reached its anti-climactic endpoint with the release of this year’s Joker: Folie à Deux, a $US200 million flop that feels like a direct repudiation of the first film’s anti-hero-worship. It painstakingly undoes all the original Joker’s myth-making, saying nothing and entertaining no one in the process.\n\nThe cure for Folie à Deux might be next year’s James Gunn-directed Superman reboot. Before casting David Corenswet in the lead role, Gunn told press he was looking for “somebody who has the kindness and the compassion that Superman has … somebody who you want to give a hug”. Is this the dawning of a new age of loveable, uncomplicated heroes?

Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nChesebro was indicted on seven counts, and in a plea deal with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty in October last year to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and agreed to testify in the case.\n\nChesebro helped devise a strategy to create false pro-Trump slates of electors in Georgia, and other states he lost to Biden, the indictment alleged.\n\nAn attorney for Chesebro did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.\n\nAfter Chesebro’s deal was reached last year, his attorney, Scott Grubman, said it was incorrect to characterize Chesebro as the architect of a scheme to overrun democracy.\n\nSome legal groups filed ethics complaints against Chesebro with the New York Supreme Court’s attorney grievance committee in 2022.\n\nOne of the groups, The 65 Project, which had cited the false electors scheme and argued in its complaint that there was a “serious risk” that Chesebro would repeat the conduct unless the New York Supreme Court took action, lauded Chesebro’s suspension in a statement Thursday.\n\n“Ken Chesebro having his law license suspended should serve as a stark warning of what will happen if lawyers violate their oaths as officers of the court to knowingly lie to subvert democracy,” said the group’s executive director, Michael Teter.\n\nChesebro was admitted to practice law in New York in 2007. He also is licensed to practice in Massachusetts, California, Texas, Florida and Illinois, the court noted.\n\nHis suspension is the latest example of attorneys’ facing discipline for their efforts to overturn Trump’s election loss in 2020.\n\nRudy Giuliani, an attorney who helped Trump file legal challenges to the 2020 results, lost his legal license in New York in July and was disbarred in Washington, D.C., last month.

Trump, by some lapse in cosmic reason, should triumph on November 5, will he do as he has promised and Make America Great Again? And which America? The one he aimed to Make Great Again back in 2016, or the one he restored to greatness during his four years in office up until 2020 and which the Democrats have since wrecked?\n\nOr is it both or neither? Or, more confusingly, both and neither?\n\nAmerica is a funny old place. If famed Civil War photographer Matthew Brady were still alive and had a femto-camera instead of one of those daguerreotype deals on sticks, and could capture every single moment of America’s storied history at once to make a giant flicker book that we could all watch in a single second, the retinal burn left on our brain would be that of a jewel-toothed hillbilly in a billowing night-shirt standing over a New York subway air vent, liberty torch aloft in one hand and recently fired telescopic rifle in the other.\n\nMost of us know of America only through the widescreen VistaVision window of Hollywood, that mythical place set among the back-suburb orange groves of southern California, created by immigrant belt-buckle salesmen in the early 1900s to peddle the fiction of assimilation: that anyone can make it in America regardless of race and creed, no matter how poor or hungry or wretched or huddled you are. \n\nAmerica’s greatest invention is not the lightbulb or the telegraph or the Post-it note, but fame. The American Dream is the fantasy of everyone watching you, of knowing who you are, of envying you, of wanting to be you. All while your gnawing self-doubt, held at precarious bay under a mountain of benzos, threatens to escape at any moment and give the game away. \n\nIt’s Narcissus and Caliban fusing themselves in a telepod accident gone wrong and then dancing the night away at Studio 54. It’s Horatio Alger in Ron Kovic’s wheelchair. It’s a face-tattooed Cinderella walking an overly botoxed ugly duckling on a leash along Hollywood Boulevard. It’s OJ Simpson’s zombie and a choir of radioactive school-shooting victims waving at the paparazzi and then slipping into Sid Grauman’s Chinese Theatre to watch the premiere of a film starring them all.\n\nLogo, Mussorgsky’s “Night on Bald Mountain”, the title in blood-red Helvetica: AMERICA.\n\nIris in, a grassy knoll, apes banging on a monolith, a shot rings out. Another president bound for Arlington. Cut to Congress shrugging. Audacious whip-pan to Jasper Johns’ painting of Old Glory flying half-mast atop the Capitol dome. Tilt down as the mob attacks. January 6th? No, ‘tis August 24, 1814, and the British are comin,’ the tang of musket ball in their nostrils from their recent blooding at Bladensburg. ‘To Brookeville!’ cries James Madison, grabbing the half-finished painting of George Washington.\n\n‘Have you no decency, sir?” BANG! Smash cut: Lincoln grabs his chest, the crowd gasps, Babe Ruth knocks another hunk of cowhide over the border wall. A small Mexican boy catches it, races home through the streets of Tijuana and proudly shows it to his mother… ‘Este huevo de fiesta está delicioso, madre!’\n\nThat boy will grow up to be either Tito Fuentes or Tito Puente. Dissolve to the trundle of a Conestoga wagon making its way across the prairie. It turns Transformer-style into a spaceship. “Hail to the Chief” wells as Washington, Lincoln, Madison and Kennedy climb aboard and strap themselves in. Ben Grimm is at the controls. ‘It’s clobberin’ time,’ he announces.\n\nReed Richards and the Human Torch hand out peanuts and Invisible Woman does the safety demonstration. They rocket into the sky and disappear with a sonic boom, an infinity symbol left sparkling in the air in stardust. Roll end-titles.\n\nPost-credit sequence: Virginia’s Mount Rogers at sunset. A newly born black child is held skywards by a silhouetted figure. The outstretched arms belong to Thomas Jefferson. He turns to the camera and winks. \n\nJefferson had a lot in common with Trump. The third president was a hedonist slave owner, a voluptuary who never paid his bills. The 45th, too, grabbed whatever he wanted, had lickle-spittles at his beck and call and stiffed contractors left and right. Jefferson was an indiscriminate racist and power-mad proponent of the proto-Nietzsche Superman; Trump was more calculating with his bigotry and even more focused in his delusions. Tom rained war down upon the Moslems of the Barbary Coast with one stroke of his quill but refused to sign the emancipating birth certificates of the bastards he was siring at Monticello with that same ink. The Don wanted to ban Muslims from entering the country and pressed his children and in-laws into service as vassals and handmaidens. \n\nBoth though were driven by the wild-eyed pursuit — as guaranteed by the US Constitution — of Happiness — Jefferson through a hemp field, across the family graveyard and up a tulip tree if necessary; Trump the only way he knows how.\n\nThe only real difference between the two is that the author of the Declaration of Independence thought nothing of travelling to Paris to deflower his dead wife’s underaged half-sister, whereas the closest the non-ghost writer of The Art of the Deal got to dishonouring anything from France was the faux-Beaux art furniture he chose for Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAnd with Jefferson at the helm of the nascent nation and Trump jumping from one foot to the other in anticipation at the aft, it’s little wonder that America has become what it is: run amok with impecunious fools and dreamers, scrambling over each other in search of the next quick fix — a country of ill-dressed simpletons, deaf to reason, blind to truth, numb to the human condition, gratifying themselves in the shadows at the dead end of a garbage-strewn back alley called hope. Probably eating a cat.\n\nStill, I don’t want to be thought of as partisan in all of this. Even if it’s Kamala Harris who kicks the field goal on Tuesday, I think the only way for America to be truly great again is for the British to reinvade and make America what it once was: 13 separate colonies that produce mainly tobacco, rice and indigo.\n\nHas the American experiment failed?

Bush was re-elected in 2004, thanks in large part to his unusual popularity among Hispanic voters, and it has gone to the Democrats in seven of the last eight contests.\n\nUsually, American presidential candidates spend the dying days of the campaign in the most important swing states. In this case, that would mean a lot of time in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona. But both Mr Trump and his opponent, Kamala Harris, have been popping up in surprising places.\n\nA week ago Ms Harris held a rally in Houston, Texas, where she delivered remarks focused on abortion. The Republican-dominated state has one of the nation’s more restrictive bans on abortion, which came into effect after the US Supreme Court’s decision, in 2022, to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe vs Wade.\n\nBut Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976. Its huge haul of electoral votes, as the country’s second-most populous state, makes it an alluring target for the Democrats, but one that’s always just a little too far out of reach. It’s something of a white whale, you might say.\n\nMeanwhile Mr Trump, on Sunday, held a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York, his home state for most of his life (after becoming president he switched his official residence to Florida, where his Mar-a-Lago resort is located).\n\nNew York last voted for a Republican when Ronald Reagan was re-elected in 1984. In each of the last four elections, it has chosen the Democrat by a margin of more than 20 per cent.\n\nMr Trump insists he might win the state, but this is something he also said in both 2016 and 2020, so take it with an Everest-high mountain of salt. Nothing in the public polling suggests New York is even remotely competitive.\n\n(Ms Harris does appear to be underperforming Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, for what it’s worth, with an average lead of 17 per cent. Still, hardly a nerve-shredder.)\n\nSo, why hold rallies in states you can’t seriously hope to win?\n\nBoth Ms Harris’s Houston event and Mr Trump’s one in New York were presumably designed to draw more media attention than usual. A presidential candidate travelling to Pennsylvania is hardly noteworthy. A Democrat campaigning in Texas? That’s surprising enough to grab a headline or two.\n\nAnd in both cases, it worked, though not all the attention garnered was positive.\n\n‘I’m here for one reason’\n\nWhich brings us, perhaps, to one explanation for Mr Trump’s foray into New Mexico.\n\nThe event at Madison Square Garden turned into a bit of a PR disaster for him, due to a poorly received joke from one of his warm-up speakers, the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe. Mr Hinchcliffe labelled Puerto Rico, an American territory home to about three million US citizens, a “floating island of garbage”.\n\nThe remark has spread widely through the Puerto Rican community, and that has real ramifications for the election. There are about half a million Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania, for example, and more than a million in Florida – enough voters, in other words, to potentially play a decisive role.\n\nBy travelling to New Mexico, Mr Trump hoped to shore up his support among Hispanics. We can offer this analysis with confidence, because he said as much during his speech.\n\n“New Mexico, look, don’t make me waste a whole damn half a day here, OK?” Mr Trump quipped to the crowd in an airport hangar.\n\n“First of all, Hispanics love Trump. They do. True. I like them. They’re smart. They’re a lot smarter than the person running for president on the Democratic side.\n\n“So I’m here for one simple reason. I like you very much, and it’s very good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community.\n\n“You know, on the east coast they like being called Hispanics. You know this? On the west coast they like being called Latinos.”\n\nHe proceeded to poll the crowd on which term it preferred (“Hispanics” got more cheers, if you’re interested).\n\nMr Trump went on to say that his advisers had told him not to visit New Mexico.\n\n“Look, I’m only here for one reason. They all said, ‘Don’t come.’ I said, ‘Why?’ ‘You can’t win New Mexico,’” he said.\n\n“I said, ‘Look, your votes are rigged. We can win New Mexico. We can win New Mexico.’”\n\nHe also claimed to have already won the state twice. To be clear: Mr Trump received 65,000 fewer votes than Ms Clinton in New Mexico, and 100,000 fewer than Mr Biden.\n\nThe Trump campaign would argue, of course, that his focus on New Mexico is a sign of strength; a sign that he is expanding the electoral map and competing in states that would normally be out of reach for a Republican (that is certainly the interpretation of his more vocal supporters online).\n\nWe will see whether that competitiveness is real, or a pipe dream, soon enough.\n\n‘Political game’: Row erupts over rally’s location\n\nThere was a tinge of controversy around the rally. According to The Albuquerque Journal, New Mexico’s largest newspaper, Mr Trump’s campaign team actually wanted to hold it at the Albuquerque Convention Centre, in the city’s downtown area, but was rebuffed.\n\nInstead, Mr Trump spoke in a private hangar at the airport, owned by CSI Aviation. \n\nThe convention centre’s manager, Ray Roa, told the newspaper this was due to previously scheduled remediation work on the city’s main water line, which runs through the building. That work, he said, had been on the calendar since late September.\n\nHowever Dan Lewis, president of the local council, has alleged the Trump campaign was denied because of political bias.\n\n“Just think about it. They just did Madison Square Garden in downtown Manhattan, right in the heart of the city of New York. There’s no reason why we couldn’t,” said Mr Lewis.\n\n“Unfortunately, the city of Albuquerque has an extremely partisan mayor, a pawn to the Democrat Party, playing a political game with a presidential candidate.”\n\nMr Roa clarified, to The Journal, that neither the mayor nor any other elected official had pressured him to deny the Trump campaign’s request.\n\nThere is also no truth to suggestions by Mr Trump’s critics, online, that he was forced to use the airport hangar because of a whopping payment he still owes the city after a visit in 2019.\n\nIn September of that year, when he was president, Mr Trump held an event in Rio Rancho, a northern suburb of Albuquerque, and spent the night in the city. He was given a bill of about $US211,000, some it for police services, some for the use of barricades, and a $US133,000 chunk for the wages of government employees who had been unable to work due to the disruption, but were still paid their salaries.\n\nMr Trump didn’t pay, and accrued interest on the bill has since seen it more than double, ballooning to about $US450,000.\n\n“Trump still owes Albuquerque half a million dollars and collections will keep reminding him about it until he pays,” the aforementioned mayor, Tim Keller, said in a statement.\n\nHowever Mr Roa made it clear, in his own statement, that Mr Trump was unable to use the convention centre on this occasion due to the remediation works. The unpaid bill had nothing to do with the decision.","summary":"With both US presidential candidates running out of time to win over voters, Donald Trump has made a curious decision.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/donald-trumps-weird-move-days-before-us-presidential-election/news-story/8895611cb12894b88abc3c8d2ec32975?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/de944d5e27b819e37b6d5b1570811761","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:05:34","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":261872284,"title":"Allying with Trump, Elon Musk is the latest billionaire to seek gov’t power","text":"If Elon Musk joins the United States government following a Donald Trump victory in the presidential election, he will be the latest in a succession of billionaire businesspeople to hold public office.\n\nFrom the late Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and former President Trump himself, the super-rich have long held positions of power in Washington, DC and across US state capitals.\n\nWith polls showing Tuesday’s election on a knife edge, Musk is in serious contention to join Trump’s cabinet after the Republican candidate floated the idea of the tech billionaire serving as so-called “Secretary of Cost Cutting”.\n\nSince entering politics after decades in the real estate business, Trump has displayed a penchant for drafting high-net-worth individuals from the private sector.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump nominated five people as Cabinet secretaries who had spent all or nearly all of their careers in the business world, including Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos, and former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Pew Research Centre, Trump’s first slate of Cabinet nominees had more businesspeople with no public sector experience than any other before it.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, has called for drastic reductions in government spending, although he has provided few specifics about where he would direct cuts.\n\nDuring Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX CEO said the federal budget could be slashed by “at least” $2 trillion.\n\n“Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that,” Musk told Howard Lutnick, the chief executive of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald and a member of Trump’s transition planning team, when asked how much he could “rip out” of the latest federal budget.\n\n“We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.”\n\nSuch a reduction in spending – equal to nearly one-third of last year’s federal budget of $6.75 trillion – would almost certainly be impossible to achieve without steep cuts in areas that politicians across the aisle have been loath to touch, including social security, healthcare, veterans’ benefits, and defence.\n\nMusk himself has acknowledged that such a sharp cut in spending would inflict serious economic pain.\n\nOn Tuesday, he responded “sounds about right” to a post on X that predicted there would be “an initial severe overreaction in the economy” and “markets will tumble.”\n\nSpaceX and Tesla did not respond to requests seeking comment from Musk.\n\nWhile politicians pledging to end wasteful spending is hardly new, there is no “precise parallel” to a businessman like Musk overseeing a department tasked with improving government efficiency, said Bruce Schulman, a professor of history at Boston University.\n\nPolitical candidates that touted their experience in business, from former President George W. Bush to presidential nominee Mitt Romney, typically had a track record in public service before seeking to enter the highest levels of the federal government.\n\nGovernment commissions aimed at eliminating waste and inefficiency – such as the Hoover Commission and the National Partnership for Reinventing Government led, respectively, by former President Herbert Hoover and Vice President Al Gore – have also generally been led by seasoned government officials.\n\nSchulman said while initiatives to eliminate waste have been endorsed at various times by both Democrats and Republicans, they have been largely for “political show”.\n\n“These efforts have had marginal effects, and mostly been for political show. But overall, both the size of the federal government in number of employees and in terms of spending have been flat for a long time even though the US population has increased dramatically. The federal government is much leaner than it was in the 1960s/70s,” Schulman told Al Jazeera.\n\nJohn Pelissero, director of Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, questioned Musk’s standing to hold a government position given his lack of experience in the public sector.\n\n“Without any working experience in government, one might wonder how he could be qualified to occupy a position, for example, that focuses on government efficiency,” Pelissero told Al Jazeera.\n\n“It is worth noting that past government efficiency or reform commissions have often been led by an individual who has earned public trust and has deep experience in government.”\n\nWhile Musk has been lauded as a tech visionary in the private sector, his business track record is not without its stumbles and controversies.\n\nSince his $44bn takeover of X in 2022, the social media platform’s value has fallen about 80 percent, according to a valuation by the investment giant Fidelity, largely as a result of advertisers leaving the platform over its loosening of content moderation.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has accused SpaceX of polluting the area around its Texas base, damaging a surrounding state park and federal wildlife refuge.\n\nIn September, the agency fined SpaceX $148,378 over a chemical spill – a minuscule penalty for a company of its size that Musk nonetheless branded as “silly”.\n\nA Cabinet position would be an enticing reward for Musk, who has emerged as one of Trump’s most vocal and powerful supporters since July’s failed assassination attempt on the former president.\n\nMusk’s companies hold billions of dollars in contracts with government agencies, raising concerns that his elevation to the government would create potentially huge conflicts of interest.\n\nSpaceX alone has received more than $15bn in government contracts for launching rockets for NASA, satellites for the Pentagon, and ferrying US astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nIn February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was awarded a $1.8bn classified government contract with an unnamed government agency.\n\nTesla, which is facing regulatory scrutiny from numerous government agencies, stands to benefit from potentially looser regulatory enforcement during a friendly Trump administration, as well as tax cuts and subsidies.\n\nX, meanwhile, provides Musk an “outsized ability to influence government policy and amplify his or Trump’s views/policies in government”, Pelissero said, adding that Musk should sell the platform if he is to enter government.\n\nMusk’s influence has already been on full display in the presidential race.\n\nThe billionaire has poured at least $118m into Trump’s campaign through his America super PAC, advocated vigorously for Trump on X – including, at times, by spreading the Republican candidate’s false claims of election fraud – and stumped with him on the campaign trail.\n\nHis efforts to promote Trump have even gone as far as testing the limits of election law.\n\nOn Monday, Philadelphia’s district attorney filed a lawsuit requesting a judge to block Musk’s $1m daily giveaway for registered voters in battleground states, calling it an “illegal lottery scheme”.\n\nThe move came days after the US Justice Department sent America super PAC a letter warning that the lottery for voters who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments of the US Constitution may violate federal law.\n\nDespite his showmanship and uncensored comments, Musk is in some ways following a familiar playbook for US elites, said Daniel Krcmaric, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University in Chicago and the co-author of a 2023 study on billionaire politicians.\n\n“All of these tactics are part of a broader strategy to use his incredible wealth to sway – using informal means – the US presidential election in his preferred direction,” Krcmaric told Al Jazeera.\n\nIt is not unusual for the ultra-wealthy to throw their resources behind political candidates, whether Republican or Democratic, or exert influence over the government through their business interests, such as in the case of John Pierpont Morgan – aka J.P. Morgan – who functioned as a de facto central banker at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThough far from unheard of, it is less common for them to seek office.\n\nAnalysing data from the Forbes Global 2000 list of billionaires, Krcmaric’s study found that 11 percent of billionaires worldwide have either sought or held formal public office.\n\nTransitioning from business to politics is far more common in autocracies than democracies, according to the study, with 29 percent of billionaires seeking or holding office in the former, compared with 5 percent in the latter.\n\nWorldwide, the list of billionaire businessmen-turned-politicians includes former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and former Australian legislator Clive Palmer.\n\nThe US has a lower rate of political participation by billionaires than average, at just 3.7 percent, due to the many other avenues of influence available to them, according to Krcmaric, including bankrolling campaigns and advocacy groups.\n\nDuring the current US presidential election cycle, the 50 biggest donors have given more than $2.5bn to influence political races and causes – about two-thirds of which favoured Republicans and conservative-aligned causes.\n\nWhile Musk has only begun explicitly supporting Trump recently after years of expressing support for Democrats, he has publicly identified with conservative and right-wing causes since at least 2022, the year he bought Twitter – as X was then known – in a hostile takeover.\n\nSoon after buying the platform that October, Musk reinstated the accounts of numerous right-leaning figures who had been banned for inflammatory posts or spreading misinformation, including Trump, self-described “misogynist” influencer Andrew Tate, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, and US legislator Marjorie Taylor Green.\n\nAt around the same time, Musk began using his X account to issue warnings about the future of Western civilisation and the influence of the “woke mind virus”, referring to what critics say is left-wing politics’ support of censorship and obsession with race, gender and sexual identity.\n\n“This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead,” Musk said in a post on November 29.\n\nAs a self-described “free-speech absolutist”, Musk also dramatically curtailed content moderation on X and scrapped the platform’s “verified” feature for high-profile figures such as celebrities and politicians.\n\nThe changes drew criticism from liberal activists and misinformation scholars, who warned that they would lead to a rise in hate speech and the impersonation of public figures.\n\nMusk’s engagement with fringe figures, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, on the platform was also held up by critics as evidence of a sharp turn to the right.\n\nMusk also began quietly donating tens of millions of dollars to conservative causes in the US, channelling money to the PAC Citizens for Sanity and the presidential campaign of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, The Wall Street Journal reported last month.\n\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to move the headquarters of X and SpaceX from California to Texas to protest against a law that bans schools from forcing teachers to notify parents when their child changes their gender identity.\n\nMusk’s turn to the right has also been on display in his expressed views about international affairs, including his promotion of a “plan for peace” in Ukraine that critics say closely aligned with the Kremlin’s talking points on the war.\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Musk had been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since October 2022, quoting current and former US, European and Russian officials.\n\nWhile many of the details of the discussions were unknown, Putin reportedly asked Musk to refrain from activating his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan as a favour to his ally, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the newspaper said, quoting a former Russian intelligence officer.\n\nXi, who has pledged to “reunify” democratic Taiwan with the Chinese mainland by force, if necessary, would likely cut Taiwan’s communication lines in the event of an invasion or blockade, according to security analysts.\n\nMusk did not respond to WSJ’s request for comment on contact with Putin, the newspaper said, although he later mocked the article on X without denying its claims.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the election, Musk will continue to exert enormous influence, whether from the sidelines or from within the White House, said H.W. Brands, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n“Social media has given private individuals avenues to celebrity that didn’t exist before. Trump and Musk are good examples,” Brands told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Trump had the additional advantage of his television show, but he outflanked regular Republicans in 2016 in a way that would have been nearly impossible in earlier generations.”","summary":"Tesla and SpaceX CEO is eyeing a position as &#039;Secretary of Cost Cutting&#039; if Republican prevails in November 5 election.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/11/1/allying-with-trump-elon-musk-is-the-latest-billionaire-to-seek-govt-power?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-25T024918Z_973298594_RC2QU9AU4QQ6_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-MUSK-1730334719.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:03:19","author":"Apps Support,Erin Hale","authors":["Apps Support","Erin Hale"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.039},{"id":261871116,"title":"Gerry Lynch: The two reasons why Donald Trump will win the US presidential election","text":"In his two previous presidential campaigns, the polls significantly understated Trump’s actual result. This year, for the first time, the polls do not put Trump well behind in the final days, but instead show him running neck and neck with Kamala Harris. If the past tendency of polls underestimating his support continues, we would expect Trump to win the popular vote for the first time ever, and to win the Electoral College comfortably. I think it is that simple. The reason why this simple presumption might be wrong is that the polls show this election is not a simple rerun of 2016 and 2020. In particular, there are many fairly conservative, upscale, white women who’ve voted for Trump twice but will vote for Harris this time, with the overturning of the Roe-v-Wade decision guaranteeing nationwide access to legal abortion being a significant driver of this shift. At the same time, there are young working-class men of all races who voted for Clinton and Biden but will vote for Trump this time, seemingly alienated by the progressive message in the culture wars. In this scenario, the Democrats retain some hope as well-off white women are a group who vote reliably in big numbers, while younger working-class men tend on average to be less diligent about casting their ballots. Yet I think Trump remains the clear favourite, due to the key issues for US voters and the candidates. Americans have for several years now cited inflation as the most important issue facing their country; in recent months, immigration has surged to second place. Basic groceries and rent are much more expensive than they were four years ago, while both legal and illegal immigration to the USA has increased significantly. Democrats, and not just Harris at the top of the ticket, face an election environment in 2024 where the electorate’s top two issues are among those where they are least trusted. As for candidates, while Trump’s manifest and grievous flaws are the subject of constant comment, they have long ago been “priced in” by voters. Harris was crowned as heir presumptive for the ailing Biden even though insiders have long known she was a poor campaigner with a weak record as vice president; the electorate have now had the chance to see that every day since July. That the Democrats anointed her rather than running a competitive process to select a candidate under emergency rules in the four weeks between Joe Biden’s withdrawal and the Democratic National Convention is an error that might haunt the party for years. All this followed several years of most of the media lying to cover up for Biden’s progressing senility in a way that was laughably obvious. The Democrats tried to behave like the old East German Information Ministry in a country with a rambunctiously free press and open internet; this was never going to end well. When voters decry the spiralling prices and immigration and endless official lies of Biden’s America, they are told that Trump is literally Hitler. No doubt this vindictive, angry, vain, and intolerant man, transparently unfit to hold the most important elective office in the world, has the psychological raw material of a frightening tyrant. But the USA in 2024 is not Germany in 1933. The state which Hitler took over had barely been a country for 60 years, with political institutions only 14 years old, introduced after catastrophic defeat in war and characterised by repeated economic collapses and incessant street violence between extremist parties. In contrast, the USA and its political institutions have been in place for almost a quarter of a millennium; despite its supposed current crisis, the country remains the world’s political colossus with unmatched economic dynamism and military might. Those deeply embedded American political institutions locate much power in states and cities, and most of the most important of these will remain in Democratic hands regardless of the identity of the next President. It is in these cities and states that the Democrats have the means to rebuild should Trump win. To do that, however, they will have to address the question they have refused to face honestly for the last eight years: why do so many Americans have so little faith in the post-1960s political and cultural order, a world that the Democrats are the most visible manifestation of, that they will turn to any a vehicle, even one as manifestly horrid as Trump, that promises to truly change the political script? l Rev Gerry Lynch is an Anglican minister and former executive director of the Alliance Party","summary":"​Simply put, there are two reasons why Donald Trump is now the clear favourite to win next week’s presidential election: the polls and the campaign.","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/columnists/gerry-lynch-the-two-reasons-why-donald-trump-will-win-the-us-presidential-election-4848220","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjQ2ZTFjNmM2LTAzZjEtNGNlYy05ZjA1LTRiZDBiYTgxMzQyYzowYjMwMTQ0NC1mOTI5LTQzZDEtYjM5MC1lODZmZGY5MDZjZGM=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-01 00:01:00","author":"Gerry Lynch","authors":["Gerry Lynch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":261870602,"title":"RFK Jr.’s vaccine quackery has no place in modern America","text":"If Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., had been born with a different name, he’d probably be peddling miracle mushroom cancer cures on YouTube right now.\n\nInstead, our French fry-slinging presidential hopeful Donald Trump has, according to Kennedy, “promised” to give him “control” of all of Washington’s public health agencies, “which, you know, is key to making America healthy.”\n\nKennedy has wiggled his way into the hearts of MAGA by (rightly) opposing the public health establishment’s abuses during COVID — and, of course, by endorsing Trump.\n\nAnd there’s nothing inherently wrong with Kennedy’s stated goal of encouraging Americans to be healthy “again.”\n\nThough, if he had his way, we’re all going to end up eating tofurkey with spelt stuffing while praying for the sun to shine so our solar panels will kick in.\n\nThe bigger problem is that he’s proven a scaremongering authoritarian and dangerous Luddite whose ideas would make life considerably worse for everyone.\n\nThe other day, Trump-Vance transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick explained that Kennedy doesn’t want the Health and Human Services secretary’s job, he merely wants access to federal data — allegedly hidden from the public — to prove vaccines are dangerous so we can take them “right off, off of the market.’”\n\nGranted, I’m not a scientist, but I suspect assuming what the data will tell you isn’t how it’s supposed to be done.\n\nBut Kennedy doesn’t want Americans to have vaccine choices; he wants to deny them the right to use them.\n\nAnd after spending an entire “2½ hours” with the man, Lutnick had embraced all his anti-vax nuttery, spreading the pernicious claim that vaccinations are linked to autism, for which there is zero scientific evidence.\n\nAs proof, Lutnick made the preposterous claim that we “know so many more people” with autism these days as compared to when he was young.\n\nNow, I’m a bit younger than Lutnick, but we grew up in the same area. \n\nSurely, he can recall kids being called “slow” or “weird” or “off,” or far uglier things, but never “autistic” or “neurodivergent.”\n\nIt is highly probable that the spike in autism cases is an epidemic of discovery.\n\nThere is increased public awareness of how autism presents itself and what it is: teachers, parents, caretakers, friends all look out for it; doctors have better ways of diagnosing it.\n\nMillions of people who might never have even known they were autistic have been identified as being on the spectrum.\n\nBasing policy on the childhood recollections of a billionaire doesn’t seem very sciency, either.\n\nThen again, even if there were more cases of autism, there’s still no evidence vaccines are the cause.\n\nLutnick has embraced a false-cause fallacy.\n\nWe do a lot of things we do today that we didn’t do in the 1960s. \n\nWhy not blame autism on cell phone use?\n\nOf course, even if Kennedy was correct, banning vaccines to curb autism would entail a disastrous tradeoff.\n\nThe year Lutnick was born, the US child-mortality rate was 31 per thousand; now it’s 7.\n\nA few years before Lutnick was born, the United States saw 21,000 cases of paralytic polio. \n\nThere are none now.\n\nChildren have been spared all sorts of horrifying diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and so on. \n\nThe upside of vaccinations has been a massive boon for humankind.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Kennedy isn’t just a skeptic of the COVID jab.\n\nIn 2023, he said there is “no vaccine that is safe and effective.” \n\nHe claimed that vaccines had sparked an “autism epidemic,” which he abhorrently compared to a “holocaust.”\n\nThe man who wants to get fluoride out of water (suggesting it makes kids gay) and put a stop to the crime of “chem trails” once said that COVID had been genetically engineered as an “ethnically targeted” bioweapon that spared Ashkenazi Jews.\n\nWhen “I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby . . . I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,” Kennedy explained recently.\n\nAny rational person would ignore the raving of some rando on the hiking trail going on about the evils of vaccines.\n\nNot, apparently, the Trump campaign.\n\nDavid Harsanyi is a senior writer at the Washington Examiner.","summary":"Robert F.

missile test a distraction from troops supply to Russia?","text":"North Korea is showcasing its deepening “nuclear alliance” with Russia and demonstrating military strength by testing what observers suspect is a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ahead of next week’s US presidential election and to also distract from its deployment of troops to the Ukraine war.\nIn an unusually prompt response, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said hours after the launch on Thursday that it was intended to demonstrate the nation’s “counteraction will” against rivals, whom he accused of escalating tensions in the region.\nKim reaffirmed that Pyongyang’s commitment to bolstering its nuclear capabilities remained unshaken.\nThe launch followed closely on the heels of Russia’s extensive nuclear forces exercise simulating retaliatory strikes, adding further tension against the backdrop of the Ukraine war, where North Korea has reportedly dispatched about 10,000 troops to back Moscow.\nThe missile test also came a day after South Korean and American defence chiefs agreed to include “realistic” scenarios – such as a North Korean nuclear attack – in their future joint military exercises, condemning Pyongyang’s reported deployment of troops to Russia.\n\n“North Korea wants to emphasise that its growing alliance with Russia is supported by nuclear weapons,” Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told This Week in Asia.\nKim’s powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong, added to the rhetoric last week by slamming both South Korea and Ukraine, likening them to “bad dogs bred by the US”.\nShe warned that any military provocation against her nuclear-armed country would lead to a “horrible situation”.\n“North Korea is also sending a message to Washington ahead of the US election, signalling that its pursuit of nuclear power status is irreversible, regardless of the election outcome,” Hong said.\nHe suggested that the missile launch was also intended to deflect attention from Pyongyang’s involvement in the Ukraine conflict.\nProfessor Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies, noted that the North might be seeking to gain leverage in potential nuclear arms reduction talks, particularly if Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office, by advancing its ICBM capabilities.\n\nJapanese and South Korean authorities reported that the missile was launched northeastward from near Pyongyang early on Thursday.\nIt travelled about 1,000km, reaching a peak altitude of 7,000km before landing outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone, off the coast of Hokkaido.\nThe recent ICBM launch has set records for both flight distance and altitude, underscoring its advancing missile capabilities.\nThe missile, launched at a lofted angle from near Pyongyang, flew for around 86 minutes, significantly surpassing the 2023 test, which reached about 6,000km over a 70-minute flight.\nYang said this test might involve a new ICBM, potentially with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle technology.\n“If this test proves successful, it raises the possibility that Russia may have provided North Korea with technological assistance,” he added.\nNorth Korea has yet to test an ICBM at a normal, lower trajectory, which could be perceived as an escalatory move likely to provoke an interception attempt by the United States.\n\nAccording to Yang, the test may also serve a domestic purpose: easing rising anxieties among families of soldiers dispatched to Russia and those with sons in active military service.\nLast week, South Korea’s intelligence agency reported that families of North Korean soldiers deployed to the Russian front lines are being relocated in an effort to limit internal unrest, as word of their deployment spreads despite strict information control.\nLawmakers were told the North Korean troops might suffer heavy casualties given their lack of modern warfare experience, especially in areas such as the Kursk region, where drone and missile technology play a significant role.\nAnalysts say Kim Jong-un could also be feeling anticipation and anxiety amid global condemnation of the deployment.\n“The missile

US polls suggest the race is a toss-up and it could be days before results are known.\nBudapest is hosting an informal EU summit on November 8 and a larger meeting of the European Political Community the previous day.

This would avoid it being called the “Budapest declaration”.","summary":"Some diplomats think the Hungarian PM might invite Trump to dial into a coming European summit if he retakes the White House.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3284715/hungarys-orban-stirs-concerns-trump-surprise-eu-leaders","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/01/89ab9d3e-e099-45a6-843e-c7bfd2dbefb3_8098762d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:47:06","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":261869986,"title":"Kamala Harris’ abortion lies: Here’s what she and Trump can — and CAN’T — do","text":"The biggest lie roiling the presidential election is Kamala Harris’ claim that Donald Trump will ban abortion nationwide.\n\nAbortion rights do not hinge on who is elected president, Trump or Harris. \n\nOr on which party controls Congress. \n\nThe issue is out of their hands.\n\nWherever you live, state legislators elected in your own state will determine your abortion rights. \n\nThat is what the US Supreme Court ruled in 2022, when it overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nAs a pro-choice woman, I understand some voters are putting aside concerns about inflation, the border, foreign policy and other issues out of fear they or their daughters won’t have freedom of choice. \n\nThey deserve the truth — but they’re not getting it from Harris, who’s all too willing to spread lies about abortion policy to shore up her sagging support.\n\nAt a rally in Houston, Texas, last week featuring pop star Beyoncé, Harris pumped up the fear.\n\n“If you think you are protected from a Trump abortion ban because you live in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New York or California,” she said, “please know, no one is protected.”\n\nThat’s 100% false. \n\nBut instead of fact-checking, the liberal media are letting that lie do its dirty work, scaring women into voting for Harris.\n\nTrump has vowed to veto a national ban on abortion. \n\nBut you don’t have to rely on his word.\n\nRead the US Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution reserves for states authority over the health and welfare of their own residents.\n\nThe federal government has only limited, enumerated powers, such as levying taxes and regulating interstate commerce — but not the power to regulate most health-care matters.\n\nTherefore, any effort by Congress to ban abortion nationally would likely be overturned by the courts as an unconstitutional intrusion into state affairs.\n\nThat includes Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would make it a crime to abort a fetus after 20 weeks.\n\nIt also includes the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, a Democratic proposal that would guarantee access to abortion nationwide, preempting state laws to the contrary.\n\nThis bill goes so far beyond Congress’ enumerated powers that its authors have omitted the “findings” section that’s meant to describe Congress’ authority to pass it — because there is none.\n\nThe same is true of Harris’ pledge to codify Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat’s unlikely to fly, short of a constitutional amendment.\n\nThe US Supreme Court recognized states’ power to regulate matters of health care as long ago as 1905, when a resident of Cambridge, Mass., challenged a local ordinance requiring the smallpox vaccine.\n\nIn that case, the court ruled that states could require residents to be vaccinated. \n\nBut the court has never recognized a federal power to do so, not even during the COVID pandemic. \n\nThat’s why vaccination laws vary from state to state, just like abortion laws do — especially now that Roe has been struck down.\n\nMembers of Congress trying to legislate abortion restrictions or abortion guarantees have generally used the Commerce Clause as the pretext for their authority, as if performing an abortion could possibly be considered interstate commerce. \n\nAt one time, the court allowed Congress to stretch the meaning of the Commerce Clause like a rubber band to authorize federal meddling into virtually anything. \n\nIt was even used that way by the authors of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003.\n\nBut recently, in a string of rulings, the court has cracked down on misuse of the Commerce Clause to extend Congress’ authority over areas otherwise reserved for the states.\n\nThat’s why Harris’ vow to codify Roe v. Wade, and her warnings about a national abortion ban signed by Trump, are uninformed and unconvincing. \n\nWhen the court struck down Roe in 2022, the justices didn’t look to Congress to make abortion law. \n\nThey looked to the states. \n\nPro-choice voters need to know that the action on reproductive rights has now shifted from Washington, DC, to their own state capitals.\n\nTen states have abortion measures on the ballot this November. \n\nIt’s possible to support increased access to abortion procedures, like Florida’s measure does, and still vote for Trump — because as president, he won’t have the power to do a thing about it.\n\nThe next battle is over the abortion pill mifepristone, which now accounts for 63% of pregnancy terminations, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nFourteen states ban the drug. \n\nThree of them, Missouri, Kansas and Idaho have sued the Federal Drug Administration to make it harder for women in those states to self-abort. \n\nTrump has said that the federal government “should have nothing to do with this issue,” infuriating pro-lifers — but staying true to the principle that state voters should decide it.\n\nThat’s the legal reality. \n\nInstead of hanging with Beyoncé, Harris should take a refresher course on the US Constitution — and drop the scare tactics.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and co-founder of the Committee to Save Our City.","summary":"Abortion rights do not hinge on who is elected president, or on which party controls Congress. The issue is out of their hands.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/31/opinion/harris-abortion-lies-heres-what-she-and-trump-can-and-cant-do/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/KAM345.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:46:01","author":"Betsy McCaughey","authors":["Betsy McCaughey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":261870004,"title":"Trump camp says it’s on victory’s ‘verge’ five days before the election","text":"Former President Donald Trump routinely declares he’s leading in the swing states “by a lot.”\n\nHis top pollster is backing that up via data with just days to go before the election.\n\nTony Fabrizio contends, “Trump’s position nationally and in every single Battleground State is SIGNIFICANTLY better today than it was 4 years ago,” saying the GOP nominee “holds the lead in 5 of the 7 Battleground States that account for over 270 Electoral Votes.”\n\nFabrizio points to public polling, via the RealClearPolitics average, to show his client is better off today than he was four years ago — and on the way to 287 electoral votes if those numbers hold up in the final count.\n\nTrump was down 7.4 points at this time in the 2020 campaign; now he’s up 0.5 points against Kamala Harris in national polls.\n\nAnd swing states show the same pendulum shift.\n\nIn Arizona, which was tied in 2020, Trump is up by 2.5 points.\n\nA 0.4-point deficit in Georgia four years ago is a 2.4-point lead today.\n\nTrump was down by 8.2 in 2020 in Michigan, but now the deficit in one of the two states in which he trails is a coin flip: 0.4 points.\n\nNorth Carolina has moved from a 0.6-point hole to a 1-point lead.

So that's a sufficient deterrent for almost everybody,\" Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Newsweek in an interview. \"It's probably a very small number of people who even attempt it.\"Republicans have continually raised concerns about voter fraud during and following the 2020 presidential election. Donald Trump and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in various courts in an effort to challenge the election, many of those cases resting on claims of voter fraud.Of the 62 lawsuits, only one succeeded before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned the initial ruling.\"Judges heard the cases, they reviewed the evidence—both Republican and Democratic judges,\" West said. \"There were judges appointed by Donald Trump, and they all reached the conclusion there was not widespread ballot fraud and the election was not stolen.\"Brookings reviewed more than the court cases in writing their report. In the report, titled, \"How widespread is election fraud in the United States? Not very,\" the authors reviewed historical data from the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation, which spearheaded the now-famous Project 2025.Heritage laid out cases in every state, creating the \"Election Fraud Database,\" which found 1,561 instances of voter fraud that resulted in 1,325 convictions. Of those, 20 cases were brought in 2024, with charges ranging from ineligible voting to false registrations, duplicate voting and ineligible voting.However, the full list of instances stretches back for years, with the earliest instance cited from 1982 (which included 63 individuals and an estimated 100,000 fraudulent ballots). Most of the instances included one offender.\"There are a few cases of election fraud in every campaign,\" West said. \"But it's not systemic. It's not widespread. It's generally not organized, and I don't think ever has affected the actual outcome, but people often pick on isolated cases and turn it into a systemic and widespread pattern.\"The Brookings report noted that over the 25 years covering the bulk of the cases cited by Heritage, there were 36 elections held. In the case of Arizona—one of the states most closely watched following the 2020 election—that meant around 42.6 million votes cast with only 36 cases of fraud in total.Pennsylvania, which many have pinned as the state that could very well decide the election, had over 100 million votes cast in 32 elections across 30 years and only around 39 cases of voter fraud.\"There have been allegations of widespread ballot fraud, but it's really not indicated by the Heritage database,\" West stressed.Newsweek reached out to the Heritage Foundation by email on Thursday for comment.","summary":"The Heritage Foundation found that voter fraud has occurred but in very small numbers.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/voter-fraud-us-elections-data-research-1978342","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2509523/election-voter-fraud-california-primaries.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:44:02","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":261870280,"title":"Mark Cuban tries to 'clarify' after comment on 'The View' widely seen as insult toward pro-Trump women","text":"Billionaire Mark Cuban appeared to try and spin him out of a mess, after making some insulting comments on \"the View\" about women who support former President Trump.

I told him, very pointedly, ‘Look Mark, I’ve got a lot of things to do, I just can’t be taking so many pointless calls from you,’\" Trump continued. \"In any event, that affected him greatly, because he’s a very insecure guy, and a MAJOR LOSER, always has been and always will be! Nobody likes him, nobody respects him, and he’s unattractive both inside and out! He should go back to talk about the person he was forced to support, because I didn’t want it, Lyin’ Kamala Harris. Also, he’s got no clubhead speed!

Florida senator Marco Rubio interrupted a campaign rally in Pennsylvania to deliver the \"breaking news\" of Biden's remarks, eliciting boos from the crowd. \n\n\"That's terrible,\" Trump responded. \"Remember Hillary, she said \"deplorable\"... that didn't work out. 'Garbage' I think is worse, right?\"\n\nTrump was making a comparison to Hillary Clinton's infamous 2016 comment that some of his supporters were a \"basket of deplorables.\"\n\nHe followed up with a rally in North Carolina where he argued Biden had \"finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters\".\n\nBut that wasn't enough for Trump the showman. \n\nAt his next campaign stop in Wisconsin, he emerged from his plane dressed in a fluoro orange vest before walking across the tarmac and onto a rubbish truck emblazoned with Trump campaign signage.\n\n\"How do you like my garbage truck?\" he asked through the window of the passenger seat. \"This truck is in honour of Kamala and Joe Biden.\"\n\nCutting through competing controversies\n\nThe final few days ahead of any big election become a frenzy as candidates pick up the pace and the media's interest ramps right up. \n\nWhile the twin \"garbage\" controversies have certainly created a distraction on both sides, it's not clear whether either will have any meaningful impact on the campaign. \n\nBut Biden's comments, on a call with a Latino voting group, were made around the same time that his vice-president was making one of her biggest speeches since securing the Democratic nomination.\n\nHarris made a symbolic choice in delivering what was billed as her \"closing argument\" from the same spot near the White House where Trump rallied his supporters ahead of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \n\n\"Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other,\" she told the tens of thousands of people gathered around the National Mall.\n\n\"I will always listen to you, even if you don't vote for me.\"\n\nHarris has spent considerable energy trying to reach conservative voters who would normally vote Republican but can't stomach Trump.\n\nAt her rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania this week, I met Justin Warren – a \"life-long Republican\" who's thrown his support behind the vice-president. \n\nHe described Biden's comments as a \"terrible statement\".\n\n\"I'm not going to try to explain why he would say that, you know it could have been a slip or a gaffe on his part. That's wrong.\"\n\nHowever, he accepted the vice-president's response when she said she \"strongly disagreed\" with criticism of people based on who they vote for. And he didn't think it would hurt her efforts to reach more voters on his side of politics.\n\n\"I think silently there are a lot of Republicans that feel the same way I do,\" he said. \n\n\"They're just afraid to speak out.\"\n\n'A long history of hate'\n\nDemocrats had earlier seized on the Hinchcliffe joke, using it to try to connect with Latino voters in the seven swing states where the election is likely to be decided.\n\nTrump's team made the relatively rare move of issuing a statement after the Madison Square Garden rally to say the comedian's views didn't reflect those of the former president.\n\nTrump later claimed he didn't know Hinchcliffe, and that he'd done more for Puerto Rico than any other president. But he didn't publicly condemn the joke and he defended the rally more generally as a \"love fest\".\n\nPeople living on the island territory can't vote in presidential elections.\n\nBut there's a significant population of people with Puerto Rican heritage living in areas like the majority Latino city of Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Trump campaigned amid the fallout. \n\nSome of his supporters there – including a woman with family in Puerto Rico – pointed out that it wasn't Trump himself who'd made the \"garbage\" comment. \n\nWhile Christian Rice, a 23-year-old who was dressed in an American flag jumpsuit, argued it wouldn't shift the needle given how baked in views of Trump already were.\n\n\"Nobody's voting for Trump because they think he's a super well-spoken, very respectful guy,\" he told me. \n\n\"He's a guy who says his mind and people around him say their minds. I don't think it's beneficial, but I don't think it's going to change anything dramatically in the election cycle.\"\n\nA small group of Latino protesters marching outside the event didn't see it that way.\n\n\"These recent comments, it's just a long history of hate,\" demonstrator Armando Jimenez said. \"They're saying out loud the quiet part.\"\n\nOne to watch: Troubling signs ahead?\n\nThe chaotic aftermath of the 2020 election has loomed large over preparations for next week.\n\nTrump has spent years claiming election fraud cost him the presidency. That's despite exhaustive investigations that found no evidence to support it.\n\nNow, Trump and some of his allies look to be laying the groundwork to make a similar claim if he's defeated.\n\nFlashpoints have already emerged. Trump has levelled cheating claims in Pennsylvania’s Lancaster County, where investigations are underway into suspicious voter registration applications.\n\nLocal officials insist the detection of the potentially problematic forms shows their systems are working.\n\nSecurity has been stepped up at election offices, including in Arizona’s Maricopa County, where armed protesters gathered in 2020.\n\nAnd concerns have been raised about Trump supporters trying to block the certification of election results at either a state or local level.\n\nIf the outcome is close, legal challenges from both sides could continue for months afterwards. So while we're in the final leg of the race, the finish line might be further away than it looks.\n\nOn that note, a quick thank you to our readers for joining me in these weekly updates on what has been an extraordinary election so far. \n\nSee you on the other side.","summary":"As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris blitz the swing states in the final days before the US election, twin \"garbage\" controversies have created headaches for both sides.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-01/trump-harris-biden-garbage-week-in-us-politics-macmillan/104547358","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8c8029609bb8298c9a51725c073a4b07?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2264&cropW=4025&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:42:27","author":"Jade Macmillan","authors":["Jade Macmillan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":261869650,"title":"The 2024 choice on taxes: Harris would boost them — Trump, lower them","text":"If you’d like more cash in your pocket and an economy fired up by tax cuts, then Donald Trump is your man hands down.\n\nNo one is more eager to cut taxes than Trump.\n\nCertainly not Kamala Harris; she’ll have you paying your “fair share” — over and over and over again.\n\nLook at their plans.\n\nTrump, for starters, would make the individual income- and estate-tax cuts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. \n\nThe law’s set to expire in 2025, meaning instant tax hikes of nearly $5 trillion, absent any action. Yikes!\n\nRecall that the TCJA lowered tax rates not just for the wealthy (as the left falsely claims) but for households across every income level, per the Tax Foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, its cuts to the corporate income-tax rate — to just 21% — helped kick-start the economy.\n\nTrump would also:\n\nScrap the $10,000 limit on the state-and-local-tax deduction (benefitting heavily taxed New Yorkers, in particular).\n\nCut the corporate tax rate by yet another point, to 20%, and to 15% for domestic production.\n\nMake Social Security payments, overtime pay and income form tips tax-free.\n\nCreate an itemized deduction for auto-loan interest.\n\nTrue, Trump has talked about slapping tariffs on imports, some of which could be passed along to US consumers.\n\nYet the ex-prez hopes to use them to promote US jobs — and to counter tariffs on US good exports abroad.\n\nThat could lead to new trade deals that benefit Americans.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is champing at the bit to jack up taxes, hoping to match or beat President Biden’s plan to boost them by $5 trillion over 10 years.\n\nShe’s been mum on the TCJA and SALT deduction but claims she’ll make the wealthy pay their “fair share” — which plainly means tax hikes.\n\nFor the record, after the Trump cuts fully kicked in, per the National Taxpayer’s Union Foundation, the top 1% of filers made 26% of total adjusted gross income in 2021 but ponied up 46% of federal income taxes. \n\nThe bottom 50% of earners paid just 2%.\n\nYet Harris would slam the wealthy (and others) even more. \n\nAnd some of her plans are downright radical.\n\nFor example, she’d impose — for the first time ever — a capital-gains tax on unrealized “income” over $5 million.\n\nThat would be a major blow to the economy, as the few nations that have tried similar schemes found out.\n\nHarris would also boost the top individual income-tax rate to 39.6%, the capital-gains tax rate to 28% and the Medicare tax to 2.1%.\n\nPerhaps her biggest smacks to the economy: goosing the corporate-tax rate to 28% and the alternative minimum corporate tax to 15%.\n\nThat would make the US business taxes the second-highest among all OECD nations, telling companies they’re better off doing business abroad.\n\nHmm: What’s her goal — to Make America Last Again?\n\nNo wonder the Tax Foundation found her proposals would cut long-term Gross Domestic Product by 2%, wages by 1.2% and employment by 786,000 full-time equivalent jobs.\n\nIt would also make it harder to address runaway deficits — and you can bet federal spending under Harris, as under President Biden, would swell red ink even more.\n\nSay hello to inflation yet again.\n\nTrump’s plan, by contrast, would boost long-run GDP by 0.8%, wages by 0.8% and employment by 597,000 FTE jobs.\n\nBottom line: If you like high taxes, a shrinking economy, runaway federal deficits and inflation, Kamala Harris will deliver big time.\n\nBut for lower taxes, a growing economy and more globally competitive US businesses, there’s just one option: Donald Trump.","summary":"If you’d like more cash in your pocket and an economy fired up by tax cuts, then Donald Trump is your man hands down.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/31/opinion/the-2024-choice-on-taxes-harris-would-boost-them-trump-lower-them/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-hdgd16egh-1730416319212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1730401991&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:37:50","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":261870928,"title":"Trump co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro suspended from practicing law in New York","text":"A state appeals court in New York on Thursday suspended Kenneth Chesebro, who struck a plea deal with prosecutors pursuing the 2020 election interference case against former President Donald Trump, from practicing law there. In a ruling Thursday, the court found that Chesebro's felony conviction in his criminal indictment in Fulton County, Georgia, over his efforts to overturn Trump's election loss in that state \"categorically meets the definition of a serious crime in this state\" and warranted the decision to bar him from practicing law in New York. His suspension was \"effective immediately, and until further order\" of the court, according to the ruling. Chesebro was indicted in Fulton County in August 2023 along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants in connection with efforts to overturn the Trump's defeat in the state to President Joe Biden. Trump has pleaded not guilty. Chesebro was indicted on seven counts, and in a plea deal with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty in October last year to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents and agreed to testify in the case. Chesebro helped devise a strategy to create false pro-Trump slates of electors in Georgia, and other states he lost to Biden, the indictment alleged. An attorney for Chesebro did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening. After Chesebro’s deal was reached last year, his attorney, Scott Grubman, said it was incorrect to characterize Chesebro as the architect of a scheme to overrun democracy. Some legal groups filed ethics complaints against Chesebro with the New York Supreme Court’s attorney grievance committee in 2022. One of the groups, The 65 Project, which had cited the false electors scheme and argued in its complaint that there was a “serious risk\" that Chesebro would repeat the conduct unless the New York Supreme Court took action, lauded Chesebro's suspension in a statement Thursday. “Ken Chesebro having his law license suspended should serve as a stark warning of what will happen if lawyers violate their oaths as officers of the court to knowingly lie to subvert democracy,” said the group's executive director, Michael Teter. Chesebro was admitted to practice law in New York in 2007. He also is licensed to practice in Massachusetts, California, Texas, Florida and Illinois, the court noted. His suspension is the latest example of attorneys' facing discipline for their efforts to overturn Trump's election loss in 2020. Rudy Giuliani, an attorney who helped Trump file legal challenges to the 2020 results, lost his legal license in New York in July and was disbarred in Washington, D.C., last month. Jenna Ellis, another Trump attorney, was banned in May from practicing law in Colorado for three years.","summary":"A state appellate court in New York suspended Kenneth Chesebro, who struck a plea deal with prosecutors pursuing the 2020 election interference case against former President Donald Trump, from practicing law there.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-co-defendant-kenneth-chesebro-suspended-law-new-york-rcna178312","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-10/231023-Kenneth-Chesebro-al-1013-5ef9aa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-31 23:36:59","author":"Zoë Richards","authors":["Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274}]}
