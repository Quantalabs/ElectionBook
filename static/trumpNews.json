Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost,' wrote the Minority Leader. \n\nClay Travis responded: 'Democrats are lining up to oppose crime being lower in DC. It’s bonkers.' \n\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer took his own path to criticizing Trump's call.\n\nHe asked: 'For all the talk Republicans give about giving their localities their rights, where are they now?'\n\n'If this was anything other than a political ploy and attempted distraction from Trump’s other scandals, if he actually cared about the people of DC, he’d demand the House finally release the billion dollars of DC’s funding they’ve been sitting on for months.'\n\nSocialist Democrat New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani began what he called an anti-Trump tour on Monday saying he would 'fight back' if Trump threatened to do the same to his birthplace. \n\n'He requires a response that showcases the ability to fight back against that same agenda, and what I would do if and when he makes these kinds of threats with regard to New York City,' he said, according to CBS News. \n\nTrump took the extraordinary move Monday to make good on his commitment to law and order.\n\n'We're going to take our capitol back,' he added. \n\nFlanked by cabinet members Attorney General Pam Bondi, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro, FBI Director Kash Patel, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Interior Director Doug Burgum, Trump said he would instruct federal law enforcement officials to deploy aggressive tactics against the city's worst offenders. \n\n'You spit and we hit and we can hit real hard,' he said. \n\nThe president also vowed to clear out camps of homeless people from Washington, DC parks and public lands. \n\nFederal law officials began their citywide deployment over the weekend, ramping up a public display of force that was seen immediately by residents. \n\n'Our Capital City has been overtaken by violent gangs, bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people, and we're not going to let it happen anymore,' he said. 'We're not going to take it.'\n\nThe plan was in part vengeance for 'Big Balls.' \n\nAround 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 3, Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency employee, was the victim of an attempted carjacking near the popular 14th Street nightlife corridor. \n\n'He was left dripping in blood. He thought he was dead with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive,' Trump said.\n\nThe neighborhood is known for political hotspots like Le Diplomate - a favorite of former President Joe Biden - beer gardens, bars and the nightclub Black Cat. \n\nPolice said a group of teenagers approached Coristine and a female companion and demanded his vehicle. \n\nCoristine, who now works for the Social Security Administration, pushed the woman into his car before he was assaulted. \n\nSince the attack, two 15-year-olds not from D.C. - but from nearby Hyattsville, Maryland - were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking.\n\nThe president also highlighted recent horrific crimes in the city including a 21-year-old congressional intern who was hit by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting and killed, a former Trump administration official murdered in a carjacking, and a Democratic congressman who was carjacked at gunpoint.\n\nTrump also recalled a 'demented lunatic' that stabbed an aide to Sen. Rand Paul in 2023 and a three-year-old girl who was shot and killed near the US Capitol while she was sitting in a car. \n\nIn the same Truth Social post, the president demanded that teenagers involved in these types of crime be prosecuted as adults. \n\n'They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it's going to happen now!' Trump warned. \n\nThe president's claim that crime has spike has been contested by the D.C.'s Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has pointed to stats that show violent crime has decreased in the District since 2023. \n\nViolent crime in DC is down 26 percent this year and in 2024 reached a 30-year low, with 190 homicides in 2024 compared to 274 in 2023, according to metro police department statistics.\n\n'The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,' Trump said in a Sunday night Truth Social post. \n\nIn April, Bowser announced the creation of a special police force specifically to tackle underage crime. \n\nIn an interview on MSNBC Sunday, she pushed back on White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller saying that D.C. was 'more violent than Baghdad.'\n\n'Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,' Bowser said. \n\nTrump has also threatened to 'FEDERALIZE this City.' \n\nTrump doesn't have the unilateral power to do such a thing - it would take congressional action. \n\nCongress would need to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows DC residents to elect their mayor and city council. \n\nDespite having more residents than Vermont and Wyoming, DC lacks congressional representation due to its non-state status.\n\nWhile Republicans control both chambers, a repeal would likely face a Democratic Senate filibuster and strong opposition from DC's 700,000 residents. \n\nNevertheless, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andy Ogles introduced the \"BOWSER Act\" in February, which would repeal Home Rule one year after passage.","summary":"Clinton, who famously lost the 2016 election to Trump, slammed the president for the move to federalize the policing of DC.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14991513/Hillary-Clinton-slammed-Dems-response-Trump-DC-crackdown.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/12/01/101127981-0-image-a-28_1754958322712.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/11/518177858179452868/1024x576_MP4_518177858179452868.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-12 01:17:44","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Speaking to Axios on Monday, Trump evoked the traumatic events of the October 2023 terrorist attack as a stark reminder of the threat posed by the group.\n“I have one thing to say: remember October 7, remember October 7,” Trump told Axios, referencing the attack that claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people in Israel and resulted in the kidnapping of approximately 250 others. The incident marked the beginning of a prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has now extended for nearly two years and drawn in multiple Arab nations in the region.\nTrump confirmed that he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. The two leaders reportedly discussed Israel’s ongoing military operations in Gaza, including plans for an invasion of Gaza City. The US President said he believes military pressure is the most effective way to dismantle Hamas.\n“It was always going to be very rough to get them out,” Trump acknowledged while talking about hostages under the control of Hamas. He added, “[Hamas] are not going to let the hostages out in the current situation,” expressing scepticism about the likelihood of their release through diplomacy alone.\nTrump also endorsed Israel’s approach, stating that he would not interfere and would allow the country to proceed with its plans.\nNetanyahu, however, has come under growing international criticism over his government’s plans to evacuate Gaza City and impose military control over the Strip. His push for a full occupation has raised humanitarian concerns and drawn sharp condemnation from global leaders.\nIn recent developments, Australia has joined a number of countries in expressing support for recognising Palestinian statehood. The move is seen as an attempt to pressure Israel into addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and returning to ceasefire negotiations. Meanwhile, Germany has announced it will halt arms exports to Israel that could be used in operations targeting civilians in Gaza. Several other nations are reportedly reviewing their military and diplomatic ties with Israel in response to the ongoing crisis.","summary":"Trump confirmed that he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/remember-october-7-donald-trump-says-hamas-cannot-be-allowed-to-remain-in-gaza-ws-l-9499475.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/dc-trump-2025-08-d24dd2de0fb65a47692c3d57dff665b8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:51:14","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.137},{"id":350228630,"title":"Zelensky signals Ukraine may give land to Russia in surprise peace move","text":"Ukraine may be prepared to give up territory already seized by Russia in a surprise shift towards a European-backed peace deal, it has emerged. President Volodymyr Zelensky is understood to have privately told European leaders that while any future peace must not involve further land concessions , Ukraine could consider freezing the frontline where it currently stands. This would effectively mean allowing Russia to retain control of areas it occupies in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea. The development comes amid growing unease in Kyiv and European capitals over a planned meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin , due to take place in Alaska on Friday. Western officials fear the two leaders could attempt to strike a deal over Ukraine’s head, leaving Zelensky sidelined. The Telegraph reports that Zelensky has urged European leaders to reject any settlement proposed by Trump that includes Ukraine giving up additional land. However, the current European-backed plan represents a softer negotiating stance and is believed to reflect mounting pressure to find a diplomatic end to the grinding conflict. One Western official, describing a flurry of weekend diplomacy, said the proposals must relate only to the territory currently held by each side's forces. The United States is said to have reassured European allies that they will be consulted ahead of the Trump-Putin talks, but concern remains. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk admitted he was filled with both fear and hope as the diplomatic manoeuvring intensified. Russia, meanwhile, is continuing to push its own version of a peace deal, which would see Ukraine pull out of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk still under its control. European diplomats insist there has been no real change in Moscow’s long-term goals, which include replacing Ukraine’s Western-aligned government with a Kremlin-friendly regime. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia is still seeking Ukraine’s full capitulation, a permanent block on NATO membership, and a complete demilitarisation of the country. Despite the talk of peace, Zelensky said on Monday night there were no signs Russia was serious about ending the war. Citing intelligence reports, he claimed Moscow was actively repositioning troops in preparation for new offensives. While Ukraine may now be open to a limited territorial compromise, officials insist any settlement must include strong security guarantees, continued weapons deliveries, and a clear path to NATO membership. The diplomatic pressure is mounting, but the fight for Ukraine’s future is far from over.

Antoni, as the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE. I know E.J. Antoni will do an incredible job in this new role. Congratulations E.J.!\"\n\nBefore the Heritage Foundation, he worked for the Texas Public Policy Commission. He holds master's and doctorate degrees in economics from Northern Illinois University.\n\nLast week, Antoni posted on X: \"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data -- that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years.\"\n\nOn Nov. 13, one week after Trump was elected again, he wrote on X: \"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS.\"\n\nAntoni had called for the firing of McEntarfer on Steve Bannon's podcast after the July jobs report was released. Later that day, she lost her job.\n\n\"Last weeks Job's Report was RIGGED,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, three days after the report came out. \"Those big adjustments were made to cover up, and level out, the FAKE political numbers that were CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!\"\n\nBannon, who was Trump's chief strategist for a portion of his first term, had advocated for hiring Antoni, who interviewed for the post, The Wall Street Journal on Sunday reported.\n\nSenate Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage and confirmation only requires 50 votes.

ICE has begun hiring thousands of new agents; it is trying to lure recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, and last week Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires. Six months into his second term, Trump’s immigration policy is what many feared it would be when he was elected. This goes beyond simply getting “tough” on immigration. The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy. In the next month, detentions under the Trump administration are expected to hit 60,000 people — the highest number in modern history. And the vast majority of those detained have no criminal record, no pending charges and, in many cases, they have a legal basis to be in the country. But that no longer seems to matter. The goal isn’t justice. It’s fear and authoritarian control. Let’s be clear: The immigration system was broken before Trump returned to office. Our asylum system was overwhelmed, our visa and green-card processes were slow and under-resourced, and our immigration courts were backlogged by years. But instead of fixing any of this, the Trump administration has chosen to make things worse — on purpose. And in doing so, they’ve turned immigration enforcement into a cudgel that is destroying the core pillars of our democracy. As we at the American Immigration Council laid out in a recent report, Trump’s second-term immigration policies, in just six months, represent an unprecedented and coordinated assault on democratic rights and principles. We are now witnessing the routine violation of rights that most Americans consider fundamental. Despite the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech, the administration revoked student visas because of their political opinions. Despite the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, ICE uses secrecy and sometimes deception to detain immigrants and even U.S. citizens in public spaces. And despite the Fifth Amendment’s promise of due process, the administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men to El Salvador’s hellhole CECOT prison, based on vague, unchallengeable allegations of gang affiliation. The Trump administration’s immigration policies aren’t just violating individual rights; they are also an attack on the constitutional structure that upholds American democracy. This system of checks and balances exists to ensure that no single branch or leader can act with unchecked power. Yet the administration has bypassed Congress, refused to spend funds legally allocated for refugee resettlement, legal aid for children and support for local governments. It tested the limits of federalism by deploying California’s National Guard, without the governor’s consent, to suppress largely peaceful protests. And it has targeted public officials and advocates — prosecuting judges, members of Congress and observers of ICE operations — for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement. When courts, including the Supreme Court, have tried to impose limits, the administration has responded by attacking the judiciary’s legitimacy and smearing individual judges. Trump’s immigration policies have become a testing ground for unchecked executive power and the erosion of procedural rights. Sidestepping Congress, defying court orders and coercing states into collaboration are all violations of long-standing democratic norms. So long as they are left unchallenged, they set a deeply troubling precedent. All of this is feeding into a vast and increasingly punitive immigration enforcement system, which is now operating at historic levels. In addition to hiring thousands of new ICE agents, the federal government is rapidly expanding detention capacity, filling private jails and converted military sites with thousands of people, most of whom have never been charged with a crime. Conditions inside are dangerous and degrading, marked by medical neglect, overcrowding and abuse. This escalation is being driven by an interagency operation that now spans state law enforcement, the military and multiple federal agencies. People are being arrested outside preschools in front of their children and while attending appointments for their citizenship interviews. Immigration courts have effectively become traps, where immigrants who show up for their day in court are instead detained so that the government can try to deport them without a hearing. The government has tossed aside due process to deport people to war zones and megaprisons without hearings, legal representation or notice. Supporters of this agenda pretend the policies are about public safety. But they make us less safe. In immigrant-heavy communities, people are afraid to report real crime — like in Tennessee, where, according to a police chief, a child may have died because their noncitizen caretaker was scared to call 911 given the recent immigration raids in the state. And by prioritizing immigration enforcement above all other public safety and law enforcement goals, Trump is diverting resources away from where they’re needed. What’s left is a chilling message: No immigrant is safe, no matter their background, status or contribution to society — and mass deportation comes at any cost, including Americans’ safety. There is a better way. A fair, efficient and humane immigration system would target the country’s limited enforcement resources on genuine threats, not high school theater teachers, makeup artists and kitchen workers. It would process asylum claims promptly and fairly, offer legal pathways for longtime residents and restore faith in the rule of law. It would cost less, work better and uphold our values far more than mass detention and mass deportation ever could. What’s at stake is not only the treatment of immigrants but the integrity of our democracy. When the government discards due process and the executive branch wields power without oversight, the legal safeguards that protect all of us begin to collapse. No matter the justification, a nation governed by law cannot afford to normalize lawlessness.","summary":"ICE is luring recruits with $50,000 signing bonuses, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem lifted the age cap for new ICE hires, and detentions are expected to hit 60,000 soon.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-record-ice-detentions-rcna223773","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-camarillo-calif-federal-agents-block-protesters-during-ice-raid-ac-902p-423d4e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:34:19","author":"Nayna Gupta","authors":["Nayna Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":350233526,"title":"President Trump Open to Sales of Nvidia's Modified AI Chips in China Amid Security Debate","text":"In a move that signals a potential shift in trade and technology policies, President Donald Trump has signaled openness to allow the sale of a modified version of Nvidia's next-generation AI chips in China.

Email ciaran.foreman@mailonline.co.uk \nBy CIARAN FOREMAN, TRAINEE REPORTER and TOM COTTERILL, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:01:28 BST, 12 August 2025 |Updated:01:31 BST, 12 August 2025 \n\nIt's the south coast tourist mecca, famed for attracting tourists, partying students, families and stag dos seeking a relaxing seaside staycation.\nBut Bournemouth has become Britain's new 'Wild West', with locals avoiding parts of the town at night for fear of becoming a victim of crime.\nIn one street alone, two of the town's historic hotels have been turned into asylum seeker hotels, with dozens of criminals charges brought agains thtose staying there.\nAt Meyrick Road's Britannia and Roundhouse hotels, some 91 criminal charges have been levelled at migrants staying there.\nIt's a similar picture at the nearby Chine Hotel, a mile away, where another 25 charges against migrants have been brought following a spate of alleged crimes in the town.\nMeyrick Road, once a bustling arterial route to Bournemouth's stunning sandy beach and town centre, is now plagued by a palpable feeling of unease.\n'I used to walk comfortably in the evening, but I don't go out now,' one man, who lives near the hotels but was too scared to give his name, tells the Daily Mail.\n'When I walk past the Roundhouse there are groups of people and you're never quite sure what's going to happen.' \n'It's not the same place, that's for sure. It's a more dangerous place, without any doubt. Especially for women late at night, and I don't think people would disagree with that.'\nSecurity guards and police now patrol the tree-lined street – with officers seen talking to migrants loitering outside the hotel when Daily Mail visited.\nThere are fears, too, the level of alleged criminality is now out of control – and could spark a riot from locals, who have already staged protests outside the venues.\n\nProtests in Bournemouth have taken place recently, including at The Chine Hotel (as seen above), where the Mail on Sunday found 25 charges had been brought against migrants\n\n45 charges were brought against those staying at the Britannia Hotel (above), the investigation uncovered\n\nMail on Sunday investigations revealed that 46 criminal charges had been brought against migrants at the Roundhouse Hotel (above)\n\nOver the weekend, a large protest was staged outside the asylum hotels in Meyrick Road, as concern continues to mount over to safety of locals living next to the venues \n\nThe Chine Hotel in Bournemouth is used by asylum seekers and is a hotspot for British holidaymakers\n\nAt the Chine Hotel (back centre), another 25 charges against migrants have been brought following a spate of alleged crimes in the town \nLast month the Mail on Sunday revealed how 116 charges – mainly of alleged assault – have been brought against 51 migrants living across the town's three seafront hotels.\nSome 46 criminal charges have been brought against asylum seekers at the Roundhouse Hotel, 45 at the neighbouring Britannia and 25 at the Chine Hotel in Boscombe Spa Road.\nThose troubling statistics lend themselves to the tinderbox feeling which has gripped Britain this summer, with recent protests exploding outside hotels that are housing asylum seekers in places like Epping, Essex, and Canary Wharf in central London.\n'I've lived here since 2008 and I can say that Bournemouth has changed,' one man tells the Mail as he points to his flat, yards away from the Britannia Hotel.\nOther recent instances, not linked to migrants, have seen youngsters plaguing the picturesque resort with the stench of marijuana and inhaling nitrous oxide 'hippy crack' balloons in front of families, as locals fear the town is slipping into chaos.\nBournemouth local Adam Elcock says his beloved town was on the cusp of descending into complete lawlessness.\n'Walking through town, it is a very different place now,' he adds. 'The whole atmosphere, the people wandering around that clearly aren't local, the way that they treat...It is quite literally the Wild West here, and the place is out of control.'\n\nPolice are patrolling the streets, both on foot and in vehicles - some of them unmarked - and officers can be seen in deep discussion with hotel residents (above) and the security guards stationed outside\n\nOne protester in a hard hat approaches police during a protest outside Bournemouth's migrant hotels\n\nSome protesters attending the rally on August 8 carried signs saying 'House Brits not illegals'\n\nRecent instances of sex attacks on the beach tell their own story of a town slipping into chaos, with youngsters plaguing the picturesque location with the stench of marijuana and inhaling nitrous oxide 'hippy crack' balloons (as seen above)\n\nThe Boscombe Spa Hotel in Bournemouth was later renamed the Chine Hotel (pictured)\n\nOne of the pictures in the book shows the Metropole Hotel in Bournemouth in May 1943 after it was bombed by the Luftwaffe in the Second World War, killing 200 people\n\nEXCLUSIVE Migrants in taxpayer-funded hotels across the UK accused of offences including rape and robbery \nWomen in the town now fear walking alone there, with two telling the Mail they try to avoid the hotels entirely after an incident that left them unnerved.\nOne woman, who didn't want to be named but works nearby, says: 'We don't feel safe here anymore. It's probably a combination of things but it doesn't help having lots of people scattered across hotels in the area.'\nThe local, who was speaking while an older woman with her nodded her head, continues: 'We went into a nearby hotel together to try and get into the swimming pool for a quick dip, and we were told to leave the property because they were housing asylum seekers.\n'We were shocked, but in hindsight we did think it was a bit strange that it was looking so rundown. There were bags of rubbish hanging out the windows and then people started shouting out the windows at us as we left.\n'We didn't hear what they said. I don't think it was English, but we felt a bit intimidated and left. We haven't been back since.'\nBut the concerns aren't just limited to locals; tourists venturing to the town have also claimed to have fallen victim to males allegedly jeering at them from one of the hotels.\nNeil Clegg, 57, from Worcester Park, London, had travelled down to holiday by the seaside for the first time in a decade and said things had soured on his trip to the point that his partner's children were no longer allowed outside alone.\n'My partner has two girls and a son, and they were coming back the other day and another girl was being harassed outside the Roundhouse, so we don't let them out now alone in the evenings,' he says.\n\nNeil Clegg (above), who was holidaying in Bournemouth near the Roundhouse and Britannia, said things had soured on his trip to the point that his partner's children were no longer allowed outside alone\n\nAt Meyrick Road's Britannia and Roundhouse hotels, some 91 criminal charges have been levelled at migrants staying there\n\nThousands of people pack the beach in Bournemouth on Sunday as holidaymakers enjoy the golden sands and blue skies in Dorset\n\nBournemouth beach full of locals and tourists on Sunday as the warm weather continues in the UK\n\nWalking down Bournemouth's Meyrick Road there is a palpable feeling of tension, unease, and discontent (Pictured: Bournemouth Pier just minutes away from the street)\n\nPictured is Bournemouth's high street back in June 2021, with shoppers walking through it\n\nMany bikes are parked outside the hotels - though it is unclear what they are being used for\n\nProtestors gather outside the Roundhouse Hotel in Bournemouth on August 9 after it was announced as being used as a migrant hotel\n\nAnti illegal immigration protesters demonstrate outside The Roundhouse hotel on August 9\n\n Protests at asylum hotels spread to Bournemouth, Norwich and Portsmouth \n'We always go out with them. It was so bad that we looked up the Roundhouse and it showed us how many asylum seekers they were holding.\n'They mill around. They're all blokes. I don't know where they're from but there hasn't been a direct problem for us. When I've walked past we've all been together and there haven't been any problems. But I believe that there could be.\n'I've never felt threatened here before, but I do now. You don't feel quite so safe anymore, and we wouldn't let the kids out now.\n'Particularly not an 18-year-old and 15-year-old girl. You can't have them walking alone in the area, which you could've done in the past.'\nIt comes after a weekend of disruption, which saw riot police being called in to separate two clashing groups of activists staging protests in Meyrick Road. \nAbout 300 people descended upon the street, in tense scenes the mirrored similar rallies nationwide, which exploded into violence.\nRoughly 200 of the activists were from an anti-immigration group, who chanted 'stop the boats and send them home' while waving the Union Flag or red and white St George one. \nAt the same time, 100 pro-migrant protesters chanted 'refugees are welcome here' while holding signs saying 'migrants make our NHS'. \n\nThe Roundhouse hotel is near the town centre and is being used to accommodate migrants\n\nPro-migrant activists face off against anti-immigration protests during a tense rally on August 8\n\nSome pro-immigration activists held signs saying 'refugees welcome' (pictured) \n\nAnti-immigration campaigners came holding the Union flag and flag of St George \nThe issue is so contentious that the town's Labour MP, Tom Hayes, last week called for the government to axe at least one of the three migrant hotels.\nIt comes amid concern over the impact the asylum accommodation is having on the town's vitally important tourism trade. \n'Their closure is really important for the recovery of the tourist economy,' Mr Hayes told the Sun over the weekend.\n'People haven't been coming to Bournemouth because they've been affected by the cost-of-living crisis, a global pandemic and austerity.\n'There's been a real decline in our coastal towns and I want zero asylum hotels in the country. I've already secured a commitment from the Government that there will be no more in Bournemouth.\n'I feel sure we'll see their closure starting within this next year.'\nBournemouth has recently hit the headlines following a spate of booze-fuelled antisocial behviour, which has seen violent gangs of men brawling with one another on the beach as families watch on in horror.\nPolice have attempted to clampdown on the mayhem during the summer, putting dispersal orders in place to try and break up large groups of troublemakers.\nBut those living in the town aren't convinced officers have a proper grip on the situation - with the migrant hotels only exacerbating the chaos, say locals. \n'There was also an incident with a knife in the town centre near the Roundhouse and there were police everywhere. We weren't allowed to leave the building we were in as we were close,' one woman adds.\nThat street fight occurred between the entrance to Bournemouth and Poole College and the Roundhouse, on January 25 last year.\nThe mass street brawl saw two Egyptian asylum seekers jailed after they stabbed a pair of Afghan college students with broken glass and a glass bottle.\n\nA street fight occurred between the entrance to Bournemouth and Poole College and the Roundhouse on January 25 last year, prompting a major police response\n\nArmed officers were at the scene of the incident where two Egyptian asylum seekers stabbed a pair of Afghan college students last year\n\nEXCLUSIVE Migrants in taxpayer-funded hotels across the UK accused of offences including rape and robbery \nSome locals who say they are frightened at such violence in the area becoming the norm told the Daily Mail how they have even begun labelling Friday night as 'Fight Night'.\nGeoff, 79, and Hilary, 78, moved to Bournemouth 14 years ago in search of solace after spending their working lives together under the bright lights of London.\nHowever, Hilary says the town she once thought was 'absolutely wonderful' is now 'ruined.\n'There are no shops, you can't go into town anymore, there are loads of druggies and drunks. We call Friday nights 'Fight Night' here,' she adds.\n'When we came here from London we thought it was absolutely wonderful, and it was, up until a few years ago. That being said, I do still love it here and think if we moved back to London it'd probably be even worse.'\nGeoff adds: 'There are a large number of people now here who are not adding anything to the community. What you see is 20 people lounging around, surrounding one cup of coffee all afternoon at local coffee bars.\n'To be honest the influx of immigrants isn't what has worried me. It's when I walk down the streets and there are hordes of people there and I'm thinking 'Why aren't they working?'\nNodding in agreement, Hilary continues: 'They're put in these hotels in this beautiful place. Who wouldn't like that when they're not paying a thing.'\n\nGeoff (left) and Hilary (right) moved to Bournemouth 14 years ago in search of solace after spending their working lives in London - but they say the town is 'ruined'\n\nMany of the hotels which are close to the Roundhouse and the Britannia boast both indoor and outdoor swimming pools, built-in gymnasiums and spa facilities.\nLuzchelle Villareal, 49, who is originally from the Philippines, but now lives in Oxford after becoming a British citizen, is paying just under £200 per night for her stay by the sea.\nMs Villareal sought to supports migrants after learning her holiday break away would be disrupted by protesters rallying against the asylum hotels. \n'I don't understand why people are protesting. I know they are asylum seekers but they're already here. What is the Government supposed to do?' she tells the Mail.\n'This has been happening a long time. I've been here for around 20 years and it's been happening ever since. Yes, they get benefits and sometimes I get annoyed because I pay tax and they get things for free - but why don't we embrace them?\n'I did everything the hard way, I had to take exams and adapt to everything, but I think we should embrace and help them because I think there will be more problems if we don't.\nShe adds: 'People from the Philippines, we work hard. We don't rely on the government and we don't mind paying tax, we work crazy hours but what do we get? Nothing.\n'But saying that, I think rather than making chaos for these people, we should embrace them. If you put yourself in their situation, I don't think this is where they want to be. They're just looking for a better life. They're the same as me. I'm just fortunate I came here legally.'\n\nLuzchelle Villareal (above), who is originally from the Philippines but is now a British citizen, fought the corner of the migrants who are currently being housed in Bournemouth\n\nMs Villareal says she is against protests outside migrant hotels when she spoke to the Mail \n\nEXCLUSIVE The seaside resort that's lost its shine: How Bournemouth has plunged into decline \nMs Villareal also says she wants to see stricter enforcement on the border by stopping people crossing the Channel illegally, but says she disagrees with protests outside the hotels.\n'I don't like them because you might see people hurting each other and it affects the place as well, and all the tourists,' she says.\nFoster carers Colin Wright, 59, and Denise Archer, 59, are some of those visitors who are affected by the protests - which saw dozens of people rallying outside the hotels last week,\nAfter making the trip down from Dartford, Kent, to spend their first holiday together in more than a decade, the couple said they were surprised to hear that asylum seekers were being put up in hotels - before asking for alternate directions back to where they are staying to avoid the migrant venues amid protests there.\n'The issue is not knowing who they are, and by that I mean their history. So you don't know what characters are here,' Mr Wright says.\n'Us spending £200 a night on a hotel feels like a slap in the face. France isn't giving migrants hotels - as far as I'm aware they're all in tents and waiting to come here. And the reason being is that they know it's better than a tent.\n'If you look at somewhere like Syria, they've got tented cities for refugees and no one's complaining about that. Try and put someone in a tent in this country or some redundant military base and everyone will go off their heads.\n\nFoster carers Colin Wright (left) and Denise Archer (right) were visiting Bournemouth for their first holiday together in a decade and had to ask for an alternate route back to their hotel so that they missed the protests\nWhile Ms Archer agrees with her partner's points, she says she sympathised with those in the hotels who may feel 'frightened' with protests raging outside.\n'I think people are so riled up because you see people really struggling to make ends meet, and for us to come down to Bournemouth is a real luxury, a real treat. It's been more than a decade since we've had a holiday on our own together,' she says\nColin agreed, adding: 'I don't want to see anyone intimidated or frightened. I do support peaceful protests.\n'I just don't know what it's come to, I really don't.'\nWhile Bournemouth's descent is not helped by such protests outside these hotels, many give a consensus the town is facing bigger problems.\nWhen the Daily Mail visited last month to speak with sunseekers and beachgoers, many spoke of an area which is declining far beyond the reason of the accommodation of asylum seekers.\nAt the beachfront we witnessed a bastion of bin bags and fast food boxes stacked in and around a solitary skip, creating a wall-climbing plant of rubbish, speeding bikes whipping by as they defiantly burn rubber over the promenade's 'No Cycling' signs.\nOne 35-year-old local who works as a barista confirmed such fears again on our most recent visit, saying: 'Bournemouth has gone downhill. I grew up in Poole and it's changed a lot.\n\nOn a Daily Mail visit to the area last month, we witnessed a bastion of bin bags and fast food boxes stacked in and around a solitary skip\n\nGroups of youngsters have been seen on the beach appearing to inhale balloons full of nitrous oxide\n\nA group of males were pictured on the seafront with balloons held to their lips - one of them appears to be holding a gas canister\n\n Furious locals set up 'vigilante' army in 'Wild West' seaside town \n'Our chambers are just down the road and I'd sometimes leave my car there and walk into town, but now I don't. I'd just drive now.\n'I probably would avoid walking around certain areas at night too now, which is sad to say. Although I don't think the reason for that is just because of asylum seekers.\n'I've never had problems with the hotels themselves, so I'd say maybe Bournemouth just isn't what it was.'\nA Government spokesman told the Mail: 'From over 400 asylum hotels open under the previous government in summer 2023, costing almost £9million a day, there are now fewer than 210, and we want them all closed by the end of this Parliament.\n'We will continue to work closely with community partners across the country, and discuss any concerns they have, as we look to fix this broken system together.'\nA Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council spokesman added: 'The Home Office are responsible for procuring and managing asylum accommodation.\n'The council carefully monitors the use of asylum hotels in Bournemouth and the impact of this on our statutory services, community safety and the local economy.'\nIn the meantime, the people of Bournemouth remain on edge, worried about what the future of such migrant hotels will have on its trade and image – and whether the town will ever be the same again.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritain's new 'Wild West': This seaside resort was loved by families...but now three historic hotels shut to house migrants are stoking a feeling of unease\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Washington DC-based Ezell said that while AI adoption would cause ‘churn, shift and change’, it also holds the potential to create 2.3 million new jobs in India by 2030 and add about $1.2–1.5 trillion to its economy.While India has overcome the historic lack of a concerted national AI strategy and underfunding, through the India AI Mission, it may be too little, he said. “But its $1.25 billion budget remains only a fraction of the amount that really needs to be invested to achieve the kind of Indian leadership in AI that will come from training AI systems on model data,” he said, while also acknowledging India’s strong talent base as the second-largest source of top-level AI talent globally.Ezell believes India’s continued restrictive data approach acts a major hindrance to its global AI competitiveness and stresses that data access is as important as human capital in building robust AI systems. “India doesn’t realise that data is an asset foundational to developing a competitive AI ecosystem, especially against China,” he said. Amid an onslaught of mass layoffs in the information technology sector that many fear is due to AI, Ezzell said AI’s impact will be job-transformative and not job-destructive, provided countries adopt the right policies.“Studies estimate artificial intelligence will impact at least 40% of jobs globally. However, the greater impact of AI will be on tasks performed by an individual, as opposed to that overall job,” Ezell insisted. Instead, AI may end up creating more jobs than now. “Economists estimate that for every one job the internet has destroyed, it has created 1.2 jobs,” he said.Ezell’s optimism stands in sharp contrast to rising layoffs in India’s tech industry. ‘Skill mismatch’ and a lack of ‘deployment feasibility’ have been cited by industry leader TCS as key reasons behind for sloughing off 12,000 employees over FY26. But according to market estimates, thousands of mid-level tech workers across the sector have been let go in recent quarters, often replaced by AI. Industry body Nasscom expects AI and automation-induced job cuts at IT firms over the next several months. “Technology is value neutral. AI is the most radically transformative tech, at least in the past century, and the economic impact is going to be profound. It should add $20 trillion to the global economy by 2030,” he said.Shifting stanceAs a close witness to DC policymaking, Ezzell also drew attention to the stark difference between the previous Joe Biden presidential administration and the current Donald Trump-led White House when it comes to AI policy. The erstwhile Biden administration, he said, had taken a more conservative and cautious route that focused more on regulating hypothetical risks.“Policymakers tend to want to regulate against speculative harms, as opposed to trying to address genuine challenges,” he said. The Trump administration, on the other hand, focuses more aggressively on global AI leadership, resulting in pushing for the diffusion of AI technologies developed in the US. Ezzell credited this strategy for giving rise to the National AI Plan, which emphasises on developing a comprehensive “AI stack” ranging from software, hardware, models, and data for global export. But for India, this shifting stance will be for nought if the US actively intends to gatekeep AI tech, and computing power. While the latest AI Policy calls for exporting the full US AI technology stack—hardware, models, software, applications, and standards—to allied nations willing to join America’s AI alliance, it also stresses on denying foreign adversaries access to US compute power as a matter of both geostrategic competition and national security.“On this, the focus is on countries that are foundationally techno-autocracies such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. India is not, and should not be included in this group,” Ezell said.","summary":"Stephen Ezell VP of Global Innovation Policy at ITIF tells Tanya Pandey &amp; Subhayan Chakraborty that AI is job transformative, not destructive","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/india-ai-budget-falls-short-of-needs/articleshow/123244799.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,height-900,imgsize-204414,resizemode-75,msid-123244799/tech/artificial-intelligence/india-ai-budget-falls-short-of-needs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:30:00","author":"Tanya Pandey & Subhayan Chakraborty, Ettech Last Updated: Aug 12, 2025, 06:00:00 Am Istfollow Usshar","authors":["Tanya Pandey & Subhayan Chakraborty, Ettech Last Updated: Aug 12, 2025, 06:00:00 Am Istfollow Usshar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.003},{"id":350228936,"title":"Electronics exporters eye new markets fearing Trump's tariff shocks","text":"As towering new tariffs reacquaint the world with lopsided levies last seen during the Great Depression nearly a century ago, local electronics companies are looking at alternative markets beyond the US – ironically, the primary revenue generator for the biggest Make-in-India success story.Europe, the Middle East and Africa are now featuring among alternative export destinations, sources said, while the US accounting for more than a third of industry shipments becomes a more difficult market, picketed by tariff guardrails and shifting content-origin goalposts.\"I have been reaching out to my customers proactively. They are still issuing orders, but there are concerns about how this will pan out.,” said Sanjay Agarwal, Managing Director, Globe Capacitors, which exports materials worth about Rs 100 crore annually to the US.“I have already controlled my purchases, especially for the materials I buy only for US customers,” Agarwal said. “As far as looking at alternative markets is considered, that is always on the horizon.”Trade uncertainty has pushed exporters of a range of electronics beyond the dominant smartphones and assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules to begin early discussions on ways to enter alternative markets, sources said.At the moment, most electronics exports, including smartphones, are exempt from the 25% tariffs imposed on India originally by US President Donald Trump, and the additional 25% set to go live from August 26. This is owing to an ongoing Section 232 investigation by the US Commerce Department as mandated under the Trade Expansion Act, 1962, the findings of which are set to be announced in the coming weeks.It is too early to assess the full impact of the trade changes being implemented by the US, but Indian firms with existing manufacturing footprint abroad may look to expand those operations, said Rajoo Goel, Secretary General, Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA).Material impact\"About 75-80% of India's electronics exports are currently exempt from the additional 50% tariff regime. In the case of smartphones and IT products such as tablets as flat panel displays, which are exempt, India's value addition is relatively lower since we are primarily doing assembly,” Goel said. “But for the remaining 25-30% products, such as PCB assemblies, telecom, consumer products, power electronics, which are subject to this new 50% tariff, our value addition is higher and would impact several domestic companies, including MSMEs.\"US-bound electronics exports jumped 43.5% to $15.89 billion in FY25. Smartphones made up 66% of this at $10.56 billion, and rose 89% in FY25.\"We are monitoring the situation closely and are looking at other markets for our products. For mobile phones, the Middle East and Africa are coming up as important destinations and for lighting, Europe is a market we are evaluating,\" said an executive at an electronic manufacturing service (EMS) firm.Assembled photovoltaic cells (PVC) modules were the second largest category, shrinking 32.7% to $1.81 billion in FY25, due to increasing restrictions on imported units. The rest was spread across electronic instruments ($1.4 billion), computer hardware ($154 million) such as laptops, and consumer electronics ($115 million) such as cameras.\"For the roughly $2 billion of electronics exports to the US, beyond smartphones and PVC, there are enough markets which exporters should explore, be it Europe, Australia or South East Asia. Given the geopolitical realignment that is happening, Russia should also be explored,\" Amrit Manwani, Chairman of electronic manufacturing services major Sahasra Group said. Echoing Goel, Manwani also said many firms may have to adapt and establish partial or full manufacturing in the US given its predominance as a market, if things don't ease.ETtech\n \"Just as there has been talk of supply chain resilience, companies will now have to wake up to demand resilience. Companies will have to look at other markets like the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Africa. It is an opportunity for Indian companies to go beyond the US and deepen their presence in other countries as well,\" another EMS executive said.","summary":"Faced with potential tariff hikes in the US, Indian electronics companies are actively exploring alternative export markets like Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Gen. Scott Sherman stated that military tapped to assist with domestic operations can protect federal property and federal agents in their mission carrying out federal operations. He mentioned they could undertake certain law enforcement actions, such as setting up a security perimeter outside of federal facilities, if a commander on the ground felt unsafe.\n\nSherman testified at the start of a three-day trial regarding whether President Donald Trump’s administration violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard soldiers and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles following June protests over immigration raids. The act generally restricts the military from engaging in civilian law enforcement. Trump has pushed the traditional bounds of military activity on domestic soil, also seen in the creation of militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMORE: Another 1,350 National Guard troops being withdrawn from Los Angeles, Pentagon says\n\nOn Monday, Trump announced he was deploying the National Guard across Washington, D.C., and taking over the city’s police department in an attempt to reduce crime, despite the mayor’s note that crime is declining in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe trial in San Francisco could set precedent for how Trump can deploy the guard in the future in California or other states.\n\nThe Trump administration federalized California National Guard members and dispatched them to the second-largest U.S. city against the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and city leaders after protests started June 7 when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested individuals at multiple locations.\n\nThe Department of Defense ordered the deployment of approximately 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles. Most of the troops have since departed but 250 National Guard members remain, according to the latest data provided by the Pentagon.\n\nCalifornia is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to return control of the remaining troops to the state and to stop the federal government from using military troops in California “to execute or assist in the execution of federal law or any civilian law enforcement functions by any federal agent or officer.”\n\nNewsom won an early victory from Breyer, who found the Trump administration violated the Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which defines power between federal and state governments, and exceeded its authority.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately appealed, arguing that courts can’t second guess the president’s decisions. It secured a temporary halt allowing control of the California National Guard to stay in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.\n\nAfter their deployment, the guard members accompanied federal immigration officers on raids in Los Angeles and at two marijuana farm sites in Ventura County while Marines mostly stood guard around a federal building in downtown Los Angeles that includes a detention center at the core of protests.\n\nSince June, federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms. Some U.S. citizens have also been detained.\n\nTrump federalized members of the California National Guard under a law allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”\n\nBreyer found the protests in Los Angeles “fall far short of ‘rebellion.'”\n\nErnesto Santacruz Jr., the field office director for the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, said in court documents that the troops were needed because local law enforcement was slow to respond when a crowd gathered outside the federal building to protest the June 7 immigration arrests.\n\n“The presence of the National Guard and Marines has played an essential role in protecting federal property and personnel from the violent mobs,” Santacruz said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO &#8212; A deputy commanding general testified Monday that military forces&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Legal Proceedings Commence to Determine if National Guard Deployment to Los Angeles Breached Federal Law first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/legal-proceedings-commence-to-determine-if-national-guard-deployment-to-los-angeles-breached-federal-law/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trial-begins-on-whether-deployment-of-National-Guard-to-Los.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:29:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":350233728,"title":"Let Josef Fritzl out of prison for coffee in a cafe, rapist father's lawyer says 'amid hopes of his early release'","text":"The notorious Austrian rapist Josef Fritzl, who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years, could soon be allowed to enjoy a coffee in a Vienna cafe under a controversial new legal request.\n\nFritzl's lawyer Astrid Wagner has confirmed she has lodged a petition for the pensioner to be granted day visits outside prison for so-called 'social training' - a scheme designed to help long-term inmates re-learn everyday skills.\n\nIf approved, Fritzl, 90, also known as the Cellar Monster, could be seen in public for the first time in over a decade, despite serving a life sentence for a catalogue of crimes so depraved they stunned the world.\n\nFritzl's name became synonymous with unimaginable cruelty in 2008, when it emerged he had locked his daughter Elisabeth in a hidden dungeon beneath his home in Amstetten, Lower Austria, from the age of 18.\n\nOver nearly a quarter of a century, he repeatedly raped her, fathering seven children -one of whom died in infancy, with prosecutors arguing he was partly responsible for the death through neglect.\n\nFritzl was eventually convicted of murder, rape, incest, slavery and severe coercion - becoming the only person in Austrian history ever convicted of slavery.\n\nHe was first held in a secure psychiatric hospital but has since been moved to a standard prison in Krems.\n\nWagner has now told The Mirror her client is 'fit for small outings' and needs to 'reintegrate into society', saying he should be allowed to practice ordering coffee, using a mobile phone and performing simple tasks like opening and locking doors.\n\nShe argued that he is failing to take prescribed dementia medication and no longer fully understands the purpose of his detention - insisting that furthering his time locked up would breach the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nWagner confirmed: 'He'll be in a café with a psychologist. There's a very nice café near the correctional facility, and he'll be going there for coffee soon.'\n\nUnder the plan, Fritzl would initially have supervised coffee trips with a psychologist to the nearby cafe before being allowed 12-hour day visits, potentially including trips to Vienna.\n\nThe request has triggered outrage across Austria.\n\nVeteran crime journalist Michael Koch hit out at the move, reminding the public that Fritzl's crimes were not 'just' about locking his daughter in a basement, but part of a sustained reign of terror that left deep scars on his victims and horrified the world.\n\nCritics fear the move could open the door to eventual full release - something Wagner has also pushed for in the past.\n\nShe maintains that 'everyone deserves a chance', but for many, the idea of seeing Fritzl strolling through the city square is unthinkable.\n\nIt comes after the incest monster claimed in April that he was friends with Donald Trump and believed the US President was sending him secret messages through hand signals from the White House.\n\nWagner revealed that Fritzl believed that hand movements made by Trump at press conferences on TV were secret signs meant only for him to update him on the talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin. \n\nFritzl also claimed that the audience clapping heard during his favourite televised folk music shows was applause for him from a 'grateful' Austrian public.\n\nAs well as fantasies about Trump and applause, Wagner said he told her that Chancellor Christian Stocker had called him asking him to 'look after the children' in Austria. \n\nShe said at the time: 'In truth, he needs special therapy.' \n\nWagner told MailOnline at the end of last year: 'I went to see Mr Fritzl in prison today, and he keeps talking about wanting to be in a house when he gets out of prison, and he has made very, very clear it has to have a cellar.\n\n'He says he wants a cellar because he has so many things he needs to store. Of course he's been transferred from a high security to the standard prison, but he still has all his things which he has collected over the years.'\n\n'I'm talking about loads and loads of files and folders. This is why he said his new place absolutely has to have a cellar.'\n\nWhen asked if she thought he was aware how unsuitable it was for him to demand a cellar given his horrific crimes, Wagner said: 'He didn't really notice, or maybe he didn't but he didn't say anything. He's old and getting more and more frail. He'll be 90 next year. And now it's time for him to be released.'\n\nFritzl also believes he will walk out of prison to people 'cheering and wanting to shake his hand' if he is successful in his bid for freedom, according to Wagner.\n\nShe told the Mirror in February that deluded Fritzl believes that 'a big celebration with people cheering' and 'wanting to shake his hand' will be waiting for him if he ever got out of prison.\n\n'This is obviously not the case. It is a fantasy.

There’s a very nice café near the correctional facility, and he’ll be going there for coffee soon’.\n\nUnder the plan, Fritzl would initially have supervised coffee trips with a psychologist to the nearby cafe before being allowed 12-hour day visits, potentially including trips to Vienna.\n\nThe request has triggered outrage across Austria.\n\nVeteran crime journalist Michael Koch hit out at the move, reminding the public that Fritzl’s crimes were not ‘just’ about locking his daughter in a basement, but part o a sustained reign of terror that left deep scars on his victims and horrified the world.\n\nCritics fear the move could open the door to eventual full release – something Wagner has also pushed for in the past.\n\nShe maintains that ‘everyone deserves a chance’, but for many, the idea of seeing Fritzl strolling through the city square is unthinkable.\n\nIt comes after the incest monster claimed in April that he was friends with Donald Trump and believed the US President was sending him secret messages through hand signals from the White House.\n\nWagner revealed that Fritzl believed how hand movements made by Trump at press conferences on TV were secret signs meant only for him to update him on the talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin. \n\nFritzl also claimed that the audience clapping heard during his favourite televised folk music shows was applause for him from a ‘grateful’ Austrian public.\n\nAs well as fantasies about Trump and applause, Wagner said he told her that Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker had called him asking him to ‘look after the children’ in Austria. \n\nShe said at the time: ‘In truth, he needs special therapy.’ \n\nWagner told MailOnline at the end of last year: ‘I went to see Mr Fritzl in prison today, and he keeps talking about wanting to be in a house when he gets out of prison, and he has made very, very clear it has to have a cellar.\n\n‘He says he wants a cellar because he has so many things he needs to store. Of course he’s been transferred from a high security to the standard prison, but he still has all his things which he has collected over the years.’\n\n‘I’m talking about loads and loads of files and folders. This is why he said his new place absolutely has to have a cellar.’\n\nWhen asked if she thought he was aware how unsuitable it was for him to demand a cellar given his horrific crimes, Wagner said: ‘He didn’t really notice, or maybe he didn’t but he didn’t say anything. He’s old and getting more and more frail. He’ll be 90 next year. And now it’s time for him to be released.’\n\nFritzl also believes he will walk out of prison to people ‘cheering and wanting to shake his hand’ if he is successful in his bid for freedom, according to Wagner.\n\nShe told the Mirror in February that deluded Fritzl believes that ‘a big celebration with people cheering’ and ‘wanting to shake his hand’ will be waiting for him if he ever got out of prison.\n\n‘This is obviously not the case. It is a fantasy. I don’t think he fully understands what the world really thinks,’ Wagner explained.\n\nDespite the delusions, Fritzl is said to be in fair physical shape for his age.\n\nWhen asked how he feels about his upcoming milestone birthday, Wagner replied: ‘He wants to grow old. He wants to grow old enough to get out of prison.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe infamous Austrian criminal, Josef Fritzl, who kept his daughter captive for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Lawyer Requests Temporary Release for Josef Fritzl for Coffee Break first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/lawyer-requests-temporary-release-for-josef-fritzl-for-coffee-break/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Let-Josef-Fritzl-out-of-prison-for-coffee-rapist-fathers.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:25:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":350230894,"title":"Trump Grants 90-Day Extension on China Tariff Deadline","text":"President Donald Trump has extended a 90-day tariff pause on China.\n\nWith only hours until the temporary agreement’s Aug. 12 deadline, Trump signed an executive order to allow the United States and China to continue trade negotiations.","summary":"Both sides will continue broader trade negotiations.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/trump-grants-90-day-extension-on-china-tariff-deadline-5899812","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/12/id5856272-GettyImages-2208986608-300x180.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:24:59","author":"Andrew Moran","authors":["Andrew Moran"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.624},{"id":350229500,"title":"‘Important Diplomatic Steps’ – Yermak and Rubio Lay Framework for Alaska","text":"The Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed ways to achieve a “just peace” in Ukraine on Monday and mapped out diplomatic steps planned for this week, Yermak reported on his Telegram channel, ahead of the meeting on Friday in Alaska this week between US President Donald Trump and Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin.\n\n“I spoke with U.S. Secretary of State and Acting U.S. National Security Advisor Marco Rubio.

Had that happened the U.S. could have ratcheted up taxes on Chinese imports from an already high 30%, and Beijing could have responded by raising retaliatory levies on U.S. exports to China.\n\nThe pause buys time for the two countries to work out some of their differences, perhaps clearing the way for a summit later this year between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and it has been welcomed by the U.S. companies doing business with China.\n\nSean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said the extension is “critical” to give the two governments time to negotiate a trade agreement that U.S. businesses hope would improve their market access in China and provide the certainty needed for companies to make medium- and long-term plans.\n\n“Securing an agreement on fentanyl that leads to a reduction in U.S. tariffs and a rollback of China’s retaliatory measures is acutely needed to restart U.S. agriculture and energy exports,” Stein said.\n\nReaching a pact with China remains unfinished business for Trump, who has already upended the global trading system by slapping double-digit taxes – tariffs – on almost every country on earth.\n\nThe European Union, Japan and other trading partners agreed to lopsided trade deals with Trump, accepting once unthinkably U.S. high tariffs (15% on Japanese and EU imports, for instance) to ward off something worse.\n\nTrump’s trade policies have turned the United States from one of the most open economies in the world into a protectionist fortress. The average U.S. tariff has gone from around 2.5% at the start of the year to 18.6%, highest since 1933, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.\n\nBut China tested the limits of a U.S. trade policy built around using tariffs as a cudgel to beat concessions out of trading partners. Beijing had a cudgel of its own: cutting off or slowing access to its rare earths minerals and magnets – used in everything from electric vehicles to jet engines.\n\nIn June, the two countries reached an agreement to ease tensions. The United States said it would pull back export restrictions on computer chip technology and ethane, a feedstock in petrochemical production. And China agreed to make it easier for U.S. firms to get access to rare earths.\n\n“The U.S. has realized it does not have the upper hand,’’ said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs.\n\nIn May, the U.S. and China had averted an economic catastrophe by reducing massive tariffs they’d slapped on each other’s products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.\n\nThose triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In a May meeting in Geneva they agreed to back off and keep talking: America’s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China’s to 10%.\n\nHaving demonstrated their ability to hurt each other, they’ve been talking ever since.\n\n“By overestimating the ability of steep tariffs to induce economic concessions from China, the Trump administration has not only underscored the limits of unilateral U.S. leverage, but also given Beijing grounds for believing that it can indefinitely enjoy the upper hand in subsequent talks with Washington by threatening to curtail rare earth exports,” said Ali Wyne, a specialist in U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group. “The administration’s desire for a trade détente stems from the self-inflicted consequences of its earlier hubris.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether Washington and Beijing can reach a grand bargain over America’s biggest grievances. Among these are lax Chinese protection of intellectual property rights and Beijing’s subsidies and other industrial policies that, the Americans say, give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in world markets and have contributed to a massive U.S. trade deficit with China of $262 billion last year.\n\nReade doesn’t expect much beyond limited agreements such as the Chinese saying they will buy more American soybeans and promising to do more to stop the flow of chemicals used to make fentanyl and to allow the continued flow of rare-earth magnets.\n\nBut the tougher issues will likely linger, and “the trade war will continue grinding ahead for years into the future,’’ said Jeff Moon, a former U.S. diplomat and trade official who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy.\n\nAssociated Press Staff Writer Josh Boak contributed to this story.","summary":"The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/11/trump-tariffs-china-another-90-days/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/APTOPIX_Trump_35849_42f1aa.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:20:18","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":350227502,"title":"Leading Democrats Issue Surprising Reaction to Trump’s Crackdown in DC","text":"Hillary Clinton was ridiculed as a ‘big-time loser’ while spearheading the Democrats’ out of touch response to Donald Trump’s declaration that federal forces would assume control over policing in Washington D.C.\n\nIn a boisterous White House press conference on Monday, Trump declared the federalization of the D.C. police and the deployment of numerous national guard troops to the streets, aiming to ‘rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, squalor, and worse.’\n\nClinton, who famously lost the 2016 election to Trump, slammed the president for the move. \n\n‘As you listen to an unhinged Trump try to justify deploying the National Guard in DC, here’s reality: Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low.’\n\nThe Democrat referenced Department of Justice statistics released by the Biden administration earlier in January, as announced by D.C.’s heavily Democratic District Attorney.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson quickly attacked the former Secretary of State on social media.\n\n‘On top of being a big-time loser, you’re also a massive liar,’ Jackson wrote. \n\nShe referenced a July story in which a police commander was suspended amid accusations of falsifying crime statistics. \n\nCommander Michael Puliam told News4 at the time that allegations were false, though he was accused by his own union. \n\nTrump took the extraordinary move Monday to make good on his commitment to law and order.\n\n‘We’re going to take our capitol back,’ he added. \n\nSurrounded by cabinet officials including Attorney General Pam Bondi, US Attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro, FBI Director Kash Patel, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Interior Director Doug Burgum, Trump committed to instructing federal law enforcement to employ aggressive measures against the city’s most notorious offenders.\n\n‘You spit and we hit and we can hit real hard,’ he said. \n\nThe president also vowed to clear out camps of homeless people from Washington, DC parks and public lands. \n\nFederal law officials began their citywide deployment over the weekend, ramping up a public display of force that was seen immediately by residents. \n\n‘Our Capital City has been overtaken by violent gangs, bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people, and we’re not going to let it happen anymore,’ he said. ‘We’re not going to take it.’\n\nThe plan was in part vengeance for ‘Big Balls.’ \n\nAround 3 a.m. on Sunday, August 3, Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old former Department of Government Efficiency employee, was the victim of an attempted carjacking near the popular 14th Street nightlife corridor. \n\n‘He was left dripping in blood. He thought he was dead with a broken nose and concussion. Can’t believe that he’s alive,’ Trump said.\n\nThe neighborhood is known for political hotspots like Le Diplomate – a favorite of former President Joe Biden – beer gardens, bars and the nightclub Black Cat. \n\nPolice said a group of teenagers approached Coristine and a female companion and demanded his vehicle. \n\nCoristine, who now works for the Social Security Administration, pushed the woman into his car before he was assaulted. \n\nSince the attack, two 15-year-olds not from D.C. – but from nearby Hyattsville, Maryland – were arrested and charged with unarmed carjacking.\n\nThe president also highlighted recent horrific crimes in the city including a 21-year-old congressional intern who was hit by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting and killed, a former Trump administration official murdered in a carjacking, and a Democratic congressman who was carjacked at gunpoint.\n\nTrump also recalled a ‘demented lunatic’ that stabbed an aide to Sen. Rand Paul in 2023 and a three-year-old girl who was shot and killed near the US Capitol while she was sitting in a car. \n\nIn the same Truth Social post, the president demanded that teenagers involved in these types of crime be prosecuted as adults. \n\n‘They are not afraid of Law Enforcement because they know nothing ever happens to them, but it’s going to happen now!’ Trump warned. \n\nThe president’s claim that crime has spike has been contested by the D.C.’s Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has pointed to stats that show violent crime has decreased in the District since 2023. \n\nViolent crime in DC is down 26 percent this year and in 2024 reached a 30-year low, with 190 homicides in 2024 compared to 274 in 2023, according to metro police department statistics.\n\n‘The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,’ Trump said in a Sunday night Truth Social post. \n\nIn April, Bowser announced the creation of a special police force specifically to tackle underage crime. \n\nIn an interview on MSNBC Sunday, she pushed back on White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller saying that D.C. was ‘more violent than Baghdad.’\n\n‘Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,’ Bowser said. \n\nTrump has also threatened to ‘FEDERALIZE this City.’ \n\nTrump doesn’t have the unilateral power to do such a thing – it would take congressional action. \n\nCongress would need to repeal the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows DC residents to elect their mayor and city council. \n\nDespite having more residents than Vermont and Wyoming, DC lacks congressional representation due to its non-state status.\n\nWhile Republicans control both chambers, a repeal would likely face a Democratic Senate filibuster and strong opposition from DC’s 700,000 residents. \n\nNevertheless, Senator Mike Lee and Representative Andy Ogles introduced the “BOWSER Act” in February, which would repeal Home Rule one year after passage.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHillary Clinton was ridiculed as a &#8216;big-time loser&#8217;

Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\" Springsteen announced last year that he would be voting for former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential race.

Around Rs 3,900 crore was disbursed to the accounts of nearly 35 lakh farmers.\nAlso Read | Oil Sanctions 'Big Blow' to Russia: US President Donald Trump Says Oil Tariff on India Making Vladimir Putin Pliable to Seeking End to Ukraine War.\nAddressing the gathering, Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that we are witnessing the formation of a remarkable India under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. He noted that Rajasthan will soon receive water from the Yamuna, Chambal, and also the Indus River. The Minister recalled that India had strongly retaliated to the Pahalgam terror attack, destroying terrorist bases through 'Operation Sindoor', a decision taken solely by India without any third-party involvement. We ceased all military actions only after Pakistan bowed before India's might, he said.\nThe Minister said that under earlier governments, crop insurance compensations were provided only when crops in an entire tehsil or block were destroyed, but Prime Minister Modi scrapped the old schemes and introduced an insurance plan under which compensations are paid even if the crop of a single farmer in a village is damaged.\nAlso Read | Recruitment Scam in Rajasthan: 70 Women Secured Government Jobs With Fake Divorce Papers; SOG Begins Probe.\nHe stressed that the government is working through multiple schemes to improve farmers' lives. Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, Rs 3.75 lakh crore has been directly transferred to farmers' accounts. Since the launch of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in 2016, Rs 2.12 lakh crore has been paid to farmers. He also highlighted substantial fertiliser subsidies, noting that a 45-kg bag of urea costs farmers Rs 266 against its actual price of Rs 1,633.24, with the difference covered by the government. Similarly, a 50-kg bag of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) costs Rs 1,350 against its actual price of Rs 3,100. So far, Rs 14.06 lakh crore has been provided to fertiliser companies to ensure affordable fertilisers for farmers.\nShri Chouhan also referred to other welfare measures, stating that the government has raised MSP (minimum support price) rates, ensuring they are set at 50 per cent above production costs. The government decided to procure moong at Rs 2,000 per quintal. Under the PM-AASHA scheme (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan), Rs 43.87 lakh crore has been transferred to farmers' accounts for wheat and paddy procurement. The Market Intervention Scheme (MIP) allows farmers to sell produce in other states with the government covering transport costs.\nOn the issue of counterfeit fertilisers, the Minister said that steps are being taken to introduce a stringent law to punish offenders, with work already underway to ensure strict action and imprisonment for the guilty.\nHe added that in cases of crop virus attacks, if farmers share information or even send a photo, a team of scientists will immediately reach the village to assist.\nChouhan said that after the Kharif season, under the Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan, teams of scientists will visit villages for the Rabi crop season to share accurate farming and research knowledge. Future agricultural research will be demand-driven, based on farmers' needs, with a focus on developing quality seeds for moong, urad, soybean, and millet to increase production.

it’s a bitter public rivalry fueled by accusations, insults, and political grudges.More Than PoliticsThe two have a long history of trading blows, and their ongoing battle could be leading to a civil war in conservative politics. \n\nThe latest clash traces back to a heated dispute over U.S.-Israel relations.Recently, Loomer publicly accused Greene of repeatedly asking her to connect her with Jewish donors, claiming Greene was “angry she was iced out by the White House\" and Trump's administration wanted little to do with the Georgia congresswoman.\n\nThe conservative mouthpiece went on to suggest Greene “was more than happy to beg Jews for money,\" a sharp jab in a war marked by mutual contempt.Greene fired back with a fiery statement, calling Loomer a liar who \"routinely lies about me\" and accusing her of damaging fellow Republicans. \n\nShe questioned Loomer’s motives and funding, alleging the conspiracy theorist is \"not MAGA, she is MIGA,\" and criticized Loomer's claims of journalism and self-employment. \n\nGreene also accused Loomer of abusing her position and spreading manipulated propaganda.Loomer responded in kind with a blistering social media tirade, accusing Greene of infidelity and hypocrisy. \n\nShe referenced Greene's alleged affairs with a \"tantric sex guru\" and gym manager, sarcastically questioning how the politician could claim to be a Christian while \"wrecking her marriage like a whore.\"Loomer Defends Herself In DepositionThe deposition also reveals how Loomer claims her rising profile in Trumpworld was sabotaged. \n\nLoomer testified the president himself was initially impressed by her reporting on Ron DeSantis and even invited her to Mar-a-Lago, instructing his chief of staff to hire her. \n\nHowever, Loomer claimed Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita told her she was no longer welcome on the campaign due to the “media frenzy” sparked by Maher’s joke.Throughout the deposition, Loomer defended her history of controversial comments, and denied accusations suggesting Maher’s joke could not have caused additional harm given her already infamous online presence.","summary":"Laura Loomer’s deposition in her Bill Maher defamation case reveals explosive claims Marjorie Taylor Greene is ‘jealous’ and disliked by Trump’s staff.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/maga-laura-loomer-marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-deposition-bill-maher/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/msgey2oYh/0x0/loomer-greene-1754953089757.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 00:00:00","author":"Nate Grant","authors":["Nate Grant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":350223314,"title":"Midwest Mamdani Announces Top Priority If Elected – And It Isn’t Minneapolis","text":"Democratic mayoral candidate Omar Fateh of Minneapolis said in an interview that his first priority as mayor would be to protect “undocumented residents” from what he claimed was a “hostile federal government.”\n\nFateh won the endorsement of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party in July over Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, making him the favorite to win the general election in the city. Fateh — when asked by a reporter — laid out his priorities in a clip posted to X on Monday, claiming President Donald Trump was causing concern for “our neighbors.” (RELATED: House Dem Admits Mass Immigration Is About Importing Democratic Voters)\n\n“Day one, if you were elected, what would be some of your top two, three priorities for the city?” the reporter asked Fateh.\n\n“So that’s a very good question,” Fateh said. “So the first, I would say, would be a hostile federal government, with not only Donald Trump in office, but he has essentially a trifecta, both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court. And a lot of our neighbors, especially our undocumented residents, are very concerned.”\n\nFateh has been compared to Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani of New York City, who won the Democratic nomination for mayor of the Big Apple in the June 24 primary, beating out former Democratic Gov.

Jindal Global University, Sonipat.A series of recent statements and actions by the Donald Trump administration targeting India has left the dominant section of the Indian strategic community with a feeling of betrayal. The US signalling its distancing from India and its aspiration for a decisive strategic role in South Asia could not be clearer. To get his way, Trump is trying to bully and humiliate India almost on a daily basis. He is unlikely to stop until India bends.Starting with public humiliation and chaining illegal Indian migrant deportees, Trump has repeated claims (30 times so far) of how he successfully brokered the ceasefire after the four-day Pakistan-India war following Operation Sindoor. He also claimed that it was his trade deal threats that calmed both nations. He is thus continuously challenging India’s long-standing position of no foreign intervention in India’s bilateral matters. To make matters worse, Trump has been on a tirade against India’s economic policy calling India the ‘king of tariffs’. This has been followed by the imposition of 25 percent tariffs imposed on all Indian exports with the threat of additional penalties unless India stops importing Russian oil and military hardware. These actions were accompanied by humiliating and derogatory language: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.” Thereafter, President Trump declared the US and Pakistan had concluded a deal to work together to develop Pakistan’s oil reserves, saying “Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India someday!” General Asim Munir’s White House lunch with Donald Trump, just as India was pushing to label Pakistan a sponsor of terrorism, was clearly to show that the US would again use the Pakistani army to bolster US policies in Central and West Asia. That is a game at which Pakistan is adept. In addition, India’s attempt to have the US and the West in its corner was shattered, for instance when India lost the election post of vice chair of the Executive Board of UNESCO to Pakistan. False hopesFor decades the Indian leadership and its strategic community has been promoting closer strategic relations with the US. India did whatever it took to do this — from developing an Indian NRI lobby in the US and maintaining strict neutrality on US support for Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza to issues that the US promoted globally. However, now President Trump wants much more. The US has once again started viewing the Pakistani army as a reliable instrument for its policy of interventions in the Asia-Pacific region and it seems it will continue to be privileged as such. Pakistan has a time-tested relation as the US’s favoured gendarme. The Pakistan army has run Pakistan’s foreign policy since its very formation. Unlike India it was always aligned. Pakistan was part of US military pacts of South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organizations (now defunct) in the 1950s and 60s. It was instrumental along with the US in developing the Taliban and Mujahideen that led the revolt which overthrew the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s. In the post 9/11 decade of US military interventions and forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, Pakistan was a key base for US maneuvers even as it housed the wanted terrorist Osama Bin Laden near its own national military academy. The General Munir-Trump lunch revived this partnership. The US will not allow India to isolate Pakistan internationally. So, India’s years of effort have been side-lined. The US has also once again started pairing India and Pakistan. This is something that India does not favour, given the scale of differences especially in the economic sphere — India is a rising medium level market economy and Pakistan has taken and rescheduled its IMF debt 25 times. However, the US interest is clearly to revive its empire-like reach, project power globally and retain its dominance. This is what Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) is about. In this agenda, India can be a market for US products and Pakistan, one of its many strategic arms. The US will, therefore, play both India and Pakistan — something that India will have to accept. The US also seeks to be the main balancing power and geopolitical influencer in the South Asia region. It was with this in mind that the US supported the Pakistani Army when they conducted a regime change ousting Pakistan’s popular prime minister, Imran Khan. The former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had also claimed a US hand in the populist student unrest and overthrow of her regime and the installation of the pro-American but hostile to India NGO-economist Mohammad Yunus. The US is also aware of the Pakistan-China alliance and how Pakistan has used this to its advantage. It was Pakistan that brokered the US-China détente in the 1970s with Henry Kissinger at the helm. Perhaps once again, as Trump wants an invite from President Xi Jinping, Pakistan may be expected to facilitate it. Time for rethinkWhat does this signify for India, who for the last three decades since its shift to globalisation in the early 1990s, prioritised its relations with the United States while turning a blind eye to US proximity with Pakistan, often at the cost of other relations especially to the Global South? One, that hyper-nationalism will not work in foreign policy especially when one must counter the hyper-imperial superpower. Two, that India has put on the back burner several long-standing beliefs of the country’s time-tested foreign policy. These included being pro-development but with awareness that colonialism will always take on new forms of extraction; a focus on peace and disarmament; and not getting obsessed and viewing all foreign policy through the lens of one militarised neighbour. This allowed India to diversify its foreign relations and not give up its traditional relations, while building new ones, but always emphasizing that it was an integral part of the Global South. The Indian elite, however, is still committed to the US and views it as an important partner. Nearly 18 percent of Indian exports are to the US and Indian students crowd US universities. India also respects US soft power and has no interest in disrupting US progress. However, the US needs to do the same. While efforts will have to be made to undo the current humiliating phase, the Indian leadership, hopefully, has also understood that the US would like to promote and facilitate American imperial interests in South Asia. These are usually not in India’s interest.Originally published under Creative Commons by 360info™.*) DISCLAIMERArticles published in the “Your Views & Stories” section of en.tempo.co website are personal opinions written by third parties, and cannot be related or attributed to en.tempo.co’s official stance.","summary":"Trump's bullying of India is to compel it to fall in line with American imperial goals.

The homicide rate is six times New York City’s.\n\nTo drive crime down, this intervention will bring in new resources, including hundreds of National Guard and broader deployment of the federal Park Police.\n\nNote, too: The feds share blame for DC’s high crime: The US Attorney for the District of Columbia is responsible for all felony prosecutions in the city — but Biden appointees to the job refused to prosecute over half of local crimes.\n\nWe hope neither the City Council nor Democrats (in Congress or neighboring Maryland and Virginia) try to sabotage this intervention.

Tamara says she heard there were surveillance cameras from the scene, but they are all grainy and told Fox News that even cabbies were afraid when she was in DC to identify her son’s body, saying the area was dangerous at night. No arrests have been made in Eric Tarpinian-Jachym's killing. President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump were \"heartbroken\" for the family in a letter sent to Eric’s parents in July. \"While we may never fully understand the impact that Eric has had during his meaningful life, we know he will be remembered for his kindness, faithfulness, and devotion to your family and his many friends,\" Trump wrote in the letter. \"He will also be remembered for his commitment to our country. I know how proud Congressman Estes was to have Eric represent his office, the people of Kansas' Fourth Congressional District, and our Nation.\" Tamara Tarpinian-Jachym said she still has many unanswered questions about Eric's death. \"I know nothing. I know about what's happening,\" she lamented. \"I don't know exactly how many bullets hit my son. All I know is from what the death certificate says, several bullet wounds. I don't know where he was hit, but I have an idea. I know nothing and maybe that's for the better, so they can catch this person or these persons. I am praying it will happen.\" The grieving mother expressed satisfaction in the work of Judge Jeanine Pirro, the new U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, on the case, expressing a desire to find the perpetrator so the person pays the price for their crime. \"She doesn't pull punches.

blame for Trump’s law-and-order takeover","text":"At its best, Washington, DC, is a city of grandeur, of iconic monuments and world-historical centers of power. \n\nAt its worst, it’s a harrowing place where a 14-year-old could steal your Hyundai. \n\nThe confluence of these two truths in the terrible early-morning beating of the DOGE employee Edward Coristine, known by his sobriquet “Big Balls,” has prompted President Donald Trump to federalize the DC police and deploy the National Guard.\n\nThe software engineer played a significant role in the frenetic push to reform the federal government that dominated the beginning of Trump’s second term and, by virtue of being in the wrong place at the wrong time (and protecting a young woman), was violently attacked by teenagers within two miles of the White House. \n\nThe metropolitan government of Washington has never been worthy of the seat of government of the greatest and most powerful nation that has ever existed.\n\nIt’s consistently been an embarrassment and, for decades now, has tolerated — and, worse, created the conditions for — disorderly and dangerous streets.\n\nThe late historian Fred Siegel wrote how “social license and economic restrictions,” what he calls “the two halves of sixties liberalism,” drained cities like Washington, DC, of their vitality.\n\nOver-regulated and inefficient, they were saddled by a “state-supported economy of social workers.”\n\nOn top of this, in the 1970s, DC experienced “black nationalism in power,” especially in the person of the catastrophic, long-time mayoralty of Marion Barry. \n\nThe federal government had to put a financial control board in charge in the 1990s to bring the District back from the brink of bankruptcy. \n\nIndeed, in the scheme of things, Trump’s intervention is more the norm than the exception in DC’s history.\n\nIn the 19th century, Congress governed the district via committees, before trying home rule in 1871 and quickly pulling back after the district was — yes — financially mismanaged.\n\nDC has had home rule since 1973, with the financial board exercising significant power from 1995 to 2001. \n\nThe district is better off now than in the bad old days of the 1990s, but remains beset by a soft-minded progressivism on matters of law and order that is an ongoing threat to public safety. \n\nAs usual, Trump is opting for the sledgehammer over the scalpel.\n\nStill, his indictment of DC for allowing lawless young people to blight the city is accurate. \n\nBut, the critics object, violent crime is falling in Washington!\n\nYes, it is, although from an unacceptably high level.\n\nAs of 2024, DC had the fourth-highest homicide rate of all major US cities and a higher homicide rate than all 50 states. \n\nAs Charles Lehman of the Manhattan Institute points out, its homicide rate for young black men has been above the national average for decades now. \n\nThe killings overwhelmingly involve young black men who have already been entangled in the criminal-justice system, with substantial rap sheets and often prison time.\n\nLehman cites a report by the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform that found about “500 identifiable people” are in this category, and account for 60% to 70% of all the gun violence in the city. \n\nThe carjackings, meanwhile, tend to be carried out by minors. \n\nAccording to Lehman, DC needs more cops who are more active making stops and arrests, as well as more prosecutions.\n\nIt also should be targeting the relatively small group of people most prone to violence, and the city’s gangs.\n\nAll of this, coupled with cleaning up homeless encampments, could continue the recent favorable crime trends and make the city feel like a better, safer place. \n\nIt’s probably too much to ask Washington, DC’s government to meet the soaring, implicit standard of its most famous buildings.\n\nBut not having to fear roving bands of young thugs would be a step in the right direction. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"The bumbling local government's failures means that Washington, DC, has never been a worthy seat for the world's greatest and most powerful

However, fewer people will lose nutrition assistance under the final version of the sweeping tax and spending cuts package that Trump signed into law last month, compared to the bill passed by the House earlier this year.\n\nThat version called for requiring parents of children ages 7 and older to work, which would have led to enrollment dropping by 3.2 million people in an average month, a CBO analysis of the House bill found.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are formally known, has long required certain able-bodied adults to work to receive benefits for longer than three months. But the GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” broadened that mandate to parents of dependent children – requiring that those with kids ages 14 and olderto work, volunteer or participate in job training at least 80 hours a month.\n\nAlso, the law requires that adults ages 55 to 64, veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster care youth to meet the mandate, though it exempts Native Americans. It also makes it harder for states to receive waivers during difficult economic times.\n\nAmong those losing coverage in an average month will be 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, CBO estimated.\n\nAnother controversial provision requires certain states to pick up the share of food stamp benefit costs for the first time. States with payment error rates of at least 6% will have to shoulder between 5% and 15% of the tab, starting in fiscal year 2028. This could prompt some states to cut back on benefits or eligibility or even leave the program, CBO found.\n\nThis measure is forecast to reduce or eliminate food stamp benefits for about 300,000 people in an average month. Also, about 96,000 children will receive smaller subsidies through child nutrition programs.\n\nUnder the House bill, by contrast, states would have had to pay a larger share of the costs, prompting them to reduce or eliminate benefits for about 1.3 million people in an average month and affecting about 420,000 children.\n\nOther provisions in the law, including changes to the formula that determines families’ monthly assistance, are projected to decrease benefits for certain households.\n\n“People are trying to make ends meet,” she said. “They will be hungrier, they will be sicker without that help.”\n\nThe elimination of this support will come at a time when more people will also lose their health insurance, she noted.\n\nThe law requires certain Medicaid enrollees – including parents of children ages 14 and older – to work for the first time. This measure will lead to 5.3 million more people being uninsured in 2034, according tothe CBO analysis.\n\nOverall, the package’s Medicaid measures are forecast to lead to 7.5 million more Americans without insurance, while changes to the Affordable Care Act will lead to 2.1 million more people being insured. In total, 10 million more Americans will not have health insurance by 2034.\n\nWho comes out ahead\n\nWhile the law will boost incomes of Americans, on average, it will not benefit everyone, the CBO found. The cuts to the safety net will outweigh the tax reductions for the lowest-income households.\n\nThose at the bottom of the income ladder, who earn less than $24,000, on average, from wages and other income streams, will see their projected incomes drop by about $1,200 a year, or 3.1%, between 2026 and 2034 – mainly from reductions in benefits, including Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nBut the highest earners, with incomes of nearly $700,000, on average, will see a $13,600 jump in their incomes, or about 2.7%.\n\nThe wealthiest 10% will receive 63% of the “spoils” of the package, Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, posted on X. By contrast, the bottom 60% will receive 4%.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He also hailed recent diplomatic and security gains against India as “the result of Allah Almighty’s blessing, the collective effort of the nation, the foresight and resolve of political leadership, and the professional skill of our brave armed forces.”\n\n“The question before us is no longer whether we will rise,” he said. “The question is how soon and with how much strength we will rise.

This plea underscores the Nordic countries’ commitment to global peace and stability, highlighting the geopolitical implications of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nNordic Countries Unite for Peace\n\nIn a rare demonstration of unified diplomacy, countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland have come together to address the escalating tensions in Eastern Europe. Their concerted appeal to President Trump marks a significant moment in international relations, showcasing their resolve to foster peace beyond their own regions and influence global leaders to prioritize diplomatic solutions over military actions.\n\nThe Nordic nations have historically championed peace and human rights, often playing key roles in mediating international disputes. Their call to action directed at the United States aligns with their longstanding traditions of global diplomacy and cooperation. This appeal serves as a testament to their dedication to assist in resolving international conflicts through peaceful means.\n\nThe Ukrainian Dilemma: A Global Concern\n\nThe situation in Ukraine has been a focal point of international concern since the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014. The ongoing unrest has resulted in thousands of deaths and has strained global relations. The Nordic nations’ appeal to President Trump is rooted in a desire for a comprehensive and enduring solution, one that adheres to international law and respects the sovereignty of Ukraine.\n\nBy urging the U.S. to take a firmer stance in supporting peace talks, these countries hope to counterbalance Russian military influence in the region. Their call reflects a broader European sentiment seeking stability in Eastern Europe and safeguarding democratic values against authoritarian threats.\n\nImplications for U.S. Foreign Policy\n\nThis unified message from the Nordic countries might have considerable implications for U.S. foreign policy regarding Eastern Europe. It highlights the importance of transatlantic cooperation and the role that diplomatic alliances can play in addressing complex global challenges. The Nordic appeal emphasizes the need for cohesive international strategies that support peace and deter aggression.\n\nExperts argue that the U.S.’s response to this plea could redefine its role on the world stage as a proponent of international law and peace. With geopolitical tensions on the rise, a robust commitment from the U.S. could reinforce alliances with European nations and set a precedent for how global powers address similar crises in the future.\n\nAs the world watches closely, the Nordic countries’ appeal serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnected nature of global politics. Their efforts to engage powerful allies in promoting peace and stability reiterate the shared responsibility nations hold in fostering a more peaceful, equitable world.\n\nIn conclusion, the diplomatic overtures from the Nordic nations to President Trump offer a glimpse into the complexities of international relations in the modern era. As global leaders contemplate the next steps for Ukraine, the call for unity and peaceful resolution remains as relevant as ever, echoing across continents and reminding us of the enduring quest for global harmony.","summary":"In a significant diplomatic gesture, the Nordic nations—Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland—have united to urge former U.S. President Donald Trump to intensify peace efforts in Ukraine.
