In a joint statement, co-CEO George Cheeks, CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach, and CBS Studios president David Stapf insisted the decision was based purely on declining revenues and shifting industry dynamics.\n\n'This was a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,' they said. 'It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.' \n\nBut critics aren't buying it.\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders fired off a blistering statement on X: 'Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late-night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.'\n\nSenator Ed Markey went further, suggesting possible political interference: 'If the Trump administration is using its regulatory authority to influence or otherwise pressure your company's editorial decisions, the public deserves to know.'\n\nTrump wasted no time celebrating the move on his Truth Social account gleefully writing, 'I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once-great.'\n\nThe post prompted a visceral response from Colbert's fellow hosts. Kimmel posted to Instagram: 'Love you Stephen. F**k you and all your Sheldons CBS.'\n\nThe timing of Colbert's cancellation has only deepened suspicions.\n\nOn July 2, Paramount agreed to settle Trump's lawsuit. On July 15, Colbert railed against it on national television. On July 17, Paramount pulled the plug on the show despite it still being the top-rated program in its timeslot, beating both Fallon and Kimmel in linear and digital viewership.\n\nIndeed, while CBS cited financial strain, the numbers have painted a more complicated picture.\n\nAdvertising revenue for The Late Show has dropped 40% since 2018 from $121.1 million to $70.2 million last year, according to ad firm Guideline.\n\nBut the show still drew a nightly average of 1.9 million viewers this past season, more than any other late-night rival with Colbert has maintaining a massive digital following on YouTube and TikTok.\n\nBut CBS insists the business no longer adds up.\n\nOne former TV network executive said The Late Show had been hemorrhaging money and losing up to $40 million annually because of shrinking ad dollars and rising production costs. \n\n'Fifteen years ago, a show like The Tonight Show could earn $100 million a year,' they said. 'Now, they're money pits.' \n\nCBS had already begun gutting its late-night schedule. The Late Late Show with James Corden was scrapped in 2023. After Midnight was canceled earlier this year. \n\nColbert will end in May of next year with CBS planned to fill the Late Show slot with reruns of the primetime hit Tracker.\n\nABC's Jimmy Kimmel has a contract that also runs out next year. Kimmel, 57, openly wondered in a Variety interview before signing his latest three-year contract extension how long he wanted to do it. He's hosted his show since 2003. \n\n\"I have moments where I go, I cannot do this anymore,\" Kimmel told Variety in 2022. \"And I have moments where I go, what am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing ... I'm not going to do this forever.\"\n\nColbert, Kimmel and Stewart were all nominated for Emmy awards this week.\n\nColbert's cancellation is the latest flashpoint in what critics call a mounting war against media critical of Trump.\n\nThe president has long sparred with journalists and entertainers, launching lawsuits against The New York Times, CNN, 60 Minutes, and ABC News. \n\nEarlier this week, his administration slashed funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS and has openly mused about pulling licenses from outlets he considers 'fake news.","summary":"A powerful Hollywood entity is demanding a state investigation after CBS abruptly canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, just days after the host accused Paramount of bribing Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14921939/Powerful-Hollywood-entity-call-investigation-bribery-Stephen-Colbert-cancellation.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/20/01/100462461-0-image-a-10_1752971564108.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 01:15:49","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":343316900,"title":"Ukraine Proposes Truce Talks with Russia After Negotiations Stalled in June","text":"Kyiv: Ukraine has proposed to hold a new round of peace talks with Russia next week, following negotiations that stalled last month, according to Al Jazeera. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed on Saturday that Defence Council Secretary Rustem Umerov had made an offer for a meeting with Russian negotiators for next week. \"Everything should be done to achieve a ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy said in his evening address to the nation, Al Jazeera reported. \"The Russian side should stop hiding from decisions.\" Ukraine's leader also reiterated his readiness to have a face-to-face sit-down with Putin. \"A meeting at the leadership level is needed to truly ensure peace — lasting peace,\" he said. There was no immediate response from Russia, as per Al Jazeera. Umerov, a former defence minister, was appointed last week as the head of the National Security and Defence Council and tasked with adding more momentum to the negotiations. He headed his country's delegation in two previous rounds of talks in Turkiye earlier this year, which yielded little more than an agreement to exchange prisoners and soldiers' remains. In previous rounds, Russia outlined a list of hardline demands that were not acceptable to Ukraine, calling on it to cede four Ukrainian regions it claims as its own and reject Western military support, as per Al Jazeera. However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Friday indicated that Moscow agreed with a statement by Zelenskyy that peace efforts needed \"more momentum\". The shift came after United States President Donald Trump, who initially appeared to adopt a conciliatory approach towards Russia after entering office, upped the pressure on Moscow. This week, Trump set a 50-day deadline for Moscow to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine or face \"100 per cent tariffs\" and the prospect of secondary sanctions being imposed on countries that buy Russian oil. He also promised to ramp up arms shipments to the war-battered country. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on Thursday that Russia would not accept the \"blackmail\" of Washington's sanctions ultimatum, and the decision to resume weapons deliveries was a signal to Ukraine to \"abandon the peace process\".","summary":"Zelenskyy confirmed that Defence Council Secretary Rustem Umerov had made an offer for a meeting with Russian negotiators for next week","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/europe/ukraine-proposes-truce-talks-with-russia-after-negotiations-stalled-in-june-1892571","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/07/20/1939768-aa-5144694.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 01:10:50","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":343317736,"title":"Why it's time to build our own Alligator Alcatraz - it'll cut crime and might just stop the small boats: LEO McKINSTRY","text":"George Orwell, that great chronicler of British patriotism, wrote during the Second World War that ‘the gentleness of English civilisation is its most marked characteristic’. Eight decades later, it would be absurd to use such language about our country.\n\nIn today’s Britain, restraint is being replaced by aggression, solidarity by conflict. In the face of rising crime and social disorder, fear and friction cast their shadows over too many of our neighbourhoods.\n\nThere are many reasons for this crisis, including the breakdown of the traditional family and the leniency of the justice system. But perhaps the most important factor has been the state’s unhinged, destructive addiction to mass immigration, with the net annual influx reaching over 900,000 in 2023.\n\nIn addition, there has been a dramatic recent surge in the number of illegal migrants crossing the English Channel. As a result, British taxpayers have to fork out £8 million a day on accommodation for\n\nthese opportunists, the vast majority of whom are young men of military age with enough money to buy a one-way ticket to England from the people smugglers.\n\nThe Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer came to power last year promising to ‘smash the gangs’, but the only thing he looks set to smash is the record for illegal entry, with the number of small-boat migrants this year (over 21,000) already 54 per cent higher than the same period in 2024.\n\nThis failure to take control has been a disaster for our social fabric. The images of asylum seekers inhabiting once-prestigious hotels – often in struggling seaside resorts – are potent symbols not only of our economic decline but also the mishandling of the fight against crime. In a spectacular act of self-harm, successive British governments decided we owed a living to millions from North Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Asia. It is a stance that has led to the import of disaffected migrants, united by their masculinity and entitlement and, for a dangerous few, a hostility to British liberal values, especially on women’s rights.\n\nA brilliant investigation by The Mail on Sunday has exposed the damaging consequences of this policy, which has seen no fewer than 708 charges for criminal offences brought against 312 asylum seekers in 70 taxpayer-funded hotels across the country.\n\nIncluded in this catalogue of crime are 18 charges of rape and 51 of theft. In one chilling case a Sudanese asylum seeker was jailed last year for trying to rape a woman in the female toilets of a nightclub in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, while he strangled her.\n\nThe MoS’s analysis backs up other evidence highlighting the dangers of creating migrant enclaves in some of our most deprived towns. Official data shows that Afghans, for instance, are 20 times more likely to be convicted of sex offences than British citizens, a profoundly worrying point given last week’s revelations that 18,500 Afghans have been settled here after the MoD leaked sensitive information about them.\n\nIn fact, 66 nationalities here have higher conviction rates than Britons. The pro-immigration lobby, desperate to maintain their narrative of multi-cultural success, does not like to face such realities. But their retreat into a cocoon of delusion and concealment only feeds the anger of the British population, as happened over the cover-up of the activities of predatory gangs in the north of England, who targeted vulnerable working-class girls.\n\nOnly last week, in an echo of last summer’s anti-immigration riots triggered by the Southport killings, anger boiled over at The Bell Hotel in Epping, which is now being used as an asylum centre.\n\nMore than 40 protesters mounted a furious demonstration at the venue after an Ethiopian asylum seeker was accused of trying to kiss a schoolgirl as she ate pizza in the town centre, eight days after he arrived in the UK.\n\nDespite the deluge of fashionable official propaganda about the hard-working, law-abiding nature of the newcomers, in truth migrants from outside the EU are far more likely to be unemployed, dependent on welfare, living in social housing or behind bars, than the native British population.\n\nIn one remarkable piece of research in 2023, Conservative MP Neil O’Brien revealed that of the two million migrants who settled in Britain from outside Europe over the previous five years, just 15 per cent came to work – a figure that makes a nonsense of the claim by Left-wing campaigners that free movement is the key to prosperity.\n\nIn fact, it is the ultimate route to national bankruptcy, especially when 1.2 million migrants are claiming universal credit, as was revealed last week. At a time when the public finances are in dire straits, it is the economics of the madhouse to pay unemployed foreign nationals to live here at the expense of British workers.\n\nApart from the occasional spasm of bureaucratic tinkering, the PM’s biggest effort in tackling the migrant crisis has been put into reaching bilateral deals with France and Germany. President Macron’s arm was twisted into agreeing a ‘one-in-one-out’ scheme, whereby a small-boat migrant landing in the UK would be swapped with another in France who had a stronger claim to settle here. And German Chancellor Friedrich Merz agreed to amend legislation to arrest people smugglers who stored dinghies in its warehouses.\n\nParis and Berlin have deigned to make these concessions only because Starmer has ‘reset’ relations with the EU, which has required the UK to hitch her wagon to those of Brussels rule makers on everything from energy prices to food standards.\n\nHad he not done so, Britain’s two ‘allies’ would have continued to abet, or at least fail to stop, the migration crisis at our shores.\n\nWhy? Because France and Germany have been far more concerned with pulling Brexit Britain back into the EU’s orbit, and if illegal migration was their principle leverage, then so be it. It’s a ploy as cynical and morally bankrupt as Putin’s funnelling of migrants through Belarus to the Polish border to destabilise the EU.\n\nWhether the measures agreed with Macron and Merz reduce the numbers arriving remains to be seen. What is clear is that Starmer has to find a better way of housing asylum seekers already here.\n\nLabour has made a vague promise to end the hotel model by the end of the Parliament without specifying how. They should look to the US. President Donald Trump is ploughing billions into building new immigration detention centres, the most infamous being a facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed ‘Alligator Alcatraz’.\n\nWere centres like these erected in the UK, they would not only remove new arrivals from deprived towns, reducing crime and community friction, but also deter other chancers seeking to come.\n\nThe Tories grasped this by housing asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm prison ship. Given that Starmer chose to close it down rather than improve conditions on board, it’s clear he hasn’t the stomach to weather the inevitable controversy around creating more immigration centres.\n\nIn the meantime, small communities across Britain are left to fend for themselves as their towns become doss houses for bored young men with alien values honed in the far corners of the world. And their town’s shopkeepers, homeowners and teenage girls remain prey to the inevitable crime that ensues.","summary":"In today's Britain, restraint is being replaced by aggression, solidarity by conflict.

During the deliberations, Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee emerged as a prominent voice, suggesting several sharp-edged questions for the opposition to collectively raise against the Centre.\nSources privy to the discussions revealed that Banerjee emphasised the need to interrogate the government extensively on the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack. He reportedly pressed for accountability regarding what he termed a clear “intelligence failure” in preventing the dastardly incident. A key point of his proposed parliamentary query was to demand an explanation for the extension of the Intelligence Bureau chief’s tenure despite this perceived lapse in national security.\nBanerjee also turned the spotlight on the controversial Pegasus spyware issue. He critically questioned the priorities of its usage, reportedly asking, “When Pegasus could have been used to curb terrorism, why was it used against the opposition instead?” This line of questioning aims to highlight alleged surveillance abuses and push for transparency on the deployment of such sophisticated technologies.\nFurthermore, the TMC leader expressed concerns over the utility and transparency of the government’s extensive foreign delegation visits. He urged the INDIA bloc to collectively challenge the government on what tangible benefits the nation derived from dispatching numerous delegations abroad, particularly when the public back home was allegedly not adequately briefed about their purpose or concrete outcomes.\nSources said Banerjee raised concerns over the ongoing Bihar SIR voter list review, which he alleged is being used by the BJP and the Election Commission as a “backdoor NRC” to exclude genuine voters. He also alleged that the BJP uses “E square (E²)” as its attack tool—ED against opposition leaders and EC against voters.\nAdding a touch of pointed sarcasm, the TMC leader reportedly remarked on a peculiar situation, indicating that Indian citizens felt compelled to follow President Donald Trump’s social media accounts for updates on sensitive issues, including diplomatic developments involving India. “This too should be raised in Parliament,” he asserted, implying a communication gap from the Indian government. These proposed interventions by Abhishek Banerjee signal the INDIA bloc’s intent to launch a frontal assault on the government’s handling of national security, governance transparency, and foreign policy during the upcoming monsoon session.","summary":"The TMC lawmaker emerged as a prominent voice at the meeting, suggesting several sharp-edged questions for the opposition to collectively raise against the Centre","url":"https://www.news18.com/politics/pahalgam-attack-pegasus-foreign-policy-trump-heres-what-tmcs-abhishek-banerjee-said-at-oppn-meet-9451307.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Abhishek-Banerjee-2025-02-a58a12fa585a91169df1b20000310724.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-20 01:00:00","author":"Kamalika Sengupta,News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["Kamalika Sengupta","News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":343317742,"title":"How Joe Rogan became the world's richest podcaster: As he lounges on a £480k-a-week yacht, TOM LEONARD reveals secrets behind former delivery man's empire - and exactly how much he makes","text":"A wise public figure would surely think twice these days before allowing themselves to be caught swanning around the Med on an ostentatious, fuel-guzzling, money-burning superyacht.\n\nEspecially if the celebrity in question is 'man-of-the-people' commentator and comedian Joe Rogan, who didn't become the world's most popular podcaster without developing a reputation for no-frills authenticity and relatability.\n\nCertainly, there's little chance his fans will 'relate' to the sight of their brawny hero and his family holidaying aboard the giant £40million yacht, OKTO.\n\nThe vessel – which at 218ft long is only 12ft shy of qualifying as a 'mega-yacht' – plus its crew of 16 costs £480,000 to charter for a week at this time of the year.\n\nRogan, 57, was seen boarding OKTO near Venice at the start of the week. A few days later, he was spotted throwing himself down the water slide as the yacht cruised off Croatia on the Adriatic.\n\nThere's a huge infinity pool on the main deck, a Jacuzzi, cinema, gym, helipad and five state rooms for ten guests. Yet the only people seen on board have been Rogan, his wife Jessica Ditzel, a 49-year-old former cocktail waitress, and their two daughters, Lola, 17, and Rosy, 14.\n\nIt's a surprising holiday choice for a man who likes to scoff at superyachts on his show. He has berated guests for downplaying climate change and criticised Bill Gates and other billionaires for flying to climate summits in private jets.\n\nFor the record, Joe, experts say superyachts are far more damaging to the environment than private jets.\n\nThe lavish Rogan family getaway provides a valuable insight not only into the private life of the martial arts fanatic but also into the extraordinary amount of money he earns.\n\nLess than 16 years after Rogan and fellow comedian Brian Redban launched The Joe Rogan Experience as a rambling, cannabis-fuelled chat between two friends, the podcast now boasts 14million regular listeners. And chief among its roll call of guests has been Donald Trump, who appeared last October. The future President's three-hour interview hit 20million YouTube views in its first 20 hours, and is seen as a major factor in his re-election.\n\nThe podcast is tirelessly controversial and hugely lucrative. In 2020, the music-streaming giant Spotify reportedly paid more than £150million for exclusive rights to the podcast for three-and-a-half years. The deal was renewed last year for an estimated £185million.\n\nThese are staggering sums for the outpourings of Rogan, whose CV includes spells as a sitcom actor, a martial arts instructor and a newspaper delivery man. The sums may seem shocking but leaked financial documents later revealed that, in its debut month, his podcast accounted for 4.5 per cent of all shows heard on the Spotify platform, with audiences spending some 14.9 million hours tuned in.\n\nAnd the streaming deal counts for only a part of his fortune. According to online finance site Moneyzine, Rogan earns more than £105million a year in total, of which less than a quarter – some £45million – comes from Spotify. The rest includes £35million from podcast sponsors, £18million from live comedy shows and comedy for Netflix, £4million from YouTube advertising revenue, £1.5million from his stake in fitness brand Onnit and £1.5million from working as a commentator on martial arts contest Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\nEstimates of his net wealth hover around the £150million mark. He reportedly owns 15 properties worth £110million in total, four yachts and more than 20 cars.\n\nIn 2020, after complaining about the high taxes, overcrowding and restrictive Covid policies of California, Rogan moved his family to Austin, Texas, where they bought a £10million lakeside home. The 11,000sq ft property has its own bar, pool, gym, sauna and spa, as well as a studio where he records his podcast.\n\nRogan says he chose Texas primarily for the 'freedom', which also includes freedom to hunt. He's an eat-what-you-kill aficionado, whose freezer is packed with the bears, elk and moose he's bagged, often with bow and arrow.\n\nQuite how Rogan has become an adored and trusted icon for a good chunk of the world's young male population is a puzzle that even he struggles to explain.\n\nAlthough his blokeish demeanour – bullet-headed, tattooed and muscle-bound – suggests a nightclub bouncer, Rogan is personable and relentlessly optimistic on his show, even if his opinions seem unfiltered. His easy-going interview manner and vast audience means few turn down his invitation and the result is a guest list both eclectic and impressive.\n\nGuests have included Elon Musk, Bono, Mel Gibson, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, Left-wing firebrand senator Bernie Sanders, rapper Kanye West and US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden.\n\nRogan's interviews, usually at least two hours long, often three, tend to sound like two people chatting in a bar, the conversation veering in all directions.\n\nHis audience, which is 70 per cent male and 64 per cent white, and evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats – loves it. 'Cool conversations are a kind of mental nourishment,' said Rogan after Spotify renewed its deal with him.\n\nCritics, however, counter that these conversations are not remotely 'cool' when they allow dangerous misinformation to spread. Which, they add, happens rather too often given Rogan's preference for speaking to 'renegades' whose views are starkly at odds with the mainstream.\n\nSceptics concede Rogan can be funny and astute: back in 2020, he presciently compared the prospect of a second Joe Biden presidency to 'having a flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods'.\n\nBut they insist he doesn't have the intellect to quiz many of his guests and too often allows them to get away with untruths that Rogan's audience swallows blindly.\n\nAs for his own views, he insists he's socially liberal on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nHe also has a strong libertarian streak when it comes to taxes, freedom of speech and gun rights.\n\nHe claims to be ignorant on many issues – but that doesn't stop him having trenchant opinions on most of them.\n\nFavourite Rogan themes are generally laddish: masculinity, physical and mental self-improvement, drugs (Rogan is a big fan and partaker of both cannabis and psychedelics) and wokeness – of which he's definitely not a fan.\n\nIn 2021, Rogan caused a stir by claiming straight, white men had been silenced by 'woke' culture.\n\nThe drugs made headlines in 2018 when Elon Musk came on the podcast and, over the course of nearly three hours, the two men smoked weed and drank whisky.\n\nIncreasingly glassy-eyed, Musk brandished a Japanese sword and even a flamethrower. The following day, the share price of Tesla, his electric car company, sank.\n\nUntil he controversially endorsed Trump last year – a decision he appears to be reconsidering following the administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants – Rogan resisted being labelled as either a Democrat or Republican, although few mistook him for a bleeding-heart liberal.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience is definitely not to everyone's taste. He's upset liberals with unvarnished views on trans-people and women (he likes 'bimbo' jokes and calls women 'chicks') while Spotify has conceded he has a 'history of using some racially insensitive language'. Rogan has been accused of anti-Semitism, particularly in 2023 after he declared: 'The idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous.'\n\nIt's a fact, however, that a commentator who got into hot water for repeatedly using the 'N word' on the show still boasts many young black guys in his audience. Rogan, even his fiercest critics concede, is too powerful to be 'cancelled'.\n\nHis defence, trotted out whenever some new firestorm erupts, is that he's a stand-up comedian, not a trained journalist, and that he invites people on his show simply because they have something interesting to say.\n\nHis critics – increasingly from the Left – counter that when so many people trust what they hear on his podcast, Rogan has a duty to challenge the guests. And that, if he's not up to doing that, he shouldn't give them airtime. When Trump appeared on the podcast, US TV channel CNN counted as many as 32 false claims, none of them flagged by Rogan.\n\nThen there's Rogan's susceptibility to conspiracy theories. His claims that the Moon landings were faked and that the Ancient Egyptians didn't build the pyramids proved harmless enough.\n\nThen came the pandemic, when Rogan's loopy Covid and anti-vaccine pronouncements caused widespread alarm.\n\nHis repeated attacks on Covid-19 vaccines, promotion of sceptics on his podcast (including one who compared America's vaccine response to the rise of Nazi Germany) and his insistence that he'd dealt with the virus by taking a livestock deworming medicine led to an outcry among scientists and doctors in 2021.\n\nThey lambasted Rogan as a 'menace to public health'. Veteran rock stars Neil Young and Joni Mitchell ended up withdrawing their music from Spotify in protest. On that occasion, Rogan put up a bizarre defence, admitting that he often says 'stupid s***', continuing: 'I'm not a doctor. I'm a f***ing moron… I'm drunk most of the time and I do testosterone and I smoke a lot of weed. I'm not a respected source of information even for me.'\n\nUnusual, certainly, but then his background could hardly have been less orthodox.\n\nHe was born in Newark, New Jersey. His father was a policeman and his mother a 'free spirit'. He claims his father was a 'very violent, scary guy' and his parents divorced when he was five.\n\nAfter moving to San Francisco, where his mother married a hippy and would visit their gay neighbours 'to get naked with them and play the bongos and smoke pot', Rogan says they relocated to Boston, Massachusetts. He drifted at school but, after a bully picked on him, took up martial arts with such passion that he became a US taekwondo champion in his teens.\n\nRogan dropped out of university and in 1988, encouraged by friends, went into stand-up comedy. This led to acting in the 1990s when he played a clueless electrician in NBC sitcom NewsRadio.\n\nHis macho image – Rogan boasted of having the world's largest private collection of pornography – resulted in him being hired, from 2001 until 2006, to present Fear Factor, a reality TV series in which contestants had to undertake gruelling challenges. Meanwhile, he put his martial arts expertise to good use by becoming a cage-fighting commentator.\n\nIn 2009, just months before he launched his podcast, he married Jessica, despite having long dismissed marriage as pointless.\n\n'She lets me do whatever I do.

We need to do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire. The Russian side must stop avoiding decisions regarding prisoner exchanges, the return of children, and the cessation of killings,” Zelenskyy said.“A meeting at the leadership level is essential to genuinely secure peace.

While those discussions led to prisoner exchanges and returning the bodies of killed soldiers, no definite steps were taken to stop the conflict. According to Russian state media, Russia had presented strict territorial demands as a condition for a ceasefire. Ukraine has made it clear that it will not accept giving up any of its territory in return for peace.Umerov, a former defence minister of Ukraine, was appointed last week as the new head of the National Security and Defence Council.

President Donald Trump earlier this month gave Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace agreement with Kyiv or face severe economic consequences, including high tariffs on Russian exports and “secondary tariffs” on goods from countries that purchase Russian oil.“We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said during a meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office earlier this week.“I use trade for a lot of things,” Trump added. “But it’s great for settling wars.”The US president also pledged to supply Kyiv with new military aid, sponsored by Nato allies, as its cities suffer ever-increasing Russian aerial attacks.","summary":"President Zelenskyy announced Ukraine's proposal for renewed peace talks with Russia next week, aiming to revive ceasefire efforts after previous negotiations stalled.

PUDEMO, an opposition party, warned that accepting foreign deportees \"poses a serious risk to our already vulnerable communities\" that are battling high crime rates. The Swaziland Solidarity Network also criticised the move as an example of \"clear racism\" and said Swazi prisons are already overcrowded.\nCNN noted that Eswatini, a landlocked monarchy with a population of just over one million, is already struggling with poverty, unemployment, and deteriorating human rights. More than half its population lives on less than $4 a day, according to the World Bank.\nEswatini's trade relations with the US have also been strained. In April, the country was included in a list of US tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, with Eswatini exports facing a 10% rate starting August 1. CNN cited sources who believe the deportation deal could be politically motivated.\nGovernment spokesperson Mdluli told CNN that Eswatini is working with the US and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to facilitate the eventual transit of the deportees to their countries of origin, though the terms of the agreement remain classified.\nAccording to CNN, neighbouring South Africa, which refused a US request to accept third-country deportees, fears the convicts may attempt to cross porous borders into its territory. Another South African government source told CNN that this seems to be an attempt \"to destabilise South Africa,\" given its porous borders and Eswatini's struggling economy. One diplomatic source said the move by Washington \"was a provocation\" and a direct security threat to the region. Ken Opalo, a professor at Georgetown University, told CNN that African nations are under pressure from Washington to accept ambiguous deals, warning it is \"foolhardy\" to expect credible commitments from the Trump administration.\nThe uproar over the deportations reflects broader concerns about sovereignty, security, and transparency in US-Africa relations, especially in smaller nations like Eswatini, already grappling with internal challenges.

In a fiery Truth Social post on July 19, 2025, Trump cheered on a Fox News panel led by Harrison Fields, claiming they “prosecuted” Obama and his “thugs” for what he calls “unequivocally exposed” election fraud at the “highest levels” in 2016. Trump gave a shout-out to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, saying, “Keep it coming!!!” as she pushes for criminal charges against Obama and top officials for allegedly cooking up a “treasonous conspiracy” to sabotage his first term Gabbard’s 114-page declassified report, released on July 18, accuses Obama’s national security team: former DNI James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and advisor Susan Rice, of manipulating intelligence to falsely claim Russian interference favoured Trump. Citing documents like a December 7, 2016, memo stating no cyberattacks altered the election outcome, Gabbard alleges a December 9 White House meeting led to a January 2017 report that wrongly pinned Trump’s victory on Russia, sparking the Mueller investigation and political fallout, per timesofindia.indiatimes.com. She has referred evidence to the Department of Justice for potential prosecution, though no charges have been confirmed, per CNN. The Allegations and Counterarguments Gabbard’s report hinges on internal memos, including a December 8, 2016, President’s Daily Brief draft asserting Russia likely didn’t aim to sway the election via cyber means. She claims Obama directed a revised narrative, partly using the discredited Steele dossier, to undermine Trump, per Fox News. However, multiple investigations contradict her findings. A bipartisan 2020 Senate Intelligence Committee report found “irrefutable evidence” of Russia’s efforts to boost Trump, with no indication of fabricated intelligence, per Politico. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 2019 report confirmed Russia’s “sweeping and systematic” interference without evidence of Trump campaign collusion. Democratic leaders have dismissed Gabbard’s claims as unfounded. Sen. Mark Warner, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated the 2017 assessment was backed by a three-year probe. Rep. Jim Himes, House Intelligence Committee Democrat, called the treason accusations “baseless,” noting no credible investigation supports Gabbard’s narrative. A recent CIA review by Director John Ratcliffe, while critical of some 2017 methods, upheld Russia’s pro-Trump actions. Gabbard’s limited intelligence experience has also drawn scrutiny. Epstein Files Saga Adds Heat These explosive accusations come as the White House faces intense scrutiny over its handling of Jeffrey Epstein’s files, with Trump ordering Attorney General Pamela Bondi on July 18 to unseal grand jury testimony amid pressure from his base for a supposed “client list,” which the DOJ says doesn’t exist. Critics, including Democratic leaders, argue Trump and Gabbard’s election fraud claims are a calculated distraction from the Epstein controversy, which has resurfaced photos of Trump with Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s and a recent Wall Street Journal report alleging a suggestive 2003 letter from Trump, per Forbes.com. The timing of Gabbard’s report, released hours after the WSJ story, has fueled speculation that the administration is redirecting attention from Epstein-related questions to old political grudges.

In 2019, they wrote that the dish cost $68 – but it’s currently on the menu for $46.\n\nWhile Melania and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr have both reportedly been trying to improve President Donald Trump’s eating habits, the first lady’s diet could also be far from perfect.\n\nIt’s unclear how often Melania orders parmesan-crusted chicken – or if she ever makes it herself – but certain at-home recipes for the dish could put you over the safe limits for saturated fat and sodium.\n\nBaking chicken with excess oil or with butter can cause it to take on unnecessary grams of saturated fat, which causes cholesterol to build up in and block arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease.\n\nEven homemade parmesan-crusted chicken, depending on the recipe you use, can total over 1,300 milligrams of sodium, more than half the recommended daily limit. This raises blood pressure and puts strain on the cardiovascular system. \n\nThe calories also vary wildly, ranging anywhere from 500 to 1,000, half a day’s worth, depending on the size of the chicken, how it’s prepared and if it’s served with pasta on the side.\n\n‘If you eat this meal daily, high sodium and high saturated fat intake can increase your risk of hypertension and heart disease,’ Erin Palinski-Wade, a registered dietitian in New Jersey, told the Daily Mail.\n\nShe also noted that due to the high calories, ‘eating it too often may lead to weight gain, which can increase insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes.’\n\nPeople also pair chicken dishes like this with pasta and garlic bread, she said, ‘increasing the refined carbohydrate, calorie, sodium and fat content of the meal.’\n\nWhile the fat and sodium in parmesan-crusted chicken can be off-putting, skipping the butter sauce, foregoing breading and being mindful of your sides can make the dish healthier.\n\nCooking chicken with butter adds in extra calories.\n\nEach tablespoon contains about 100 calories. While this is roughly the same as olive oil, it has more cholesterol and lacks essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids. \n\nAdd in butter, additional cheese and potentially pasta on the side and it can easily reach over 1,000 calories, half the recommended daily amount for the average American. \n\nParmesan-crusted chicken may also be high in sodium because the cheese is naturally salted.\n\nSodium attracts and retains water, which increases blood volume throughout the body and puts more pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Over time, this leads to high blood pressure, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. \n\nToo much strain on the heart increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart disease. \n\nSaturated fat is also a concern, as it has been shown to raise LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.\n\nBecause the body can’t filter this excess out, it builds up as plaque in the arteries, which restricts blood flow and puts increased strain on the heart. \n\nThe American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 percent of your total calories in a day be from saturated fat. \n\nThis means in a typical 2,000-calorie diet, no more than 120 should be from saturated fat. This adds up to 13 grams or less. \n\nHowever, a healthier parmesan-crusted chicken is possible. Palinski-Wade recommends selecting a cheese with less sodium and fat.\n\nBaking the chicken instead of frying it, as some recipes recommend, also eliminates hundreds of calories of oil, while skipping any suggested breading entirely reduces calories, fat and sodium levels.\n\n‘This significantly reduces the fat and calorie content of the meal,’ Palinski-Wade said.\n\nShe also suggested using olive oil as an alternative for butter and pairing chicken with salad or baked vegetables.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMelania Trump&#8217;s favorite meal is shockingly high in saturated fat, calories and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Melania Trump&#039;s hidden indulgence carries a significant health risk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/melania-trumps-hidden-indulgence-carries-a-significant-health-risk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Melania-Trump039s-secret-guilty-pleasure-comes-with.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 23:58:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.609},{"id":343315292,"title":"SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE EMERGING NEW GLOBAL ORDER","text":"Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s (EU) top diplomat, declared in April this year that “the international order is undergoing changes of a magnitude not seen since 1945.” According to the American professor of International Relations Dr Leslie Vinjamuri, the international order is going through a period of appreciable change, marked by the decline of the post-World War II order and the rise of new power dynamics. \n\nThe post-1945 order, also referred to as the ‘liberal international order’, which was founded on the principles of democracy, free markets and multilateralism, is facing increasing challenges. This order has begun to be disputed by some rising powers, such as China, that are seeking to reshape the global landscape. The challengers point out the manner in which the powers advocating the principles of the liberal world order have continuously acted in ways that contradict what they claim they stand for. The rising powers are seeking a more multi-polar world order. \n\nSo, apart from China, who else is a rising power? Most Western scholars and commentators, perturbed by the way the rising powers have started to reshape the global order, are getting quite a few things wrong — mostly due to the baggage that they still carry of the eroding order. They see China, Brazil, India, South Africa, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico as the rising powers. \n\nYet, after the ‘100-hour war’ between Pakistan and India in May this year, quite a few Western analysts have tweaked their lists of rising powers. The war was ‘won’ by Pakistan after it downed multiple Indian fighter jets and left the Indian armed forces and government looking shocked and embarrassed. Recently, the American journalist and author Joshua Kurlantzick wrote that India was quickly losing its hegemony in South Asia. According to Kurlantzick, “The tide on the Subcontinent has shifted dramatically against India.” \n\n While Western nations and institutions still cling to a fading post-WWII framework, even as the ground beneath them shifts, countries such as China and Pakistan are stepping into new roles following the rise of multi-polar realism and the crumbling of the illusions of Western democracy\n\nChina has become the dominant power in the region and it has bolstered Pakistan’s military capabilities so that it can become China’s main bidder in the region. This partnership is deepening its relations with other South Asian countries, making India feel isolated. This feeling intensified when, during and after the 100-hour war, US President Donald Trump refused to support India’s position (that ‘Pakistan is a terrorist state’), as did the EU countries. \n\nIndia failed to provide any evidence of what it was claiming. The black eye that it received in the war further diminished the reputation that it had built for itself (that of being a South Asian hegemon). The US has been nurturing India to counter China’s influence in South Asia. But after India stumbled during the 100-hour war, many think-tanks in the US started to go back to the drawing board. \n\nSuddenly, to them, Pakistan has now become one of the most important players in South Asia — a country that, till just a few years ago, was being understood by them as a failing state. Such are the unpredictabilities of the emerging new global order. \n\nIndeed, Western think-tanks and governments did see what was coming (vis-à-vis the new global order). But instead of working towards finding a relevant place for Western powers in the new arrangement, they spent most of their energies in trying to stall the change. The thinking was/is that to reverse the effects of the emerging order, China’s economic growth and influence needed to be stopped. But after almost a decade of trying, they failed. China only seems to be getting stronger internally and externally, mainly through its economic muscle.\n\nIn 2021, writing for the Harvard Business Review, Rana Mitter and Elsbeth Johnson put forward an interesting thesis. They wrote that the West was trying to understand China from the lens of the liberal world order. The liberal world order posited that free trade and economic growth naturally led to democracy. One of the strongest examples of this is post-War Japan. Therefore, the Western powers saw the need of exporting the principles of this order to other countries as well for a ‘stable’, multilateral world.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Western powers believed that China’s economic growth would see the country adopt democracy and the principles of the liberal model. But when this did not happen, they began to employ more aggressive tactics to make it happen. It still didn’t. \n\nAccording to Mitter and Johnson, “China’s rapid economic growth has come in the context of stable authoritarian rule, suggesting that democracy and growth are not inevitably mutually dependent.” What’s more, a 2020 survey by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government revealed that 95 percent of Chinese citizens were satisfied with the Beijing government. \n\nAnother thing that is being missed are the changing definitions of democracy. The post-1945 concept of democracy that was actively propagated by the West now stands exposed to the elements. And the irony is, this is happening more in established democracies that were the champions of the liberal world order. \n\nSo, speaking for or idealising that model of democracy in the emerging global order has started to sound rather naive and even somewhat delusional. Aspiring new powers have gone ahead and developed their own models. Pakistan’s current ‘hybrid system’ is an example that was further strengthened by the country’s recent humbling of India and due to the gradual revival of the country’s economy. \n\nThen there are certain constraints that Western analysts impose on themselves that are retarding their understanding of the transformations transpiring in international politics. The following is a simple example. In December 2024, the website of Radio Free Europe (RFE) — a stark remnant of the liberal world order — asked ten of its most prominent journalists and analysts to predict what 2025 was likely to bring. \n\nThey discussed Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Europe, US, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Caucasus and even Belarus. But there was not a single mention of Israel, Gaza or Palestine. Over 60,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since late 2023. Gaza has become a major flashpoint that is likely to rearrange the Middle East in various ways.\n\nIt is entirely possible that RFE consciously avoided mentioning this flashpoint, because an ‘analysis’ in this regard may have upset the EU’s position vis-à-vis Israel. It is a position that has made numerous defenders of the liberal world order seem contradictory and even confused, if not entirely in denial. \n\nThis is, at least, one reason why the EU has started to look like a toothless tiger in the new emerging order. \n\nPublished in Dawn, EOS, July 20th, 2025","summary":"Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s (EU) top diplomat, declared in April this year that “the international order is undergoing changes of a magnitude not seen since 1945.” According to the American professor of International Relations Dr Leslie Vinjamuri, the international order is going through a period of appreciable change, marked by the decline of the post-World War II order and the rise of new power dynamics. \n\n\n\nThe post-1945 order, also referred to as the ‘liberal international order’, which was founded on the principles of democracy, free markets and multilateralism, is facing increasing challenges.

A defeat in the upcoming election could make it virtually impossible for Japan to further increase its defense budget, as only a few opposition parties support the move.\n\nDefense Minister Gen Nakatani said, \"Nothing has been determined at all\" regarding Japan's defense budget for fiscal 2028 or later, despite the country's expected exposure to direct or tacit pressure from the United States to spend more than 2 percent of its GDP.\n\nIn 2022, Japan decided to allocate 43 trillion yen ($289 billion) over five years through fiscal 2027 to reach the 2 percent benchmark, aligning with the then-standard among NATO members, amid growing security threats from China, North Korea and Russia.\n\nThe amount includes expenses for security-related \"complementary initiatives,\" such as research and development, public infrastructure construction and the coast guard, which are vital for bolstering Japan's defense capabilities.\n\nFor decades, Japan capped its annual defense budget at around 1 percent of GDP -- roughly 5 trillion yen -- reflecting its postwar pacifist stance under the war-renouncing Constitution, while maintaining its security alliance with the United States.\n\nNakatani said the initial defense budget for fiscal 2025, including related outlays, is set to total 9.9 trillion yen, equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP three years earlier -- evidence, he said, of steady progress toward the government's target.\n\nTo keep the 43 trillion yen outlay on track, the government has approved hikes in income, corporate and tobacco taxes, despite its debt burden topping 1,300 trillion yen -- more than twice the size of the economy.\n\nCorporate and tobacco tax hikes are set for April 2026, but the government has yet to finalize the timing of the income tax increase, even after Ishiba took over as prime minister from Fumio Kishida in October.\n\nIshiba's Liberal Democratic Party has pledged in its election campaign to \"adamantly defend our territory and citizens by fundamentally reinforcing defense capabilities,\" citing China's military buildup and North Korea's missiles as serious threats.\n\nMajor opposition parties, including the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan -- led by former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda -- and the Japan Innovation Party, also support strengthening the nation's defense capabilities.\n\nNoda, known as a fiscal hawk, has voiced opposition to raising taxes to cover increased defense spending, arguing the 43 trillion yen target lacks a solid basis. Rather than proposing alternative funding sources, he has pledged a consumption tax cut to support the economy.\n\nThe LDP's junior coalition partner, Komeito, along with opposition forces -- the Democratic Party for the People, Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan -- have made no clear reference to how the increased defense budget would be funded.\n\nAmong other opposition parties, Reiwa Shinsengumi, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party have all opposed expanding defense spending, calling on the government to uphold the Constitution.\n\nMasumi Ishizuki, general manager of the Policy and Macro Environment Research Department at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said the defense spending plan is unlikely to change significantly, regardless of the post-election government.\n\nIshizuki, meanwhile, pointed out that Trump, who took office in January with his \"America First\" banner, has been adding pressure on allies, prodding NATO countries to set a new target of investing 5 percent of GDP for defense and related expenses by 2035.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has also called on U.S. allies in Asia to pursue defense goals equivalent to those of NATO members. According to a diplomatic source, Washington has already asked Japan to spend 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense.\n\nSecuring sufficient financial resources to disburse such a large amount could be a tough task if the upper house election weakens the Ishiba government, as his ruling coalition is on the verge of losing its majority in the chamber.\n\nHirohito Ogi, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Geoeconomics at the International House of Japan, said the prime minister's limited influence could make Finance Ministry bureaucrats hesitant to cooperate in increasing defense spending.\n\nIf the political leader has a solid foundation, the ministry in charge of the national budget would have no choice but to cooperate, Ogi said, adding prospects for future defense spending

US in droves, despite Trump’s strict border stance: report","text":"There’s been a surprising spike in Aussies heading to the US after many were deterred by President Donald Trump’s strict border stance and other controversial government policies.\n\nAccording to new data released by the Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA), travel from Australia to the US increased by 4.8 percent year-on-year and was up 8 percent in May 2025 compared to May 2024.\n\nFigures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) were also up in various categories including traveling on a holiday (up 12 percent compared with last year), visiting friends or relatives (up 15 percent) or for business (up 8 percent).\n\nIt shows a solid improvement compared to April where there was a 6.2 per cent decline.\n\nUS inbound travel to Australia, however, slipped by 3.7 percent in May and remained flat year-on-year with a modest 0.6 percent rise.\n\n“The USA remains popular with outbound travelers, but the muted inbound response highlights challenges in achieving a balanced two-way tourism recovery,” ATIA director of compliance and membership, Nina Hedges said.\n\nDestinations Aussies are travelling to over the US\n\nThe US continues to take a back seat to destinations like Bali, Japan and Vietnam, which lead the way as Australia’s favourite overseas locations.\n\nAccording to recent ATIA figures, for the year ending May 2025, outbound travel surged by 12.5 percent to 12.21 million trips, driven by a strong appetite for travel across Asia.\n\nStandout growth included Indonesia (Bali) up 16.3 percent, Japan, up 32.4 percent, Vietnam, up 25.8 percent and China, up 26.9 percent.\n\n“Asia continues to shine as the preferred playground for Australian travellers, with Bali, Tokyo and Ho Chi Minh City topping itineraries for millions,” Ms. Hedges said.\n\nJapan specifically continues to see a growth in visitor numbers thanks to expanded flight options and the region’s strength with the AUD, allowing it to stretch further for accommodation, dining and shopping.\n\n‘Australia’s love affair with America could fade’\n\nFlight Centre chief executive and founder Graham Turner told news.com.au that in the first three months of 2025, leisure bookings to the US from Australia dropped about 12 to 15 percent compared to last year, while business travel remained “on par”.\n\nBut he anticipated the decline to “accelerate” for both leisure and business travel across April, May and June.\n\nJune figures are yet to be released.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Megginson, a personal finance expert at Finder, previously said perceptions of hostility and the current political climate “could see Australia’s love affair with America fade.”\n\nShe warned Australians to check their travel insurance policies carefully before going to the US as many insurers would not provide cover if you are denied entry at the border.\n\nThere’s been reported cases of tourists being denied entry on arrival and at times, strip searched and thrown in prison.\n\nIt comes as the US maintains strict immigration rules with significant emphasis on border security and entry eligibility.\n\n“With tensions rising on American soil, Australians are rethinking holidays to the US at the moment,” Ms. Megginson told news.com.au in June.\n\n“There’s growing sentiment among Australians that the potential issues that could arise when visiting the US are beginning to outweigh the appeal of visiting some of our favorite cities.\n\n“My husband recently got back from a week in Los Angeles, and he noticed a huge shift from previous visits: he was questioned in detail about all aspects of his trip and why he was travelling alone.\n\n“It was a really hostile welcome, and if travellers feel they’re being treated like suspects at the border, they’ll simply take their travel dollars elsewhere.”\n\nMeanwhile, according to Finder survey results, it appears older Australians are less likely to be deterred by what is happening politically in the US, with this age group actually traveling to the States more on Intrepid trips this year than they did last year.\n\nLeigh Barnes, who is the company’s managing director of the Americas, told news.com.au his team had increased their focus on domestic travel within the US, promoting the right products at the right time, and increasing their brand presence.\n\nCanadians visiting the US plummets\n\nOther visitors from other countries aren’t so enthusiastic about the US with Canada – the country’s biggest market for international visitors –

states, said the US is looking at a significant nine per cent drop in international arrivals for 2025, and a drop of $US8.5 billion – $A13 billion (-4.7 percent) in international visitor spending compared to last year.\n\nThe travel data company’s May report cited factors contributing to the negative outlook include Mr Trump’s administration posturing and policy announcements, such as ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs across longstanding trade partners.","summary":"There’s been a surprising spike in Aussies heading to the US after many were deterred by President Donald Trump’s strict border

It's not my language, it's not my words.'\n\nMr Trump has said he parted ways with Epstein before allegations against him became public in 2006. \n\nThe Mail on Sunday has learned Maxwell, currently serving 20 years in jail on child sex trafficking charges, began asking Epstein's friends for contributions to the birthday book at the end of 2001.\n\nIt was presented to Epstein, who was later convicted of being a paedophile, on his 50th birthday, on January 20, 2003.\n\nPrince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson – both friends of Epstein at that time – are also believed to have contributed letters to the book alongside Mr Clinton, who regularly flew in Epstein's private jet, dubbed 'the Lolita Express'.\n\nLast night, a source said: 'Ghislaine asked everyone they knew and that included presidents, princes and kings. \n\n'Bill Clinton wrote a warm and gushing letter. It was one page and profuse in its admiration for Jeffrey.'\n\nThe MoS has been told Epstein's close friend, Harvard scholar Henry Rosovsky, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson and computer pioneer Marvin Minsky also all contributed letters.\n\nThe WSJ claimed Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz wrote a letter but he has yet to comment about the claim.\n\nThe whereabouts of the original book is not known. \n\nIt is thought to have been seized during one of the raids on Epstein's homes in Florida and New York, where Maxwell kept 'dozens of albums' filled with pictures of their trips together including holidays to visit Prince Andrew at Balmoral, Buckingham Palace and Windsor. \n\nShe would have huge leather-bound albums made up after every trip, often with blue leather covers.\n\nThe letters are believed to have been included in more than 100,000 pages of evidence recently reviewed by 1,000 FBI agents working in 24-hour shifts.\n\nIt is believed the letters were copied by investigators and entered into evidence as facsimiles around the time the book was seized. \n\nA source claimed the WSJ's story was based on a 'poor facsimile' copy of the alleged Trump letter and said: 'The book is now sitting in a storage facility somewhere, if it still exists. \n\n'What was in the evidence pile were poor-quality copies of single pages, not a copy of the whole book.'\n\nMr Trump has found himself embroiled in a row over Epstein with his loyal MAGA base.\n\nHe had vowed 'full and complete transparency', saying he would release the Epstein files, but his Attorney General Pam Bondi caused outrage earlier this month when she released a statement claiming there was no 'client list' and that no further information would be released, sparking claims of a cover-up.\n\nOn Friday, Ms Bondi backtracked and filed court documents seeking the release of Grand Jury testimony in both the Maxwell and Epstein cases. \n\nEpstein died in jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on child sex trafficking charges.\n\nHis death was officially ruled a suicide but Maxwell's brother Ian told the Mail yesterday he believed the billionaire was murdered. \n\nHis sister is currently seeking an appeal in the Supreme Court.\n\nSources say it is unlikely that Prince Andrew will be mentioned in either tranche of documents. \n\nVirginia Giuffre accused Epstein of trafficking her three times to Andrew for sex, twice when she was just 17 and under age.\n\nAndrew vehemently and consistently denied the charges and later settled a £12 million civil suit with no admission of guilt.\n\nThe FBI has closed the investigation into Andrew and a source close to the probe said: 'The timelines of the cases are not when Andrew would have been around.'\n\nMr Clinton was approached for comment.","summary":"The former US president (pictured, with Epstein) was one of hundreds who contributed to a heavy leather-bound, gold-embossed album of letters compiled by Epstein's ex-lover

secret trip to Rupert Murdoch's Montana ranch before WSJ broke bombshell Epstein story","text":"Vice President JD Vance made a brief trip to Rupert Murdoch's Montana ranch a month before his newspaper published explosive claims that Donald Trump sent Jeffrey Epstein a salacious birthday card.\n\nVance spoke with the 94-year-old media mogul, his son Lachlan Murdoch and a group of other Fox News executives at the $280 million estate on June 11, sources told the Associated Press.\n\nIt's not clear why the vice president addressed the group or what they spoke about, but the meeting appeared to be brief.\n\nAccording to flight restrictions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the vice presidential aircraft, Air Force Two, was only on the ground for a matter of hours. \n\nAir Force Two landed in Butte – which is approximately 70 miles from the Murdoch ranch – around 2.30pm, according to NBC Montana.\n\nMurdoch bought the 340,000-acre Beaverhead cattle ranch in Montana from the billionaire Koch family, which had owned the property for 70 years, in 2021.\n\nThe ranch, located near Yellowstone National Park, is one of the largest in the state, and has a nearly 28-mile long private trout fishing river and is populated by elk, antelope and mule deer. \n\nAfter the Murdoch meeting, the vice president and his wife, Usha, then took a hike, Montana State Auditor James Brown, who helped plan the trip, told Montana Talks.\n\nAir Force Two then departed shortly after nightfall, an airport source told Politico's West Wing Playbook.\n\nMurdoch and his media organization have long been friendly with Republicans and the Trump administration.\n\nHe appeared at Trump’s inauguration and was spotted earlier this year in the Oval Office.\n\nHowever, their relationship has appeared to have soured and Trump launched a blistering attack on Murdoch and his newspaper.\n\nOne month after Vance's mysterious meeting, Murdoch's newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, reported that Trump sent Epstein the card in 2003 as part of a collection collated by Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nTrump has furiously denied the allegations and hit the newspaper and its owner with a $10 billion lawsuit.\n\nTrump's lawsuit, obtained by DailyMail.com, shows the libel suit filed in the Southern District of Florida against WSJ, Dow Jones, Rupert Murdoch and the paper's reporters who published the story in what Trump called a 'powerhouse' suit on Truth Social.\n\nTrump is requesting a jury trial and is suing 'for damages, punitive damages, court costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper, not to be less than $10 billion dollars.'\n\nA bombshell report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday claimed Trump wrote a 'bawdy' 50th birthday card to Epstein, which concluded: 'Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret.'\n\nThe newspaper said it had reviewed a typewritten letter bearing Trump's signature, framed by the seemingly hand-drawn outline of a naked woman, that Ghislaine Maxwell included in a 2003 birthday album.\n\nIn the text, the paper claimed Trump wrote: 'We have certain things in common, Jeffrey' and that both of them know that 'there must be more to life than having everything.'\n\nThe message is said to have included an X-rated drawing of a naked woman, with Trump's famous signature squiggle written across her genitals to mimic pubic hair.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the naked woman appeared to have been hand-drawn with a marker, with a pair of arcs indicating the woman's breasts and a squiggly signature reading 'Donald' appearing in her pubic region, mimicking hair.\n\n'I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,' Trump told the WSJ. 'It's not my language. It's not my words.'\n\nTrump has denied writing the letter or drawing the picture, calling it 'false, malicious, and defamatory.'\n\nThe Wall Street Journal bombshell, which Trump thoroughly denounced on social media, comes amid major MAGA outrage over a DOJ and FBI report published last week indicating no further Epstein-related files will be released.\n\nSince then, Republicans in Congress have faced pressure from their constituents to force the DOJ to release the files and conservative influencers have been pressuring lawmakers to act.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance made a brief trip to Rupert Murdoch's $280 million Montana ranch and spoke with with the 94-year-old media mogul, his son and a group of media executives.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14921809/JD-Vance-secret-trip-Rupert-Murdoch-Montana-ranch.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/19/23/100461807-0-image-m-31_1752964944072.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/19/1598561189575674436/1024x576_MP4_1598561189575674436.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-19 23:14:20","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":343308360,"title":"How Democrats Undermined Themselves: Self-Owns, Reckless Moves, Delays, and Vocal Mishaps Against Trump","text":"Democrats are facing a series of setbacks, and their attempts to challenge Trump have left them feeling embarrassed, demoralized, and in search of solutions. Let’s dive into five reasons why the Democrats lost to Trump and their composure alongside it.\n\nDemocrats often excel at unity, making it difficult for certain members to align with Republicans. However, last month was an exception when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) initiated a vote to impeach President Trump, only to see it fail with a striking count of 344 to 79 on the House floor. Clay Travis, founder of OutKick.com, summarized the fiasco on X.\n\nDemocrat impeachment attempt against Trump fails 344 to 79. Democrats voted against impeaching Trump 128 to 79. Tough look for AOC.\n— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) June 24, 2025\n\nI never thought I’d see a day when Democrats on the House floor voted in favor of keeping Donald Trump in office. That was something to behold. \n\nStupid Stunts\n\nTypically, when a Congressional member is set to make a questionable move, it doesn’t usually involve taxpayer money. Yet, that wasn’t the case when Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen embarked on a mission to El Salvador to “rescue” a constituent from Maryland. After deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, Senator Van Hollen pushed to reunite this seemingly upstanding individual with his family in America. The complication? Garcia is an MS-13 gang member with illegal entry into the U.S. and ties to human trafficking. This situation raised questions about why Van Hollen wanted him back in the United States, with the Department of Homeland Security expressing clear concerns. \n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia is not a “Maryland Man”—he is an MS-13 gang member involved in human trafficking who entered the United States illegally. His removal from the United States should have occurred under the Biden Administration. He will not return to our country under the Trump Administration.\n\nOnce Abrego Garcia was deported, Van Hollen made a show of his trip to El Salvador and the subsequent meeting he had with him. Politically, I know how the game is played, sometimes we push the limit to make a point—but this stunt by Van Hollen was purely driven by Trump Derangement Syndrome. Plus, our tax dollars paid for the trip.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDemocrats are facing a series of setbacks, and their attempts to challenge&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: How Democrats Undermined Themselves: Self-Owns, Reckless Moves, Delays, and Vocal Mishaps Against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-democrats-undermined-themselves-self-owns-reckless-moves-delays-and-vocal-mishaps-against-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hoo-Boy-New-Effort-by-Dems-to-Figure-Out-Why.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 23:03:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":343307100,"title":"GLEN OWEN: Blair's 'Dodgy Dossier' diplomat and a quiet coup in Downing Street","text":"Jonathan Powell was slinking through the shadows of diplomatic life when he was talent-spotted by Tony Blair and given unprecedented power as his chief of staff.\n\nWhile the majority of Mr Blair's inner circle fell away over the ensuing 12 years – the victims of scandal, fatigue or in-fighting – Mr Powell stayed firmly by the Prime Minister's side until they both left Downing Street in 2007.\n\nHis presidential-style job title carried with it the new, and arguably unconstitutional, right to issue orders to civil servants, and brought him into frequent contact with Peter Mandelson, now the UK Ambassador to Washington.\n\nThe two men are the real forces in British diplomacy, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy reduced to an effectively ceremonial role.\n\nBoth Mr Powell and Lord Mandelson have formidable private networks they are able to mobilise. In Mr Powell's case, as we report today, he founded an organisation, Inter Mediate, which is paid by Mr Lammy's department to carry out off-the-books diplomacy with rogue states.\n\nOxford-educated Mr Powell, 68, is the son of Air Vice-Marshal John Frederick Powell. He was described as an ultra-Left 'Maoist' at his private school. In stark contrast, his brother Charles, now 84, was foreign policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher when she was Prime Minister – and is the only one of four siblings to pronounce the family name to rhyme with 'pole' rather than 'towel'.\n\nJonathan Powell's early career in the Foreign Office took him to Lisbon, Stockholm and the spies' nest of Vienna towards the end of the Cold War. He was posted to the British Embassy in Washington in 1991 and caught Mr Blair's eye after introducing him to Bill Clinton.\n\nMr Powell's time as part of the 'sofa Government' with spin chief Alastair Campbell ranged from the highs of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 to the lows of the Iraq War and the publication of the 'dodgy dossier' justifying military action on the grounds that Saddam Hussein possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction.\n\nMr Powell's central role in the fiasco was revealed with the later release of an email he sent to John Scarlett, the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee in September 2002, which appeared to suggest that the language used in an early version of the dossier should be toughened up.\n\nWriting five days before the dossier appeared, Mr Powell asked: 'What will be the headline in the Evening Standard on the day of publication? What do we want it to be?'\n\nAfter leaving No 10, Mr Powell spent a year as a banker at Morgan Stanley before returning to diplomacy as the UK special envoy to Libya in 2014.\n\nThen, last year, he was appointed as Sir Keir's special envoy to resolve the Chagos archipelago sovereignty dispute. His solution was to recommend we hand it over, lock stock and barrel, to Mauritius.\n\nSince taking up his job as Sir Keir's National Security Adviser – controversially as a political position, rather than as a civil servant, as was previously the case – Mr Powell has used his experience to tutor the Prime Minister in how to handle Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and to explain the complexities of the Middle East.\n\nHe has also shuttled between London and Kyiv to try to broker a ceasefire in the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\nBut some within Downing Street are growing increasingly wary about the influence of these smooth Blairites. In addition to Lord Mandelson and Mr Powell, there is Liz Lloyd, Mr Powell's deputy in No 10 during the Blair era, who is Sir Keir's director of policy delivery.\n\nAt what point, they wonder, does 'experience' and 'guidance' become 'control'?","summary":"While the majority of Mr Blair's inner circle fell away over the ensuing 12 years, Jonathan Powell stayed firmly by the Prime Minister's side until they both left Downing Street in 2007.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-14921891/GLEN-OWEN-Blair-Dodgy-Dossier-diplomat-quiet-coup-Downing-Street.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/20/00/100461875-0-image-m-36_1752966004234.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 23:02:39","author":"Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.086},{"id":343319782,"title":"The Sino-American battle for brains","text":"Around the world, governments are racing to build world-class universities. From Germany’s Exzellenzinitiative to India’s “Institutes of Eminence,” the goal is the same: to cultivate institutions that attract and nurture top global talent, conduct cutting-edge research, and drive innovation and growth. But the stakes are particularly high in the US and China, given the escalating competition between the world’s two largest economies.\nThe struggle to lead in higher education is about more than prestige. Elite universities affect economic performance in myriad ways, including by fostering innovation, boosting productivity, and increasing individual earnings.\nGraduates from top-tier institutions are more likely to become scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs. At the national level, countries with higher average university quality tend to enjoy faster technological development and stronger productivity.\nA few years ago, any comparison of US and Chinese higher education would have been no contest. For decades, US universities have dominated global rankings, with institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Harvard forming the core of the innovation hubs that have been integral to the country’s global scientific leadership and entrepreneurial dynamism.\nMany of the world’s most valuable companies – including Google, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – were built by graduates of elite US universities.\nAs often as not, those graduates were not American. Over half of America’s billion-dollar startups have at least one immigrant founder, and a quarter were launched by individuals who first arrived in the US as international students.\nThis points to a key strength of America’s university system: its ability to attract the world’s top talent. International students account for 14% of enrolment at America’s top research universities, and 28% at elite institutions, such as the Ivy League universities, Stanford, and MIT. In the 2023-24 academic year, international students contributed nearly US$44 billion to the US economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs.\nBut America’s continued dominance in higher education is far from guaranteed. While US (and European) institutions still lead in global rankings, Chinese universities have been rapidly gaining on them in recent years.\nIn the QS and Times Higher Education rankings, Peking and Tsinghua universities have now broken into the top 20. And in the 2025 Nature Index, eight of the top ten global research institutions are based in China, with Harvard and Germany’s Max Planck Society being the only Western institutions that made the cut.\nMoreover, Zhejiang University, which has modelled itself on Stanford, has helped to transform Hangzhou into a Chinese Silicon Valley, with a vibrant startup ecosystem underpinned by strong government support and active university-industry collaboration. The AI powerhouse DeepSeek emerged in Hangzhou.\nChinese universities are particularly strong in the so-called STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). China now produces some two million science and engineering graduates annually, more than double the number in the US.\nEngineering degrees comprise 33% of all undergraduate qualifications in China, compared to just 8% in the US, and more than 600 Chinese universities now offer undergraduate programmes in AI. Today, nearly half of the world’s top AI researchers are of Chinese origin – and a growing number of them are choosing to work in China.\nThese developments are no accident. Rather, they reflect three decades of sustained government commitment, exemplified by initiatives like Project 985 and the Double First-Class Construction programme. And continued progress is virtually guaranteed.\nEarlier this year, China released a national strategy aimed at turning the country into an “education power with global influence” by 2035, particularly in areas like AI, semiconductors, and robotics.\nTo be sure, China’s push to lead in higher education will face considerable headwinds. Cutting-edge research and breakthrough innovation demand intellectual and academic freedom – the freedom to question prevailing ideas, explore new concepts, and update modes of thinking. As critics have warned, the Communist Party of China’s tight control over universities and the media is not conducive to any of this.\nNonetheless, China’s commitment to strengthening higher education is clear. The same cannot be said for the US, where President Donald Trump’s administration has effectively declared war on leading universities in the name of combating alleged ideological bias.\nThis has included freezing billions of dollars in research funding and demanding sweeping reforms by institutions like Harvard and Columbia, from curricula changes to the elimination of diversity programmes. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has sought to revoke and restrict visas for international students.\nThough the Trump administration’s attacks have been met with some resistance from universities, there has been at least as much capitulation. Now, trust in higher education is plunging, and foreign applications are falling sharply – a trend that is no doubt compounded by Trump’s broader immigration crackdown. These developments jeopardise not only US academic freedom, but also America’s long-standing economic, scientific, and technological edge.\nOne can only hope that the Trump administration’s assaults on higher education will prove to be short-lived, and the US will recommit to promoting academic freedom, welcoming international students, and supporting universities as incubators of groundbreaking ideas.\nWith China investing heavily in building world-class universities, courting foreign talent, and strengthening ties between industry and academia, the US cannot afford to take its academic primacy for granted. How the global “brain race” unfolds could affect technological leadership, economic power, and geopolitical influence for decades to come.\n\nLee Jong-Wha, professor of economics at Korea University, is a former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank and a former senior adviser for international economic affairs to the president of South Korea.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"With China investing heavily in building world-class universities, courting foreign talent, and strengthening ties between industry and academia, the US cannot afford to take its academic primacy for granted.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/07/20/the-sino-american-battle-for-brains","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ccde741a-graduation-freepik-resize-280525-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 23:00:46","author":"Lee Jong-Wha","authors":["Lee Jong-Wha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.247},{"id":343318660,"title":"Why conservatives can’t live without conspiracy theories","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nOver the last two weeks, President Donald Trump has been at odds with his MAGA base like never before.\n\nHis administration has said it will not disclose any further information on the case of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, and Trump has railed against his own supporters for not falling in line with the current narrative.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have taken him to task, highlighting how the right claimed that Trump’s election would lead to further disclosures. But now the GOP has stonewalled any attempts at transparency and possibly implicating Trump himself in the fallout.\n\nLed by Trump, conservatives spent years pushing conspiracy theories about Epstein and his death because it fed into longstanding narratives about the elite and Democrats. Supporters told themselves that Epstein’s sex trafficking was used to benefit the super-rich and that Democrats were covering it all up for the purported “globalists” they work in concert with.\n\nBut this isn’t a recent development. Modern conservatism has always been obsessed with this kind of wild conspiracy thinking.\n\nThe John Birch right takes control\n\nThe extremist John Birch Society rose to prominence on the right in the 1950s and 1960s in response to the rise of the so-called “liberal” world order under leaders like Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. \n\nBut it wasn’t enough for Birchers to simply oppose liberal ideas; they had to indulge in bizarre conspiracies, like the notion that the population was being brainwashed to support communism via fluoridated water.\n\nAfter the conservative uprising that led to Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona and his acolytes taking control of the party—and losing the 1964 election in a landslide—the conspiracy-first mindset, described as “the paranoid style,” became the default on the right.\n\nParanoia goes mainstream\n\nWhile some GOP leaders like Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush stoked conspiratorial fires over and over, there was an understanding that this brand of extremism was a political nonstarter. \n\nThe Republican establishment wanted the votes of conspiracy true believers without the public humiliation of standing by easily debunked absurdities.\n\nThis began to change after President Bill Clinton ascended to the White House in 1993. Frustrated by Clinton’s win, conservatives openly accused him and Hillary Clinton of operating a drug-trafficking ring and committing a series of murders, among many other easily debunked conspiracies.\n\nThis reached a fevered pitch when President Barack Obama was elected. The right couldn’t accept the legitimacy of a Black president and embraced the “birther” conspiracy, claiming that his birth certificate was false and that he was really Kenyan. Of course, Trump was the most prominent booster of this racist smear.\n\nFigures once on the outside, like Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, became normalized under Trump and the MAGA movement.\n\nSuddenly, the right began openly accusing Democrats of being part of a child sex-trafficking ring called “Pizzagate,” which inspired believers to commit crimes, including the Alex Jones fan who stalked a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant to liberate children from the establishment’s nonexistent basement.\n\nConspiracies mean simple answers\n\nIn a complex world with horrible things constantly happening that seem to defy explanation, conspiracy theories help to make things “make sense.” The right grasps onto these theories as a way to explain why the world doesn’t go their way.\n\nFor instance, many Republicans have simply never believed that a Black person is qualified to be president. Obama purportedly being a Kenyan with a sprawling conspiracy keeping him in office appears to them as a rational explanation.\n\nSimilarly, following Trump’s disastrous first term, many on the right had convinced themselves that he did a great job. Instead of reckoning with failures like the COVID-119 death toll on his watch, the right—led by Trump—argued that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nRepublicans have capitalized on this mindset, feeding their supporters a steady stream of conspiratorial nonsense, including debunked theories about the origins of COVID-19 and the QAnon conspiracy that involves elites attacking children for their blood.\n\nTrapped in their own trap\n\nConspiratorial thinking is the domain of the right.

The proposal, delivered by newly appointed Defence Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, invites Russian representatives to a new meeting scheduled for next week.\n\nIn his evening national address, Zelenskyy stressed the urgency of a ceasefire. “Everything should be done to achieve a ceasefire,” he said. “The Russian side should stop hiding from decisions.” He also reiterated his willingness to meet directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, insisting that a leadership-level meeting is essential for achieving “lasting peace.”\n\nUmerov, who previously served as defence minister, was appointed last week to reinvigorate peace efforts. He had led Ukraine’s delegation in earlier rounds of negotiations in Turkiye, which produced minimal progress beyond agreements on prisoner exchanges and the return of soldiers’ remains.\n\nRussia has not yet officially responded to the latest Ukrainian proposal. However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged on Friday that peace talks require “more momentum,” echoing Zelenskyy’s sentiments.\n\nThe renewed diplomatic push comes amid escalating military activity on both sides. On Saturday, Russia launched a large-scale drone and missile assault on Ukraine, with over 300 drones and 30 missiles striking 10 regions, including the key Black Sea port city of Odesa. At least one civilian was killed and six others injured, according to Ukrainian authorities.\n\nIn retaliation, Ukraine targeted infrastructure inside Russia. A Ukrainian drone strike in the Rostov region halted train operations overnight, injuring a railway worker. Moscow also reported that its air defence systems intercepted 27 Ukrainian drones throughout Saturday afternoon. Russian aviation authorities temporarily suspended operations at Vnukovo and Domodedovo airports in response to the attacks, though flights later resumed.\n\nMeanwhile, international pressure on Moscow continues to mount. U.S. President Donald Trump, reversing his earlier conciliatory stance, has given the Kremlin a 50-day ultimatum to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping economic penalties, including 100 percent tariffs and secondary sanctions on Russian oil buyers. He also pledged to significantly increase arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nRussia responded sharply to Trump’s threats. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova condemned the U.S. position as “blackmail” and claimed that Washington’s actions were undermining the peace process. She said the resumption of American arms support signalled Ukraine’s intention to abandon negotiations.\n\nDespite the exchange of fire and hardening rhetoric, Zelenskyy remains committed to diplomacy. “A meeting at the leadership level is needed to truly ensure peace,” he insisted. With over 1.2 million people estimated to have been killed or wounded since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the human toll continues to climb in what has become Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies","summary":"KYIV – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Saturday that Ukraine has extended an offer [...]","url":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/world-news/zelenskyy-offers-fresh-peace-talks-with-russia-renews-call-for-meeting-with-putin/","image":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Zelenskyy.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:57:43","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zw","sentiment":0.11},{"id":343308146,"title":"Trump Urges Senate Leader to Cancel Summer Recess to Confirm Nominees","text":"In a Truth Social post on Saturday afternoon, President Donald Trump urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, to cancel the Senate's summer recess and its long weekend breaks to push through his nominee confirmations.\"Hopefully the very talented John Thune, fresh off our many victories over the past two weeks and, indeed, 6 months, will cancel August recess (and long weekends!), in order to get my incredible nominees confirmed,\" Trump wrote. \"We need them badly!\"This is breaking news, more updates to follow.","summary":"The president has urged Majority Leader John Thune to cancel the Senate's summer recess and its long weekend breaks to push through his nominee confirmations.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-urges-senate-leader-cancel-summer-recess-2101318","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686567/donald-trump-john-thune.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=926b0e547a23cb8524fe9dad16f70a32","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:55:38","author":"Adeola Adeosun,Hannah Parry","authors":["Adeola Adeosun","Hannah Parry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":343305820,"title":"Gabbard: DOJ should investigate Obama administration for 2016 claims","text":"July 19 (UPI) -- The Obama administration should be investigated for abuse of power to smear President Donald Trump in 2016, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard said on Friday.\n\nGabbard announced the release of files and a memo related to claims of Russia's alleged attempt to disrupt the 2016 elections to help Trump win the presidency over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"There was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of government,\" Gabbard said in a news release on Friday.\n\n\"Their goal was to subvert the will of the American people and enact what was essentially a years-long coup with the objective of trying to usurp the president from fulfilling the mandate bestowed upon him by the American people,\" Gabbard said.\n\nShe accused the Obama administration of an \"egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution\" that \"threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama and his national security cabinet members \"manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork\" for falsifying claims that Russia acted to influence the election in Trump's favor and to impeach the president, according to the DNI release.\n\nGabbard in 2019 was a member of the Democratic Party and a representative from Hawaii who said, \"I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,\" during the Dec. 18, 2019, House vote to impeach Trump, according to Politico.\n\nThe DNI release says the U.S. intelligence community consistently concluded Russia likely was not trying to influence the 2016 election, and then-DNI Director James Clapper on Dec. 7, 2016, concluded \"foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks\" to alter the election results.\n\nDespite evidence to the contrary, Gabbard says Obama and others tasked Clapper with creating a new intelligence community assessment that claimed Russia acted to influence the election.\n\nObama officials then leaked false statements claiming Russia tried to influence the election's outcome and produced a new assessment on Jan. 6, 2017, that contradicted prior assessments on the matter, according to the DNI.\n\nGabbard said she is forwarding relevant materials to the Department of Justice for possible legal action.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have challenged Gabbard's announcement.\n\n\"The unanimous, bipartisan conclusion was that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Donald Trump,\" Sen.

'He is of firm belief that Nick Saban will coach in college football again.'\n\nBut some would say there are no sources more reliable than Saban's own family and his daughter, Kristen, has refuted those claims.\n\nShe posted a picture on her Instagram story of her dad walking onto the field with the caption: 'Damn, I miss this.' \n\nFans thought she was fueling those claims that Saban was going to return to the sideline.

Student-athletes can now be compensated for merely showing up to play and can earn a profit for spokesperson gigs, clothing and autograph sales and more.\n\nAdditionally, a legal ruling on June 6 allowed colleges to directly pay players via revenue sharing for the first time. The settlement of House v. NCAA marked the end of the NCAA's previous model of amateurism, in which athletes were not allowed to earn money while in school. Schools can now share up to $20.5million of their revenues with their athletes.\n\nThe reports of an upcoming executive order come one day after a House subcommittee advanced a bill along party lines that would establish national standards for student-athlete sponsorships. \n\nCalled the SCORE Act, the proposed legislation would supersede current state laws regulating NIL.\n\nThe White House has not commented on the latest report of an NIL-related executive order, but President Trump has a long history of expressing interest in sports. He has attended many major sporting events, including several prominent college football games like the Army-Navy football game last December.\n\nSaban has been critical of the NIL funding in the past, largely because he was concerned about the effect on college football. \n\nThe NIL era also has brought a rise to the transfer portal era, with thousands of students across all sports seeking to move schools - some of them for bigger paydays.","summary":"Rumors swirled this week that the seven-time national champion was eying a return to the sidelines a couple of years after his final season with Alabama.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-football/article-14921793/Nick-Saban-daughter-rumors-retirement.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/19/23/100461117-0-image-m-15_1752962894193.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:26:48","author":"Editor,Max Winters","authors":["Editor","Max Winters"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":343301784,"title":"Zelensky Proposes New Peace Talks With Russia Amid Ongoing Bombardments In Ukraine","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has proposed a new round of peace talks with Russia in an effort to revive stalled negotiations and push for a ceasefire.

Let's take a deeper dive.\n\nWhat lies beneath\n\nVancouver-based TMC wants to harvest ocean-floor rocks called polymetallic nodules. These prehistoric, potato-size nodules are rich in nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper, which are considered critical metals for U.S. manufacturing, power generation, infrastructure, and defense. \n\nThey're also vital to a lower-carbon future. Nickel, cobalt, and manganese are key ingredients in many electric vehicle (EV) battery chemistries, while copper is critical for EV wiring, motors, charging stations, and even solar panels. \n\nThe long list of use cases for these metals shows just how important they are to the U.S. economy. Here are a few examples:\n\nData source: TMC The Metals Company. \n\nThe Department of Energy estimates that over 80% of America's supply of critical minerals -- the raw ingredients for these metals -- comes from foreign sources. Given the heightened geopolitical tensions in the world today, that's a national security concern. But it's also an environmental issue. Land-based mines where these minerals are sourced threaten some of the world's most biodiverse and sensitive ecosystems, such as the rainforests of Indonesia and the Philippines. \n\nTMC has stated that deep-sea mining offers access to critical minerals with far less disruption to sensitive ecosystems, and has promised full transparency into the environmental impacts. However, environmental groups and marine scientists warn that disturbing the ocean floor could pose serious risks to biodiversity, especially in ecosystems that are slow to recover, if they recover at all. As with many emerging technologies, the ecological trade-offs are still being debated -- and TMC's framing should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nTMC hasn't started mining\n\nTMC The Metals Company holds exploration rights for two large swaths of the Pacific Ocean's Clarion-Clipperton Zone -- a 1.7 million-square-mile abyssal plain between Hawaii and Mexico that's teeming with mineral-rich nodules. However, TMC has no legal authority to begin commercial operations there until the International Seabed Authority (ISA) -- an organization formed by the United Nations to regulate mineral activity on the high seas -- finalizes its long-delayed rules for deep-sea mining. \n\nIn the meantime, TMC is hedging its bets. In late April, just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to boost domestic access to offshore critical minerals, TMC applied for a mining permit by way of a U.S. law passed in 1980. \n\nThe International Seabed Authority oversees mineral mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. However, the United States never ratified the UN treaty that created the ISA, and doesn't formally recognize the agency. So if the Trump administration decides to unilaterally assert America's right to mine in the Pacific, it could provide TMC a faster legal pathway to begin commercial operations -- albeit a controversial one.\n\nIs TMC a buy?\n\nTMC's 576% run-up this year shows just how tricky it can be to value a company with no revenue and no commercial product. In the meme-stock era, valuations can become totally unmoored from business fundamentals. TMC The Metals Company is a prime example.\n\nLike many start-ups, TMC is burning through cash. TMC reported a $20.6 million net loss in Q1 2025, and CEO Gerard Barron recently boasted that the company has invested more than $500 million \"in deep-sea science, engineering, and technology to build the world's most advanced deep-sea minerals platform.\" \n\nThe good news is management believes that its liquidity at the end of the first quarter -- $2.3 million in cash and $41.5 million in available credit -- should cover operations through at least May 2026. And the company recently announced an $85 million equity investment from Korea Zinc, one of the world's top non-ferrous metal refiners. \n\nWhile there's no question that TMC has massive potential, there are big risks as well. Deep-sea mining is an unproven business model. If TMC gets the green light to start harvesting polymetallic nodules in the Pacific, there's no telling if the company can do it profitably.\n\nTMC has laid out some wildly ambitious projections. In a 2021 investor presentation, the company estimated that its flagship NORI-D project in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone would begin commercial production by 2024 and generate nearly $2 billion in EBITDA by 2027, with estimated annual revenue of $4.7 billion from 2030 to 2046. Those numbers are based on a long list of assumptions -- from favorable commodity prices and permitting timelines to full-scale production volumes -- and they haven't been updated since. \n\nUntil TMC The Metals Company has a more well-defined path to commercial production -- and can provide more detail on its potential revenue and earnings -- TMC is a highly speculative bet. If you're thinking about starting a position, expect choppy waters for now.","summary":"You don't need a periodic table of the elements to see the potential in TMC.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/19/should-you-buy-this-ev-metals-stock-thats-up-460-t/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F824545%2Fgettyimages-525894241.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:14:00","author":"Josh Cable","authors":["Josh Cable"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":343301582,"title":"Powell once said he couldn’t imagine leaving the Fed early—other than dying. ‘You will not see me getting in the lifeboat’","text":"As President Donald Trump continues to put pressure on Powell, an earlier standoff between the two men could offer clues on how their current one might play out. \n\nIn 2019, like today, Trump demanded the Fed hurry up and cut rates amid a trade war he had launched, raising questions about Powell’s future as Fed chief and whether he would step down. \n\nDuring a House Financial Services Committee hearing in July of that year, Powell was asked by then-Chairwoman Maxine Waters, “If you get a call from the president today or tomorrow and he said ‘I’m firing you. Pack up and it’s time to go.’ What would you do?”\n\n“Of course I would not do that,” Powell replied.\n\n“I can’t hear you,” Waters said, prompting laughter in the chamber.\n\n“The answer would be ‘no,’” Powell reiterated.\n\n“You think the president doesn’t have the authority. Is that why you would not leave?” Waters asked.\n\n“The law clearly gives me a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it,” Powell said.\n\nAccording to the 2022 book Trillion Dollar Triage by Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Timiraos, he was even more adamant in private about not stepping down early.\n\n“I will never, ever, ever leave this job voluntarily until my term ends under any circumstances. None whatsoever. You will not see me getting in the lifeboat,” Powell told a reporter that spring. “It doesn’t occur to me in the slightest that there would be any situation in which I would not complete my term other than dying.”\n\nFor Powell, who was first appointed Fed chief by Trump, the top priority was to ensure the U.S. economy continued to expand but also to preserve the Fed as an institution, including its independence, according to the book.\n\nWeeks after that House hearing, the Fed lowered rates a quarter point, but Trump kept haranguing and insulting Powell, calling for even more easing.\n\nGiven that history, Powell’s tenure became an issue again after Trump was re-elected. In November, Powell was asked whether he would step down if asked by Trump. He replied no, adding later that it’s “not permitted under the law” for the president to fire or demote him or any other Fed governors in leadership positions.\n\nMonths later, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs across U.S. trading parters, raising fears of stagflation—weak economic growth coupled with high inflation. While inflation hasn’t spiked yet and growth remains intact, the Fed has held off on lowering rates, drawing the ire of Trump. \n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said it was “highly unlikely” that he would fire Powell, while confirming that he had discussed the “concept” of dismissing him with House Republicans during a White House meeting Tuesday night.\n\nStill, Trump and other White House officials have continued to attack Powell over renovations at the Fed’s headquarters, accusing him of mismanagement. \n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a longtime critic of Powell, suggested the renovation issue was “a pretext to get him fired.” Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other chiefs at top banks said this past week that central bank independence is crucial to the economy and financial markets.\n\nPowell’s term as chairman of the board of governors expires in May 2026, but his term as a governor extends to January 2028. That means he would still be eligible to serve as chairman of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, if he chooses to stick around as governor. \n\nHistorically, the board chair has also been FOMC chair, but the law allows the FOMC to determine its own internal organization. So it’s possible one person could serve as Fed board chair, and a different person could serve as FOMC chair.\n\nOn Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said moves to replace Powell are under way and suggested that he should consider stepping down from the Fed entirely once his chairmanship ends.\n\n“Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor,” he told Bloomberg. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination.

Paxton's office characterized the situation as allowing \"men to win countless events,\" reflecting the state's position that biological sex should determine competitive categories.This legal challenge comes amid broader federal action targeting transgender athletes. In February, Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The administration has also threatened to withhold federal funding from states that don't comply with these directives.The policy debate recently escalated in California where Trump threatened \"large scale fines\" against Governor Gavin Newsom after 16-year-old transgender athlete AB Hernandez won gold in high jump and triple jump at the state high school championship. The California Interscholastic Federation subsequently changed its rules to allow more cisgender girls to compete and medal in events where transgender athletes participate.USMS had already begun revising its policies before the Texas lawsuit was filed. The organization now bars transgender women from receiving official recognition for placing in women's events while still allowing them to participate in competitions. However, the lawsuit dismisses these changes as \"too little, too late.\"What People Are SayingUSMS released a Facebook statement on Friday: \"The Texas Office of the Attorney General notified U.S. Masters Swimming on May 19 that it was conducting an investigation into policies pertaining to transgender athlete participation in USMS competitions. USMS has been cooperating fully with the investigation and has been working with the Texas Office of the Attorney General to hopefully reach an agreement about the policy. USMS implemented an interim eligibility policy on July 1 in response to feedback from our members and the Attorney General's office and in line with our partnership with World Aquatics, which USMS is a member federation of.\"\"USMS surprisingly learned yesterday via social media that the Texas Office of the Attorney General filed a lawsuit against USMS and the five LMSCs that operate in the State of Texas. USMS is currently reviewing the allegations. To be clear, under USMS's policy (which aligns with World Aquatics policy), trans women are not eligible to receive records, Top 10 times, or awards in the women's category at all USMS-sanctioned events, and trans men are eligible for those competitive recognition programs in the men's category. Moreover, trans women swimming in the women's category do not displace other women from participating or receiving recognition in any USMS event. USMS policies referenced have been publicly posted on our website since 2012 and are outlined in our annually published Code of Regulations. More information about USMS's interim eligibility policy can be found in our FAQs.\"The statement concluded: \"USMS is a national nonprofit community of adult swimmers focused on health and fitness. It is deeply disappointing to see our organization and individual members publicly targeted in a lawsuit that appears to be more about generating headlines than seeking justice. USMS will continue to cooperate fully with the Texas Office of the Attorney General and to uphold the values that have guided our community for more than 50 years.\"What Happens Next?USMS says it will continue cooperating with the attorney general's investigation while defending its policies in court.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Ken Paxton sued U.S. Masters Swimming over transgender women competing in an April meet, alleging unfair advantage.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/texas-ag-sues-swimming-group-transgender-athletes-masters-meet-2101286","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2686540/ken-paxton.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6514d8a8809ad5c2e61e2e4e029b7de4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:06:42","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":343301002,"title":"The unwatchably awful Stephen Colbert interview that proves why he was doomed: MAUREEN CALLAHAN delivers the real story... and unmasks America's most loathsome late-night host","text":"Another one bites the dust.\n\nThat's it and that's all for the late-night host Stephen Colbert, whose intolerance, intransigence and nightly screeds against Trump have surely led CBS to kill his entire show.\n\nR.I.P. The Late Show, dead at 33 — the same age as Christ, which I mention because Colbert, a vocal Catholic, is busy turning himself into a martyr.\n\nYes: The insufferable Stephen Colbert has been crucified by his network, he'll have us believe, for speaking out against one Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe reflexive celebrity testimonials from the likes of Ben Stiller, Katie Couric and Adam Scott immediately poured in. And — surprise, surprise — they're not generating the intended response.\n\nTake a look at Jason Alexander, the Seinfeld star who posted on Instagram, in part: 'Stephen… you will not be silenced or dismissed.'\n\nWell, Jason, he just was — and unceremoniously at that.\n\nResponses to that post make it clear how little people agree.\n\nOne: 'We need more humor and less virtue signaling.'\n\nAnother: 'To make the whole show every day political? That's why they dropped him… S**t gets old no matter what side you sit on.'\n\nAnd my favorite, which speaks to millions of Americans: 'He chose to use his platform as his own personal sermon. After I've worked 12 hours, then cooked dinner and got my kids ready [for] bed, I don't want to be lectured to or demeaned if my politics differ. It's a special kind of arrogance to think that you, as a comedian, can stop doing your job and instead use your show as a pulpit.'\n\nIn an official statement, CBS says it was 'purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night' and nothing to do with the show's 'content'.\n\nBut while every late-night show except Greg Gutfeld's on Fox limps along on life support, Colbert was the worst host of them all: strident, hectoring, a total scold and schoolmarm monomaniacally animated by hatred of Trump — which translates into hatred of more than half the country.\n\nRather than accept that CBS has made a prudent business decision — Colbert's show cost $100 million to produce and lost $40 million annually — Hollywood insists Colbert is the sacrificial lamb in the pending merger between CBS parent company Paramount and Skydance (owned by the son of billionaire Trump loyalist Larry Ellison).\n\nA lot of heavy weather has also been made of the recent $16 million Paramount payment to settle Trump's lawsuit against the network, which just this week Colbert slammed as a 'big, fat bribe.'\n\nTruly, Stephen Colbert poses no threat to Trump.\n\nHe speaks in an echo chamber. He's just an unfunny guy who takes himself way too seriously, whose own mission creep turned his show into unwatchable punditry, and who, rather than engage in witty banter, is always out to prove he's the smartest guy in the room.\n\nTake his 2017 interview with Ricky Gervais — a far finer mind — in which a smug Colbert initiated a debate about religion and tried to discredit Gervais's well-known atheism.\n\nLate-night banter indeed.\n\nGervais: 'You believe in one God, I assume.'\n\nColbert: 'Uh, in three persons, but yeah.'\n\nGervais: 'So there are about 3,000 [gods through human history] to choose from… so basically, you deny one less god than I do.'\n\nThat clip has over 15 million views on YouTube, which should have told Colbert something — namely, to tone down the smug self-regard and use his platform for its intended purpose: laughter.\n\nBut no. Colbert is way too important for that. In a June 2024 profile with Entertainment Weekly, Colbert pulled out a photo not of late-night legends Johnny Carson or David Letterman but famed news anchor Walter Cronkite.\n\n'This is my reminder,' Colbert intoned, 'that Walter Cronkite started off as a morning anchor who had a puppet lion, so let's not hear about the dignity of CBS News. F**k you.'\n\nThe arrogance. The hubris. Colbert was paid a reported $15 million a year, yet insulted his bosses in print and on his show — and thought he was too important to face consequences! \n\nInstead, of course, he and his cohort blame Trump — who, frankly, has bigger problems to deal with than this late-night hack.\n\n'Everyone knows what happened,' a Colbert show source told the Daily Mail. 'He came out against Trump and now he's gone.'\n\nOr maybe he just bleeds $40 million annually and can't book any guests bigger than Rep. Adam Schiff, who told President Trump to 'piss off' on Thursday night's show.\n\nIt's similarly grim for the apolitical Jimmy Fallon, cut down from five to four nights a week at NBC; Seth Meyers, who had to fire his band after budget cuts; and Jimmy Kimmel, whose viewing figures lag some 600,000 behind Colbert.\n\n'F**k CBS,' said Kimmel this week.\n\nHow brave. How impactful. Listen, Kimmel — your days are numbered, too.\n\nUltra-liberal Jon Stewart, who returned to his desk at The Daily Show after all manner of other projects failed to launch, on whether his own show will last much longer: 'I honestly don't know. They may sell the whole f**king place for parts.'\n\nThese guys just refuse to get the memo. They still cling to the sinking ship of liberal legacy media and linear TV, which viewers are rejecting in droves.\n\nEven Gutfeld!, which dominates with three million nightly viewers, is a shadow of what late-night TV was before YouTube and digital media.\n\nThe Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, which ran from 1962 to 1992, typically pulled in over 15 million viewers.\n\nThink about it: Carson's show ran through the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy, the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War, Watergate, Roe v. Wade, the Cold War, the AIDS epidemic, and the fall of the Berlin Wall — to name just a few political and historical earthquakes.\n\nAnd viewers never, ever knew Carson's politics.\n\n'That's not what I'm there for,' Carson said. 'Why do they think that just because you have a Tonight Show that you must deal in serious issues? It's a danger — it's a real danger. Once you start that, you start to get that self-important feeling that what you say has great import, and you know, strangely enough, you could use that show as a forum, you could sway people. And I don't think you should as an entertainer.'\n\nCarson was called 'The King of Late Night' for a reason. And descendants like Stephen Colbert, with that 'self-important feeling,' now preside over the end of an empire.","summary":"Another one bites the dust.  R.I.P.

Donald Trump is in the Epstein files,” Musk wrote. “That’s the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day.”\n\nThe post went viral before Musk quietly deleted it. But the damage was done. For the first time, Trump was facing a serious revolt from his own base, and the spark had come from someone outside politics, someone arguably more powerful online: Musk.\n\nMusk’s Calculated Strike\n\nThe breakdown in the Trump–Musk alliance began publicly on June 5, when the former president, angered by criticism from Musk, suggested the government might review federal contracts awarded to Musk’s companies, particularly the NASA deals with SpaceX. That same day, Tesla’s stock plunged, shedding $150 billion in market value.\n\nBut what went largely unnoticed at first was Musk’s decision to drag Trump into the darkest and most radioactive conspiracy theory in the MAGA universe: Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nFor years, Trump’s supporters have clung to the belief that Epstein, the convicted sex offender with ties to elites in politics, finance, and royalty, was murdered to protect powerful Democrats. The so-called “Epstein files” have become a rallying cry for those who believe the system protects pedophiles and punishes truth-tellers.\n\nUntil Musk reignited the flame, interest in the files had died down. The “Phase 1” document release in early 2024 had failed to implicate major Democratic figures, leaving the MAGA base disappointed. Then Musk tossed a grenade.\n\nFeeding the Fire With Grok\n\nIn a series of follow-up posts on July 17, Musk asked Grok, the AI chatbot built into his X platform, to generate a list of people who had visited Epstein’s infamous private island because, according to him, they “should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein,” Musk wrote. “Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes.”\n\n Please make a thorough list of all those who should be investigated for possible rape of underage girls provided by Epstein. Think hard and research thoroughly. Order by probable severity and frequency of their crimes. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 17, 2025\n\nIt was a direct appeal to MAGA’s most emotional instincts: fear, anger, and the desire for retribution. But this time, Trump was no longer the crusader against the elite. He was being cast as part of it.\n\nTrump’s Losing Grip\n\nTrump tried to dismiss the accusations, calling them a “dumb hoax,” and urged his followers to move on. But many of them refused. Influential conservative pundit Matt Walsh captured the mood: “Trump was elected in 2016 partly on a pledge to ‘lock her up.’ Yelling at us to stop talking about Epstein only makes us talk about him more.”\n\n Trump was elected in 2016 partly on a pledge to “lock her up.” Arresting and prosecuting powerful and corrupt people has been a core issue for MAGA since its inception. That’s what the Epstein issue is about. And it’s why the base can’t and won’t just drop it. pic.twitter.com/b011aM7XAG — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) July 16, 2025\n\nOnline, the backlash snowballed. Users mocked Trump’s distractions—policy announcements and petty grievances—while demanding transparency. The hashtag #ReleaseTheEpsteinFiles exploded again.\n\nThe anger intensified after the Department of Justice (DoJ) fired federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, who had reportedly reopened parts of the Epstein investigation. For many, it was further proof that Trump was protecting someone, or himself.\n\nThe Perfect Strike\n\nMusk identified the one thing Trump’s base couldn’t ignore—Epstein—and used it to shake their loyalty.\n\nFor a decade, Trump had cultivated a movement built on conspiracy, suspicion, and moral outrage. Musk flipped the script. And the effect was immediate. Some thought the CEO of Tesla and founder of SpaceX was playing with fire. SpaceX relies heavily on federal contracts, and Trump made clear that retaliation was on the table. But six weeks later, Musk is back to business, and Trump is still trying to put out the fire.\n\nMusk pierced the armor of MAGA. By using the movement’s own moral language against its founder. He created a crack in Trump’s once impenetrable base. It was a strategic hit.\n\nFor the first time since 2016, Donald Trump isn’t setting the agenda. He’s reacting to someone else’s. And Elon Musk is the one holding the remote.\n\nMusk 1.

In fact, many of the young, rebellious faces in the crowd are paid actors content to earn a paycheck on behalf of very wealthy individuals who are committed to artificially manipulating the US political system.\n\nEnter Adam Swart, the CEO and founder of Crowds on Demand (CoD), whose website details a long list of services it provides to give any political movement the booster rockets it needs to get off the ground.\n\n“If you need to hire protesters, we can get a crowd on the street, sometimes within 24 hours time. If you need speakers to present at a council meeting, we can provide talented and well-spoken individuals to advocate for the cause. We also have a dedicated team of phone-banking staff who can call Congressional Offices and convince government officials to support your cause and help you overcome opposition. If you need lots of letters and emails written from constituents, we have a network of tens of thousands of individuals across the country who can send well-written constituent letters to their representatives…”\n\n“We are the ultimate guerilla lobbying and government relations firm,” the website boldly declares.\n\nSwart was forthcoming with the information that his publicity firm was offered a lucrative contract to assist in a Democrat-backed astroturfing effort.\n\n“Interests aligned with the organizers of the July 17th movement have approached us and, in fact, we rejected an offer that probably is worth around $20 million dollars,” Swart admitted to NewsNation’s Brian Entin in an interview.\n\nOn July 17th, protests took place around the country against the Trump administration, organized by Good Trouble Lives On, a left-wing progressive organization. July 17th was the fifth anniversary of the death of former Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights leader who referred to protests as “good trouble.”\n\nSo why did Swart reject the multi-million dollar offer to host the July 17th event? After all, some Trump supporters suspect that CoD played a prominent role in the highly successful “No Kings Day” protests, which were said to have attracted more than five million people in more than 2,100 cities and towns, possibly the largest single-day demonstration in American history.\n\nRight-wingers have insisted that the numbers turning out to oppose Trump are routinely bolstered by hired operatives supplied by Swart’s company. While CoD denies any involvement in No Kings, for example, just the idea that a publicity firm could legally exist as a driving force to any protest movement is extremely unsettling (determining exactly what groups CoD supports is very difficult as employees are forced to sign non-disclosure forms that protect the client’s anonymity).\n\nWith regards to the “Good Trouble Lives On” protest, Swart admits turning down the offer because the demonstrations would “make us all look bad” as 1,500 events planned across country had the potential to “turn violent.”\n\nThe CEO said he does not activate any activists-for-hire if “it involves illegal activity… we do not engage in any form of illegal activity – of course, no violence, no vandalism, and no blocking streets without a permit.”\n\nWhile Swart must be applauded for turning down a fortune for keeping the US political process transparent and safe, there are other big-league players who do not operate by such a moral compass. Consider George Soros and his Open Society Foundation for one.\n\nLast summer, at the height of anti-Israel protests on university campuses, US lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Fox News that organizations funded by the billionaire philanthropist and others helped finance the movements.\n\n“There’s no question that there are organizations funded by George Soros and the Rockefeller Brothers. Take for example ‘Jewish Voice for Peace,’” Dershowitz said. “It has been behind many of these demonstrations. They’re not Jewish and they don’t want peace. It’s a fake organization. It’s an old-line group of communists and anarchists that want to overthrow the United States government… These organizations are funded by Soros and other organizations that help turn these useful idiots into protesters and eventually into terrorists.”\n\nGetting back to the Democrats, the very act of astroturfing the US political system strongly suggests that Trump’s MAGA presents a clear and present danger to the liberals. The Democrats have reached the point where they are practically forced to pay people a minimum wage check to mobilize against Donald Trump. Nothing screams a party in disorder more than one that obviously lacks grassroots support and is forced to rig the political system.","summary":"An activist group CEO claims he was offered millions of dollars to recruit protesters for anti-Trump demonstrations \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621703-crowd-demand-protest-business/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/687c157420302740670232ae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 22:02:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":343315346,"title":"Gold drifts higher; platinum at highest in over a decade","text":"NEW YORK: Gold prices firmed on Friday on a weaker dollar and persistent geopolitical tensions, though easing concerns about the US Federal Reserve’s independence, and strong US data capped gains.

Here's How You Will Now Need To Pay","text":"Foreign visitors to the United States will soon have to pay an additional 'Visa Integrity Fee' of at least $250, as part of a provision tucked into former President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which recently passed into law. The fee applies to all nonimmigrant visa categories and cannot be waived, making it a mandatory cost for millions of potential travellers, including tourists, businesspersons, and international students. According to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson, the new fee is aimed at restoring “integrity” to America’s immigration system, with its primary intent being to discourage visa overstays and unauthorised employment. While this move is expected to increase revenue and reduce visa misuse, immigration experts warn that the lack of clarity on the implementation timeline and refund process has already created confusion. Fee Set at Minimum $250, To Be Adjusted Yearly for Inflation For the fiscal year 2025, the visa integrity fee is pegged at a minimum of $250. The Secretary of Homeland Security reserves the authority to raise the amount, and the fee will be indexed for inflation annually. This charge is in addition to existing visa and immigration-related fees, not a replacement. Although the legislation includes a provision for reimbursement, the process is conditional and uncertain. Visa holders must not overstay by more than five days and must avoid unauthorised employment during their stay. Refunds, if any, would only be processed after the visa expires, which for many travellers may mean years later. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) noted in its financial analysis that “a small number of people would seek reimbursement,” and added that the Department of State would need several years to create a viable refund mechanism. As of now, no official implementation date has been announced, and regulatory clarity is missing. The U.S. Travel Association confirmed “significant challenges and unanswered questions regarding implementation,” citing the complex interplay between DHS and the State Department. Meanwhile, DHS has acknowledged that the visa application and issuance process is outside its direct control, raising logistical questions on how and when the fee will be collected. A DHS spokesperson confirmed to CNBC that cross-agency coordination is ongoing.

The Duke of York’s close pal Ghislaine Maxwell asked the sex offender’s rich and powerful friends to write messages for the billionaire’s 50th in 2003. The British socialite, 63, who is serving 20 years in a US jail for trafficking girls for Epstein, bound the tributes in a leather album. The gift was discovered by US Justice Department investigators probing the financier’s inner circle. A US source told this newspaper: “Ghislaine was the driving force behind the birthday tributes. She wanted it to be a who’s who of Epstein’s inner circle, and she leaned on a lot of people to write something. It wasn’t just casual greetings. Ghislaine wanted messages that were personal, meaningful. “Jeffrey... always saw Andrew as the pinnacle of his pals, and Ghislaine made sure he was asked to contribute. “She framed it as a celebration of Jeffrey’s brilliance, his generosity, his supposed unique mind. She made it sound like an honour to be included.” It is not clear if the prince did send a message. At the time, Prince Andrew was a regular fixture at social gatherings with his pal, who was convicted of a sex offence with a minor in 2008. The Duke has said he was not aware of Epstein’s crime. Andrew, 65, was introduced to Epstein in 1999 by Maxwell. He visited the financier in New York, Florida and the US Virgin Islands, and hosted Epstein at Balmoral, Windsor Castle, Sandringham and Royal Ascot. Each time Maxwell was also present. In a 2014 court filing, Virginia Giuffre claimed she was loaned by Epstein to Andrew for sex three times as a teenager. Andrew repeatedly and vehemently denied her claims. She later sued him in New York for sexual abuse, which he settled out of court for a reported £12million. He continued to deny any wrongdoing, telling BBC Newsnight he had no recollection of meeting her. In April, Giuffre, 41, took her own life in Australia. Epstein, 66, died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019. The birthday album came to light after it was reported that Donald Trump had contributed a signed note. The Wall Street Journal claimed to have seen a 2003 typed letter featuring a permanent marker sketch of a naked woman. Trump allegedly wrote: “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,” and also: “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.” Trump’s links to Epstein stretch back to the 1990s. In a 2002 interview, Trump said: “He’s a lot of fun to be with… he liked beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” The US President said the Journal story was faked, adding that he never drew pictures of women. However, some of his city skyline sketches have been sold at auction. Last month Elon Musk claimed the President was named in Epstein-related material. Trump called the claims a Democrat “scam” but he and key Republicans have since demanded the Epstein files be unsealed. Prince Andrew was asked for comment.","summary":"The Duke of York’s close pal, Ghislaine Maxwell, contacted Jeffrey Epstein’s rich and powerful friends, asking them for handwritten notes wishing the billionaire a happy 50th birthday","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/prince-andrew-asked-honour-jeffrey-35580077","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34754711.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/9_Party-At-Mar-A-Lago.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-19 21:24:54","author":"Christopher Bucktin","authors":["Christopher Bucktin"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.298},{"id":343303690,"title":"‘People who spent years saving lives are now struggling to survive’ – how we witnessed Trump’s USAID cuts devastate health programmes in Kenya","text":"Rachael Eastham, Lancaster University and Christopher Baguma, Lancaster University\n\nMy phone wouldn’t stop ringing – nurses, social workers, young mothers – all begging for help. ‘I’ve lost my job,’ ‘I have no food,’ ‘What do we do now?’ I felt helpless.\n\nThese are the words of Rogers Omollo, founder and CEO of Activate Action – a youth-led non-profit organisation that supports young people with HIV and disabilities in Homa Bay, a town in west Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria.\n\nAs specialists in youth and sexual and reproductive health, we were on a field trip to learn from Omollo and others like him. We wanted to find out about the work they were doing to tackle HIV, stigma and health inequalities.\n\nBut our time there was dominated by one thing: President Donald Trump’s executive order which put almost all international spending by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on pause for a 90-day review and subsequently took a wrecking ball to all international aid programmes funded by the US.\n\nIn July, research published in The Lancet medical journal found that the US funding cuts towards foreign humanitarian aid could cause more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030, with a third of those at risk of premature deaths being children. Davide Rasella, who co-authored the report, said low- and middle-income countries were facing a shock “comparable in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict”.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, we saw firsthand the profound impact the “pause” had in this community. Activate Action is not directly funded by USAID, but as we followed in the footsteps of our host, Omollo, meeting the organisation’s collaborators and beneficiaries, the true extent of the funding freeze became shockingly apparent.\n\nPlaces like Homa Bay relied heavily on USAID funding to keep hospitals and clinics running, to ensure access to essential medicines, and to support reproductive health and HIV programmes. The executive order, in principle, resulted in the immediate halting of over US$68 billion (£51 billion) in foreign aid, a substantial portion of which supports lifesaving reproductive health and HIV programmes worldwide.\n\nThe Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.\n\nAs we walked through abandoned offices and healthcare facilities speaking to bewildered people out of work and in need of critical services in February 2025, the chilling reality set in. Omollo reflected:\n\nPeople who have spent years saving lives are now struggling to survive. The clinics are empty, the hope in their voices fading. It broke my heart. I wanted to scream, to fix it, but the truth hit hard – we can’t depend on one lifeline. If funding stops, lives should not. We must build something stronger, something that lasts.\n\nResearch shows that global financial strain can foster a conservative political climate. For example, the global financial crisis of 2008 has been associated with the rise of right-wing populism.\n\nThe current populist political climate is demonstrably hostile towards matters like reproductive health and rights. There are reports that reproductive rights are “backsliding” globally. For example, in the US abortion services have been increasingly restricted. In countries like Kenya, this is compounded by the longstanding global tendency towards anti-African or anti-black sentiment reflected in the foregrounding of stories that primarily depict Africa as a problem or a failure.\n\nSo, before we even set off on our research trip to unite sexual and reproductive health advocates and collaborate with African partners, we knew we were swimming against this tide.\n\nFinal figures remain unclear but in early 2025, the abrupt suspension of an estimated US$500 million of funding to Kenya was suggested by Amnesty International to have led to the layoff of 54,000 community health workers – many of whom had been part of robust, locally led responses to HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.\n\nThe decision to do this was driven by US audit and efficiency “reevaluations” over 8,000 miles away in Washington. Decisions were made and implemented by small numbers of people within the Trump administration including Elon Musk, whose estimated individual wealth far exceeds the gross domestic product of many entire east African nations, including Kenya.\n\nDespite years of progress in community-based healthcare systems managed by Kenyans just like Activate Action, these cuts by one external donor disrupted critical services overnight. This also demonstrated that African health systems, no matter how effective, remain subject to profound external control.\n\nOur project was funded in October 2024, before Trump’s re-election. One week of activities in the UK, one week in Kenya. By the time Activate Action visited Lancaster, in the north of England, in January 2025, we had already started to raise eyebrows as our colleagues began receiving communications from USAID-funded initiatives about pausing projects. Two weeks later, by the time we gathered in Kenya, the immediate human cost was clear to see.\n\n‘The field has been eviscerated’\n\nWe sat at the back of a meeting observing training for an Activate Action initiative that would see community health champions offer peer support for their neighbours on safer sex and HIV prevention. In a building that was usually busy and populated by USAID-funded staff, the lights remained on in only one room.\n\nBefore visiting Homa Bay, we knew of its reputation when it came to the so-called triple threat of gender-based violence, HIV infection and teenage pregnancy rates – all of which disproportionately affects this semi-rural county in west Kenya.\n\nAs we watched the training, a colleague based in Europe (who was instrumental in connecting some of the members of our group) texted after learning we were in Kenya, saying:\n\nIt’s terrifying. Document it. No one gets it. The field has been eviscerated.\n\nSo, what did this evisceration look like?\n\nStaff directly affected by the order were either not permitted to talk about what was happening on the record or didn’t feel safe doing so. We spoke to at least five people who told us directly they couldn’t “speak out” and were nervous about us taking any photographs.\n\nWe saw how scores of people were served their notice to cease projects, backdated and effective immediately – a stop work order, followed by (for reasons with cloudy legal foundations) official terminations to contracts. Their economic and professional futures left hanging in the balance.\n\nAs we navigated workshops and meetings, Omollo (now unexpectedly advantaged through Activate Action not being USAID-funded) continued to receive multiple texts, calls and emails from people seeking work.\n\nA researcher we know working on a USAID supported HIV and maternity care project described doing frantic overtime in the face of uncertainty. She needed to put in hours of extra (unpaid) work to communicate with research participants as it would not be ethical to abruptly disappear on people currently engaged in an active research programme.\n\nShe had no way to manage expectations with those she spoke to and no way of knowing if they were saying a final “thank you and goodbye” to the people she had been working with for months. Despite the descriptions of USAID project funds being “paused”, she was quickly served a full termination of employment notice.\n\nIn east Africa, where this sudden and mass unemployment of vital technical and administrative staff is happening, more than half of young people aged 15-35 are unemployed. The rate is even higher among young women in rural areas (up to 66%.)\n\nA greater horror unfolds when you consider who these unemployed workers are usually paid to help because they serve communities with some of the highest needs related to HIV, teenage pregnancy and gender-based violence.\n\nThe youth health facility we visited, for example, was locked up when we arrived. We sat in stunned silence in an empty three-roomed building with a youth HIV counsellor. We were shown photographs that showed how it was once a vibrant and busy place.\n\nHere, the free services and information on HIV, contraception and mental health was being delivered by skilled and non-judgmental youth specialists. But it was closed down from January 20, 2025 and its future remains uncertain. A free condom dispenser outside lay empty, all supplies given out on closure day in a last ditch attempt to help young people remain safe over the coming weeks.\n\nIn Homa Bay, huge achievements have been made in addressing teenage pregnancy and adolescent HIV infection in recent years. There has been a remarkable decline in prevalence rates, new infections, and HIV-related deaths, aided by robust treatment programmes that contribute to better health. People have been living with HIV at undetectable levels, therefore unable to transmit infection. But this “safe” status requires ongoing treatment with antiretroviral medication.\n\nWhat now in the absence of USAID?\n\nBut at the time of our visit, the delivery of antiretroviral therapy was becoming more restricted and would require collection by the user every three weeks, rather than the usual three months, therefore lasting the user a shorter time. To service providers we spoke to, this increase in the frequency of collection of medication was known to be a significant barrier for people having to travel long distances more frequently without transport to get their supply replenished.\n\nOmollo explained to us that Homa Bay is also a medication hub, of sorts. People come here from other communities where, due to stigma, the risks of being identified as someone who is HIV positive in their own communities are much higher.\n\nSuccesses notwithstanding, Homa Bay county’s teenage pregnancy rate is over 20% and HIV prevalence is some of the highest in Kenya (15.2% overall in Homa Bay, higher than the national average of 3.7%), with 75% of new HIV infections across the country affecting young people aged under 34. There are almost as many people living with HIV in Homa Bay county as there are in the whole of the UK and many are children. In other words, the demand for accessible and sustained services is high and the impact of their absence is huge.\n\nEvery conversation we had yielded new information about the reality. Gender-based violence projects were also suspended, in part because of the Trump administration’s intentions to end “gender ideology”. A service provider joked despondently during a presentation how: “I got sacked for saying gender.”\n\nIn Kenya, femicide (the murder of women or girls because of their gender) has been described as a “crisis” requiring urgent action. In Homa Bay specifically, the sexual and gender-based violence statistics are higher than national averages and have been on the rise, especially among young people.\n\nThis follows alarming countrywide coverage about femicide across Kenya including high profile and horrifying cases such as that of the Ugandan athlete Rebecca Cheptegei.. Official figures are unclear but there are currently widespread protests and calls to action related to this injustice.\n\nActivate Action had recently won one USAID award focusing on men living with HIV and substance use problems (factors that are both implicated in gender-based violence). Since the USAID funding freeze this offer has instantly been dissolved with no expectation of reinstatement.\n\nMeanwhile, the fight against cervical cancer – the leading cause of cancer death in Kenya – has also been hit.\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination campaigns across the county have stalled, despite the fact the vaccines help prevent cervical cancer.\n\nAt one point, a 23-year-old mother of three small children asked us directly if we found it troubling (as she did) that she will not be able to receive maternal healthcare and her contraception. The list of effects is grim and feels endless.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nWhen our group convened for a workshop at a community venue with sexual and reproductive health and rights staff from across the area, the chatter was similarly focused on the effects of the USAID funding freeze, but this time in the direct shadow of operations.\n\nNext door, four-wheel drive Jeeps had been recalled and locked behind USAID premises gates, gathering dust instead of being out in the field delivering HIV outreach services. They represented the stasis of operations more widely.\n\nDr Peter Ibembe, from a party of service providers visiting from Uganda, was formerly a Programme Director for the non-governmental organisation Reproductive Health Uganda where he was in charge of service delivery. He spoke to us about the atmosphere:\n\nAn eerie tone of quiet has descended on the place. Many have been suddenly rendered jobless; creating mental stress, depression, anxiety. But there has also been an indirect effect on the wider community through the entire value chain: landlords, banks and other credit institutions; food vendors; gas stations; transportation facilities and companies; hotels, restaurants and lodges; schools hospitals and the like.\n\nEveryone has been left in limbo. Kenya, despite gradual improvements, is a lower middle income country. Poverty identified by the World Bank as a key development challenge for the nation with, in 2022, over 20 million Kenyans identified as living below the poverty line. So these knock-on effects can be drastic.\n\nAt an organisational level we also saw clearly how the boundaries of any one project running within any organisation cannot be neatly drawn, nor can projects be plucked from this matrix discretely in the way we might imagine when we hear how “USAID projects” have been suspended. This way of thinking profoundly undermines the reality of what these cuts mean because many projects are interdependent and interrelated. Omollo added:\n\nWhilst Activate Action was not directly funded by USAID, the overall reduction in health services affects the community they serve. The lack of support for HIV prevention, mental health and economic empowerment programmes placed additional strain on grassroots organisations like us … which have had to fill gaps with limited resources.\n\nServices the world over, especially community based services, usually operate with multiple funding streams each providing different projects. Naturally the people, resources and activities overlap. To stress, this is not evidence of the “corruption” the Trump administration claims it wants to weed out, but it is the reality of how services reliant on external funding work.\n\nIt is usual that a patchwork of project grants function together to keep the doors open and the lights on. In fact, the sharing of operational resource is what bolsters an organisation’s capacity to serve its communities most effectively.\n\nConsidering “USAID projects” as single discretely bounded entities belie the messy complexity of how community and healthcare services work.\n\nFor another example of this kind of inter-connection, look no further than “table banking”. Table banking has been described as a “microcredit movement by women and for women” – effectively a DIY bank. We saw table banking used at Activate Action’s Street Business School, an initiative that tackles HIV through training women and building economic sustainability so they do not become trapped in poverty which may force them into have transactional sex. From a seated circle under trees, we watched as the collective pay in and take out loans to support their businesses from a central informal “bank account”.\n\nBeneficiaries from this project continue to come together every Thursday, pooling finances and taking loans to sustain their business needs for the coming week (for example, buying stock for their market stalls). They told us how they are planning to collaborate on a catering business which will mean the older, sicker members of the group remain able to work and earn.\n\nSimilarly, Omollo told us how “a bit like table banking”, among his friends and colleagues, they also pool finance on a weekly basis to tick off items on a collective shopping list. He said: “One week we buy for one person, the next week, the next person and so on, until we all have a microwave.”\n\nThese demonstrations of microfinance arguably present, however idealistic, inspiration for a more financially sustainable future whereby its principles offer a “light of hope” at grassroots level, possibilities for nations in meeting sustainable development goals and, crucially in this context, freedom from dependency on external donors.\n\nSocial dictators of health\n\nWhen we planned this exchange project, we wanted to work with Activate Action because of our shared interests.\n\nIts explicit focus on the “social determinants of health” (the non-medical factors that affect health) is a refreshing departure from so many health programmes that seek to intervene on a person’s behaviour without attending to how it may be shaped by the wider social system.\n\nFor example, in the case of Homa Bay, Activate Action works to address root causes, such as poverty. Poverty means that transactional sex (which could be sex for food or period products) is common. Unsafe sex can be a hallmark of these sexual encounters, increasing HIV risk and transmission. Helping women build businesses, earn their own money to buy food and make their own period pads, reduces the need to trade sex for necessities.\n\nAs we sat discussing the various ways the cancelling of USAID would have devastating effects on different programmes and so the lives of different people, we realised how myriad social determinants – such as income, unemployment and healthcare services – are overwhelmingly contingent on distant regimes. Regimes run by people who seem to demonstrate little regard for the lives of disadvantaged and minoritised people.\n\nNo period of consultation, no management of expectations – a profound example of how bigger systems that govern our social lives can, in fact, dictate the outcomes of our health.\n\nAntiretroviral drugs for HIV literally keep people alive and prevent transmission to others. Efforts to critique the USAID freeze by the inspector general of USAID, Paul Martin, saw him sacked. Again, no reason was given, and the White House did not have any comment.\n\nWhen we were trying to explore whether termination notices for staff in Kenya were even legal, one media report about a judicial effort to halt the USAID stop work order noted that Trump has a “high threshold for legal risk”. An insight into what type of threats we may need to consider when trying to understand risks to and protections for health in the future.\n\nDr Ibembe, who provided closing remarks to our workshop, highlighted how “the effect of USAID cuts on the east African development landscape has been nothing short of seismic. It has created an environment of uncertainty, fear and stress. In some instances, up to 80% of health-related initiatives are donor supported. The funding and operational gap created is almost insurmountable.”\n\nThis reliance on external financial support and limited domestic financing in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries is common. This makes a nation vulnerable. Kenya also experiences substantial “donor dependency” especially across the health system which makes it harder to absorb the shock of a donor pulling funds.\n\nIn other words, this is a highly precarious system that is going through a shock which it will find incredibly difficult to withstand.\n\nThe situation is a stark reminder of just how unfair the power dynamics are that dictate African health governance and sovereignty.\n\nConversations about reducing the dependence of countries like Kenya on external donors have been going on for a long time. Throughout it has been acknowledged that any transition away from donor dependence needs to be carefully managed to avoid upsetting all the gains that have been made through initiatives like those funded by USAID. This has been completely impossible given the pace of change since January 2025 when the USAID stop work order came into play.\n\nAfrican solutions to African problems\n\nThe question now is not merely how African institutions will survive these disruptions but how they will leverage them as an impetus for change. Discussions about donor dependency arguably contribute to the framing of African states and institutions that are economically vulnerable and a “risk”. This in turn creates a negative bias that has recently been identified as costing African nations billions in lost or missed investment opportunities.\n\nWhile financial constraints are a reality, the dominance of stereotypes also means we may overlook the effective strategic responses and resilience demonstrated by African organisations over the years. The challenge is not simply to reduce donor reliance but to reposition African institutions as key architects of health solutions through approaches that emphasise ownership, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nThe Afya na Haki (Ahaki) institute provides a clear example of this shift towards what they refer to as “Africentric” models of health governance. The aim is to build African solutions to African problems.\n\nThis approach is anchored on four key pillars: amplifying positive African narratives; strengthening engagement with African regional institutions; supporting and fostering collaboration among African non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other organisations; and bringing together African experts and communities to create knowledge that reflects local realities and needs.\n\nYet, restrictive policies that pre-date the USAID cuts such as the global gag rule which means NGOs are prohibited from receiving any US government funding if they provide, advocate for, or even refer to abortion services, have significantly disrupted this work, forcing institutions to rethink their operational strategies. An Ahaki staff member told us how their core focus on empowering Africans has been “thrown into disarray”.\n\nResearch that puts African stories and priorities front and centre is crucial – not just for shaping policies but for shifting the focus from dependence on external aid to African-led solutions and self-determination.\n\n‘Hope hasn’t disappeared’\n\nWithin days of the USAID executive order on January 20, the USAID website was unreachable and our colleagues in Homa Bay sat reeling. By February 14, just after our visit, it was confirmed that a federal judge had successfully blocked the funding suspensions, although the relevance of this for people and projects like those we met in Homa Bay, whose contracts had already been terminated, was limited.\n\nThis executive order is one of many that has triggered global shockwaves. But for every action there is a reaction and we have also witnessed international resistance, from protests of USAID and nonprofit workers in Washington, to 500 Kenyan community workers demanding their unpaid salaries.\n\nMusk’s company Tesla has been subject to widespread boycott and coordinated protest by “Tesla Takedown” in over 250 cities around the world. Canada has also made strides to reject American imports and strengthen its domestic markets, building greater independence from the USA, echoing desires of many African nations in relation to US donor dependence.\n\nMusk suggested that USAID needs “to die” due to widespread corruption – an assertion that remains unsubstantiated. However, the violence and damage of this sentiment is being realised. As the sites we visited remain eerie and empty, gathering dust, our immediate concern is for the people and communities that agencies once funded by USAID represent and serve.\n\nOmollo, and others like him, are now finding new ways to navigate these problems. The ripple effects of the USAID funding freeze have hit hard, programs have stalled, uncertainty has grown and communities are feeling the strain.\n\n“But in the cracks, we’ve found ways to adapt,” he said. “At Activate Action, we’ve leaned on local partnerships, stretched every resource, and kept showing up for young people. Hope hasn’t disappeared; it’s just become something we fight for daily.”\n\nFor you: more from our Insights series:\n\nBeatrix Potter’s famous tales are rooted in stories told by enslaved Africans – but she was very quiet about their origins\n\nEngineering hope: how I made it my mission to help rebuild Ukraine’s critical infrastructure\n\nInside Porton Down: what I learned during three years at the UK’s most secretive chemical weapons laboratory\n\nIgnored, blamed, and sometimes left to die – a leading expert in ME explains the origins of a modern medical scandal\n\nTo hear about new Insights articles, join the hundreds of thousands of people who value The Conversation’s evidence-based news.

Trump Picks Bomber Commander As New Air Force Vice Chief","text":"The White House has nominated General Thomas A. Bussiere, commander of the United States Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), to serve as the next Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The nomination, confirmed by the Pentagon on Friday, positions Bussiere as the second-highest-ranking officer in the service, pending Senate confirmation. He is expected to replace General Jim Slife, who was abruptly dismissed by President Donald Trump earlier this year in a sweeping purge of senior military officials. According to the Department of Defence, Lieutenant General Stephen Davis, currently serving as the Air Force’s inspector general, has been nominated to receive his fourth star and assume leadership of the Global Strike Command following Bussiere’s elevation. Additionally, the White House has put forward Space Force Lieutenant General Shawn Bratton for promotion to Vice Chief of Space Operations, succeeding General Michael Guetlein, who was recently confirmed to lead the Pentagon’s Golden Dome missile defence programme. Slife’s Removal Creates High-Level Vacancy as Pleus Fills Temporary Role President Trump dismissed Slife without public explanation in February, part of a broader shake-up that also saw the removal of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Charles Q. Brown and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti. Since Slife's ouster, Lieutenant General Scott Pleus, the Air Force’s director of staff, has held the vice chief role on an acting basis. Bussiere’s nomination arrives at a pivotal time for the Air Force, as the service confronts evolving global threats and seeks to modernise its nuclear deterrent. If confirmed, Bussiere would bring over three decades of strategic and operational experience to the post, including leadership of bomber forces and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) wings central to America’s nuclear triad. From B-2 Combat to B-21 Raider: Bussiere’s Legacy at Global Strike Bussiere assumed command of Global Strike in December 2022, overseeing a portfolio that includes the B-1B Lancer, B-2 Spirit, and B-52H Stratofortress bomber fleets, as well as the ground-based Minuteman III ICBMs. He has played a key role in shepherding the integration of the next-generation B-21 Raider stealth bomber, a programme critical to maintaining long-range strike dominance amid intensifying competition with China and Russia. A command pilot with over 3,400 flight hours, Bussiere’s operational resume spans numerous aircraft platforms, including the F-15C Eagle, F-22 Raptor, B-1, B-2 and B-52. He flew air combat missions in several major operations, notably during Operation Southern Watch and Operation Vigilant Warrior in the 1990s, where he helped enforce no-fly zones and deter Iraqi aggression. His combat experience extended into the 2000s with sorties in the B-2 during NATO’s Operation Allied Force over Kosovo and in the Iraq War. The nominations of Bussiere and Bratton will now proceed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, which must review and approve each for confirmation. While the Senate confirmed Guetlein for his new role overseeing missile defence, it remains unclear whether political headwinds stirred by Trump’s previous firings will affect the current batch of nominations.
