(sic),\" the Tesla and SpaceX chief wrote in continuation of his criticism of the EU.Shortly afterwards, Musk declared that X was \"Now number 1 in every EU country!\".The source of Musk's declaration was a post by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, which announced, \"BREAKING: X just became the #1 source for news in every single EU country — Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.\"\"The same 27 countries trying to regulate, fine, and silence it… now rely on it more than any legacy outlet or state media. You can’t make this up (sic),\" the group added.Mint could not independently confirm the claim made by the group and re-shared by Musk. Why was X slapped with a $140 million fine?The $140 million penalty on X by the EU was for alleged violations of the bloc's strict content and transparency rules, which were enforced in August 2023. The rules essentially regulate what big tech companies can and cannot do when it comes to content moderation and the handling of user data.Announcing the fine, the EU said that X had been penalised over the \"deceptive design\" of its blue checkmark, in addition to a lack of transparency in the social media platform's ads repository.The EU also said that X had failed to fulfil its obligations to provide researchers to the platform's public data, something that is mandated under the Digital Security Act (DSA).\"Moreover, X's processes for researchers' access to public data impose unnecessary barriers, effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union,\" the EU said.EU slammed by Musk, Trump adminFollowing EU's decision to penalise X, Musk went on the offensive, calling for the bloc's dissolution.“The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries, so that governments can better represent their people (sic),” the billionaire wrote on X, and followed up with several posts on the EU's shortcomings.“Europe is sleep-walking into oblivion,” wrote Musk in one post.He went on to share a post equating the bloc with the “Fourth Reich”, before continuing his attack. “The tyrannical, unelected bureaucracy oppressing the people of Europe are in the second picture,” Musk wrote on Sunday, sharing a post. Following the imposition of the fine, officials of the Donald Trump administration also sharply criticised the EU, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio labelling the move an “attack” on US tech companies.“The European Commission’s $140 million fine isn’t just an attack on X, it’s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments,” wrote Rubio in a post that was shared by US Vice President J D Vance. “The days of censoring Americans online are over,” Rubio added.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/people/x-is-now-number-1-in-every-eu-country-elon-musks-new-announcement-after-calling-for-abolition-of-27-nation-bloc-11765132370962.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/07/1600x900/logo/FILES-EU-US-TECH-X-MUSK-FINE-1_1765133285673_1765133294279.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 18:49:17","author":"Shiladitya Ray","authors":["Shiladitya Ray"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.072},{"id":385984648,"title":"American unity with Israel is more than just politics - opinion","text":"The writer speaks at a rally for then–presidential candidate Donald Trump in Glendale, Arizona, last year.

This seven-part series looks at different aspects of the singer-songwriter’s life.\n\nIt is not often that two reggae superstars tour together. Certainly not polar opposites like Jimmy Cliff and Peter Tosh, but the two artistes hit the road during the summer of 1982 for shows in the United States (US) and Canada.\n\nTosh — who had recently completed work on his Mama Africa album — headlined the two-month trek. Cliff was promoting his album, Special, released by Columbia Records in early 1982.\n\nThe tour was organised by Copeland Forbes, who was involved with both artistes in a management capacity.\n\n“The co-headlined tour we did in 1982 with Jimmy Cliff and Peter Tosh was one of the best tours I’ve ever organised in my over 60 years in the entertainment fraternity. Critics said it could never happen, the fact that one artiste is a Rastafarian (Tosh) and the other, a Muslim by faith,” Forbes told Observer Online. “The critics were proven wrong as the tour went on for over two months, selling out venues across the US and Canada.”\n\nTheir contrasting personalities was the main reason for the sceptics’ gloomy outlook. Tosh was a firebrand who called out the system on songs like Legalize It, Equal Rights and Get Up, Stand Up; he was also an advocate for the legalisation of ganja, a stance that got him in trouble with the law.\n\nCliff, the former teen star, was the face of reggae since the early 1970s. His starring role in the 1972 movie, The Harder They Come, plus radio-friendly songs such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People, Sitting In Limbo and Many Rivers To Cross, made him a superstar.\n\nForbes acknowledged there were problems prior to the tour. Who would take the stage first was an issue, with Tosh refusing to go on first.\n\nHowever, Cliff had no problem opening the shows, and the tour kicked off on August 12 at Mesa Community Center Amphitheater in Mesa, Arizona.\n\nTosh and Cliff did approximately 28 dates together. They made stops in major areas including Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; British Columbia, Edmonton, Calgary and Saskatoon in Canada; Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Boston, Fort Lauderdale and Miami.\n\nIn November 1982, Tosh and Cliff performed at the World Music Festival in Montego Bay. They also appeared on Bunny Wailer’s Youth Consciousness Festival in Kingston one month later.\n\nMama Africa was released by EMI Africa in 1983. As part of its promotion, Tosh opened a handful of shows for The Police on their Synchronicity tour.\n\nHe was murdered by gunmen at his St Andrew home in September 1987 at age 42.\n\nJimmy Cliff, a two-time Grammy winner and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame inductee, died on November 24 at age 81. He will be given an official funeral by the Jamaican government on December 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Dancehall Entertainment Jimmy Cliff Peter Tosh Reggae \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JLP Central Executive approves resolution to support intensification of hurricane recovery effort \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) has approved two resolutions following a meeting of its Central Executive on Sunday, signalling ful... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Isiaa Madden, architect behind The Pinnacle, celebrates Mouttet Mile win \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Isiaa Madden has reshaped skylines, revived architectural imagination in Montego Bay, and carried her family’s 90-year legacy of service at Madden’s F... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Hope in Melissa’s aftermath’ \n\n\n Escarpment Road and Middle Quarters New Testament Churches of God partner for major relief effort \n\n\n BY KELSEY THOMAS Online coordinator thomask@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — In the wake of the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, Escarpment Road New Testament Church of God joined forc... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Samuel K Golden releases ‘Sunset’ to inspire survivors post-Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Fusion artiste Samuel K Golden is hoping that his latest single, Sunset , will be a beacon of inspiration for Jamaicans who were negatively impacted b... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Robert Minott gains buzz with ‘Link Up’ on Pretty Little Baby instrumental remake \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Reggae artiste Robert Minott is pleased with the enthusiastic response to his latest single, Link Up , released on a remake of an instrumental inspire... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bunny Shaw on the double as City go six clear at the top of English WSL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaica’s Khadija “Bunny” Shaw scored twice and provided an assist to help her Manchester City team extend their lead at the top of the English Women'... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump reignites ‘soccer vs football’ debate at World Cup 2026 draw \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States — United States (US) President Donald Trump has revived the longstanding debate over whether the sport known in the US as “s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Speaking on tariffs, Trump said, \"We have tremendous flexibility with the current system. It's unbelievable for national security. I've ended eight wars, largely because of trade and because of tariffs.\" He added, \"If we go the other tariff route, it won't give you the same pure national security.\" As Trump highlighted what he sees as the security advantages of tariffs, his comments came ahead of a key Supreme Court ruling on whether he exceeded presidential authority in imposing broad duties. In the coming weeks, the justices are expected to determine whether Trump violated federal law by using emergency powers to launch sweeping tariffs during his second term. Since returning to office in January, the president has repeatedly applied and reinstated tariffs on various trading partners, raising costs on products including appliances, lumber and electrical components. A coalition of companies and trade organisations has challenged the approach, arguing Trump misused the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by treating it as a blanket tool for tariffs. In a post on Truth Social, Trump addressed the looming Supreme Court decision, insisting he has alternative options if his current strategy is restricted. \"While the United States has other methods of charging TARIFFS against foreign countries, many of whom have, for YEARS, TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OUR NATION, the current method of Tariffing before the United States Supreme Court is far more DIRECT, LESS CUMBERSOME, and MUCH FASTER,\" he wrote. Trump also asserted broad presidential powers over national security and foreign policy, saying he had \"settled 8 Wars in 10 months because of the rights clearly given to the President of the United States.\" To ensure the tariff strategy continues even if the court limits existing measures, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been preparing a fallback plan. His proposed \"plan B\" would use other statutory authorities combined with tougher actions on economic competition. \"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with 301s, with 232s, with the I think they're called 122s,\" he said, referring to three separate provisions governing trade actions. Section 301 targets unfair foreign trade practices, Section 232 permits tariffs on imports that threaten national security, and Section 122 allows short-term tariffs or quotas in balance-of-payments emergencies. Bessent warned that if the Supreme Court overturns the current tariffs, it could result in \"massive refunds\" owed to companies that paid them. He added that the government may have to return significant amounts already counted as federal revenue, creating fiscal and administrative challenges for the Treasury.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/ive-ended-eight-wars-largely-because-of-trade-and-tariffs-trump-1922386","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/12/08/1987288-aa-6080445.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 01:19:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.065},{"id":385986722,"title":"'Little bit disappointed Zelensky hasn't read peace proposal': Trump signals frustration over Ukraine talks","text":"ANI\"Little bit disappointed Zelensky hasn't read peace proposal\": Trump signals frustration over Ukraine talks\n\nWashington: US President Donald Trump and the First Lady arrived on the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, as questions continued to swirl over the administration's approach to Ukraine peace efforts.On Sunday, Trump said, \"I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the peace proposal,\" signalling frustration with Kyiv's response to recent diplomatic outreach.Amid those concerns, Trump's eldest son suggested that the president could walk away from Ukraine peace talks amid repeated allegations of corruption involving senior Ukrainian officials. Speaking at the Doha Forum, Donald Trump Jr. claimed Ukraine was \"a far more corrupt country than Russia\" and described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"one of the great marketers of all time.\"When asked whether his father might withdraw from peace discussions, Trump Jr replied, \"I think he may.\" He added that this was his personal view, as he has not played a prominent public role in recent negotiations.These comments followed three days of meetings in Miami between delegations from Kyiv and Washington. Both sides described the talks as productive, but Ukrainian officials said there were few concrete breakthroughs and that unresolved questions remain over security guarantees and territorial matters.Live EventsUkraine has long faced corruption concerns, and recent developments have intensified scrutiny. Andriy Yermak, a top aide and influential figure in peace negotiations, resigned after anti-corruption agencies raided his home in November, highlighting the continuing challenges within the country's political system.Providing a direct update on the state of diplomacy, President Volodymyr Zelensky said peace negotiations with the United States have been \"constructive\" but \"not easy\". Zelensky spoke by phone on Saturday with President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. \"The American representatives know the basic Ukrainian positions,\" Zelensky said. \"The conversation was constructive, although not easy.\"His remarks come ahead of planned discussions in London today involving Zelensky, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor Friedrich Merz.At the same time, the Kremlin welcomed Trump's new national security strategy, saying that it \"corresponds in many ways to our vision.\" The strategy warned that Europe faces \"civilisational erasure\" and said Washington aims to re-establish strategic stability with Russia.On Sunday, Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy said a deal to end the conflict was \"really close\" and now hinges on resolving two major issues--the future of the Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by hosting its flagship awards program, mixing politics with a celebration of stars from music and film. This year&apos;s Kennedy Center Honours, widely seen as the top US recognition for lifetime achievement in the performing arts, feted actor Sylvester Stallone, disco singer Gloria Gaynor, country musician George Strait, Phantom of the Opera star Michael Crawford and rockers KISS. Trump, who had a hand in picking the recipients, did not attend Kennedy Center events during his first term. But he has taken a keen interest in the institution during his second, firing its president, installing a new board that made him chair and ordering a renovation of the building. He told reporters that the Kennedy Center is \"going to be brought back to life.\" \"We are saving the Kennedy Center,\" Trump said, with first lady Melania Trump at his side. The president is putting his stamp on both the White House and the Kennedy Center structures, controversially tearing down the White House&apos;s East Wing to make room for a 8361-square metre ballroom. The Kennedy Center&apos;s new president, Ric Grenell, who once served as Trump&apos;s ambassador to Germany, is overseeing the performing arts complex&apos;s multi-million-dollar renovation and revamping the organisation&apos;s events, including hosting the World Cup final draw on Friday. In the Oval Office, Trump praised this year&apos;s honorees and gave them newly designed gold medallions with blue ribbons, rather than the rainbow-coloured ribbons used since 1978 to represent the spectrum of performing arts. \"These are among the greatest artists, actors and performers of their generation,\" Trump said. \"We can hardly imagine the country music phenomenon without its king of country, or the American disco without its first lady, or Broadway without its phantom...or Rock and Roll without its hottest band in the world, and that&apos;s what they are, or Hollywood without one of its greatest visionaries.\" KISS members Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss rose to fame in the 1970s with hits such as I Was Made for Lovin&apos; You, country star Strait&apos;s hits include Down and Out and Gaynor is known for I Will Survive. English stage actor Crawford starred in the lead role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical The Phantom of the Opera, and Stallone established himself with movies such as Rocky and Rambo.

Trump has pledged to crack down on sanctuary cities, vowing to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that refuse compliance with federal immigration actions. \n\nWith ICE conducting sweeps in several U.S. cities, the guidance could affect how millions of immigrants in New York respond to federal agents.\n\nKnow your rights. Protect your neighbors.New York is — and always will be — a city for all immigrants. pic.twitter.com/nuntRzgEwq— Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) December 7, 2025\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn the video, Mamdani outlined several key rights available to people encountering ICE agents. He explained that individuals can choose not to speak to federal immigration agents, film them without interfering with their work, and refuse requests to enter private spaces. ICE agents cannot enter homes, schools, or private workplace areas without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to Mamdani.\n\n“ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. If you’re being detained, you may always ask, ‘Am I free to go?’ repeatedly until they answer you,” Mamdani said in the clip. \n\nThe guidance comes one week after demonstrators gathered as ICE attempted to detain people on Canal Street near Chinatown. A similar immigration sweep in the same neighborhood last October also met with protests, indicating ongoing tensions between federal enforcement and community resistance.\n\nMamdani has been highly critical of ICE, describing it as “a rogue agency, one that has no interest in laws, no interest in order” during a June interview.

He has said that he will personally step in to check the process and details, Bloomberg report said. Netflix-Warner deal: What did Donald Trunp saySpeaking to reporters on 7 December, Donald Trump said, “Well, that’s got to go through a process, and we’ll see what happens.” Donald Trump also confirmed that he met Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently and complimenting the streaming company. “But it is a big market share. It could be a problem.” Netflix has “a very big market share, and when they have Warner Brothers, you know, that share goes up a lot,” the president said, adding that he will be personally involved in the decision-making process. The $72 billion deal would combine the world’s No. 1 streaming player with the No. 4 service HBO Max, which has raised red flags from antitrust regulators. The Justice Department’s antitrust division, which would review the transaction in the US, could argue that the deal is illegal because the combined market share would put Netflix well over a 30% threshold.Netflix is expected to argue that other services such as Google’s YouTube and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok should be included in any analysis of the market, which would dramatically shrink the platform’s perceived market dominance.Netflix’s Sarandos met with Trump at the White House recently to lobby for the acquisition, Bloomberg reported earlier. Trump confirmed that meeting. Netflix wasn’t any kind of all-powerful monopoly, the executive argued at that time, and had suffered its own subscriber losses a couple of years earlier, according to people familiar with the matter.

But in an exchange with reporters on Sunday night, Trump suggested that the Ukrainian leader is holding up the talks from moving forward.\n\n“I’m a little bit disappointed that President Zelenskyy hasn’t yet read the proposal, that was as of a few hours ago. His people love it, but he hasn’t,” Trump claimed in an exchange with reporters before taking part in the Kennedy Center Honors. The president added, “Russia is, I believe, fine with it, but I’m not sure that Zelenskyy’s fine with it. His people love it it. But he isn’t ready.”\n\nTo be certain, Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t publicly expressed approval for the White House plan. In fact, Putin last week had said that aspects of Trump’s proposal were unworkable, even though the original draft heavily favored Moscow.\n\nTrump has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Zelenskyy since riding into a second White House term insisting that the war was a waste of U.S. taxpayer money. Trump has also repeatedly urged the Ukrainians to cede land to Russia to bring an end to a now nearly four-year conflict he says has cost far too many lives.\n\nZelenskyy said Saturday he had a “substantive phone call” with the American officials engaged in the talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. He said he had been given an update over the phone by U.S. and Ukrainian officials at the talks.\n\n“Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media.\n\nTrump’s criticism of Zelenskyy came as Russia on Sunday welcomed the Trump administration’s new national security strategy in comments by the Kremlin spokesman published by Russia’s Tass news agency.\n\nDmitry Peskov said the updated strategic document, which spells out the administration’s core foreign policy interests, was largely in line with Moscow’s vision.\n\n“There are statements there against confrontation and in favor of dialogue and building good relations,” he said, adding that Russia hopes this would lead to “further constructive cooperation with Washington on the Ukrainian settlement.”\n\nThe document released Friday by the White House said the U.S. wants to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah and that ending the war is a core U.S. interest to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia.”\n\nSpeaking on Saturday at the Reagan National Defense Forum, Trump’s outgoing Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, said efforts to end the war were in “the last 10 meters.”\n\nHe said a deal depended on the two outstanding issues of “terrain, primarily the Donbas,” and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nRussia controls most of Donbas, its name for the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which, along with two southern regions, it illegally annexed three years ago. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant is in an area that has been under Russian control since early in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and is not in service. It needs reliable power to cool its six shutdown reactors and spent fuel, to avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents.\n\nKellogg, who is due to leave his post in January, was not present at the talks in Florida.\n\nSeparately, officials said the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany would participate in a meeting with Zelenskyy in London on Monday.\n\nAs the three days of talks wrapped up, Russian missile, drone and shelling attacks overnight and Sunday killed at least four people in Ukraine.\n\nA man was killed in a drone attack on Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region Saturday night, local officials said, while a combined missile and drone attack on infrastructure in the central city of Kremenchuk caused power and water outages. Kremenchuk is home to one of Ukraine’s biggest oil refineries and is an industrial hub.\n\nKyiv and its Western allies say Russia is trying to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water for a fourth consecutive winter, in what Ukrainian officials call “weaponizing” the cold.\n\nThree people were killed and 10 others wounded Sunday in shelling by Russian troops in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, according to the regional prosecutor’s office.\n\nAP writers Darlene Superville and Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed reporting.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/07/trump-zelenskyy-russia-ukraine-war/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Russia_Ukraine_War_08152-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:59:44","author":"Susie Blann","authors":["Susie Blann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":385985664,"title":"Putin on Board, Zelenskyy Not Ready: Trump Shares Big Update on Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal","text":"Moscow is fine with the United States-backed peace proposal to end the longdrawn Russia-Ukraine conflict, however, Kyiv is yet to accept it, said US President Donald Trump.,US President Donald Trump said, \"...Russia and Ukraine, I thought it was going to be a little bit easier, but it's not being made easy...\",\"We have been speaking to President Putin and Ukrainian leaders, including President Zelenskyy.

He also noted that the number of points had been reduced to 22.\n\nOn December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law, businessman Jared Kushner, at the Kremlin. The key topic was the settlement in Ukraine. The conversation lasted about five hours. According to Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov, the sides discussed the essence of the proposals from the four documents on the US peace plan. According to Ushakov, the meeting on the Ukrainian settlement was constructive and informative.","summary":"Washington proposed a 28-point plan for settling the conflict in Ukraine","url":"https://tass.com/world/2055015","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:47:11","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":385985984,"title":"\"Little bit disappointed Zelensky hasn't read peace proposal\": Trump signals frustration over Ukraine talks","text":"Washington, DC [US], December 8 (ANI): US President Donald Trump and the First Lady arrived on the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, as questions continued to swirl over the administration's approach to Ukraine peace efforts.On Sunday, Trump said, \"I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the peace proposal,\" signalling frustration with Kyiv's response to recent diplomatic outreach.Amid those concerns, Trump's eldest son suggested that the president could walk away from Ukraine peace talks amid repeated allegations of corruption involving senior Ukrainian officials. Speaking at the Doha Forum, Donald Trump Jr. claimed Ukraine was \"a far more corrupt country than Russia\" and described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"one of the great marketers of all time.\"When asked whether his father might withdraw from peace discussions, Trump Jr replied, \"I think he may.\" He added that this was his personal view, as he has not played a prominent public role in recent negotiations.These comments followed three days of meetings in Miami between delegations from Kyiv and Washington. Both sides described the talks as productive, but Ukrainian officials said there were few concrete breakthroughs and that unresolved questions remain over security guarantees and territorial matters.Ukraine has long faced corruption concerns, and recent developments have intensified scrutiny. Andriy Yermak, a top aide and influential figure in peace negotiations, resigned after anti-corruption agencies raided his home in November, highlighting the continuing challenges within the country's political system.Providing a direct update on the state of diplomacy, President Volodymyr Zelensky said peace negotiations with the United States have been \"constructive\" but \"not easy\". Zelensky spoke by phone on Saturday with President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. \"The American representatives know the basic Ukrainian positions,\" Zelensky said. \"The conversation was constructive, although not easy.\"His remarks come ahead of planned discussions in London today involving Zelensky, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor Friedrich Merz.At the same time, the Kremlin welcomed Trump's new national security strategy, saying that it \"corresponds in many ways to our vision.\" The strategy warned that Europe faces \"civilisational erasure\" and said Washington aims to re-establish strategic stability with Russia.On Sunday, Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy said a deal to end the conflict was \"really close\" and now hinges on resolving two major issues--the future of the Donbas region and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture.Asked when he arrived for the ceremony how he had found time to prepare, Trump said he “didn't really prepare very much.”“I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,” the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.”.preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. he said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honourees that he was doing so “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted that the broadcast, scheduled to air Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.Trump is assuming a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian and Trump nemesis Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honourees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Trump's hosting job.“Oh this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can’t wait for tonight,” Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Centre board.Since 1978, the honours have recognised stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his “Rocky” and “Rambo” movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem “I Will Survive” and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honoured.The ceremony is expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band’s original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honourees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.Stallone said being honoured at the ceremony was like being in the “eye of a hurricane.”“This is an amazing event,” he said. “But you’re caught up in the middle of it. It’s hard to take it in until the next day. ..: but I’m incredibly humbled by it.”Crawford also said it was “humbling, especially at the end of a career.”Gaynor said it “feels like a dream” to be honoured. \"To be recognised in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. “She truly did survive,” Farris said. \"What an iconic song.”Actor Neil McDonough said he’s presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. “But that isn’t even the best part,” McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I’ve ever met.”Previous honourees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).TRUMP HAS TAKEN OVER THE KENNEDY CENTRETrump upended decades of bipartisan support for the centre by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticised the centre’s programming and the building’s appearance — and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the “Trump Kennedy Centre.” He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face to face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honouree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honours for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.During Trump’s first term, multiple honourees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Trump’s first year in office, honours recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump stayed away during that entire term.Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honourees and turned down some recommendations because they were “too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Trump's Hollywood ”special ambassadors\" and has likened Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.HONOREES' VIEWS ABOUT TRUMPStrait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organisations in recent years.Simmons spoke favourably of Trump when Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Trump was “out for himself” and criticised Trump for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were “terrorists.” But after Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.“If your candidate lost, it’s time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,” Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it’s time to understand that those who don’t share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.”- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Dec 8, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/trump-hosts-kennedy-center-honors-stallone-kiss-gloria-gaynor-glbs-2832232-2025-12-08","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/kennedy-center--trump-084520707-16x9_0.png?VersionId=YdpQCib0Gh5g7lAZqLJMLxpNdjpfb3Cy?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:46:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.358},{"id":385984276,"title":"India News | Goa SDMA Issues Strict Safety Advisory to Nightclubs and Restaurants After Arpora Club Fire Tragedy","text":"Porvorim (Goa) [India], December 8 (ANI): The Goa State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) on Sunday issued a detailed safety advisory to all nightclubs, restaurants, bars, event venues and similar establishments across the state after the deadly fire at a restaurant-club in Arpora that killed 25 people.\nSDMA directed establishments to ensure strict compliance with fire safety, electrical safety, emergency preparedness, and structural safety norms prescribed by the competent authorities.

Tammy Duckworth said that Johnson should be added to the list of Republicans whom Trump frequently identifies as responsible for undermining his agenda. The Illinois Democrat was on CNN’s State of the Union and argued that Johnson was attempting to block a prominent part of that 2024 campaign agenda: Support for making in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments affordable or free for American families.\n\nShe spoke to anchor Dana Bash about a letter she wrote to the president annotated with the Trump-style caption, “WARNING: Speaker Johnson wants YOU to become the DEADBEAT DAD of IVF.”\n\n“It’s...personal to me because I saw so many of my comrades who were at Walter Reed and other military medical centers who lost their fertility as a result of their military service,” said Duckworth, noting that veterans still suffer much higher rates of infertility than do civilians.\n\nHer comments come on the heels of a Military.com report detailing the congressional discussions over the National Defense Authorization Act, better known as the NDAA. The annual bill funds America’s armed services. Johnson, according to Military.com, is leading efforts to strip language aimed at expanding IVF coverage for service members from the legislation. \n\nRight now, IVF coverage is only covered for service members if infertility is judged to have been caused by “a serious or severe illness or injury while on active duty,” according to the news outlet. New provisions in this year’s NDAA would expand that coverage to all service members, regardless of the reasons for infertility struggles.\n\nThe senator pointed out one reason why this plan is often insufficient during her interview on Sunday: Many military women, she argued, want financial support to freeze their eggs before entering into combat zones rather than seeking treatment or therapies after the fact.\n\nOn Sunday evening as Washington headed into the second week of the holiday month, lawmakers in the House released the text of the 2026 NDAA. The massive piece of legislation, more than 3,000 pages in total, did not include the language expanding IVF access for service members — indicating Johnson's success.\n\nThe policy is one of Trump’s most unique campaign positions stemming from his 2024 bid for office. While all three of his presidential runs leaned on support from the Christian conservative right, including opponents of abortion, the president’s stance on IVF runs contrary to views held by many hardline opponents of abortion given how human embryos are created, stored and sometimes destroyed as a part of the IVF treatment process.\n\nIn October, the president announced at a White House event that his administration had negotiated with some pharmacies and a drug manufacturer to lower costs on one commonly-used IVF medication.\n\nDuckworth suggested during her interview that it was Johnson and the House GOP’s own ties to the religious right blocking further progress on the president’s plan, not Democrats. Trump acknowledged some of that backlash from conservatives at his event in October, and quipped that his plan was “pro-life”.\n\n\"There's nobody opposing this other than Speaker Johnson and his religious views,\" said Duckworth. “Because if you believe that a fertilized egg is a human being, has personhood, then some of the processes within IVF are considered murder.”\n\nIt’s also one Trump has struggled to implement via legislation. The expansion of IVF benefits to all servicemembers would mark his greatest success in this endeavor; Republicans in Congress have not moved to implement the broader policy call of his campaign, which would involve passing legislation to mandate health insurance plans cover IVF in some fashion, making it a more affordable option for families. $50,000 is typically cited as the average cost for a successful pregnancy via IVF, which includes the cost of medications and often multiple treatment cycles.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is dealing with lingering resentment and rebellious attitudes in the House of Representatives. Prominent women in his caucus including rogues like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nancy Mace, as well as loyalists like Rep. Elise Stefanik, are growing increasingly publicly critical of his leadership, while others have predicted in anonymous comments to reporters that Johnson’s tenure as speaker will not last through 2026.\n\nThe House GOP holds a tenuous majority in the chamber, which is set to shrink in January with the resignation of Greene and, potentially, Mace as well. Other members are reportedly considering the same.\n\nDemocrats are poised to take control of the chamber next year if current trends continue.

With the political landscape about to see a significant number of governor’s seats in contention, the party is keen to convert these wins into a broader, national success.\n\nThe recent victories have given Democrats a renewed focus on a strategy aimed at bolstering their presence in governance. This comes after the substantial setbacks in 2024, which saw Donald Trump reclaim the presidency and the Republicans seize control of Congress. Democrats are now honing their message around economic affordability, hoping this resonates even in traditionally conservative territories.\n\nAndy Beshear, the Governor of Kentucky and the newly appointed chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, emphasized the importance of addressing the immediate financial challenges faced by American citizens. “We must remain sharply focused on the daily struggles of the American people and the difficulties they face,” Beshear articulated, hinting at his potential aspirations for a presidential bid in 2028. “While everyone dreams of a prosperous future, managing today’s expenses is crucial.”\n\nBeshear, along with his fellow governors, believes that the message of making life more affordable could serve as a powerful tool against Trump’s policies, while strategically avoiding making him the campaign’s centerpiece. “Yes, it is essential to scrutinize a president’s performance,” Beshear remarked, “but we must refrain from passing judgment on the voters themselves.”\n\nHe and other governors said Democrats can use the affordability message as a cudgel against Trump without making him the central focus of their campaigns.\n\n“Yes, we can judge a president, and we should judge this president,” Beshear said. “But we never judge those voters.”\n\nDemocrats hone in on costs\n\nThe meeting of Democratic governors comes as blue states have been under fire from the Trump administration, which is exercising power in novel ways against the president’s perceived enemies.\n\nTrump has deployed the National Guard in California, Oregon and Illinois over the objections of their Democratic governors. His administration has demanded detailed voter data and threatened to cut off food assistance for states that don’t provide information to support his immigration crackdown.\n\nHeading into a primary season in which factions will battle over the future of the party, Democratic governors largely sang from the same sheet over the weekend. A dozen candidates and sitting governors all said they plan to talk extensively about the costs of housing, child care, utilities and groceries during Trump’s second term.\n\nBut the unified focus on affordability papers over real divisions in the party’s ranks over how aggressively to confront Trump, who won all of the presidential battleground states last year, and how to deal with the rising costs that are squeezing Americans.\n\nOn the same day Democratic moderates with national security credentials, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, won their governor’s races, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won election as New York mayor. All ran on promises to tackle affordability, but they offered very different visions for how to deliver.\n\nThe affordability strategy isn’t without risk. Economic conditions could change, making concerns about prices less salient or urgent.\n\nAnd Democrats could be setting themselves up for disappointment down the road if they win in 2026 but are unable to bring down costs to voters’ satisfaction, allowing Republicans to capitalize on the same buyer’s remorse Democrats are now seeking to stoke.\n\nFor Democratic incumbents seeking reelection, they can’t rest on fighting the Trump administration, said two-term Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. They need to show results. \n\n“Deliver for me. But don’t forget to fight this,” said Lujan Grisham, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. “They do want both, and finding ways to cross-cut those and marry that I think is going to be a winning set of messages.”\n\nAffordability also becomes a focal point for Trump\n\nAfter the New Jersey and Virginia elections last month, the White House began shifting its message to focus more on affordability. Trump, who has not done much domestic travel during his second term, is scheduled to visit Pennsylvania on Tuesday to highlight his efforts to reduce inflation.\n\nThe president has talked more about affordability recently, and he reduced tariffs on beef and other commodities that consumers say cost too much. But Trump also has said the economy is better and consumer prices lower than reported by the media.\n\n“The word affordability is a Democrat scam,” he said during a Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nHe continues to blame his Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for the increase nationwide in inflation rates that occurred this year after his return to the White House. Overall, inflation is tracking at 3% annually, up from 2.3% in April when Trump rolled out a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said the administration will be intent on reducing inflation, after tackling immigration and pushing to have interest rates cut.\n\n“I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nDemocratic governors and candidates were largely aligned in the conclusion that many voters in 2024 didn’t feel as if their party was focused on their concerns or shared their anger at a system they believe is failing average Americans.\n\n“I think if there was any failure in the presidential election, it’s we forgot what real people care about,” said Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who is expected to seek a second term next year.\n\n“We’ve got to listen to people,” said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta who is running for Georgia governor.\n\nDemocrats believe some red states could be in play\n\nOnce Spanberger takes office in January, Democrats will control 24 governor’s offices, a significant improvement from the low point of just 16 following the 2016 election but still slightly behind the Republicans’ 26 seats. \n\nThirty-six states will hold elections for governor next year.\n\nAmong the hardest-fought contests will be in swing states that flipped between supporting Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024. Those include Arizona, where Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term, and Nevada, where Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is up for reelection. Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia all have open seats that are widely expected to attract a large field of candidates and big spending.\n\nThe retirement of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in Kansas, an overwhelmingly Republican state in presidential contests, gives the GOP the upper hand there. But Democrats are talking about expanding the field by competing in states such as Iowa or Ohio, where the party used to be competitive but has struggled in the Trump era.\n\nGina Hinojosa, a Texas lawmaker running for governor in the nation’s second-most populous state, is making the case to Democratic donors that investing in Texas will be crucial to her party’s hopes of winning power in Washington before the 2030 census. Her state is projected to pick up at least four House seats and Electoral College votes at the expense of blue states such as California and Illinois. \n\n“If we don’t flip before the end of the decade, there won’t be Democratic control of Congress or the White House,” Hinojosa said. “Because the math doesn’t work.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn the sunlit corridors of Arizona, Democratic governors convened over the weekend&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democratic Governors Advocate for Midterm Strategy Centered on Economic Concerns of Voters first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democratic-governors-advocate-for-midterm-strategy-centered-on-economic-concerns-of-voters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Democratic-governors-say-the-party039s-midterm-strategy-must-focus-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:38:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.296},{"id":385983430,"title":"Key senator OK with boat strike video release","text":"A video of a U.S. military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean that killed two survivors of the initial attack shows “nothing remarkable,” the Republican who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee said Sunday, and he would not oppose its public release if the Pentagon were to declassify it.\n\nArkansas Sen.

Andy Beshear, the new chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and a possible candidate for president in 2028. “Everybody wants the economy of tomorrow, but paying the bills today is absolutely critical.”\n\nHe and other governors said Democrats can use the affordability message as a cudgel against Trump without making him the central focus of their campaigns.\n\n“Yes, we can judge a president, and we should judge this president,” Beshear said. “But we never judge those voters.”\n\nDemocrats hone in on costs\n\nThe meeting of Democratic governors comes as blue states have been under fire from the Trump administration, which is exercising power in novel ways against the president’s perceived enemies.\n\nTrump has deployed the National Guard in California, Oregon and Illinois over the objections of their Democratic governors. His administration has demanded detailed voter data and threatened to cut off food assistance for states that don’t provide information to support his immigration crackdown.\n\nHeading into a primary season in which factions will battle over the future of the party, Democratic governors largely sang from the same sheet over the weekend. A dozen candidates and sitting governors all said they plan to talk extensively about the costs of housing, child care, utilities and groceries during Trump’s second term.\n\nBut the unified focus on affordability papers over real divisions in the party’s ranks over how aggressively to confront Trump, who won all of the presidential battleground states last year, and how to deal with the rising costs that are squeezing Americans.\n\nOn the same day Democratic moderates with national security credentials, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, won their governor’s races, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won election as New York mayor. All ran on promises to tackle affordability, but they offered very different visions for how to deliver.\n\nThe affordability strategy isn’t without risk. Economic conditions could change, making concerns about prices less salient or urgent.\n\nAnd Democrats could be setting themselves up for disappointment down the road if they win in 2026 but are unable to bring down costs to voters’ satisfaction, allowing Republicans to capitalize on the same buyer’s remorse Democrats are now seeking to stoke.\n\nFor Democratic incumbents seeking reelection, they can’t rest on fighting the Trump administration, said two-term Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. They need to show results.\n\n“Deliver for me. But don’t forget to fight this,” said Lujan Grisham, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. “They do want both, and finding ways to cross-cut those and marry that I think is going to be a winning set of messages.”\n\nAffordability also becomes a focal point for Trump\n\nAfter the New Jersey and Virginia elections last month, the White House began shifting its message to focus more on affordability. Trump, who has not done much domestic travel during his second term, is scheduled to visit Pennsylvania on Tuesday to highlight his efforts to reduce inflation.\n\nThe president has talked more about affordability recently, and he reduced tariffs on beef and other commodities that consumers say cost too much. But Trump also has said the economy is better and consumer prices lower than reported by the media.\n\n“The word affordability is a Democrat scam,” he said during a Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nHe continues to blame his Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for the increase nationwide in inflation rates that occurred this year after his return to the White House. Overall, inflation is tracking at 3% annually, up from 2.3% in April when Trump rolled out a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said the administration will be intent on reducing inflation, after tackling immigration and pushing to have interest rates cut.\n\n“I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nDemocratic governors and candidates were largely aligned in the conclusion that many voters in 2024 didn’t feel as if their party was focused on their concerns or shared their anger at a system they believe is failing average Americans.\n\n“I think if there was any failure in the presidential election, it’s we forgot what real people care about,” said Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who is expected to seek a second term next year.\n\n“We’ve got to listen to people,” said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta who is running for Georgia governor.\n\nDemocrats believe some red states could be in play\n\nOnce Spanberger takes office in January, Democrats will control 24 governor’s offices, a significant improvement from the low point of just 16 following the 2016 election but still slightly behind the Republicans’ 26 seats.\n\nThirty-six states will hold elections for governor next year.\n\nAmong the hardest-fought contests will be in swing states that flipped between supporting Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024. Those include Arizona, where Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term, and Nevada, where Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is up for reelection. Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia all have open seats that are widely expected to attract a large field of candidates and big spending.\n\nThe retirement of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in Kansas, an overwhelmingly Republican state in presidential contests, gives the GOP the upper hand there. But Democrats are talking about expanding the field by competing in states such as Iowa or Ohio, where the party used to be competitive but has struggled in the Trump era.\n\nGina Hinojosa, a Texas lawmaker running for governor in the nation’s second-most populous state, is making the case to Democratic donors that investing in Texas will be crucial to her party’s hopes of winning power in Washington before the 2030 census. Her state is projected to pick up at least four House seats and Electoral College votes at the expense of blue states such as California and Illinois.\n\n“If we don’t flip before the end of the decade, there won’t be Democratic control of Congress or the White House,” Hinojosa said. “Because the math doesn’t work.”","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/12/07/democratic-governors-midterm-strategy/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Democratic_Governors_64736-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:34:09","author":"Jonathan J.

Vance made the comment in a post on X, claiming that mass migration strips opportunities from American workers. He also alleged that studies contradicting his view were funded by \"the people getting rich off of the old system\". A user, quoting Vance's message, shot back, \"That means you have to send Usha, her Indian family, and your biracial kids back to India.\" USHA'S FAITH REMARKS STIR CONTROVERSYThis isn't a separate instance when Vance targeted mass migration. During a recent appearance on the New York Post's podcast, Vance said it was \"totally reasonable and acceptable\" for Americans to prefer neighbours who share their race, language or skin colour. .preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Vance, who often echoes Donald Trump's rhetoric, blamed the Biden administration for what he calls an immigration system that has \"promoted division.\" Asked in the interview whether a returning Trump administration planned to deport all undocumented migrants, Vance said, \"We're trying to remove as many as we possibly can.\"The latest uproar also revived a separate controversy from last month, when he said his wife, Usha Vance, who is Hindu, will one day come to share his Christian faith, even as he emphasised that their interfaith marriage is built on mutual respect and understanding. Speaking again at a Turning Point USA event, he told supporters that Usha attends church with him, and he \"honestly do (es) wish\" she might eventually embrace the Christian faith.Vance later clarified that Usha \"has no plans to convert\" and that he respects her beliefs.TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESCALATES IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWNThe Trump administration has escalated its nationwide crackdown on both legal and undocumented immigrants in recent months. On December 3, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced an immediate suspension of all immigration applications, including green cards, citizenship, and asylum claims, from 19 \"high-risk\" countries previously targeted by travel bans, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, and others, citing heightened security concerns following the fatal shooting of a National Guard member by an Afghan asylum seeker in Washington, DC. This measure, which also halts asylum decisions for over 2.2 million pending cases and mandates re-interviews for refugees admitted under the prior administration, has frozen pathways for thousands of families and workers. - EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Dec 8, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/jd-vance-immigration-remarks-row-mass-migration-glbs-2832230-2025-12-08","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/mother-of-3-usha-vance-breaks-silence-after-being-spotted-without-wedding-ring-232307765-16x9.jpg?VersionId=yeh2bGmhkUThPZz2JhpGkT_LLyjNx5Sl?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:32:40","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":385983906,"title":"Exclusive | Jiangnan Shipyard to build world’s first thorium-powered container vessel by 2035","text":"State-owned Jiangnan Shipyard (Group) plans to build the world’s first nuclear-powered container vessel, a move that would cement China’s dominance in an industry increasingly shifting to renewable energy.\nLin Qingshan, vice-president of the Shanghai-based shipbuilder, told the Post on Thursday that a 25,000-container vessel was being designed, adding that these next-generation ships would use nuclear power.

In July 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Moscow to meet Putin. A month later, in August, he visited Ukraine and met Zelensky.Indian and Ukrainian officials have been in talks for several weeks, and New Delhi had reached out to Zelensky’s office even before Putin arrived in India, the report said, quoting people familiar with the developments.India's calibrated approach to Russia-UkraineIndia’s stand on the Russia–Ukraine war has been one of calibrated balance: it calls for peace, dialogue and respect for sovereignty while avoiding taking sidesPM Narendra Modi said during Putin's visit last week that India is \"not neutral” in this war and stands for peace. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has reiterated that violence must stop, that diplomacy is the only way forward, and that India remains willing to contribute to peace.The timing of the proposed visit, however, will depend on several factors, including the progress of former US President Donald Trump’s peace plan and the situation on the battlefield, the report said. Ukraine’s domestic politics, where President Zelensky’s government is under pressure due to a major corruption scandal, could also play a role.In August last year, PM Modi had visited Ukraine at the invitation of Zelensky in first ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in the year 1992.A joint statement issued following PM Modi's visit to Ukraine stated that both Leaders expressed mutual interest in elevating bilateral relations from a comprehensive partnership to a strategic partnership in the future.What Ukrainian envoy said in August?In August this year, Ukrainian envoy Oleksandr Polishchuk said PM Modi had invited Zelensky to visit India, adding that the two nations are “trying to agree on a precise date” for the same.“The Indian Prime Minister invited Zelensky to come to India. Both sides are working on this. We expect President Zelenskyy to be in India, definitely,” Polishchuk said while speaking to reporters on the occasion of Ukraine's national Flag Day, 23 August 2025.PM Modi held a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky again in New York in September last year,So far, Ukraine has sent Presidents to India three times - 1992, 2002 and 2012.(With agency inputs)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/india/after-putin-s-visit-will-zelensky-come-to-new-delhi-next-india-likely-to-host-ukrainian-president-in-2026-report-11765151614185.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/07/1600x900/logo/UKRAINE-CYPRUS-RUSSIA-DIPLOMACY-CONFLICT-WAR-1_1765151732236_1765151741198.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:30:07","author":"Livemint","authors":["Livemint"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.052},{"id":385983684,"title":"Trump Growing Tired of ICE Barbie Drama: Chief Advisor Corey Lewandowski's Love Affair Turns Political Liability Overnight","text":"The tenure of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is reportedly in jeopardy, with senior administration officials indicating that President Donald Trump is preparing to replace his once-favoured cabinet member.While Noem has been a vocal champion of the administration's hardline immigration policies, the primary source of friction is not policy but the persistent controversy surrounding her relationship with chief advisor Corey Lewandowski, a dynamic the White House is reportedly eager to resolve.Internal Frustrations Signal Imminent Leadership Overhaul at DHSSenior administration officials suggest that a significant staff shakeup could occur as early as the New Year. The timeline remains somewhat flexible, yet the sentiment is increasingly decisive. Two former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, who served under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, told The Bulwark that the President is looking to move on from Noem. One source suggested that the change could happen 'really soon'.Meanwhile, a third official cautioned that Trump might allow the former South Dakota governor to remain in her post through January and February to oversee planned enforcement operations. Despite this potential grace period, the desire for a clean slate heading into the new calendar year is a driving force behind the discussions.Trump is reportedly eyeing Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is vacating his office in January, as a potential replacement. However, Youngkin has previously expressed a preference for economic or business portfolios rather than immigration enforcement.Corey Lewandowski's Presence Creates Friction and Operational RisksThe primary catalyst for Noem's potential ouster appears to be her continued professional and personal proximity to Corey Lewandowski. Often referred to as Washington's 'worst-kept secret', the alleged secret romance between the married Secretary and her advisor has reportedly alienated top White House leaders. Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, operates as a 'gatekeeper' for Noem, weighing in on personnel matters and travelling with her extensively.Beyond the personal dynamics, Lewandowski's influence on policy has drawn sharp criticism. He has spearheaded aggressive efforts to replace Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership nationwide with Border Patrol veterans. The goal is a harder, military-style edge to the administration's immigration crackdown, a strategy already visible on the ground with the hostile 'Midway Blitz' operation in Chicago.Apart from the policy battles, Lewandowski faces legal headaches regarding his actual job status. As an unpaid special government employee, he is legally restricted to working only 130 days per year. In August, reports surfaced that the White House was quietly investigating a gross undercounting of his working days, adding another layer of liability to Noem's tenure.Bizarre Praise and Administrative Pushback Amidst ScandalNoem made headlines during a recent cabinet meeting with an unusual tribute to Trump's influence on the weather. 'Sir, you made it through hurricane season without a hurricane...even you kept the hurricanes away. We appreciate that', she said. This level of flattery comes from an official who previously fell off the vice presidential shortlist after admitting to shooting her family's dog, a controversy that continues to shadow her political career.Despite the mounting reports, allies of the Secretary have forcefully denied the claims of internal strife. Lewandowski addressed the allegations of his dismissal and the relationship rumours in a statement, asserting, 'None of that is true'.Furthermore, the administration has officially pushed back against the narrative of a split. White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson took to social media to denounce the speculation. 'Anonymous former staffers pretend to know what POTUS is thinking and the Bulwark treats them as credible? This \"report\" — and the Bulwark — is total FAKE NEWS! Secretary Noem is doing a great job implementing the President's agenda and Making America Safe Again', she wrote.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-growing-tired-ice-barbie-drama-chief-advisor-corey-lewandowskis-love-affair-turns-1761035","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1774118/trump-eyes-noem-exit-amid-lewandowski-affair.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=3cbac86a7437b8c4db7413bb4ed524fe","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:27:55","author":"Daniel Joshua Flores","authors":["Daniel Joshua Flores"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":385981978,"title":"Hegseth non-committal on releasing video of second drug-boat strike","text":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday refused to say whether the Pentagon would release video of the operation that targeted survivors of a strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean..The White House early this week confirmed that a US admiral under Hegseth's authority ordered the deadly \"double-tap\" strike against the survivors, reports of which have triggered accusations of a possible war crime..A total of 11 people were killed in the two strikes in early September, the first in a months-long military campaign that has so far left more than 80 dead..While video of the initial attack has been released, pressure has built on the Trump administration to release any available video of the follow-up strike on the survivors..\"We are reviewing it right now,\" Hegseth said during a Q&A session after addressing a defense forum hosted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California..The Pentagon chief was asked multiple times whether the video would be released, but Hegseth resisted..\"We're reviewing the process, and we'll see,\" he said. \"Whatever we were to decide to release, we'd have to be very responsible about reviewing that right now.\".Hegseth also vehemently denied having issued a kill order on survivors, as was reported by The Washington Post..\"You don't walk in and say 'Kill them all.'

Despite this, the executive recognised that “thousands of lives have been disrupted” and that some residents remain without shelter and basic utilities.\n\nThe resolution further extended condolences to families who lost loved ones or property in the hurricane and reaffirmed support for accelerated recovery efforts.\n\nA second resolution approved by the Central Executive confirmed the cancellation of the JLP’s 2025 Annual Conference, citing the party’s focus on national recovery. It also endorsed the re-election en bloc of all members of the party’s officer corps.\n\nBoth resolutions were formally adopted on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Isiaa Madden, architect behind The Pinnacle, celebrates Mouttet Mile win \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Isiaa Madden has reshaped skylines, revived architectural imagination in Montego Bay, and carried her family’s 90-year legacy of service at Madden’s F... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Hope in Melissa’s aftermath’ \n\n\n Escarpment Road and Middle Quarters New Testament Churches of God partner for major relief effort \n\n\n BY KELSEY THOMAS Online coordinator thomask@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — In the wake of the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, Escarpment Road New Testament Church of God joined forc... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Samuel K Golden releases ‘Sunset’ to inspire survivors post-Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Fusion artiste Samuel K Golden is hoping that his latest single, Sunset , will be a beacon of inspiration for Jamaicans who were negatively impacted b... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Robert Minott gains buzz with ‘Link Up’ on Pretty Little Baby instrumental remake \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Reggae artiste Robert Minott is pleased with the enthusiastic response to his latest single, Link Up , released on a remake of an instrumental inspire... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bunny Shaw on the double as City go six clear at the top of English WSL \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaica’s Khadija “Bunny” Shaw scored twice and provided an assist to help her Manchester City team extend their lead at the top of the English Women'... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump reignites ‘soccer vs football’ debate at World Cup 2026 draw \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States — United States (US) President Donald Trump has revived the longstanding debate over whether the sport known in the US as “s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JLP Central Executive to discuss intensifying Hurricane recovery efforts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A meeting of the Jamaica Labour Party's (JLP) Central Executive is set to get underway in St Andrew on Sunday morning with discuss... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Andy Beshear, the new chairman of the Democratic Governors Association and a possible candidate for president in 2028. “Everybody wants the economy of tomorrow, but paying the bills today is absolutely critical.”\n\nHe and other governors said Democrats can use the affordability message as a cudgel against Trump without making him the central focus of their campaigns.\n\n“Yes, we can judge a president, and we should judge this president,” Beshear said. “But we never judge those voters.”\n\nDemocrats hone in on costs\n\nThe meeting of Democratic governors comes as blue states have been under fire from the Trump administration, which is exercising power in novel ways against the president’s perceived enemies.\n\nTrump has deployed the National Guard in California, Oregon and Illinois over the objections of their Democratic governors. His administration has demanded detailed voter data and threatened to cut off food assistance for states that don’t provide information to support his immigration crackdown.\n\nHeading into a primary season in which factions will battle over the future of the party, Democratic governors largely sang from the same sheet over the weekend. A dozen candidates and sitting governors all said they plan to talk extensively about the costs of housing, child care, utilities and groceries during Trump’s second term.\n\nBut the unified focus on affordability papers over real divisions in the party’s ranks over how aggressively to confront Trump, who won all of the presidential battleground states last year, and how to deal with the rising costs that are squeezing Americans.\n\nOn the same day Democratic moderates with national security credentials, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, won their governor’s races, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won election as New York mayor. All ran on promises to tackle affordability, but they offered very different visions for how to deliver.\n\nThe affordability strategy isn’t without risk. Economic conditions could change, making concerns about prices less salient or urgent.\n\nAnd Democrats could be setting themselves up for disappointment down the road if they win in 2026 but are unable to bring down costs to voters’ satisfaction, allowing Republicans to capitalize on the same buyer’s remorse Democrats are now seeking to stoke.\n\nFor Democratic incumbents seeking reelection, they can’t rest on fighting the Trump administration, said two-term Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. They need to show results. \n\n“Deliver for me. But don’t forget to fight this,” said Lujan Grisham, who is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. “They do want both, and finding ways to cross-cut those and marry that I think is going to be a winning set of messages.”\n\nAffordability also becomes a focal point for Trump\n\nAfter the New Jersey and Virginia elections last month, the White House began shifting its message to focus more on affordability. Trump, who has not done much domestic travel during his second term, is scheduled to visit Pennsylvania on Tuesday to highlight his efforts to reduce inflation.\n\nThe president has talked more about affordability recently, and he reduced tariffs on beef and other commodities that consumers say cost too much. But Trump also has said the economy is better and consumer prices lower than reported by the media.\n\n“The word affordability is a Democrat scam,” he said during a Cabinet meeting last week.\n\nHe continues to blame his Democratic predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for the increase nationwide in inflation rates that occurred this year after his return to the White House. Overall, inflation is tracking at 3% annually, up from 2.3% in April when Trump rolled out a sweeping set of import taxes.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said the administration will be intent on reducing inflation, after tackling immigration and pushing to have interest rates cut.\n\n“I expect inflation to roll down strongly next year,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”\n\nDemocratic governors and candidates were largely aligned in the conclusion that many voters in 2024 didn’t feel as if their party was focused on their concerns or shared their anger at a system they believe is failing average Americans.\n\n“I think if there was any failure in the presidential election, it’s we forgot what real people care about,” said Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, who is expected to seek a second term next year.\n\n“We’ve got to listen to people,” said Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta who is running for Georgia governor.\n\nDemocrats believe some red states could be in play\n\nOnce Spanberger takes office in January, Democrats will control 24 governor’s offices, a significant improvement from the low point of just 16 following the 2016 election but still slightly behind the Republicans’ 26 seats. \n\nThirty-six states will hold elections for governor next year.\n\nAmong the hardest-fought contests will be in swing states that flipped between supporting Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024. Those include Arizona, where Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs is seeking a second term, and Nevada, where Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is up for reelection. Wisconsin, Michigan and Georgia all have open seats that are widely expected to attract a large field of candidates and big spending.\n\nThe retirement of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in Kansas, an overwhelmingly Republican state in presidential contests, gives the GOP the upper hand there. But Democrats are talking about expanding the field by competing in states such as Iowa or Ohio, where the party used to be competitive but has struggled in the Trump era.\n\nGina Hinojosa, a Texas lawmaker running for governor in the nation’s second-most populous state, is making the case to Democratic donors that investing in Texas will be crucial to her party’s hopes of winning power in Washington before the 2030 census. Her state is projected to pick up at least four House seats and Electoral College votes at the expense of blue states such as California and Illinois. \n\n“If we don’t flip before the end of the decade, there won’t be Democratic control of Congress or the White House,” Hinojosa said. “Because the math doesn’t work.”","url":"https://apnews.com/article/governors-democrats-affordability-2026-midterms-trump-1dfe3d853f29bb392764203601e4c2d1","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/ebfe5a1/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7912x5277+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F73%2F99%2Fe8b09d26dbfa9151744b7f635fdc%2F34a9f06f39564a08bea17912a0214de7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:23:58","author":"Jonathan J.

The legislation, which authorizes War Department spending at $8 billion above the White House’s request, includes a 4% pay raise for enlisted service members, expands counter-drone authorities, and directs new investments in the Golden Dome missile defense shield and nuclear modernization programs. It also extends Pentagon support to law enforcement operations at the southwest border and strengthens U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific, including funding for Taiwan’s security cooperation program. In a victory for conservative privacy hawks like House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the legislation includes a non-defense provision that would mandate FBI disclosure when the bureau was investigating presidential candidates and other candidates for federal office. That measure was the subject of party in-fighting last week when Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., whom Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had appointed chairwoman of House GOP leadership, publicly accused the speaker of kowtowing to Democrats and allowing that provision to be removed. WAR DEPARTMENT REFOCUSES ON AI, HYPERSONICS AND DIRECTED ENERGY IN MAJOR STRATEGY OVERHAUL Johnson said he was blindsided by Stefanik's anger and was unaware of her concerns when she had made them public. Stefanik later claimed victory on X, stating the provision had been reinstated after a conversation between herself, Johnson and President Donald Trump. Coverage of in vitro fertilization (IVF) for military families, which became a flashpoint in recent days, is not included in the final NDAA. Neither are provisions preempting states from regulating AI or banning a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). Republicans have pushed the CBDC prohibition as a privacy and civil-liberties measure, arguing that a government-issued digital dollar could give federal agencies the ability to monitor or restrict individual transactions. House aides said the anti-CBDC language became tied to a separate housing-policy package known as \"Road to Housing,\" and the concessions required to keep both items together were unacceptable. The bill also establishes a new \"Artificial Intelligence Futures Steering Committee\" charged with producing long-range forecasts and policy recommendations for advanced AI systems, including artificial general intelligence. The legislation takes aim at long-standing bottlenecks in the defense industrial base by authorizing new investment tools, expanding multi-year procurement for high-demand munitions and platforms, and overhauling portions of the acquisition system to speed the fielding of commercial and emerging technologies. Alongside those reforms, lawmakers approved new \"right-to-repair\" style requirements that force contractors to provide the technical data the Pentagon needs to maintain and sustain major weapons systems—a change intended to reduce vendor lock-in and ease chronic maintenance delays across the fleet. One major section of the bill establishes a far-reaching outbound investment screening system, requiring U.S. companies and investors to alert the Treasury Department when they back certain high-risk technologies in China or other \"countries of concern.\" The measure gives Treasury the ability to block deals outright, forces detailed annual reporting to Congress, and grants new authorities to sanction foreign firms tied to China’s military or surveillance networks. Lawmakers cast the effort as a long-overdue step to keep U.S. capital from fueling Beijing’s development of dual-use technologies. US COULD LOSE NEXT MAJOR WAR DUE TO PENTAGON'S 'BROKEN' ACQUISITION SYSTEM The bill also includes a procurement ban targeting biotechnology providers that would bar the Pentagon from contracting with Chinese genetic sequencing and biotech firms linked to the People’s Liberation Army or China’s security services. Additional sourcing prohibitions restrict the War Department from purchasing items such as advanced batteries, photovoltaic components, computer displays, and critical minerals originating from foreign entities of concern, further tightening U.S. supply chains away from China. They also require the department to phase out the use of Chinese-made computers, printers and other tech equipment. Beyond economic measures, the NDAA directs the State Department to deploy a new cadre of Regional China Officers at U.S. diplomatic posts around the world, responsible for monitoring Chinese commercial, technological, and infrastructure activities across every major geographic region, including Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. The NDAA contains several Israel-related provisions, including a directive for the Pentagon to avoid participating in international defense exhibitions that bar Israeli involvement. It authorizes funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow – the missile defense programs the U.S. operates with Israel. The bill also requires biennial reports comparing China’s global diplomatic presence to that of the United States. The Pentagon is separately directed to strengthen U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific by extending the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and expanding cooperative training and industrial-base initiatives with regional allies, including Taiwan and the Philippines. The legislation reauthorizes the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative at $400 million per year for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. Congress will also require more frequent reporting on allied contributions to Ukraine to track how European partners support Kyiv. The bill repeals two long-dormant war authorizations tied to earlier phases of U.S. military involvement in Iraq, while leaving the primary post-9/11 counterterrorism authority untouched. Lawmakers said the final text includes repeals of the 1991 Gulf War AUMF and the 2002 Iraq War AUMF, both of which successive administrations have said are no longer operationally necessary. The 1991 authorization approved the U.S.-led effort to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and the 2002 authority permitted the invasion of Iraq under President George W. Bush. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Both parties have debated winding down these authorizations for years, arguing they no longer reflect current U.S. missions in the Middle East. Presidents from both parties, including Trump, have maintained that modern military operations in the region do not rely on either statute and that the commander in chief already holds sufficient Article II authority to defend U.S. personnel when required. Repeal also answers long-running concerns in Congress about outdated war authorities being used as secondary legal justifications for actions far from their original intent, such as the 2020 strike on Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The NDAA does not touch the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which remains the central legal basis for U.S. counter-terror operations against al-Qaeda, ISIS, and associated groups. That post-9/11 statute continues to underpin nearly all active U.S. counter-terror missions worldwide. House aides said leaders in their chamber hoped to consider the bill as soon as this week. It will first need to go through the House Rules Committee, the final gatekeepers before legislation gets a chamber-wide vote. It could hit that panel as early as Tuesday afternoon. Then it will head for a vote in the Senate before reaching Trump's desk for his signature.","summary":"Congress passes $900B defense bill targeting China with new investment restrictions, military technology bans, and 4% pay raise for troops nationwide.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/congress-unveils-900b-defense-bill-targeting-china-tech-bans-investment-crackdown","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/us-capitol-building.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 00:22:17","author":"Elizabeth Elkind,Morgan Phillips","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind","Morgan Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.055},{"id":385984744,"title":"Hamas and Israel move towards phase two of US-backed Gaza plan  - Grenada Chronicle – Daily Grenada And","text":"As Israel and Hamas prepare to move towards phase two of a United States-led blueprint to end Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, disagreements loom over the as-yet undefined role of an international stabilisation force in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\n\nSenior Hamas official Basem Naim said on Sunday that the US draft required “a lot of clarifications”.

The ruling from US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly does not preclude the DoJ from trying again to indict Comey, but it does suggest prosecutors may have to do so without citing communications between the former FBI chief and a close friend, Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman. Comey was charged in September with lying to Congress when he denied having authorised an associate to serve as an anonymous source for media coverage about the FBI. In pursuing the case, prosecutors cited messages between Comey and Richman that they said showed Comey approving of Richman interacting with journalists for certain FBI-related coverage. The case was dismissed last month after a different federal judge ruled the prosecutor who filed the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But that ruling left open the possibility that the US government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a long-time foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the DoJ of a vindictive prosecution. After the case was thrown out, lawyers for Richman sought a court order to bar prosecutors from continued access to his computer files, which the DoJ obtained through search warrants in 2019 and 2020 as part of a media leak investigation that was later closed without charges. Officials searched the files for communications between Comey and Richman they could use to build the case against Comey. But Richman and his lawyers say prosecutors exceeded the scope of the warrants, illegally held onto communications they should have destroyed or returned, and conducted new, warrantless searches of the data.
