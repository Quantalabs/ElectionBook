In southern Gaza, 20 people were wounded by Israeli gunfire as they waited to get aid from U.N. aid trucks near Morag Square near Rafah, medics said.\n\nEight more people died of starvation or malnutrition in the last day, Gaza's Health Ministry said, while at least 80 people were killed in the latest Israeli firing.\n\nNetanyahu's office said in a statement that the prime minister had held a \"limited security discussion\" lasting about three hours during which military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir \"presented the options for continuing the campaign in Gaza\".\n\nAn Israeli official had earlier told Reuters that Defence Minister Israel Katz and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu, would also attend the meeting to decide on a strategy to take to the cabinet this week. Israeli media reported on Tuesday that the cabinet would convene on Thursday at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT).\n\nIsrael's Channel 12, citing an official from Netanyahu's office, had said the prime minister was leaning towards taking control of the entire territory. That would reverse a 2005 decision to withdraw Israeli citizens and soldiers from Gaza, while retaining control over its borders, airspace and utilities, a move right-wing parties blame for Hamas gaining power there in the 2006 election.\n\nIt was unclear, however, whether Netanyahu was foreseeing a prolonged takeover or a short-term operation aimed at dismantling Hamas and freeing Israeli hostages. The prime minister's office declined to comment on the Channel 12 report.\n\n\"It is still necessary to complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, release our hostages and ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel,\" Netanyahu told new recruits at a military base. \"We are not giving up on any of these missions.\"\n\nThe U.N. called reports about a possible decision to expand Israel's military operations throughout the Gaza Strip \"deeply alarming\" if true.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump declined to say whether the U.S., Israel's closest military ally, supported Netanyahu's plans.\n\n\"I know that we are there now trying to get people fed,\" Trump told reporters. \"As far as the rest of it, I really can't say. That's going to be pretty much up to Israel.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas released a video of the Israeli hostage Evyatar David, appearing emaciated in what seemed to be an underground tunnel. The images shocked Israelis and sparked international condemnation.\n\nThroughout the war, there has been sustained international pressure on Hamas to release the remaining 50 people taken hostage in 2023, of whom Israeli officials estimate 20 are still alive. Most hostages have been released during ceasefires following diplomatic negotiations. Israel broke the last ceasefire.\n\nPRESSURE TACTIC?\n\nA Palestinian official said the suggestion of a full Israeli military takeover of Gaza may be a tactic to pressure Hamas into concessions, while the Palestinian Foreign Ministry urged foreign nations to take heed of the reports.\n\n\"The ministry urges countries and the international community to treat these leaks with utmost seriousness and to intervene urgently to prevent their implementation, whether these leaks are meant to exert pressure, test international reactions, or are genuine and serious,\" it said.\n\nIsrael's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encourage Palestinians to leave their homeland. \n\nThe International Court of Justice said in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal and should end soon.\n\nNearly two years of fighting in Gaza have strained Israel's military, which has a small standing army and has had to repeatedly mobilise reservists; some military leaders have warned against expanding the military occupation.\n\nIn a sign of differences between some members of Israel's ruling coalition and the military, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir challenged military head Zamir to state he would comply with government directives even if a decision was made to take all of Gaza.\n\nThe statement from Netanyahu's office said the Israeli Defence Forces were \"prepared to implement any decision that will be made by the Political-Security Cabinet.\"\n\nThe war was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israeli communities and military bases near Gaza on October 7, 2023. About 1,200 people, including more than 700 civilians, were killed, and 251 hostages were taken to Gaza.\n\nIsrael's military response has devastated the tiny, crowded enclave, killing more than 61,000 people, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nIsrael's campaign has forced nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people from their homes and caused what a global hunger monitor called last week an unfolding famine.\n\nSome 188 Palestinians, including 94 children, have died from hunger since the war began, according to Gaza authorities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli tanks pushed into central Gaza, but it was not clear if the move was part of a larger ground offensive.\n\nPalestinians living in the last quarter of the territory where Israel has not yet taken military control, via ground incursions or demands for civilians to leave, said any new push would be catastrophic.\n\n\"If the tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea?\" said Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant. \"This will be like a death sentence to the entire population.\"","summary":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met senior security officials to finalise a new strategy for the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip, his office said on Tuesday","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/netanyahu-meets-security-officials-as-israel-considers-full-gaza-takeover/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-419.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 01:30:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Reuters 30am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Reuters 30am"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":348507892,"title":"Trump names Vance as his likely successor in 2028 US elections","text":"WASHINGTON, August 6. /TASS/.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nIn a recent speech, António Guterres, the UN General Secretary, claimed that the world is “on the cusp of a new era” in global energy. “Fossil fuels,” he said are finally “running out of road.”\n\nThis is a weighty statement by an influential voice and so needs some critical assessment. If correct, it tells us a massive transformation has occurred or is in progress. If not, it tells us something about problems of perception and representation regarding energy reality.\n\nGuterres’ speech announced the release of a new UN report, “Seizing the Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the New Era of Renewables, Efficiency, and Electrification.” His main message has several parts: 1) the energy transition has reached a point where a non-carbon future is “no longer a promise [but]\n\na fact”; 2) wind and solar are now so low cost they are displacing fossil fuels and will become dominant; 3) renewables are free from economic or political problems so are the real “foundation of energy security.”\n\nEnergy Sources The World Uses And What This Means\n\nIn 2024, world energy use was 76.4% from oil, coal, and natural gas, in that order, with another 6% from traditional biomass, or 82.4% from carbon sources. This compares to 6.1% for solar and wind. If we add other renewables like hydro, the non-carbon total rises to 13%, and with nuclear to 18%. This is only a few percent less than natural gas, at 22%.\n\nTrend-wise, global energy consumption has been increasing at an accelerated rate since 2022, with fossil sources growing slowly, hydro and nuclear stable, and solar and wind rapidly increasing. The best interpretation from this and other trends is that renewables are replacing fossil sources in meeting new energy demand but haven’t started to displace them on a global basis. Their overall role is still small but significantly elevated when viewed as part of the non-carbon share.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nReal change is thus underway, but there are no clear signs of a massive transformation. The idea that the era of fossil fuels is at an end is difficult to square with reality.\n\nElectricity Is The Future, But It Will Not Be Simple\n\nThe UN message focuses on electricity, which makes sense as this form of energy is expanding into new sectors like transportation, industry, and services. Electricity is the future in an ever-more digitized world, and demand for power is growing everywhere.\n\nThe claim that solar and wind are far cheaper than fossil fuels and nuclear and will thus win out in every case is not a simple one. Added to the material and construction costs for these sources are those needed to integrate their fluctuating power levels into a grid system and to back them up when they fall below demand for extended periods. Backup typically comes from other sources, including natural gas, and increasingly storage technologies, especially batteries. Costs for battery storage are dropping as technology and manufacturing improve, but batteries can only supply power for hours, not weeks.\n\nAre solar/wind displacing fossil fuels in key regions? In Europe, yes. Wind supplied more total power to the continent in 2024 than either gas or coal, which have fallen by 50% or more in the past two decades. Non-carbon sources, including nuclear and hydro, now account for more than 60% of Europe’s electricity, a figure certain to rise. In the U.S., however, a major drop in coal use has been overwhelmingly due to a surge in cheap natural gas.\n\nTOPSHOT - The coal-powered Datang International Zhangjiakou Power Station is pictured at night in Zhangjiakou, one of the host cities for the 2022 Winter Olympics, in China's northern Hebei province on November 12, 2021. (Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP) (Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nChina presents a more complex case. Coal continues to exceed all other sources combined, but non-carbon electricity has grown to more than 40%. To date, wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear have taken the place of more coal use but now seem to be displacing existing consumption as well. Solar and wind are the fastest growing by far, yet hydro and nuclear are rapidly increasing, too. Beijing has plans for these sources to lower coal dependency and peak its carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nRapid build out of solar and wind, however, has brought challenges. Grid integration has not been able to keep place, leading to curtailment of actual power produced. The large land demands of these sources have created environmental and local political problems.\n\nAt the same time, 2024 saw construction of new coal plants at a decade high. Global Energy Monitor’s coal plant tracker shows a large number of future plants have been permitted with others under construction. Continuing rise in China’s total demand for power has meant that coal use has kept increasing even while its share decreases.\n\nThe Energy Security Issue Is Crucial But Has More Than One Answer\n\nIn his speech, the UN chief tells us there are “no price spikes for sunlight” and “no embargoes on wind.” However true, it is not nature but the technologies that harness it and the critical minerals they need which matter. And these have had their role in the trade “wars” between China and the European Union and U.S.\n\nThere is no realistic scenario where solar and wind become the simple solution to the entangling economic and geopolitical challenges regarding energy security. Concerns today over import dependency do not vanish just because a foreign energy technology is cheap; indeed, they increase. We’ve seen this repeatedly directed at Chinese exports of solar and wind technology.\n\nThis brings up another truth. When it comes to security, countries tend to favor their own natural resources. These include sun, wind, and flowing water but also coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium. China is hardly the only country that has a coal culture. So do many of the world’s most rapidly developing nations, like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Turkey.\n\nReality Checks About Global Energy Are Often Needed\n\nThese are only a few reality checks that readily present themselves. They assure us that global energy trends are complex and evolving. They are complex, moreover, for reasons that go well beyond costs. Fossil fuels still run the greater part of the world and will not run out of road soon.\n\n(COMBO) This combination of pictures created on February 21, 2020 shows US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at a Keep America Great rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 19, 2020.

This is happening in an era of fractured international order and trade disruption, enhanced by the Trump Administration’s weaponized use of tariffs in foreign policy. There is every sign, in other words, that global realities will continue to resist simple solutions well into the future.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"UN Chief tells world new age of clean energy is now here, fossil fuels at a dead end.

The thinktank said Medvedev was subsequently being portrayed as having a “different assessment” from Putin on nuclear issues. An ISW assessment said: “The Kremlin regularly uses Medvedev to introduce nuclear threats into the Russian and international information spaces.” Medvedev, a high-ranked official who was once prime minister of Russia, as well as a proxy for Putin in the presidency, accused Trump of taking “a step towards war” by tightening an ultimatum for Russia to seek peace. Trump in response said he had moved two nuclear submarines into position “just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that”.\n\nThe ISW further assessed that “Kremlin officials utilised three main framings to respond to Trump’s decision to redeploy the submarines: posing Trump’s decision to redeploy the submarines as “emotional,” discounting the threat that this decision poses to Russia, and posturing Russia as a more responsible international actor than the United States … These official Russian responses ignore the Kremlin’s history of frequently using nuclear saber-rattling to push the west to make decisions that benefit Russia.\n\nOn the battlefield, the ISW said that Ukrainian forces had recently advanced near Pokrovsk, which Russian forces have been trying to capture since at least July 2024. Russian forces recently advanced near Kupyansk, Siversk, Toretsk, and Velykomykhailivka, the institute said. Russian claimed on Tuesday to have captured the village of Sichneve in east-central Dnipropetrovsk region. The Reuters news agency, which carried the claim, said it could not independently confirm it.\n\nDonald Trump has said he will make a decision on whether to sanction countries that purchase Russian oil after a meeting with Russian officials scheduled for Wednesday. That is when Steve Witkoff – real estate promoter, friend of Trump and officially his Russia envoy – is due to meet with Russian leadership in Moscow. A Bloomberg report suggested that Putin might agree to a ceasefire in terms of airstrike but not on the ground. Also on Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that Trump’s administration is considering additional sanctions on Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers that illicitly move Russian oil.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said on Tuesday he’d had a “productive” conversation with Trump about ending the war, sanctions on Russia and the finalisation of a US-Ukraine drone deal. Ukraine, he said, had long supported US proposals for an immediate ceasefire and had proposed a number of formats to implement a halt to the fighting. “We have spoken with and proposed to Russia quiet in the skies, no missile and drone attacks and specifically no attacks on civilian infrastructure or on the energy sector.

With Eye On China","text":"As the United States ramps up tariffs on major trading partners globally, President Donald Trump is also disrupting strategies that could be used -- by Chinese companies or others -- to circumvent them.Goods deemed to be \"transshipped,\" or sent through a third country with lower export levies, will face an additional 40-percent duty under an incoming wave of Trump tariffs Thursday.The latest tranche of \"reciprocal\" tariff hikes, taking aim at what Washington deems unfair trade practices, impacts dozens of economies from Taiwan to India.The transshipment rule does not name countries, but is expected to impact China significantly given its position as a manufacturing powerhouse.Washington likely wants to develop supply chains that are less reliant on China, analysts say, as tensions simmer between the world's two biggest economies and the US sounds the alarm on Beijing's excess industrial capacity.But \"it's a little more about the short-term effect of strengthening the tariff regime than it is about a decoupling strategy,\" said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council.\"The point is to make countries worried about it and then have them err on the side of not doing it, because they know that Trump could then jack up the tariff rates higher again,\" he added, referring to tariff evasion.The possibility of a sharply higher duty is a \"perpetual stick in the negotiations\" with countries, said Richard Stern, a tax and budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation.He told AFP that expanding penalties across the globe takes the focus away from Beijing alone.Experts have noted that Vietnam was the biggest winner from supply chain diversions from China since the first Trump tariffs around 2018, when Washington and Beijing engaged in a trade war.And Brookings Institution senior fellow Robin Brooks pointed to signs this year of significant transshipments of Chinese goods.He noted in a June report that Chinese exports to certain Southeast Asian countries started surging \"anomalously\" in early 2025 as Trump threatened widespread levies.While it is unclear if all these products end up in the United States, Brooks cast doubt on the likelihood that domestic demand in countries like Thailand and Vietnam rocketed right when Trump imposed duties.\"One purpose of the transshipment provisions is to force the development of supply chains that exclude Chinese inputs,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"The other purpose is to push back on Chinese overcapacity and force them to eat their own surpluses,\" he added.But Washington's success in the latter goal depends on its ability to get other countries on board.\"The transshipment penalties are designed to encourage that,\" Reinsch said.Lipsky added: \"The strategy that worked in the first Trump term, to try to offshore some Chinese manufacturing to other countries like Vietnam and Mexico, is going to be a much more difficult strategy to execute now.\"Lipsky noted that Beijing could see the transshipment clause as one targeting China on trade, \"because it is.\"\"The question is, how China takes that in the broader context of what had been a thawing relationship between the US and China over the past two months,\" he added.While both countries temporarily lowered

agreement permit US military intervention? Tuesday’s mañanera recapped","text":"The presentation of a new government plan for state-owned oil company Pemex took up a significant portion of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s Tuesday morning press conference.\n\nSheinbaum declined to respond to some questions about issues not related to Pemex, but did speak about a new Mexico-United States security agreement that is expected to be signed soon.\n\nMexico-US security agreement is ready, says Sheinbaum \n\nSheinbaum said that a new security agreement between Mexico and the United States is “ready,” but won’t be signed this week.\n\nShe said that she would present the new agreement at a future press conference in order to be “very transparent.”\n\nIn late 2021, during the governments of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico and Joe Biden in the United States, the two countries entered into the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities, which superseded the Mérida Initiative.\n\nLast Thursday, Sheinbaum said that she believed that the new bilateral security agreement would be signed this week.\n\nHowever, she claimed on Tuesday that her remarks were misunderstood and that she didn’t say that at all.\n\n“… The wording [of the agreement] is practically finished, [but] it still hasn’t been decided when it will be signed,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nShe said that the agreement is governed by four key principles.\n\nRespect for sovereignty.\nRespect for each other’s territory.\nMutual trust.\nCollaboration and cooperation between Mexico and the United States “within that framework.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been pressuring Mexico — including through the threat of tariffs — to do more to combat drug cartels in Mexico and stop the trafficking of narcotics to the United States, especially fentanyl.\n\nA violent start to the week \n\nA reporter asked the president whether recent acts of violence such as the murder of a prosecutor in Tamaulipas and the murder of a union leader in Quintana Roo as well as the discovery of dismembered bodies in Veracruz and the discovery of 32 bodies in a clandestine grave in Irapuato, Guanajuato, could be “used” by the United States in negotiations over the security agreement.\n\n“There is an agreement of collaboration and cooperation,” Sheinbaum said, apparently reiterating that the pact has already been drawn up.\n\n“… We’re a sovereign country, we make decisions as a sovereign country,” she added.\n\n“And with the United States, we collaborate and cooperate and that collaboration and cooperation is very important, but with [respect for each other’s] sovereignty,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nPushed as to whether acts of violence in Mexico could “raise the price of the negotiation” with the United States, “so to speak,” the president effectively brushed off the question, only responding, “Why?”\n\nA US military intervention in Mexico is ‘not on the table,’ says Sheinbaum\n\nAfter Sheinbaum’s aforesaid response, a different reporter abruptly asked the president about the possibility of a U.S. military intervention against criminal groups in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum reminded the press corps that she had previously rejected an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to send the United States army into Mexico.\n\n“They can insist again, but that issue is not on the table,” she said.\n\n“… There are other ways of collaborating and coordinating with each other. There is information they can provide us, information we can provide them in a scheme of collaboration without subordination and respecting our sovereignty,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"On Tuesday, the president spoke about a new Mexico-United States security agreement that is expected to be signed soon.\n\n\nThe post Will the new bilateral security agreement permit US military intervention?

\n\nLipsky noted that Beijing could see the transshipment clause as one targeting China on trade, \"because it is.\"\n\n\"The question is, how China takes that in the broader context of what had been a thawing relationship between the US and China over the past two months,\" he added.\n\nWhile both countries temporarily lowered triple-digit tariffs on each other's exports, that truce expires August 12.\n\nThe countries are in talks to potentially extend the de-escalation, although the final decision lies with Trump.\n\nIt will be tough to draw a line defining product origins, analysts say.\n\nCustoms fraud has been illegal for some time, but it remains unclear how Washington will view materials from China or elsewhere that have been significantly transformed.\n\nThe burden lies with customs authorities to identify transshipment and assess the increased duties.\n\n\"That will be difficult, particularly in countries that have close relations with China and no particular incentive to help US Customs and Border Protection,\" Reinsch added.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"As the United States ramps up tariffs on major trading partners globally, President Donald Trump is also disrupting strategies that could be used -- by Chinese companies or others -- to circumvent them.","url":"https://yen.com.gh/business-economy/288648-trump-targets-tariff-evasion-eye-china/","image":"https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/a49065ed23553f57.jpeg?v=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 01:07:04","author":"Samuel Obour","authors":["Samuel Obour"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.022},{"id":348509262,"title":"Maybe it's time to extend the natural-born citizenship requirement to all federal positions, says Rachel Campos-Duffy","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nJesse Watters Primetime August 05, 2025 04:30 \n\n Maybe it's time to extend the natural-born citizenship requirement to all federal positions, says Rachel Campos-Duffy \n Fox News host Rachel Campos Duff discusses President Donald Trump's efforts to put an end to birthright citizenship and an Illinois Democrat Delia Ramirez's claim of being 'Guatemala first' on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRV-VIDEOJESSE WATTERS PRIMETIMEHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DEMOCRATSHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESPOLITICS","summary":"Fox News host Rachel Campos Duff discusses President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to put an end to birthright citizenship and an Illinois Democrat Delia Ramirez&apos;s claim of being &apos;Guatemala first&apos; on &apos;Jesse Watters Primetime.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376599485112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/5bc832db-9402-4eb8-953b-1a9c737feb4b/17e48ef1-2d35-4aef-8206-6a5aad9070cd/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 01:06:29","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":348505452,"title":"‘Erratic And Vindictive’: Victor Davis Hanson Says Jerome Powell Reminds Him Of Another Powerful Federal Official","text":"Victor Davis Hanson said on Fox Business Tuesday that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is showing the “same symptoms” as former Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nAmid pressure from Trump, Powell has reportedly told trusted colleagues that he intends to finish his tenure, which concludes in May 2026. During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Hanson said that Powell has shown signs of personal sensitivity and agitation while responding to public criticism, especially from President Donald Trump.\n\n“I think he’s very sensitive. He’s kind of like Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland was broken by the Republicans when they delayed his Supreme Court nomination into nothing, and he never forgave them. And he was sort of an erratic and vindictive attorney general, and Powell is starting to show the same symptoms as Garland,” Hanson told host Larry Kudlow.\n\nGarland was then-President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in 2016. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would not consider Garland to replace deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans said the next president should make the nomination, allowing the American people to influence the Supreme Court’s future.\n\nHanson said Powell lacks Trump’s negotiation skills, particularly when it comes to dealing with criticism. (RELATED: Trump Says Scott Bessent Won’t Be Fed Chair Pick As ‘He Does Not Want It’)\n\n“Well, he doesn’t understand the art of the deal, the way Trump negotiates. So when Trump calls him ‘too late pal’ or he uses ad hominem, he takes personal offense at that, and that’s understandable,” Hanson said. “But he’s got a responsibility to 340 million Americans, maybe 100 million of them are paying mortgages, and that’s a make-or-break deal for them when they’re paying seven and above on a 30-year mortgage.”\n\nHanson advised Powell to focus on his responsibilities and rise above personal sensitivities to better serve the American people.\n\nTrump has criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates during his presidency and has called for his resignation due to the Fed’s reluctance to make cuts. Additionally, Trump’s allies have suggested the possibility of appointing a “shadow Fed chair” before Powell’s term concludes, according to Axios.\n\nDespite his criticisms, Trump said on “Finnerty” that he would likely avoid removing Powell from his position, as it could cause instability in the market.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Hopefully the owners can be contacted if she has a chip,' a second added.\n'On a day out with her coat on. Looks like he having a good time. I hope they find her owner,' a third said.\nMany Aussies were left wondering what the dog was doing.\n'How on earth did she pull it off,' one asked. \n'Where was she trying to go,' wondered another.\n'Where is her owner,' a third added.\nAnyone who recognises her or has information is urged to contact the Sydney Dogs and Cats Home.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDog catches the bus to a Sydney train station - as search begins for her owner\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Kennedy Jr., marks his latest effort to weave vaccine skepticism into the core of US government policy.\"We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,\" Kennedy said in a statement.The health department's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is \"terminating 22 mRNA vaccine development investments because the data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu,\" he added.\"We're shifting that funding toward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"The changes affect Moderna's mRNA bird flu vaccine -- a move the company itself disclosed in May -- as well as numerous other programs, including \"rejection or cancellation of multiple pre-award solicitations\" from pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Sanofi.In total, the affected projects are worth \"nearly $500 million,\" the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said. Certain late-stage projects were excluded from the move \"to preserve prior taxpayer investment.\"\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" Secretary Kennedy said.\"That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA and investing in better solutions.\"Since taking office, Kennedy, who spent two decades sowing misinformation around immunization, has overseen a major overhaul of US health policy -- firing, for example, a panel of vaccine experts that advise the government and replacing them with his own appointees.In its first meeting, the new panel promptly voted to ban a longstanding vaccine preservative targeted by the anti-vaccine movement, despite its strong safety record.He has also ordered a sweeping new study on the long-debunked link between vaccines and autism.Unlike traditional vaccines, which often use weakened or inactivated forms of the target virus or bacteria, mRNA shots deliver genetic instructions into the host's cells, prompting them to produce a harmless decoy of the pathogen and train the immune system to fight the real thing.Though in development for decades, mRNA vaccines were propelled from lab benches to widespread use through President Trump's Operation Warp Speed -- a public-private partnership led by BARDA that poured billions into companies to accelerate development.The technology's pioneers, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, were awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work contributing \"to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday announced it would terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, questioning the safety of a technology credited with helping end the Covid pandemic and saving millions of lives.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-axes-mrna-vaccine-contracts-casting-safety-doubts-3780278","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4614737/us-secretary-health-human-services-robert-f-kennedy-jr-has-overseen-major-overhaul-us-health.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=beacad33f5c80f99d491ed81127ecacc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:57:17","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.066},{"id":348504472,"title":"Mariah Carey's astronomical hotel fee REVEALED as R&B diva stays at lavish London Corinthia following her performance at Brighton Pride","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Harry QUITS his charity as damning report into 'war of words' boardroom row rejects racism claim\n\nComatose woman woke up moments before organ harvesting surgery... but pushy donor boss 'told doctors to operate anyway'\n\nRevealed: Hilarious occupation listed on Ozzy Osbourne's death certificate as Black Sabbath frontman's cause of death is confirmed\n\nI can see straight through Rochelle Humes' slap-in-the-face swipe at Myleene Klass after her cheating confession.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:50 BST, 6 August 2025 |Updated:01:55 BST, 6 August 2025 \n\nMariah Carey is reportedly paying over £250,000 for her hotel stay during her time in the UK. \nThe hitmaker, 56, headlined Brighton Pride over the weekend after arriving on her private jet earlier in the week. \nAnd now The Sun has revealed she is staying at one of the top-floor suites at the Corinthia hotel on London's Embankment.\nFeaturing a large terrace, wine cellar, private spa and living room lit with a real fire, the room costs around £20,000 per night. \nA source told the publication: 'She blocked out two weeks in the best suite. It's only the best for Mariah.\n'Her royal gig is a huge deal, so naturally she is living like a queen.'\n\nMariah Carey is reportedly paying over £250,000 for her hotel stay during her time in the UK capital following her performance at Brighton Pride last weekend (pictured) \n\nFeaturing a large terrace, wine cellar, private spa and living room lit with a real fire, the room costs around £20,000 per night (the Corinthia pictured) \nDaily Mail have contacted Mariah's representatives for comment. \nAfter performing in Brighton last weekend, Mariah is taking to the stage at Sandringham's royal estate as part of the Heritage Live’s large outdoor music concerts on August 15. \nAnd it seems Mariah is one of the Corinthia's best guests after Beyoncé reportedly 'bowed down' to the singer in June and 'packed up her £25k-a-night London penthouse for the diva songstress to move in.'\nThe Single Ladies singer, 43, had booked a 12-night stay at the Corinthia while performing at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \nBut she allegedly moved out at the weekend when self-confessed diva Mariah touched down to play at Capital's Summertime Ball on Sunday. \nA source told The Sun: 'Superstars as big as Beyonce and Mariah want to stay in only the best hotels.\n'Beyonce had been staying in Corinthia’s penthouses.\n'But when Mariah flew in, Beyonce packed up so Mariah could take over her suites. It was like Beyonce was bowing down to another music queen.'\nMeanwhile last weekend Mariah wowed fans as she took to the stage for her much-anticipated headline slot at Brighton Pride.\n\nA source revealed: 'She blocked out two weeks in the best suite. It's only the best for Mariah. Her royal gig is a huge deal, so naturally she is living like a queen'\n\nThe suite also features a private spa \n\nBeyoncé reportedly 'bowed down' to the singer in June and 'packed up her £25k-a-night London penthouse for the diva songstress to move in' at the Corinthia \n\n Mariah Carey puts on a leggy display in FOUR figure-hugging outfits while headling Brighton Pride \nThe singing superstar put on a leggy display in four figure-hugging outfits as she performed for an impressive two hours. \nMariah glittered in a silver gradient dress that she paired with a diamanté pink jacket and silver boots before changing into a blue and turquoise number that kept her legs on full display. \nHer packed setlist included hits like Vision of Love and Heroes as she gave the long-awaited performance that was initially scheduled for 2020, but was cancelled because of the Covid pandemic. \nShe later wrote on Instagram: 'Thank you so much Brighton Pride for having me tonight! A special heartfelt thank you to the LGBTQ+ community for your ongoing support. \n'I will always be there for you. Love, MC.'\nShe took the opportunity to show her support for the trans community by embellishing her pink jacket with the phrase 'Protect the dolls'. \nElsewhere in the performance, Mariah stunned in a more loosely fitted gold dress and thigh-high boots. \nShe also changed into a longer black dress and open-toed glittery high heels for a more upmarket, glamorous look. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMariah Carey's astronomical hotel fee REVEALED as R&B diva stays at lavish London Corinthia following her performance at Brighton Pride\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

He'll be relocating immediately to the existing home, and we're going to be doing new construction, adding between 2,500 and 3,500 square feet.\n'We're creating functional spaces that could be used as a recording studio and multiple different functions.\n'So he's able to work from home when he's not on tour.'\nThere are also reportedly plans for a floating padel court, which would be the first of its kind for a US home. \nRobbie bought his new home from Real Housewives of Miami star Dr Nicole Martin and husband Anthony Lopez.\nRobbie sold his LA home last year.\nThe sale meant the British singer looked to be cutting ties with Hollywood for good after owning a place there for 18 years.\nHe purchased the huge property, which sits on 1.95 acres, in uber-rich Holmby Hills for £39.3million in March 2022. \n\nIn addition to the £30 million price tag he reportedly spent another £4 million on furniture, adjustments and building renovations to make it the perfect family home\n\nThe singer, 51, and his wife Ayda will soon be moving into the sprawling US property, according to The New York Post\nThe three-house estate featured eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, pool and tennis court, plus an impressive garage that holds 15 luxury cars, all spanning over 18,900 sq ft.\nDubbed the 'Funny Girl' Estate, the property was originally constructed in 1938 for the renowned comedian Fanny Brice. \nShe was famously played by Barbara Streisand in a Broadway musical based on her life\nThe starlet, whose life is the subject of semi-biographical musical Funny Girl, lived at the Faring Estate until she died in 1951.\nRobbie has now sold four properties in the last two years, with his only other remaining asset being his £17.5million Kensington, London home.\nAccording to documents, the new owner is Lapro Property Trust, which is a Sydney-based entity associated with Aussie billionaire Nick Molnar, who co-founded Afterpay.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Robbie Williams sells his LA mansion for £51.6m and nets himself a £12.3m profit with his fourth house sale in two years \nMolnar previously purchased Matthew Perry's Century City penthouse for £16.6M in 2021 - and sold it to Rihanna two years later.\nRobbie seems in a big hurry to get rid of his properties. In 2022 he even revealed he had nowhere to live after selling his home in Wiltshire and his previous Los Angeles property.\nHe sold a ten bedroom, twenty-two bathroom LA mansion to Drake in a private $35-$50 million deal for the ten bedroom, twenty-two bathroom mansion.\nThe 2022 sale came two months after Robbie found a buyer for his Wiltshire home in a deal worth £6.75million.\nSpeaking to Australian radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, Robbie said at the time: 'We're actually nowhere.'\n'We haven't got an abode right now, we've pretty much sold everywhere, we don't live anywhere and we're trying to figure it out.'\nRobbie and his wife Ayda, 46, share four children, Teddy, 11, son Charlie, nine, daughter Coco, five and three-year-old son Beau.\nRobbie previously said that his kids are a massive factor in deciding where to live because they need to be placed in suitable schools.\nHe explained: 'The four kids are constantly a Rubix Cube puzzle that we're trying to sort out because if they are schooled then they don't see me because I'm all over the place and if they are home-schooled then they have another set of things that are a problem.'\n\nRobbie and Ayda share four children, Teddy, 11, son Charlie, nine, daughter Coco, five and three-year-old son Beau\nSpeaking in 2014, Robbie - then a father of two - admitted he was keen to make the United Kingdom his permanent base after spending an extended period of time in the United States.\nHe told The Sun: 'I love LA. The people and the weather are great but it's not England. It can't offer the same. Things change when you're a dad - there are people to look after who are more important than yourself.\n'I want [daughter] Teddy and the new baby, whatever it may be, to be educated in England. Teddy is already surrounded by English people so she's bound to have an accent anyway.\n'But that's not the point - we want to educate her in London. We've just bought a ruddy big house so we had better be coming back!'\nRobbie Williams\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRobbie Williams 'splashes out on £30MILLION waterfront mansion in Miami which boasts seven bedrooms, an 18-car garage, wine cellar and its own dock'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

This is a new Democratic Party,” Martin said. “We’re bringing a knife to a knife fight, and we are gonna fight fire with fire.”\n\nMartin acknowledged it’s an about-face from Democrats’ usual high road of speaking out against and trying to legislate around the partisan manipulation of congressional districts. But he said that as President Donald Trump and Republicans go to greater lengths to try to seize power, Democrats can’t just “roll over.”\n\n“It didn’t have to be this way,” Martin said, arguing that Texas Republicans’ moves threaten the principle of democratic representation so much that a nationwide redistricting war is “a fight worth fighting with every tool at our disposal.”\n\nDemocrats far and wide have been vocal in their support for Texas Democrats. But state leaders are increasingly throwing their support behind efforts to draw new lines that would give an advantage to their party in the House.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul of New York told reporters Monday that “the gloves are off.”\n\n“If Republicans are willing to rewrite these rules to give themselves an advantage, then they’re leaving us no choice. We must do the same,” Hochul said. “I cannot ignore that the playing field has changed dramatically, and shame on us if we ignore that fact and cling on tight to the vestiges of the past.”\n\nGov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who is seeking a third term as governor but is considered a potential presidential contender, is also among those who have embraced Democrats’ new tactic.\n\n“We’re fighting for democracy. There are no rules anymore, apparently,” Pritzker said as Democrats nodded behind him. “We’re going to have to play by the set of rules that are being set out in front of us, which frankly, none of us believes is the right way to operate.”\n\nNational Democrats have been called on by their base to do more to resist Trump. Instead of deferring to their lack of power, they’re nationalizing their Texas counterparts’ battle, egging on a war where most partisan sparring will happen at the state level.\n\nAnd when it comes to retaliatory gerrymandering, Democratic state leaders are more than happy to answer that call.\n\nSpecific plans to pad Democratic margins in response to Texas Republicans’ moves are gaining support in California, as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gone full speed ahead embracing the strategy in his state. He has argued that the “moral high ground means nothing if we’re powerless because of it.”\n\nRumblings about other partisan gerrymandering plans in smaller, but still Republican-led, states mean the threat to Democratic House districts won’t end there.\n\nDemocrats adopting a total-war approach to manipulating imaginary lines are scaring some Republicans who represent congressional swing districts, or districts that could become more competitive if their boundaries get shaken up. Two so far have said they will introduce legislation to halt all mid-decade redistricting.\n\nWhile talking big about their plans, Democrats are offering a subtle olive branch — reiterating that they feel Republicans’ maneuvers have finally forced their hands.\n\n“Now is not the time for one party to play by the rules while one party has completely ignored them. They’ve decided to cheat, and we’re gonna respond in kind,” Martin said. “None of us wanted to be here.”\n\nThis story was produced as part of a partnership between NOTUS — a publication from the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute — and NEWSWELL, home of Times of San Diego, Santa Barbara News-Press and Stocktonia.","summary":"Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin urged members of his party to forget their usual rulebook and go all in on partisan redistricting Tuesday.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/08/05/democrats-go-all-in-on-partisan-redistricting-including-in-california/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Newsom-Budget.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:43:05","author":"Emily Kennard • NOTUS","authors":["Emily Kennard • NOTUS"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":348510560,"title":"Trump declines to say if he supports or opposes potential Gaza takeover by Israel","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump declined to say whether he supported or opposed a potential military takeover of Gaza by Israel and said his administration's focus was on increasing food access to the Palestinian enclave under assault from Washington's ally.\n\n\"I know that we are there now trying to get people fed,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"As far as the rest of it, I really can't say.

In the guidance, the SEC emphasized the importance of providing certain disclosures.\n\nSeveral market observers lauded the move, predicting that it could bring about a notable increase in applications for such products.\n\nThis was only the beginning of the activity that took place during the month, as several crypto experts testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on July 9.\n\nSummer Mersinger, the CEO of nonprofit industry group the Blockchain Association, Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Timothy Massad, who previously headed the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, were all in attendance.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives took decisive action to help establish a more mature regulatory framework for digital currencies by voting in favor of three separate pieces of legislation, including the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, known as the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has already signed the GENIUS Act, which provides regulatory clarity for stablecoins, into law, while the Senate is expected to consider the other two bills over the coming months.\n\nThe CLARITY Act in particular would help flesh out the exact jurisdiction that the SEC and CFTC have over the crypto space, which would make things easier for industry participants.\n\nIn addition, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce made some overtures to the broader crypto space when she invited industry participants interested in tokenization to meet with both the government agency and its staff.\n\nThis move presents a contrast to the approach of regulation by enforcement that the SEC took while former Chair Gary Gensler was heading up the government agency.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Ether’s price volatility declined in July, falling to its lowest since November 2024, according to various measures of these fluctuations.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/05/ether-price-volatility-fell-to-lowest-since-november-in-july/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6892a49cfcfcbc2c4c3935f0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:41:52","author":"Charles Lloyd Bovaird II,Senior Contributor","authors":["Charles Lloyd Bovaird II","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.038},{"id":348503422,"title":"Locals' fury over plans to build huge solar farm on idyllic countryside made famous by The Vicar of Dibley","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Harry QUITS his charity as damning report into 'war of words' boardroom row rejects racism claim\n\nComatose woman woke up moments before organ harvesting surgery... but pushy donor boss 'told doctors to operate anyway'\n\nRevealed: Hilarious occupation listed on Ozzy Osbourne's death certificate as Black Sabbath frontman's cause of death is confirmed\n\nI can see straight through Rochelle Humes' slap-in-the-face swipe at Myleene Klass after her cheating confession.

Email: olivia.christie@mailonline.co.uk \nBy OLIVIA CHRISTIE, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:01:28 BST, 6 August 2025 |Updated:01:39 BST, 6 August 2025 \n\nPlans to build an industrial-sized solar farm on countryside made famous by The Vicar of Dibley have sparked fury among locals, who claim it will ruin the 'quintessentially English view'. \nThe row centres on a 97-hectre solar project which is planned for fields in Oxfordshire that feature in the opening credits of the iconic 1990s BBC sitcom starring Dawn French. \nThe landscape, made up of patchwork fields, farmland and small villages, is also loved by the thousands of commuters who travel up and down the M40 to London. \nThe proposed site is located next to Postcombe, near Thame - a village made up of just 120 houses, a garage and a pub - and can be seen from the motorway. \nLocals have described the potential impact of the solar farm, which would consist of large panels mounted nearly 10ft off the ground, as 'devastating' and 'frightening'.\nThey have also raised concerns that the Labour government's drive towards Net Zero emissions will mean the plans are pushed through regardless of their objections. \nThere are currently several plans for large solar farms in the pipeline for approval across the UK. \nThese include the enormous £800million Botley West project in Oxfordshire, which is set to spread across the Blenheim Estate where Sir Winston Churchill was born.\nLocal Bob Massie, who lives in Postcombe and used to work in video production, said the plans for the solar farm are 'frightening'. \n\nPlans to build an industrial-sized solar farm on countryside made famous by The Vicar of Dibley have sparked fury among locals. Pictured: The view which was featured on the show \n\nPostcombe resident and parish councillor John Poole (pictured) has raised concerns about the proposals\n\nThe landscape, made up of patchwork fields, farmland and small villages, is also loved by the thousands of commuters who travel up and down the M40 to London \nHe told the Daily Mail: 'It is a fantastic view. It is one of only 12 such views protected in the country nationally.\n'The solar farm would be just be truly devastating. It's quite frightening, really.\n'Ultimately the view is so beautiful that Richard Curtis chose it as the opening title to The Vicar of Dibley.\n'He chose that view because it was quintessentially English, and it was. It was showing a quintessentially English view with fields and villages.'\nHe added: 'I see this view as like the Sycamore Gap tree. I would say this is another national treasure and once it has gone, it has gone forever. \n'There is no getting it back.' \nMr Massie also raised concerns about the type of solar panels that would be used for the site.\nHe said: 'These are not just the sort of solar panels that you might put on your roof. They are enormous. The whole site is enormous. \n'People think of solar panels as being the things that you put on on domestic roofs. These are whacking great industrial solar panels, and it is a vast area.' \n\nLocals have described the potential impact of the solar farm, which would consist of large panels mounted nearly 10ft off the ground, as 'devastating' and 'frightening'\n\nPictured: Dawn French in the BBC sitcom The Vicar of Dibley \n\nPictured: The fields which have been proposed to be used for the solar farm \n\nPictured: The view of the proposed solar farm from the M40 \n\n Solar farm plan for near sacred pilgrimage route is savaged by locals \nThe plans for the solar farm have been developed by private company Solar2 and are currently being considered by South Oxfordshire District Council. \nLocals have until the end of the month to lodge their objections - but some fear the plans will be pushed through anyway. \nPostcombe resident and parish councillor John Poole said: 'We're trying to raise the awareness within the villages and encourage people to have their say on the planning portal. \n'We think it is unlikely that South Oxfordshire District Council will support the application because of the national landscape and the protections in place. \n'However, it is approved and it goes to appeal it could be down to Ed Miliband saying oh well we have a climate emergency and we need Net Zero.' \nMr Massie also raised concerns about whether the application would be pushed through. \nHe said: 'This is not just any view. It is a recognised area of outstanding natural beauty. It's also protected locally by the planning plans and policies.\n'I think maybe in the late eighties or something they tried to put a service station in that same sort of area. \n'That was thrown out because it was going to spoil the view. There's lots of protections on it. \n\nPictured: A screen grab of the view in Oxfordshire taken from the credits of The Vicar of Dibley\n\nOne of the fields where the solar farm has been proposed to be built near Postcombe \n\nPictured: The route of funeral way that is used to carry coffins between the two villages \n\nPictured: A screen grab of the view, featuring small villages, taken from the credits of The Vicar of Dibley\n\n Campaigners call on King Charles to help them stop Britain's biggest solar farm - a £800m project \n'I'm hoping that with all these policies protecting it, that will ultimately prevail but you never know with these things. \n'Planning regulations under the new the Labour government are apparently going to be simplified and perhaps development that wasn't going to be allowed will be.' \nLocals have also raised concerns that plans for the site include temporarily blocking a funeral path used to transport coffins from Postcombe to the nearby village of Lewknor. \nFootpaths in the area close to the proposed site are also used and loved by families and dog walkers.\nMr Poole said: 'The solar farm is going to be in fields that have the local footpath that connects Postcombe to Lewknor. \n'It's used by a lot of villagers to go between the villages and is a place where people walk their dogs. \n'So from our point of view it does impact our daily lives. It's our views, it's our walks.\n'When you look over the fields and towards the village all you are going to see is glaring solar panels.' \nHe explained that people in Postcombe are not against renewable energy but are simply opposed to the location of the proposed solar farm. \nMr Poole said: 'Practically all the villages here are against the solar farm being built but we are not against renewable energy.\n'People in the villages have solar panels on their houses, or they've got electric cars, or both. \n'And as a parish, we're just putting solar panels onto our village hall. \n'What we don't want is a solar farm thrown upon us that's generating electricity, which is going to be sent to the National Grid or somewhere that doesn't benefit us.' \nThe Daily Mail has contacted Solar2 for comment. \nLondonLabourRichard CurtisDawn FrenchBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLocals' fury over plans to build huge solar farm on idyllic countryside made famous by The Vicar of Dibley\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Why Budweiser could be the buzzkill.","text":"That analyst, TD Cowen’s Robert Moskow, said Constellation could sell more beer in more parts of the country — something it’s already trying to do. The only problem, he said, was that AB InBev \n\n“Our analysis indicates that Constellation has a path to offset economic pressure on its base of Hispanic consumers by continuing to expand beer distribution (especially in lower Hispanic-index markets) and extending into more pack sizes and price points,” Moskow said in a research note on Tuesday.\n\n“However, with market leader [AB InBev]’s investments in the U.S. market gaining traction, we foresee a tougher fight for shelf space ahead,” he continued.\n\nHispanic consumers make up around half of Constellation’s beer business. Amid President Donald Trump’s sweeping deportation efforts, advocacy groups have accused the U.S. government and the agents carrying out arrests of racial profiling, particularly in southern California, where protests over the raids took place in Los Angeles and elsewhere. The government has denied those allegations, telling NPR, in a story last month, that “officers do their due diligence.”\n\nDuring Constellation’s investor day in 2023, the company said it wanted to make its beer available in 500,000 new distribution points for its main brands over five years. In January this year, management said it had “secured more than half” of those locations. Moskow, in Tuesday’s note, said much of that growth, so far, appeared to come from the Midwest, helped in no small part by Modelo Especial.\n\nHe said that in the next phase of that distribution expansion would likely rely more on Pacifico, and that the company would likely try to sell more beer where the Hispanic population is lower. \n\n“Geographically, we expect most of the gains to come from the general market in the Midwest, Southeast, and South where the Hispanic population index is lower,” Moskow said. “In addition, we expect them to introduce a wider array of pack sizes to help distributors expand Modelo’s retail footprint.”\n\nHe noted, however, that after the 2023 Bud Light boycott, Anheuser-Busch InBev has staged something of a rebound this year, following investments in marketing and faster-growing beers. Its market share has ticked higher, with big gains in parts of the Midwest and South — the same areas where Constellation would need to grow.\n\n“If ABI’s success in these markets continues, Constellation may need to capture shelf space from different competitors (e.g., Molson Coors) or states (e.g., Florida and Illinois) to reach its targets,” Moskow said. \n\nAnalysts have said that beer demand has suffered as some younger and more health-conscious consumers stay away from alcohol. Molson Coors Beverage Co. \n\nHowever, shares of Molson rose 1.3% on Tuesday, as Chief Executive Gavin Hattersley suggested the current industry malaise wouldn’t last.\n\n“Drinking-age consumers continue to engage with beer at similar levels across all generations, and compared to historical levels,” Hattersley said. “It’s the occasions that are left.”\n\nShares of Constellation were up 0.2% on Tuesday. The stock is down 22.2% on the year.","summary":"ICE raids have hurt beer demand for Corona’s parent company.

That's an 11-point advantage, the widest any American politician earned. \n\nIn second place was Democratic socialist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, even though her approval rating is underwater. She garnered a 34 percent favorable rating, compared to 38 percent who view her unfavorably. \n\nTwenty eight percent of poll respondents had no opinion of the Congresswoman, revealing she's a blank slate to a significant number of Americans. \n\nHer 4-point deficit was the lowest of any American politician earned, outside Sanders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Vice President JD Vance was seen as more favorable than the president himself. But Vance Thirty-eight percent of respondents viewed Vance positively, and 49 percent viewed him negatively.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., left, greets Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as they speak during a stop of their \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour at Civic Center Park, March 21, 2025, in Denver\n\nTrump, on the other hand, was viewed positively by 41 percent of survey respondents and negatively by 57 percent. \n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a Trump cabinet member and former independent candidate in the 2024 race, had the support of 42 percent of poll respondents last month, while 47 percent viewed him unfavorably in July. \n\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services was the most popular figure in Trump's circle, with only a five percent negative net rating.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 7 to July 21.\n\nThe unspoken truth about Trump's inner circle and Melania's unparalleled control\n\nGallup found the Pope to have a 57 percent favorable rating and an 11 percent unfavorable rating, giving the religious leader the highest favorable score.\n\nZelensky’s second-place ranking was driven by a 52 percent favorable response and a 34 percent unfavorable response.\n\nFormer Trump ally and Tesla CEO Elon Musk was the least liked newsmaking figure, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ranking just above him. Musk’s numbers were deeply negative: only 39 percent of those polled found the tech CEO likable, while nearly twice as many expressed an unfavorable view. \n\nThis may explain why he has distanced himself from politics in recent weeks.\n\nMusk’s ratings have dropped sharply since an earlier Gallup poll in January, where he had a 24 percent favorability.\n\nTwo other men in Trump’s orbit, Marco Rubio and Robert F.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance will serve as the respective chair and vice chair of the task force with a forthcoming executive director who will oversee its day-to-day operations.\n\n\"I think it's going to be amazing,\" said Trump. \"America is a nation of champions, and in July 2028 we'll show the world what America does best, and that's when we're winning like we have never won before.\"\n\nSpeaking at the press event, Casey Wasserman, chairman of the 2028 L.A. Olympics organizing committee, said the Games will attract more than 150 heads of state and will host approximately 11,000 Olympic and 4,500 Paralympic athletes in 800 competitions at 49 venues. He said the Games will be the equivalent of putting on seven Super Bowls a day for 30 days and thanked Trump for his support.\n\nIt's not clear how the task force will interface with local authorities in Los Angeles, where the city's Democratic leaders have clashed with the Trump administration over its aggressive approach to immigration and the president's deployment of National Guard troops to the city to quell violent protests.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called the Trump administration's deployment of U.S. troops to MacArthur Park \"un-American\" and supported the city's move to join a lawsuit seeking to halt immigration raids.\n\nBass said in a post on X Saturday that the city will be ready for the Olympics and will not let the Trump administration \"divide us.\"\n\nTrump took a swipe at Bass during Tuesday's press conference, saying he would use the National Guard or the military to keep the event safe.\n\n\"Because, obviously, you have a mayor that is not very competent,\" he said.\n\nTrump earlier signed an executive order intended to keep transgender athletes out of women's sports. He said there will be a \"strong form of testing\" to prevent transgender athletes from participating in the Olympics and suggested his administration may pursue charges.","summary":"President Donald Trump's new task force will coordinate federal roles for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles where leaders have clashed with him.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/05/trump-summer-olympics-los-angeles/9181754437853/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/9181754437853/2025/1/a4325e0375623b02912cc47d2496d686/v1.5/Trump-to-lead-task-force-on-28-Summer-Olympics.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:32:44","author":"Jake Thomas","authors":["Jake Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.165},{"id":348503430,"title":"Lizzo says she 'still thinks she's big' after dramatic weight loss transformation","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Harry QUITS his charity as damning report into 'war of words' boardroom row rejects racism claim\n\nComatose woman woke up moments before organ harvesting surgery... but pushy donor boss 'told doctors to operate anyway'\n\nRevealed: Hilarious occupation listed on Ozzy Osbourne's death certificate as Black Sabbath frontman's cause of death is confirmed\n\nI can see straight through Rochelle Humes' slap-in-the-face swipe at Myleene Klass after her cheating confession.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy ALESIA STANFORD, WRITER \n Published:00:53 BST, 6 August 2025 |Updated:01:32 BST, 6 August 2025 \n\nLizzo has dazzled fans with her drastic weight loss, but mentally, the hitmaker has said she isn't feeling any different.\nThe hitmaker, 37, who has admitted to having a complicated relationship with food, is working on making emotional changes to her self-perception.\n'I like how I look now. I still think I'm big. I'm still wearing plus-size clothing. I have the same rolls. I got the same belly, the same thighs — I think I'm just a smaller version,' she told Women's Health in an interview published on Monday.\nRegarding her confidence about herself, even before dropping an estimated 60 pounds, she explained, 'Body positivity has nothing to do with staying the same. \n'Body positivity is the radical act of daring to exist loudly and proudly in a society that told you you shouldn't exist.'\nLizzo, who was targeted by harsh comments as a larger person, explained: 'Me saying I love myself in 2016 was offensive to people.'\n\nLizzo recently admitted that she doesn't feel any different after her dramatic weight loss. 'I like how I look now. I still think I'm big,' she told Women's Health; Lizzo seen left in 2022 and right in 2025\n'How dare you love yourself? You are fat and Black and you're a woman, so you shouldn't love yourself,' she said of the messages sent her way. \nThe Yitty founder has referred to the change in her body as 'releasing' rather than 'losing' weight. \n\n Lizzo admits she got 'tired of living' as she opens up about the lowest point of her life \n'Let me tell you this. It's okay to release weight.' the About Damn Time artist told the publication. \n'It's okay to gain weight after you've released weight, because what you're not going to do is shame me if my body changes again and I get bigger'.\nThe Good as Hell singer has denied using Ozempic, or other weight loss drugs, but says, 'If I did all of this on Ozempic, if I did all this with surgery, I would be just as proud of myself, because this sh*t is hard.\n'Everyone who's ever been in a bigger body in this current version of society knows that this sh*t ain't easy. Existing isn't easy'.\nLizzo actually copped to trying Ozempic, briefly, but found it didn't help her. \n'Ozempic works because you eat less food, yeah? So if you eat right, it makes you feel full,' she told the Just Trish podcast in June. 'But if you can just do that on your own and get mind over matter, it's the same thing'.\n\n'I'm still wearing plus-size clothing. I have the same rolls. I got the same belly, the same thighs — I think I'm just a smaller version,' she said in the interview; seen in June 2025\n\n'If I did all of this on Ozempic, if I did all this with surgery, I would be just as proud of myself, because this sh*t is hard,' she explained; seen in May 2025\n\nLizzo recently shared a dramatic before and after post showing off her weight loss. She said 'training 3x a week' and staying in a 'calorie deficit' helped her achieve her goal\n\nLizzo was not alone in her abandonment of the costly medications which can have a price tag of more than $1,000 a month. \nA new report on behalf of 19 U.S. Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance plans found that only about one-third of patients who started taking the drugs were still taking them a year later, according to Reuters. \nIn a recent post showing her before and after Lizzo described how she did it.\n'I work my ass off, training 3x a week, daily sauna & cardio, adding animal protein back into my diet, hiring a chef who helps me meal prep and keeps track of what I put into my body in a calorie deficit, cutting out sugary Starbucks & full fat sodas & potato chips… I quit drinking for the longest… (but I'm drinking again cus I earned it!).'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLizzo says she 'still thinks she's big' after dramatic weight loss transformation\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Marcos Jr agreeing for expeditious conclusion of the negotiations of the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) between India and the Philippines for further promotion of mutual trade.\nThe two countries agreed to enhance defence cooperation with President Marcos thanking PM Modi for cooperation in the area of defence industry and export of platforms including the BrahMos. Also Read | Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus Announces General Election Will Be Held in February 2026.\nIn a veiled reference to China, the two countries expressed concern for the situation in the South China Sea particularly with regard to coercive and aggressive actions that impact on regional peace and stability, and called on relevant parties to exercise self- restraint and commit to peaceful and constructive means to resolve and manage disputes.\nPresident Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr, who is on a five-day State visit to India, arrived in the national capital on Monday. Also Read | Donald Trump Claims India Will Offer Zero Tariffs, but US Will Put Higher Tariffs in 24 Hours for Russian Oil Trade.\nThe two countries underscored that the final and binding 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea is a significant milestone and the basis for peacefully resolving disputes in accordance with international law.\nIndia and Philippines reaffirmed full respect and adherence to international law, particularly on the rights and obligations of States under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and its dispute settlement mechanisms, including on the geographic and substantive limits of maritime entitlements, the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment, as well as reaffirming the freedom of navigation and overflight, and the importance of unimpeded commerce based on the principles of international law, as reflected notably in UNCLOS.\nIn 2016, the arbitral tribunal adjudicating the Philippines' case against China in the South China Sea had ruled overwhelmingly in favour of the Philippines. Declaration on the Establishment of a Strategic Partnership between India and Philippines was issued after talks between PM Modi and President Marcos.\nThe two leaders agreed that the Strategic Partnership marks a new chapter towards realising the full potential for bilateral, regional and international cooperation between the two countries.\nThe Strategic Partnership is based on a mutual commitment to strengthen bilateral relations for the continuing peace, stability and prosperity of the two countries and the broader region, and serves as a foundation for the two countries to chart a future-oriented mutually-beneficial cooperation;\nThe India-Philippines Strategic Partnership is guided by the Plan of Action (2025-2029) adopted by the two countries on August 5, 2025.\nIndia and Philippines also agreed to cooperate closely in multilateral and regional forums, including in the United Nations and its specialized agencies, on global issues of mutual concern and interest, such as rule of law in the global commons, counter-terrorism, climate change and sustainable development. Actively supporting the reform and expansion of the United Nations Security Council, both in permanent and non-permanent categories of membership, through text-based negotiations;\nReaffirming shared commitment to free, open, transparent and rules-based trading system, both countries underscored the need to work together under bilateral, regional, and multilateral platforms to strengthen supply chains, promote trade facilitation, and ensure that trade contributes to their economic development.\nIn his opening remarks during the bilateral meeting, PM Narendra Modi said \"it is a historic day for our bilateral relations\". \"We are taking India to the levels of a strategic partnership. This will give our relationship a new speed and depth, and give strength to our relationship in the Defence and Security Sector. In the last few years, there has been progress in our relations in all sectors- trade, defence, maritime, health, security, food security, development partnership, and people-to-people ties. It is a matter of great happiness that we are setting a plan of action for the next five years. Till July 2027, the Philippines is India's country coordinator. In 2026, you will preside over the ASEAN Chair,\" he said The two countries exchanged MoUs in a range of areas including cooperation in peaceful use of outer space and use of digital technologies. At a special media briefing, P Kumaran, Secretary (East) said there was a discussion on defence cooperation.\n\"President Marcos thanked the Prime Minister for cooperation in the area of defence industry, the export of defence platforms to India, including the BrahMos. He also called for greater cooperation in the area of the defence industry... As part of our broader defence cooperation, we were talking about capacity building, joint exercises, joint cooperative maritime activities, exchange of training programs between our officials and all standard elements that we talk about when it comes to defence cooperation... We talk about more opportunities for India to export our defence platforms. I think we have indeed exported a number of defence hardware platforms to many, many countries. The Philippines certainly showed interest in working with us to explore opportunities for more defence platforms,\" he said. \"We're also talking about ship visits, cooperation as part of multilateral formats... We are also talking about enhanced cooperation between our coast guards. So basically aimed at sharing best practices, enhancing maritime domain awareness on both sides, talking about enhancing interoperability, working together to enhance our disaster response readiness in the coming years and so on... We highlighted our capabilities in space and the cost-effectiveness of our space program. President Marcos said he had indeed studied how cost-effective our space program is and they wanted to try and use some of our space technology, space capabilities to effect social transformation in terms of helping predict weather events, helping with agriculture, helping with disaster relief,\" Kumaran added.\nIndia and Philippines agreed on facilitating the regular convening of institutional mechanisms including the Joint Defence Cooperation Committee (JDCC) and Joint Defence Industry and Logistics Committee (JDILC) for dialogue on defence cooperation, with emphasis on defence industrial collaboration, defence technology, research, training, exchanges, and capacity building. The two countries agreed on institutionalising military training activities between the two countries and Service-to-Service interactions, with increased focus on tri-service cooperation and recognizing the vital role of the seas and oceans in achieving development needs of the two countries, rights and freedoms as coastal states, developing economies, and maritime nations of the Indo-Pacific region.

Dave Edmunds my beloved husband is making a good recovery it seems positive.\n'He's breathing on his own now. He remembers me. Go figure. Ha. Ha.. He's even cracked a few jokes etc. And it appears he has a knack for trying to recall and remember things! \n'I can't begin to tell you how relieved I feel. He still has a long road to recovery. We still have a long road to recovery. But there is hope now.'\nShe added later on in her post: 'Today I'm having a meeting with the main physician and surgeon. To determine what's needed? Surgery and other dental and procedures? \n'It's a long long journey ahead for us both. But I have faith and you lovely people on here is making a very difficult horrific excuse easier. Thank you again everyone .. I will keep you all updated.'\nLast Tuesday as she went into detail about the incident at their home in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Cici told how she tried to 'keep him alive' by clearing his airways of fluids.\nShe then explained that a nurse began 'heavy CPR' and after a while declared Dave had died, with Cici telling how she 'refused' to give up on her husband.\n\nOn Tuesday Cici gave a more positive update saying he was now 'breathing on his own' and had even 'cracked a few jokes' from his hospital bed.\n\nIn an emotional Facebook post on Tuesday, Dave's heartbroken wife Cici shared the shocking news, as well as details about his terrifying health scare\nShe added that he 'very clearly' had brain damage and memory loss, and was at 'high risk' of having another cardiac arrest.\n\n 70s rocker Dave Edmunds fighting for his life in hospital after suffering major cardiac arrest which left him with brain damage \nOn how the experience affected her, she said: 'I’m still in shock and I believe I have PTSD from the horrific experience. \n'My brilliant talented funny and special Dave could really use as many peoples prayers and good wishes so to speak.'\nConcluding her detailed post, she added: 'Thank you all for your support and well wishes. It means the world to me. Dave will have a very long journey ahead of him if he survives. We both have. \n'But knowing that there are kind hearted people such as you all. Makes this tremendously difficult journey a little easier. Bless you all. Sending you all much love and light and always.'\nCici's post was met with a plethora of supportive messages from followers sending their love and prayers for Dave. \nCardiff-born musician Dave had many hits in the 1970s and early 80s with tracks including Slipping Away, The Promised Land and Girls Talk.\n\nCici went on to say that by a 'miracle', Dave was brought back to life, stating that he'd been intubated by doctors but was still critically ill in hospital (seen in 1985) \nThroughout his music career, Dave was part of a number of bands, his most significant being Love Sculpture, who released their debut single in 1968.\nTheir most successful song was a high-speed cover of Sabre Dance, which peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart and even got the attention of DJ John Peel who played it twice on one of his shows.\nAfter going solo, Dave went on to have a Christmas number 1 UK single with his cover of Smiley Lewis' I Hear You Knocking, which sold three million copies and even reached No. 4 in the US. \nMeanwhile, Dave married Swedish wife Cecilia (Cici) back in 1983, and they live in Monmouth, Wales.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDave Edmunds' wife Cici gives major health update on the 70s rocker after he was left fighting for his life following terrifying cardiac arrest\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The statements came after Palestinian groups last week released videos showing two emaciated Israeli captives amid a broader starvation crisis affecting some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, Al Jazeera noted.\nIn a post on X, Netanyahu wrote in Hebrew that Hamas was spreading a \"lie of starvation\" in Gaza, but \"systematic starvation is being carried out against our hostages.\" Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, responded through spokesman Abu Obeida, saying Israeli captives \"eat what our fighters and all our people eat\" and will \"not receive any special privilege amid the crime of starvation and siege.\" However, Abu Obeida added that Hamas is \"ready to act positively and respond to any request from the Red Cross to deliver food and medicine to enemy prisoners,\" Al Jazeera reported.\nAbu Obeida stressed the need for \"humanitarian corridors\" to be opened permanently for food and medicine to reach all Gaza residents and called for an end to Israeli attacks \"during the receipt of packages for the prisoners.\"\nThe ICRC expressed being \"appalled by the harrowing videos\" of the captives and reiterated its call to be \"granted access to the hostages.\" The organization said, \"These videos are stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held.\" It added, \"We know families watching these videos are horrified and heartbroken by the conditions they see their loved ones held in,\" Al Jazeera reported.\nAccording to the ICRC's website, \"securing access requires the cooperation of all parties involved.\" The group also said it \"has not been able to visit any Palestinian detainees held in Israeli places of detention since 7 October 2023.\n\"In a separate statement, the ICRC condemned the killing of a Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) staff member in a \"clearly marked Palestine Red Crescent Society building\" in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, Al Jazeera reported. The PRCS earlier blamed Israeli forces for the attack.\nMeanwhile, families of Israeli captives in Gaza criticized Netanyahu's insistence that a \"military resolution\" is the only solution, calling it \"a direct danger to the lives of our sons, who live in the hell of tunnels and are threatened by starvation and immediate death.\" They said, \"For 22 months, the public has been sold the illusion that military pressure will bring back the hostages, and today, even before reaching a comprehensive draft agreement, it is said that an agreement is futile,\" Al Jazeera reported.\nAbout 50 captives remain in Gaza, with fewer than half believed to be alive.\nThe Gaza Government Media Office reported that Israeli authorities allowed only 36 aid trucks into Gaza on Saturday, while 22,000 trucks remain outside waiting to deliver food to Palestinians, Al Jazeera added.\nThe United Nations office in Geneva warned that 1 million women and girls in Gaza are now starving. In a post on X, the UN said: \"One million. That's how many women and girls are starving in Gaza. This horrific situation is unacceptable and must end. We continue to demand the delivery of lifesaving aid for all women and girls, an immediate ceasefire, and the release of all hostages,\" Al Jazeera reported.\nAt least 175 people, including 93 children, have died from forced starvation, according to Gaza's Ministry of Health, including 17-year-old Atef Abu Khater, who weighed only 25 kg (55 lbs) before his death on Saturday.

Because I can sometimes not do it. It's really, really hard.'\nShe added, 'The first thing that I hear from people is how did you get it? Meaning I must have done something wrong in my life to have this disease, I did it to myself. It's like I had breast cancer as well so, oh you must have done something.\n'That stigma, I'm used to it now but it was so hard to swallow for a while because why the f*** would you think that I would do something to have this, because this is the worst thing I've ever had in my life.'\n\nBack in May, Christina gave a heartbreaking health update and revealed that she doesn't 'leave the house anymore'; seen in 2022 in L.A. \nThe actress candidly expressed, 'It's the worst thing I've ever gone through.'\nChristina explained what a bad day looks for her and said, 'to go to the bathroom is like walking on needles and hot lava so I haven't really been able to get out of my bed today.'\nThe star then shared early symptoms she had, such as numbness and also losing her balance.\nLast month in July, Christina also announced that she is set to release a new memoir titled You With The Sad Eyes.

But with MS, all the things I thought were important shifted,' the Emmy-nominated actress said began in a statement, per People.\n'For a long time, it felt impossible to find the meaning in everything I've been through, but for the first time in my life I've been able to stop and reflect.'\nChristina then admitted that it was 'scary' to 'to tell it all' in her candid memoir.\n\nLast month in July, Christina also announced that she is set to release a new memoir titled You With The Sad Eyes; seen in 2023 in L.A. \n\nShe gets candid about her life - including her health journey, tumultuous upbringing in Lauren Canyon, struggles with insecurities, and suffering from past abuse and assault; seen in 1989 in L.A. \n'But no matter how dark it gets, I wrote this because I truly believe that books can make people feel less alone.'\nThe star further explained to readers that her book 'won't be some big violin scratching for my life.

Nearly 50 lakh persons are employed in the aqua sector, including in ponds, laboratories, export companies, processing and packing units, hatcheries, feed companies, ice factories and cold storage units.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 financial year, India exported 17,81,602 metric tonnes of seafood worth $7.38 Billion (₹60,523.89 crore). The contribution of Andhra Pradesh was 9.52% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), worth around ₹19,428 crore, said Joint Director (Aquaculture) Shaik Lal Mohammad. \n\n“India is exporting shrimp, frozen fish, frozen squid, cuttle fish, lobster, crabs and other products to more than 120 countries,” said Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) officials.\n\nThe U.S. is the major importer of Indian seafood with a share of 34.53% in terms of US$, followed by China (18.76%), Thailand (7.77%), Vietnam (7.41%) and Japan (6.06%).\n\nAndhra Pradesh State Aquaculture Development Authority (APSADA) Vice-Chairman Anam Venkata Ramana Reddy on Tuesday told The Hindu that the government was making efforts to prevent losses to aqua farmers in the State.\n\nFarmers said the aqua sector in A.P. was facing a severe crisis after the U.S. announced 26% reciprocal tariff in April this year. As the price of shrimp had fallen in the international market, many farmers announced crop holiday, the producers said.\n\n“We are not in a position to continue aquaculture by paying a 35% tariff to the U.S., which is the major importer of our produce. The Central government should take measures to save the sector in Andhra Pradesh,” said A. Veerraju, an aquaculture farmer from Kaikalur in Eluru district.","summary":"Aqua farmers have to bear 35% tariff, including 25% tariff, 5.77% countervailing duty and 3.96% anti-dumping duty from August 7, says Seafood Exporters Association of India","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/trumps-25-tariff-likely-to-hit-seafood-exports-from-ap/article69896640.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/l995h1/article69897727.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/VJ21_PRAWNS-5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:26:36","author":"Rajulapudi Srinivas","authors":["Rajulapudi Srinivas"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.312},{"id":348502064,"title":"World News | Earthquake of 2.7 Magnitude Hits New Jersey, Tremors Felt in Parts of New York","text":"New York [US], August 6 (ANI): A 2.7 magnitude earthquake struck near Hillsdale in northern New Jersey on Tuesday at 12:11 pm (local time), according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), CNN reported.

Also Read | Donald Trump Claims India Will Offer Zero Tariffs, but US Will Put Higher Tariffs in 24 Hours for Russian Oil Trade.\nThe USGS received reports of light shaking from residents across Staten Island and southwestern Connecticut. The USGS also noted that the older, denser, and more compact rock formations in the eastern United States help transmit seismic energy more efficiently, allowing the quake's effects to be felt across a wider area, as per CNN. Emergency authorities issued basic guidelines for residents. NYC Emergency Management urged people to remain alert for possible aftershocks, which could follow within minutes, hours, or even days after the primary tremor.\nResidents were advised that if they felt shaking, they should check their surroundings for fallen debris, shifted items, or cracks in structures and report it to USGS, as per NYC Emergency Management.

Gabbard joined \"The Ingraham Angle\" Tuesday for her first interview since Attorney General Pam Bondi directed her staff to act on a criminal referral the DNI chief sent to her office in late July. \"I met with the Department of Justice prosecutors today, and yes, they are committed to leaving no stone unturned as they conduct this grand jury investigation and find the truth,\" said Gabbard. \"They have more questions and they're gonna be really taking a deep dive into this, again, looking everywhere to find the truth and conduct this very serious investigation.\" WHITE HOUSE SENDS MIXED SIGNALS IN RUSSIA ‘HOAX’ BLAME GAME Fox News reported on Monday that Bondi directed an unnamed federal prosecutor to start legal proceedings, with plans to present evidence to a grand jury for a potential indictment, according to a letter from Bondi and a source familiar with the investigation. The announcement comes after the attorney general announced the creation of a \"strike force\" to look into the evidence Gabbard and her team gathered. Gabbard alleges that Obama administration officials politicized intelligence and laid the groundwork for a \"years-long coup\" against President Donald Trump after he won the 2016 election. She claimed in a post on X that former President Barack Obama and key members of his national security team, including then-CIA Director John Brennan and then-DNI James Clapper, fabricated a narrative about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election to \"subvert\" Trump’s presidency. Gabbard told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that, despite the improbability of Obama facing serious charges due to the Supreme Court’s 2024 presidential immunity ruling, she wanted to release the declassified documents to protect the nation’s \"integrity.\" \"The integrity of our democratic republic depends on the American people knowing the truth about what actually happened and seeking that accountability, bringing about that accountability,\" said the former Democratic congresswoman. \"This was not a one-off thing. This wasn't just, ‘Oh, well, they fudged the lines a little bit.’ They created a lie and propagated that lie in order to try to undermine the person that the American people chose to be our president and commander-in-chief.\" An Obama spokesperson pushed back on Gabbard’s \"outrageous\" and \"bizarre\" allegations in a rare statement in July as attempted distractions. \"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes. These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio,\" the spokesperson said. AMERICANS SHOULD BE AWARE OF GABBARD’S ‘DANGEROUS DISTRACTION’ WITH REVISIONIST HISTORY OF 2016 ELECTION A 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report, backed by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., found that Russia did not \"hack\" election infrastructure, such as changing votes or manipulating voting machines. It did, however, conclude that the Russian government worked to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions and voting processes. Rubio, now the Secretary of State, said in a 2020 press release that the committee’s investigation did not find evidence that then-candidate Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government.

But in 2024, there were only 114 killings.\n\nThe dramatic change came after President Nayib Bukele, who brands himself as the 'world's coolest dictator', launched an aggressive crackdown on crime. \n\nIn 2022, he declared a state of emergency, which remains in place. It gave security forces the power to arrest people without a warrant. \n\nAt one point, around 1,000 people a day were being detained on suspicion of gang involvement. \n\nA year later, El Salvador opened a new prison called the Terrorism Confinement Centre - Cecot - to hold the growing number of detainees. \n\nIt was built in a remote area and is now one of the most extreme prisons in the world. \n\nInmates are banned from all contact with the outside world, and up to 100 men share a single cell. \n\nThey sleep on bare concrete slabs with no mattresses, and food is limited. There are no visitors, and prisoners are often transferred in chains, surrounded by armed guards.\n\nInmates are confined to their cells and are only allowed out for exercise in the prison's corridors or video link hearings. \n\nEl Salvador now has the highest prison population per capita in the world, with nearly three per cent of all men in the country behind bars. US president Donald Trump has hailed Bukele's policies, and the two have become close allies. \n\nBefore the crackdown, the country was dominated by two main gangs, MS-13 and Mara 18, which formed in California during the 1980s. \n\nMany members were deported back to El Salvador in the 1990s and took control of large parts of the country. \n\nGangs extorted money from businesses, controlled entire neighbourhoods, and carried out brutal killings.\n\nBut that has changed since the leader's rise. He campaigned on the promise to make the country safe, and his supporters say he has delivered. \n\nCriminal gangs are not the only ones in his crosshairs. He introduced tougher penalties for petty crimes - anyone caught drink driving, even with a trace of alcohol, can be jailed for 15 days before facing a fast-track trial and up to five years in prison. \n\nHe has also surrounded entire towns with soldiers, doubled the size of the military, and expanded surveillance powers. \n\nCheckpoints with troops carrying rifles have been set up, and cops go door to door in search of suspected criminals. \n\nThe tactic, which Bukele calls a 'security fence,' has been used in dozens of operations since 2022.\n\nBukele has also pushed legal reforms allowing judges to try dozens of suspects at once. Evidence can include anonymous tips or online posts.\n\nIn February 2025, Bukele signed a law which ordered children held for organised crimes to be sent to adult prisons. \n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, over 3,000 minors have been detained with little or no evidence.\n\nThe government has also introduced a national informant hotline, offering cash rewards to citizens who report suspected gang members. \n\nPosters and text messages encourage neighbours and even relatives to turn people in. Critics say this has led to false accusations and revenge reports.\n\nHowever, Bukele says the crackdown is 'an example for other countries … that we can live in peace'. Aside from his war on crime, he has launched policies like making his country the first nation to declare Bitcoin legal tender and has improved the country's infrastructure. \n\nLast year, he was re-elected with 85 per cent of the vote in a controversial election. His main opposition got less than 7 per cent. In a recent move, Congress abolished the limit on presidential terms, allowing him to stay in power for life if re-elected.\n\nOpposition congresswoman Marcela Villatoro said, 'Democracy died today,' after the reforms were passed by 57 votes to three.\n\nBukele's supporters argue that the results speak for themselves and say locals and tourists now walk the streets safely at night, even in areas that were once no-go zones.\n\nBut his huge transformations have not come at a cost. He has been heavily criticised by human rights advocates who say he has committed many atrocities, especially when it comes to detainees. \n\nIn 2022, Amnesty International said: 'Under the current state of emergency, the Salvadoran authorities have committed massive human rights violations, including thousands of arbitrary detentions and violations of due process, as well as torture and ill-treatment.","summary":"In 2015, there were 6,656 murders in the small Central American country, which has a population of just 6.4 million.

While Trump acknowledged it was too early to make a definitive decision, he stated that Vance is “most likely” to carry forward the legacy of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, according to a report by CBS News.\n“It’s too early, obviously, to talk about it. But certainly, he’s doing a great job, and he would be probably favoured at this point,” Trump said during a recent executive order-signing ceremony at the White House.\nIn addition to praising Vance, the President also expressed admiration for Secretary of State Marco Rubio, suggesting that Rubio could also play a significant role in the future of the Republican Party. Trump noted that Rubio is “somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” while commending the “incredible people” currently within the GOP.\nAlthough this is not the first time Trump has spoken positively about both Rubio and Vance, it is among the clearest indications yet of where his preferences may lie. In a May interview with NBC News, Trump had previously stated that he didn’t “want to get involved” in picking a future leader. However, he did admit that vice presidents typically have a natural advantage in such scenarios.\nAs of now, both JD Vance and Marco Rubio are viewed as likely contenders for the 2028 GOP presidential nomination. Trump, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term, will not be eligible to run again. However, earlier this year, there were reports suggesting that Trump and his allies were privately exploring legal avenues that could potentially allow him to serve beyond two terms.\nSpeculation about a third Trump presidency was further fueled in April when merchandise such as hats bearing the slogan “Trump 2028” began appearing in the market.\nIt’s worth noting that both Rubio and Vance were once vocal critics of Trump. Rubio, in particular, ran against him during the 2016 Republican primaries. Over time, however, both men have aligned with Trump and have taken on prominent roles within his administration.","summary":"In addition to praising Vance, the President also expressed admiration for Secretary of State Marco Rubio.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/most-favoured-at-this-point-trump-backs-jd-vance-as-heir-apparent-for-2028-ws-l-9487072.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/01/JD-Vance-Republican-Warning-Nomination-Reuters-2025-01-9ef2a2dc71e40572a0a8066aee3390c3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:18:53","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.012},{"id":348510544,"title":"Three years into war, US and Europe keep billions in trade with Russia","text":"Three years after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the United States and European Union still import billions of euros worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium.\n\nIndia this week lashed out at what it called Western double standards, after facing renewed threats from U.S. President Donald Trump over its surging purchases of Russian crude oil.\n\nHere are the main commercial ties that the U.S., Europe, and India maintain with Russia, and their evolution over the last four years:\n\nEUROPE IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA\n\nSince the beginning of the war, trade between the EU and Russia has drastically contracted due to EU sanctions and import restrictions on some products.

The meeting, which focused on the situation in the Middle East, was requested following the release of videos showing two hostages in dire physical condition. David urged the council to demand the immediate release of all hostages held in Gaza. Speaking via Zoom, David asked the council to call for humanitarian aid and medical care for the hostages and to use its leverage to help secure their freedom. He held up a still photo from a video Hamas published of his brother in captivity. \"My brother and the other hostages have endured an unimaginable nightmare,\" David said. \"We now know from medical reports and other indications that Evyatar, Guy (Gilboa Dalal) and the others are on the brink of death. They may only have days left to live.\" David said his brother, a 24-year-old kidnapped from the Nova music festival, now weighs only around 90 pounds. He described a horrifying scene from the video in which his brother, a \"living skeleton\" was forced to dig his own grave. David pointed out that a terrorist's hand, seen in the frame, was thicker than his brother's leg. \"Suddenly, Hamas confirmed what we have known for months: the terrorists have plenty of food,\" David said. \"The only ones starving in Hamas tunnels are the hostages. The terrorists are choosing to starve them as part of a sick and twisted propaganda campaign.\" David said released hostages who were held with his brother and Gilboa Dalal confirmed that terrorists had food nearby and would \"relish it loudly\" while the hostages had none. David outlined three urgent calls to the council: demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, call for humanitarian aid to reach them and recognize the need for urgent medical intervention. He closed by imploring the council not to let them die and to use all possible pressure to force Hamas and its partners to act. Following David's address, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar spoke, calling for international pressure on Hamas to release the hostages. \"I came here to put the issue of the hostages front and center on the world stage,\" Sa'ar said. \"This past weekend, the world witnessed the cruel starvation of Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski, tortured deliberately by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\" Sa'ar accused some countries of pressuring Israel instead of Hamas. \"By attacking Israel, campaigning against Israel and their announcement to recognize a virtual Palestinian state, they gave Hamas free gifts and an incentive to continue this war,\" he said. He added that Israel is facilitating a large amount of aid into Gaza and that Hamas is responsible for starting and continuing the war. The United States representative said the horrific videos of David and Braslavski \"should shock and appall the world.\" The representative thanked Ilay David for his courage, stating that the U.S. stands with the hostage families and will continue to work to free the remaining hostages. The U.S. called for the international community to impose \"maximum pressure on Hamas to immediately release all 50 hostages\" and criticized \"unproductive publicity stunts\" such as the two-state solution conference and unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. The U.S. representative said President Donald Trump's administration's priority is freeing the hostages along with ensuring Hamas disarms. Special envoy Jonathan Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee recently traveled to Gaza to meet with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. \"As President Trump has said, the fastest way to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is for Hamas to surrender and release the hostages,\" the U.S. representative said. France and the United Kingdom, both of whom have recently announced their intention to recognize Palestine as a state, used the meeting to condemn Hamas while also calling for increased humanitarian access to Gaza. The French ambassador denounced Hamas' \"boundless inhumanity\" and \"vile methods,\" and the U.K. representative called Hamas' actions \"inhuman and cruel.\" Both countries also reiterated that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to lasting peace. Algeria's ambassador accused Israel of genocide, quoting Israeli author David Grossman who recently used the same term. Other nations also voiced concern for the hostages, with Denmark's ambassador expressing \"sincere solidarity\" with the remaining hostages and their families and Sierra Leone's representative demanding their unconditional release. The Russian ambassador acknowledged the dire situation of the hostages but pointed out that their families have accused the Israeli government of prolonging the war and endangering their loved ones.","summary":"At special session called by Israel, Ilay David urged the Security Council to demand the immediate release of all hostages held in Gaza","url":"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-08-06/ty-article/brother-of-israeli-hostages-tells-un-gaza-terrorists-have-plenty-of-food/00000198-7ca3-d257-a1f9-feef34360000","image":"https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/00000198-7bce-d50b-adba-7bcf44220000/90/a1/d1375b584ac9aab13902d4c6dd08/656602.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:17:15","author":"Linda Dayan","authors":["Linda Dayan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":348510762,"title":"Watch this Texas Democrat clap back at GOP plot to steal House seats","text":"Texas state Rep.

Trump's supporters have been obsessed with the Epstein case for years and have been up in arms since the FBI and Justice Department said last month that the wealthy financier had committed suicide while in jail, did not blackmail any prominent figures, and did not keep a \"client list.\"In a bid to calm the furor, the Justice Department is seeking the release of the grand jury transcripts from

States ramps up tariffs on major trading partners globally, President Donald Trump is also disrupting strategies that could be used -- by Chinese companies or others -- to circumvent them.\n\nGoods deemed to be \"transshipped,\" or sent through a third country with lower export levies, will face an additional 40-percent duty under an incoming wave of Trump tariffs Thursday.\n\nThe latest tranche of \"reciprocal\" tariff hikes, taking aim at what Washington deems unfair trade practices, impacts dozens of economies from Taiwan to India.\n\nThe transshipment rule does not name countries, but is expected to impact China significantly given its position as a manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nWashington likely wants to develop supply chains that are less reliant on China, analysts say, as tensions simmer between the world's two biggest economies and the US sounds the alarm on Beijing's excess industrial capacity.\n\nBut \"it's a little more about the short-term effect of strengthening the tariff regime than it is about a decoupling strategy,\" said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\"The point is to make countries worried about it and then have them err on the side of not doing it, because they know that Trump could then jack up the tariff rates higher again,\" he added, referring to tariff evasion.\n\nThe possibility of a sharply higher duty is a \"perpetual stick in the negotiations\" with countries, said Richard Stern, a tax and budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nHe told AFP that expanding penalties across the globe takes the focus away from Beijing alone.\n\n Alternative supplies \n\nExperts have noted that Vietnam was the biggest winner from supply chain diversions from China since the first Trump tariffs around 2018, when Washington and Beijing engaged in a trade war.\n\nAnd Brookings Institution senior fellow Robin Brooks pointed to signs this year of significant transshipments of Chinese goods.\n\nHe noted in a June report that Chinese exports to certain Southeast Asian countries started surging \"anomalously\" in early 2025 as Trump threatened widespread levies.\n\nWhile it is unclear if all these products end up in the United States, Brooks cast doubt on the likelihood that domestic demand in countries like Thailand and Vietnam rocketed right when Trump imposed duties.\n\n\"One purpose of the transshipment provisions is to force the development of supply chains that exclude Chinese inputs,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"The other purpose is to push back on Chinese overcapacity and force them to eat their own surpluses,\" he added.\n\nBut Washington's success in the latter goal depends on its ability to get other countries on board.\n\n\"The transshipment penalties are designed to encourage that,\" Reinsch said.\n\nLipsky added: \"The strategy that worked in the first Trump term, to try to offshore some Chinese manufacturing to other countries like Vietnam and Mexico, is going to be a much more difficult strategy to execute now.\"\n\n China response? \n\nLipsky noted that Beijing could see the transshipment clause as one targeting China on trade, \"because it is.\"\n\n\"The question is, how China takes that in the broader context of what had been a thawing relationship between the US and China over the past two months,\" he added.\n\nWhile both countries temporarily lowered triple-digit tariffs on each other's exports, that truce expires August 12.\n\nThe countries are in talks to potentially extend the de-escalation, although the final decision lies with Trump.\n\nIt will be tough to draw a line defining product origins, analysts say.\n\nCustoms fraud has been illegal for some time, but it remains unclear how Washington will view materials from China or elsewhere that have been significantly transformed.\n\nThe burden lies with customs authorities to identify transshipment and assess the increased duties.\n\n\"That will be difficult, particularly in countries that have close relations with China and no particular incentive to help US Customs and Border Protection,\" Reinsch added.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"As the United States ramps up tariffs on major trading partners globally, President Donald Trump is also disrupting strategies that could be

U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Mexico’s share of the U.S. market fell from 15.9% in the first six months of 2024 to 15% from January through June 2025 as U.S. imports rose at the

edging closer to that of China, which fell 12.4% year-over-year, to $111.48 billion. That surplus has been one of Trump’s pretexts for his aggressive trade stance toward Mexico.\n\nOne of the takeaways from the recent trade negotiations between the United States and Mexico was President Sheinbaum’s appearance of abidance to Trump as regards the trade surplus, even to the point of Mexico encouraging its nation’s companies to “buy American.”\n\nIn recent months, Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper imports and 25% on automobiles and certain auto parts from Mexico. He also introduced 25% tariffs on non-USMCA products, which could increase to 30% unless Sheinbaum can convince the U.S. president not to raise the tariffs by the October deadline.\n\nOverall, U.S. export and import levels both increased in the first half of the year, despite the imposition of tariffs on several countries, which encouraged many states to introduce reciprocal tariffs. U.S. global foreign purchases climbed by 12.7% to almost $1.8 trillion.

John Cornyn sent a letter earlier Tuesday to FBI Director Kash Patel asking for federal assistance in bringing back state Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe group of Democrats fled the Lone Star State Sunday in order to prevent their Republican colleagues from approving a new redistricting plan that favors the GOP. \n\nThe newly redrawn map could help Trump and Republicans keep the U.S. House of Representatives in GOP hands in the 2026 midterms, which historically haven't gone the party in power's way.\n\n'Well, I think they've abandoned the state,' Trump commented. 'Nobody's seen anything like it, even though they've done it twice before. And in a certain way, it almost looks like they've abandoned the state looks, very bad.' \n\nEach Democratic lawmaker is being fined $500 a day for skipping the special legislative session, which was called by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \n\nAbbott also ordered an investigation into whether the Democrats are violating bribery laws by using donations to cover the fines. \n\nTrump noted to reporters that Abbott also wanted the Democrats to come back. \n\n'I mean the governor of Texas is demanding they come back, a lot of people are demanding they come back,' the president said at an executive order signing related to the 2028 summer Olympics in Los Angeles. \n\n'You can't just sit it out, you have to go back, you have to fight it out,' the president continued. 'That's what elections are all about.' \n\nHe pushed back on the assertion that Texas Republicans were not playing fair - changing the makeup of Congressional districts in the middle of a decade. \n\n'They would have done it anyway,' the president said of Democrats. \n\nRedistricting is usually tied to the U.S. Census, which is conducted every 10 years. \n\n'I watched this morning as Democrats are complaining and they're complaining from states where they've done it, like in Illinois, like in Massachusetts,' Trump said. \n\nTrump then segued to one of his favorite Democratic punching bags, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Sanders, a prominent progressive. \n\n'I watched this lunatic, Pocahontas, she's a total lunatic,' Trump said. \n\nTrump assigned Warren the controversial nickname after she was involved in a scandal about whether she should have identified as Native American. \n\n'I don't know what she's on,' he continued. 'She's all jumping up and down like I've never seen anything like it, talking about supporting the communist mayor.'\n\nThe president then briefly went into his hometown's mayoral race, lampooning Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, who Trump calls a 'communist.' \n\nTrump then explained that Warren was also talking about the redistricting. \n\n'But if you look at what's going on with the redistricting, or whatever you want to call it, the Democrats have done it long before we started,' Trump said. 'They've done it all over the place. They did it in New York, they did it in a lot of different states.","summary":"President Donald Trump kept the option open to use FBI agents to track down the 'missing' Texas Democrats.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14973989/donald-trump-fbi-texas-democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/06/00/100953261-0-image-a-12_1754436389996.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:00:44","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.379},{"id":348501600,"title":"Warming Pak-US ties","text":"DEPUTY Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday held his second phone call within a week with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signaling deepening diplomatic ties in the wake of Dar’s recent visit to Washington.\n\nIn a statement issued on X, the Foreign Office said that Pakistan and US top diplomats discussed a “range of bilateral matters and exchanged views on current regional and international issues.” Both sides agreed to remain in contact and continue cooperation on areas of mutual interest.\n\nThere has been unusual personal and telephonic interaction between the leadership of the two countries for the last several months. The frequency of such high level contacts is surely indicative of renewed warmth in bilateral relations between Pakistan and the United States, which remained somewhat lackluster until recent past prompting analysts to point out that the US has lost interest in Pakistan following its withdrawal from Afghanistan. A reset in relations is apparently underway but what we know publically and through official statements of the accounts of bilateral engagements is not enough to form a clear picture of what is going on and where would it lead to. There have been lavish praises of Pakistan by President Donald Trump but practically the country is not getting the kind of treatment it expects. The President was all praise about the leadership qualities of Pakistan’s civilian and military authorities for the sagacity they displayed during short war with India; views Pakistan’s contribution, role and sacrifices in the war against terror in a positive frame and claims he can play a role in finding a negotiated settlement of the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir, besides hosting Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House, which is considered as an extraordinary gesture towards Pakistan. However, so far there is nothing tangible to suggest what the US intends to gain from this fresh embrace and what Pakistan is going to achieve except sentiments of goodwill. Of course, Pakistan has clinched a comparatively favourable trade deal from the United States but it is not as favourable as Pakistan had been expecting despite the fact that in return Islamabad has offered the most favourable tariff on the US goods to be imported. In addition, Pakistan has also opened its lucrative mining and hydrocarbon sectors for US investment. Pakistan is in the midst of a renewed counter-terrorism campaign and would surely want the United States to provide necessary support for the purpose as it would help eradicate the menace in the shortest possible time and with minimum losses and collateral damages. However, so far, no such meaningful cooperation was in sight despite confirmation of Pakistan’s position by independent reports that it has become a victim of terrorism sponsored by two of its neighbours. It is also pertinent to point out that substantial cooperation in the realm of counter-terrorism also becomes a must for peace, security and stability of the regions that the US and other foreign countries were eyeing to explore for mineral wealth as well as oil and gas. In the absence of a clear picture, diplomatic circles and geo-strategic analysts are conjecturing about what this new phase of friendship is aimed at. There are assumptions that the United States was cozying up to Pakistan in a bid to cause a dent in the country’s bilateral ties with China but like the nuclear programme, complete consensus prevails in Pakistan that the friendship with China is a factor of economic and defence strength of the country. Some circles also argue that attempts are being made to lure Pakistan into the circle of Abraham Accords that the US President is trying to create for a safe and secure Israel. It is also argued that brisk movements vis-à-vis Pakistan-US relations are also part of efforts to put pressure on India to distance itself from the Russian Federation and to secure a favourable trade deal. In the latest development, after describing India as a dead economy, President Trump said on Monday he will substantially raise tariffs on India over its purchases of Russian oil, pointing out that New Delhi is not only buying massive amounts of Russian oil but is also selling it in the open market for big profits. As for Pakistan, its people definitely want a robust relationship with the United States but on the basis of sovereign equality and mutuality of interests. It would be a major success for our policy and decision makers if this becomes a reality as a consequence of the widely appreciated policy of maintaining good and interest-based ties with all important countries of the globe.","summary":"DEPUTY Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday held his second phone call within a week with US…","url":"https://pakobserver.net/warming-pak-us-ties/","image":"https://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/editorial-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:00:38","author":"News desk","authors":["News desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.035},{"id":348510900,"title":"All talk, no paper: Japan’s US tariff deal hits a snag","text":"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba may have hailed the 15 per cent tariff imposed on his country by the United States as a “win-win” deal, but Tokyo is expected to push back if the levies adversely affect Japan’s economy – especially the vital vehicle sector.\nOne of the biggest sources of domestic criticism has been the absence of a joint text on the agreement, observers say.\nWhile Ishiba has touted the trade deal reached last month as benefiting both nations, he also acknowledged on Monday that the real challenge would be in its implementation.\n“Some say that carrying the trade deal out is harder than agreeing on it. I humbly seek your continued support on this,” he told a parliamentary session.\n\nThe agreement, reached just before an August 1 deadline and after intense negotiations, has been credited with averting a potential trade crisis for Japan.\nInitially, the US threatened a 25 per cent tariff on all Japanese imports but ultimately agreed to the reduced rate in a concession that spared Japan from deeper economic pain.\nBut there is still no clarity regarding when US tariffs on automobiles and auto parts will be reduced from the current 25 per cent to the agreed 15 per cent.\n“We should first devote all our efforts to properly lowering automobile tariffs, which are most closely related to our national interests,” Ishiba said, adding that he would push to hold further talks with US President Donald Trump to ensure the tariff cuts were implemented.\n\nAt the same parliamentary session, Ryosei Akazawa, Japan’s chief trade negotiator, addressed the criticism surrounding the lack of a written agreement.\n“It’s my understanding that having something on paper would be helpful,” he said, pointing out that similar agreements with South Korea and the European Union also lacked formal documentation.\nStephen Nagy, a professor of international studies at Japan’s International Christian University, said “push back” might occur if the trade deal hurt the Japanese economy or harmed key sectors such as automotive manufacturing.\nIshiba’s political future, meanwhile, hinged less on the tariffs and more on his administration’s poor electoral performance, mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of both US-Japan and Japan-China relations, Nagy said.\n“Ishiba will not be able to secure a carve-out from tariffs, which will cast him as a poor negotiator and leader,” he said. “The ruling Liberal Democratic Party power brokers will use this as further evidence to oust him in favour of a more conservative leader.”\n\nInvestment impasse\nThe lack of a joint text on the trade agreement was a major concern, Rintaro Nishimura, a senior associate at strategic advisory firm The Asia Group, told This Week in Asia.\nHe noted discrepancies between what the US and Japanese governments had said about the agreement, particularly regarding implementation schedules, investments, defence equipment purchases and agricultural goods.\nThe investment component was particularly contentious, according to Nishimura, with the US claiming a “US$550 billion” investment, while Japan describes it as “investment, loans and loan guarantees by government financial institutions of up to US$550 billion”.\n“There are huge question marks as to how much of this will be pure investment – Akazawa says 1 to 2 per cent – and how much will be loans and loan guarantees,” Nishimura said.\nAnother sticking point involves profit sharing, with Washington claiming a 9-1 ratio in its favour, while Tokyo clarified that this would only pertain to the investment aspect, excluding loans and guarantees.\n\nDespite being under mounting pressure following last month’s bruising upper house election, Ishiba has vowed to stay on as prime minister to ensure the trade deal is fully realised.\nA poll by private broadcaster JNN at the weekend indicated a slight increase in support for Ishiba’s cabinet, rising 4 percentage points to 36.8 per cent, with 47 per cent of respondents agreeing that he should not resign. Polls published by the Mainichi and Asahi newspapers on July 27 showed approval ratings of 29 per cent for Ishiba’s government.\nNishimura said that while Ishiba’s ratings had improved, this was less about the trade deal and more a reflection of voter resistance to a right-wing coalition with the far-right populist party Sanseito, which gained traction in the recent election.\nIshiba was likely to try and stay in office “for at least a month or so” until domestic pressure for his resignation became too much, Nishimura predicted. Uncertainty over the trade deal’s implementation “gives him grounds to argue that he should remain in place”, he added.\n\nPeace memorial ceremonies this week in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, commemorating the end of World War II, and the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development later this month could provide Ishiba with opportunities to strengthen his position.\nAs the ruling LDP prepares for an extraordinary Diet session in the autumn, pressure on Ishiba is expected to escalate, especially if opposition coalitions challenge his authority through no-confidence motions.\nThe LDP and its coalition partner Komeito suffered a humiliating setback in last month’s upper house election, failing to secure a majority at a second consecutive poll, as support surged for candidates from the small, ultraconservative Sanseito party, known for its “Japanese First” policy.","summary":"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba may have hailed the 15 per cent tariff imposed on his country by the United States as a “win-win” deal, but Tokyo is expected to push back if the levies adversely affect Japan’s economy – especially the vital vehicle sector.\nOne of the biggest sources of domestic criticism has been the absence of a joint text on the agreement, observers say.\nWhile Ishiba has touted the trade deal reached last month as benefiting both nations, he also acknowledged on Monday...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3320785/all-talk-no-paper-japans-us-tariff-deal-hits-snag","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/05/3bcbd3d1-d2b6-4622-8479-32a3de451fae_d0a44ae9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:00:08","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.446},{"id":348501936,"title":"Down 19% This Year, Has Apple Stock Become a Bargain Buy?","text":"Apple (AAPL -0.27%) is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of $3 trillion. With around 1.5 billion active iPhone users worldwide, it has a massive userbase, which is connected to its vast and growing ecosystem. Warren Buffett once referred to Apple as one of the best businesses he's ever known.\n\nYet, despite all its success, accolades, and seemingly terrific growth prospects, the stock has been struggling this year, down by 19% as of the end of last week. While the company has been falling behind in the race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, is that enough of a reason to justify such an underwhelming performance? Or could Apple be one of the best tech stocks to buy right now, given its reduced valuation?\n\nIs Apple's business heading in the right direction?\n\nA challenge for Apple in recent years has been its diminishing growth rate. With a troubling AI rollout that has resulted in the company delaying features, there hasn't been a strong upgrade cycle with users buying new iPhones. There hasn't been an overwhelming reason to do so, especially if people are anticipating new AI features on the horizon; there's been arguably more of a reason to wait.\n\nThe company recently reported earnings, and it did experience an unusual uptick in sales, with its top line rising by close to 10%.\n\nAAPL Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.\n\nFor the period ending June 28, iPhone sales rose by 13%. But a big reason for that is likely to do with tariffs. The fear of rising prices in the future may have resulted in many people deciding to upgrade their devices sooner rather than later. Thus, it wasn't necessarily innovative new products that pushed demand up, but rather, a fear of challenging macroeconomic conditions ahead. As a result, investors haven't been buying up Apple's stock despite the seemingly strong growth -- the best the company has achieved in multiple years.\n\nThe good news is that the company's revenue may be stronger next year. Apple is launching a new foldable phone (without creases), which may give customers an exciting new product to buy. \n\nJust how cheap is Apple stock today?\n\nThere's little doubt about how strong Apple's business is. This is still a company that generates more than $400 billion in annual revenue, with excellent profit margins of around 24%. The big question, however, is whether the stock is too expensive, especially if its growth rate may not be all that high going forward. Shares of Apple are down big this year, and that has pushed the stock's price-to-earnings multiple down to around its five-year average.\n\nAAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts.\n\nApple is still nowhere near its 52-week low of $169.21, which it reached in April when U.S. President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs. But the consensus analyst price target for the stock is set to around $237, indicating that analysts do see Apple rising by around 17% in value from where it is right now. \n\nShould you buy Apple stock today?\n\nApple's stock has been having a challenging year in 2025. With a vast user base and the business expanding its array of services over the years, there's still room for the company to become much larger in the future. But at 30 times its earnings, I can understand the apprehension from investors in buying the stock, as that's a steep multiple for a company where double-digit sales growth may simply not be the norm.\n\nWhile it's still a good business to invest in for the long term, I don't think Apple's valuation is cheap enough where there's enough margin of safety to make it worth buying, given the uncertainty around tariffs and the economy. Although it's down this year, the stock is by no means a bargain.","summary":"Apple's stock is currently trading around 30 times earnings, which is in line with its five-year average.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/05/down-19-this-year-has-apple-stock-become-a-bargain/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F827750%2Fpeople-using-their-cell-phones.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-06 00:00:00","author":"David Jagielski","authors":["David Jagielski"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":348507590,"title":"India implements new measures to boost domestic growth amid global trade challenges","text":"India is considering a fresh set of measures to support domestic growth amid a worsening global trade environment and rising external headwinds, including new tariffs from the United States.

This comes as the country prepares to face the 25% tariff imposed on exports by the US. Adding to the pressure is the recent announcement by US President Donald Trump to top this 25% levy with a penal duty for importing oil from Russia. Experts have said the move will have a marginal impact on India’s economy as it is not export-oriented. India exported $86 billion worth of goods last year to the US. Last week, Goldman Sachs said US levies could reduce India’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth by around 0.3 percentage points. Live EventsPolicymakers are of the view that the current pace of growth is insufficient and more needs to be done to deregulate and unshackle the economy. The Reserve Bank of India has projected a growth rate of 6.5% for FY26, while the International Monetary Fund has forecast 6.4% growth for FY26. A review of the goods and services tax framework is already in the works. The government is also eyeing measures to ease various procedures and processes that hinder investments and businesses, particularly the need for multiple clearances. Steps to encourage local manufacturing in strategic and critical sectors are being identified, besides ways to cut dependence on a single country for imports.
