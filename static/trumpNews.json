EU mulls its options as tensions with US rise over Greenland","text":"Brussels, Threats from the White House over Greenland have sparked outrage and a flurry of diplomatic activity across Europe, as leaders consider possible countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs and the first-ever use of the European Union's anti-coercion instrument.US President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10 per cent import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to American control of Greenland.Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff, Trump said in a social media post while at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The rate would climb to 25 per cent on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States, he said.European leaders from Dublin to Helsinki quickly condemned the announcement as economic coercion and sent representatives to Brussels on Sunday for an emergency meeting.If diplomacy fails, they have signalled a new willingness to wield the economic might of the 27-nation European Union.“Our priority is to engage, not escalate. Sometimes the most responsible form of leadership is restraint,” said European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill on Monday. “The EU has tools at its disposal and is prepared to respond should the threatened tariffs be imposed.”What next for the EU?Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and other world leaders will are now travelling to Davos for the annual World Economic Forum. No meetings are yet scheduled between European leaders and Trump.After Davos, the 27 EU leaders will convene in Brussels on Thursday evening for an emergency meeting on transatlantic relations.Costa has said EU leaders agree “that tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and are incompatible with the EU-US trade agreement.”The leaders expressed “readiness to defend ourselves against any form of coercion.”What are options on the table?-Europe has a lot of tools at its disposal but a fraught path ahead, said Penny Naas, senior vice president of the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based think tank.“It's tough for the Europeans to find that space where they can both demonstrate strength without incurring significant retaliation. And as long as they're unwilling to accept retaliation, they're going to have trouble projecting strength,” she said.The EU has three major economic tools it could use to pressure Washington: new tariffs, suspension of the US-EU trade deal, and a “trade bazooka,” the unofficial term for the bloc's Anti-Coercion Instrument that could sanction individuals or institutions found to be putting undue pressure on the EU.The EU and the US agreed in June on a framework for a trade deal. It was due to be ratified by the European Parliament this week, but on Saturday, the leader of the largest group in the Parliament, centre-right German lawmaker Manfred Weber, said approval was “not possible at this stage.”The EU could also levy tariffs on US goods worth 93 billion euros that it suspended after the July deal. However, commission spokesperson Gill said that unless that suspension is extended, those levies would take effect on February 7 if the US follows through on its tariff threat.Europe's biggest exports to the US are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.The value of EU-US trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.In 2021, the European Commission set up the Anti-Coercion Instrument after Beijing restricted trade to Lithuania, which has built ties with Taiwan, claimed by China as its territory.“The primary objective of the ACI is deterrence. The instrument will, therefore, be most successful if there is no need to use it,” according to a commission statement.There's widespread refusal to use the instrument in European capitals out of fears it would escalate matters – but France and Germany, the bloc's two economic juggernauts, have signalled their support.“Tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context,” said French President Emmanuel Macron in a social media post. “Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.”Indirectly, the EU has sought to shift its economies from the US to other parts of the world.Brussels signed a massive trade deal last week with the five Mercosur nations in South America as well as separate agreements with Indonesia and Japan. EU officials are working on similar free trade deals with the United Arab Emirates and India, where von der Leyen is expected in late January to finalise negotiations.Gill, the commission spokesperson, said the India deal would cover nearly 2 billion people, and together with the Mercosur deal it provides a clear victory for the EU in the wake of the global economic chaos unleashed by the second Trump administration.“We can see very clearly that the value of responsible, mature leadership on the global stage is paying off in terms of the EU trade agenda, in terms of our efforts to diversify our trade partners and give ourselves the maximum economic potential from our partnerships around the globe,” he said.

European countries, she said, must stand firm against coercive tactics like tariffs and military threats.Trump’s Greenland threat sparks European unityCallamard’s intervention follows Trump doubling down on his plans to seize Greenland, claiming the move is necessary for world security. European powers, including Germany and France, have denounced his threats of new tariffs against countries opposing his Arctic ambitions as “blackmail.”While condemning Trump’s approach, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized Europe’s desire to “avoid any escalation” in the dispute ahead of his planned meeting with Trump in Davos on Wednesday.“Say no” to bulliesAmnesty’s chief urged governments to show courage and reject one-sided deals.“Stop thinking you can make deals with bullies, stop thinking you can agree to the rules of the predators and not become yourself a victim of them,” Callamard said.She framed the Greenland dispute as the latest symptom of a broader global trend she sees as destructive to international norms.“The US bid to seize Greenland is only one indication that the world is facing the destruction of the rules-based order,” she warned.Global order under threatCallamard criticized multiple powers for undermining the international system established after World War II.“Superpowers seem intent on destroying what has been established after World War II, dedicated to finding common rules to our common problems,” she said.She pointed to Trump’s actions over the past year, Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in Gaza as evidence of the system’s erosion.“The fact that it is now being destroyed without any plan B, just for the sake of destroying the rules, should send shivers to all of us,” she added, warning that the alternative was “falling down into an abyss.”European values and human rightsCallamard stressed that Europe’s mission extends beyond economics.“The European project was not just about economics, but also about values, humanity, and the rule of law,” she said. “I'm hoping that our leaders will recall that… history and see in the current challenges a way of re-insisting on the European project and demanding human rights protection for the sake of humanity.”She urged an end to the “appeasement politics” toward Washington.“Please stop it. Resist. Resist,” she concluded.(With AFP inputs)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/amnesty-chief-urges-europe-to-resist-donald-trump-s-bullying-11768846765398.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/19/1600x900/logo/SYRIA-ANNIVERSARY-MISSING-11_1768847352305_1768847362036.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 18:30:57","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.006},{"id":394351804,"title":"Jamaican-Canadian transplant launches cultural marketing firm for Caribbean brands","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon Castonguay, founder of Adion Communications \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 19, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Jamaican-Canadian transplant launches cultural marketing firm for Caribbean brands \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica—Adion Communications, a Canada-based multicultural marketing agency, is calling for more Jamaican and Caribbean brands to make international marketing a central pillar of their long-term growth strategy.\n\n“Sure, Jamaican brands have cultural power and global appeal. But influence alone isn’t enough. While Caribbean products gain traction in export channels, little to no brands invest in sustained marketing overseas, resulting in limited visibility, weakened competitiveness, and missed opportunities for revenue growth,” said Shannon Shannon Castonguay, Jamaican-born cultural marketing strategist and founder of Adion Communications.\n\n“To compete internationally, brands must actively show up in the market; if not, they risk becoming invisible, lost on crowded shelves where competitors are doing the work.”\n\nOne key observation Castonguay said where Caribbean brands fail to market, inauthentic products quickly fill the gap.\n\n“Products that merely bear Jamaican colours or claim to have ‘Caribbean flavour’ receive traction that would have otherwise gone to authentic Caribbean brands. Needless to say, that didn’t sit right with me. It pushed me to champion our brands globally and market them in ways that stay true to their identity and cultural roots,” she explained.\n\nAdion Communications supports Caribbean brands seeking stronger international presence through culturally grounded strategy, digital marketing, brand storytelling, and on-the-ground experiential activations.\n\n“For far too long we’ve relied on nostalgia and hinged on the bet that people know these Caribbean products. If you consider it, global brands market specifically for each country they enter. Coca-Cola, for example, everyone knows Coca-Cola, however they tailor their message for each market segment year after year. They never rest in complacency,” Castonguay added.\n\nAdion Communications helps brands navigate global markets without diluting their identity, ensuring that expansion strategies honour brand heritage while meeting international consumer expectations.\n\n“Having spent years living in Jamaica and working with several Jamaican brands, I know the level of tenacity with which we operate, so to see that same diligence neglected here in Canada, I understand the disservice it does to our brands. I’ve never known Jamaicans to be small fries; in everything we do, we’ve been a big order,” Castonguay said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Adion Communications Caribbean brands Shannon Castonguay \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Prince Harry, Elton John ‘violated’ by UK media’s alleged intrusion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP)—Alleged unlawful information gathering by two UK newspapers made Prince Harry \"paranoid beyond belief\" and left Elton Joh... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 48-hour curfew extended in sections of Kingston East \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica – A 48-hour curfew has been extended in sections of the Kingston Eastern policing division.

(Photo by Toby Shepheard / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 19, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Prince Harry, Elton John ‘violated’ by UK media’s alleged intrusion \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom (AFP)—Alleged unlawful information gathering by two UK newspapers made Prince Harry “paranoid beyond belief” and left Elton John feeling “violated”, the pair have testified as a joint lawsuit opened Monday in the High Court.\n\nHarry, pop icon John and his husband David Furnish and four other high-profile figures are suing Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), the publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, for privacy invasions.\n\nHarry returned to Britain to attend Monday’s opening proceedings in the last unresolved case brought by the British royal in his crusade against several UK newspaper publishers.\n\nThe claimants allege the tabloids illegally intercepted voicemail messages, listened into phone calls and deceptively obtained private information from at least 1993 to 2018, in some instances.\n\nThey accuse ANL of paying private investigators implicated in other phone hacking lawsuits for some of the “unlawful information gathering acts” to generate stories.\n\nANL has consistently denied the claims, calling them “lurid” and “preposterous”.\n\nIn new court submissions, Harry’s lawyers detailed the self-described impact of 14 “unlawful articles” about him in the two tabloids that were “based on repeated, sustained and covert acquisition of private information”.\n\nHarry stated they created a “massive strain” on his personal relationships, “creating distrust and suspicion” and drove “me paranoid beyond belief, isolating me”.\n\nMeanwhile, witness statements by John and Furnish showed “they feel that their home, and the safety of their children and loved ones, has been violated”.\n\nThe pair felt “outrage” when they discovered “Associated’s invasion into medical details surrounding the birth of their son Zachary, and the stealing of their son’s birth certificate”.\n\n– ‘Mission’ –\n\nIt is the third and final case brought against a British newspaper publisher by Harry, who has called it his “mission” to take on the tabloids “for the greater good”.\n\nKing Charles III’s younger son has long blamed the media for the death of his mother Princess Diana, killed in a Paris car crash in 1997 while trying to shake off the paparazzi.\n\nThe 41-year-old — dressed Monday in a navy blue suit and a matching tie — is set to give evidence Thursday.\n\nHe made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior British royal to take the stand in more than a century, when he testified as part of his successful hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).\n\nLast year, he also settled in his court action against Murdoch’s UK tabloid publisher, which agreed to pay him “substantial damages” for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.\n\nActors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, lawmaker and campaigner Doreen Lawrence — whose son Stephen was infamously murdered in a 1993 racist attack — and ex-politician Simon Hughes are the other claimants in the ANL case.\n\nAll seven were in court or following proceedings remotely Monday, and are set to testify, with Hurley due up later in January, followed by John and Furnish in early February.\n\n– ‘Systematic’ –\n\nDelivering his opening statement, the claimants’ lawyer David Sherborne said he will show “there was clear and systematic use of unlawful gathering of information” at ANL.\n\nHe added it “knew they had skeletons in their closet” and that years of “emphatic denials were not true”.\n\nANL hired more than a dozen private investigators to conduct unlawful vehicle checks, access flight information and bank details, the claimants allege.\n\nThey claim investigators would impersonate individuals to obtain information, in a practice known as blagging. They also say ANL covered it up through the “mass destruction” of records.\n\nANL lawyer Antony White countered in written arguments that “editors, desk heads and journalists” are “lining up to reject the claimants’ allegations of habitual and widespread phone hacking, phone tapping and blagging within the organisation”.\n\nHarry’s visit is a rare UK return after stepping back from royal duties in 2020 and relocating eventually to California with wife Meghan.\n\nDuring his last visit in September, Harry met with the king amid a bitter family rift. But there are no reported plans for him to see his father during this visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Elton John Prince Harry UK media \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 48-hour curfew extended in sections of Kingston East \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica – A 48-hour curfew has been extended in sections of the Kingston Eastern policing division.

Strong root systems helped stabilise soil, flexible culms reduced breakage, and bamboo’s rapid regrowth ensured the integrity of future feedstock supply.\n\n“Hurricane Melissa gave us a clear demonstration of what this crop can withstand,” said Kirk Raymond, agronomist and field-logistics officer at Bamboo Bioproducts Ltd.\n\n“The bamboo along the edges of the fields experienced the most wind shear, but the interior growth areas held strong. When we went back in to measure and account for losses, what we saw was a very good showing in terms of yield and overall crop stability.”\n\nAccording to Raymond, post-storm assessments took nearly three weeks and included clearing fallen bamboo from roadways, cleaning planting rows, and weighing material to calculate losses. What emerged was an unexpected advantage: much of the bamboo felled by the storm was still suitable for industrial processing.\n\n“Based on quality alone, the material we assessed would fall in the 80 to 90 per cent range for mill throughput,” he explained. “In many ways, Melissa acted like a pre-harvest exercise rather than a disaster.”\n\nRaymond pointed out that the storm also reinforced the value of long-term crop planning.\n\n“Bamboo grown on a four-year rotation becomes significantly more resistant to extreme weather after its second year, a factor that limited disruption despite the hurricane’s intensity,” he said.\n\nFor a country exposed to increasingly intense storms linked to climate change as with many parts of the globe, those attributes matter, said Stedeford. Agriculture and manufacturing are often among the hardest-hit sectors after hurricanes, he observed.\n\nBamboo, he said, is positioning itself as a bridge between the two, an agricultural crop that can support industrial production while withstanding climatic shocks.\n\nWhile the storm tested the fields, it also validated strategic decisions behind the mill’s development, said Stedeford, as he disclosed that the planned mill site did not flood during Hurricane Melissa, confirming the accuracy of earlier hydrological and site selection assessments.\n\n“Following Melissa, we revisited elements of the mill design, which was already engineered for Category 5 wind loads and seismic events, to incorporate additional learnings around wind exposure and extreme weather scenarios,” he explained.\n\nRefinements were made to structural detailing, construction-phase planning, and shutdown procedures, strengthening resilience both during construction and once the facility becomes operational.\n\nYet, for the company, resilience was not just about infrastructure or crops; it was about people. As the hurricane approached, operations were paused and staff were instructed to stay home with their families. After the storm passed, the company’s immediate focus shifted to welfare.\n\n“Our priority was people, always,” Stedeford said. “Immediately after the storm, our focus shifted to welfare checks and restoring contact with our teams in the west. We provided immediate support for food and personal hygiene needs and worked through our local leadership to coordinate assistance where it was most needed.”\n\nThat people-first approach, he noted, was critical in maintaining trust and morale during a period of widespread disruption.\n\nIt also reinforced the company’s broader philosophy of operating as part of a community, not apart from it. The company also committed funding to support neighbouring communities as they stabilised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Bamboo Bioproducts Ltd Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kostoulas stunner rescues Brighton draw after penalty row \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n BRIGHTON, United Kingdom (AFP)—Charalampos Kostoulas snatched a superb late equaliser as Brighton survived Marcus Tavernier's controversial penalty to... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gov’t strengthening health system to meet hurricane, flu demands \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n ST ANN, Jamaica—The Government is taking steps to strengthen health services and address rising demand, as it responds to the combined impact of Hurri... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US Treasury chief says retaliatory EU tariffs over Greenland ‘unwise’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n DAVOS, Switzerland (AFP)—US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned European nations on Monday against retaliatory tariffs over President Donald Trump... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Early exit for Jamaicans at 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Champs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Zandre Roye and Oshae Haye exited the 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Championship (LAAC) at the Lima Golf Club in Peru, after not ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gunmen kidnap 163 worshippers from two Nigerian churches—clergy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KANO, Nigeria (AFP)—Armed gangs kidnapped at least 163 Christian worshippers after storming two churches in Nigeria's northern Kaduna State on Sunday,... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Holness urges vigilance against exploitation of ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Prime Minister Andrew Holness has cautioned beneficiaries of the Restoration of Owner or Occupant Family Shelters (ROOFS) initiativ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $158.26 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, January 19, ended trading at $158.26, down by 4 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Lifestyle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival serves up stellar lineup on Jan 31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n A number of stirring features are to be showcased at this year’s third annual Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival being presented by the Consulate... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(Photo by Glyn KIRK / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 19, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Kostoulas stunner rescues Brighton draw after penalty row \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIGHTON, United Kingdom (AFP)—Charalampos Kostoulas snatched a superb late equaliser as Brighton survived Marcus Tavernier’s controversial penalty to rescue a 1-1 draw against Bournemouth on Monday.\n\nKostoulas netted with a brilliant overhead kick in stoppage-time at the Amex Stadium after Bournemouth led through Tavernier’s dubious first half goal.\n\nBournemouth had taken the lead in the south-coast derby when referee Paul Tierney overturned his decision to book Amine Adli for diving after a challenge from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nVAR official Jarred Gillett told Tierney to consult the pitch-side monitor and the referee agreed to rescind the yellow card, awarding a spot-kick that Tavernier converted.\n\nBut just as Bournemouth were closing on on their first win on the road in 10 matches in all competitions, Greek teenager Kostoulas came to the rescue with his second goal since signing from Olympiakos in July.\n\nBournemouth have now conceded 12 goals in the last 15 minutes of the second half — no team has allowed more in the Premier League this season.\n\nKostoulas’ dramatic leveller kept Brighton three points ahead of Bournemouth in mid-table.\n\n“It’s difficult to speak to the referees. They always have their own opinion,” Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said of the penalty.\n\n“A touch and a contact is not enough, and that is what the referees said to us before the start of the season. And in certain moments they don’t do it, that’s just the truth, and we’ve got to accept.”\n\nBournemouth manager Andoni Iraola added: “At the end, we are in that moment in the season when everything is against us. We don’t have this little bit of luck that you need.\n\n“They scored an incredible goal, an overhead kick, top corner, and you finish with a point.\n\n“It’s a big shame because the players have done an incredible effort. They were dead at the end.”\n\nBournemouth took the lead in contentious fashion in the 32nd minute.\n\nAdli was initially booked for diving as Verbruggen sprawled at his feet in the penalty area.\n\nHowever, Tierney was told to check the pitch-side monitor and the referee rescinded the yellow card, giving Bournemouth a spot-kick for the contact from Verbruggen’s leg on Adli’s thigh.\n\nFurious Brighton fans chanted “you’re not fit to referee” at Tierney, but Tavernier ignored the row as he drilled the penalty past Verbruggen.\n\nBrighton winger Kaoru Mitoma was making his 100th Premier League appearance, the third Japanese player to reach the milestone after Maya Yoshida and Shinji Okazaki.\n\nThe 28-year-old’s goal earned a draw at Manchester City in Brighton’s last league game and he went close with a curler that flashed over early in the second half.\n\nBrighton defender Lewis Dunk headed wastefully wide before Yankuba Minteh’s drive was well saved by Djordje Petrovic.\n\nBut Hurzeler’s team kept pushing and snatched an equaliser in the first minute of stoppage-time.\n\nJan Paul van Hecke’s knockdown reached Kostoulas and the 19-year-old striker took a touch on his chest before guiding a brilliant bicycle kick past Petrovic from 10 yards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Brighton Charalampos Kostoulas Marcus Tavernier \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gov’t strengthening health system to meet hurricane, flu demands \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n ST ANN, Jamaica—The Government is taking steps to strengthen health services and address rising demand, as it responds to the combined impact of Hurri... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US Treasury chief says retaliatory EU tariffs over Greenland ‘unwise’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n DAVOS, Switzerland (AFP)—US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned European nations on Monday against retaliatory tariffs over President Donald Trump... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Early exit for Jamaicans at 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Champs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Zandre Roye and Oshae Haye exited the 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Championship (LAAC) at the Lima Golf Club in Peru, after not ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gunmen kidnap 163 worshippers from two Nigerian churches—clergy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KANO, Nigeria (AFP)—Armed gangs kidnapped at least 163 Christian worshippers after storming two churches in Nigeria's northern Kaduna State on Sunday,... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Holness urges vigilance against exploitation of ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Prime Minister Andrew Holness has cautioned beneficiaries of the Restoration of Owner or Occupant Family Shelters (ROOFS) initiativ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $158.26 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, January 19, ended trading at $158.26, down by 4 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Lifestyle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival serves up stellar lineup on Jan 31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n A number of stirring features are to be showcased at this year’s third annual Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival being presented by the Consulate... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

[The] impact of Hurricane Melissa, where at least six parishes had major impact to health infrastructure. Over 105 of the 325 health centres that we have, have been impacted by the hurricane,” he noted.\n\nThe minister added that even parishes spared the worst of the damage continue to feel the effects.\n\n“This parish of St Ann, though among the least impacted, has nevertheless been affected,” Dr Tufton pointed out.\n\nAlongside hurricane recovery efforts, the minister noted that the health system is simultaneously managing its usual seasonal flu surge.\n\n“We’re going through the flu season where we normally have a spike in the attendance at our health facilities of persons who want help because of flu-like symptoms, respiratory-related illnesses. That amplifies some of the other chronic illnesses, such as] diabetes. So you get a spike in the demand on services at our accident and emergency wards, if not at our health centres,” Dr Tufton explained.\n\nHe highlighted concerns raised by several health workers and underscored that the Government is mindful of the challenges they face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Dr Christopher Tufton Hurricane Melissa influenza season \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US Treasury chief says retaliatory EU tariffs over Greenland ‘unwise’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n DAVOS, Switzerland (AFP)—US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned European nations on Monday against retaliatory tariffs over President Donald Trump... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Early exit for Jamaicans at 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Champs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Zandre Roye and Oshae Haye exited the 11th Latin America Amateur Golf Championship (LAAC) at the Lima Golf Club in Peru, after not ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gunmen kidnap 163 worshippers from two Nigerian churches—clergy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KANO, Nigeria (AFP)—Armed gangs kidnapped at least 163 Christian worshippers after storming two churches in Nigeria's northern Kaduna State on Sunday,... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Holness urges vigilance against exploitation of ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Prime Minister Andrew Holness has cautioned beneficiaries of the Restoration of Owner or Occupant Family Shelters (ROOFS) initiativ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $158.26 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, January 19, ended trading at $158.26, down by 4 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Lifestyle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival serves up stellar lineup on Jan 31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n A number of stirring features are to be showcased at this year’s third annual Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival being presented by the Consulate... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shelters across Jamaica to be improved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—Shelters across Jamaica are to be improved as the Government moves to strengthen national disaster preparedness ahead of the upcomin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 19, 2026\n\n\n\n\n US Treasury chief says retaliatory EU tariffs over Greenland ‘unwise’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland (AFP)—US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned European nations on Monday against retaliatory tariffs over President Donald Trump’s threatened levies to obtain control of Greenland.\n\n“I think it would be very unwise,” Bessent told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.\n\nHe said Trump wanted control of the autonomous Danish territory because he considers it a “strategic asset” and “we are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else”.\n\nAsked about Trump’s message to Norway’s prime minister, in which he appeared to link his Greenland push to not winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Bessent said: “I don’t know anything about the president’s letter to Norway.”\n\nHe added, however, that “I think it’s a complete canard that the president will be doing this because of the Nobel Prize”.\n\nTrump said at the weekend that, from February 1, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden would be subject to a 10-percent tariff on all goods sent to the United States until Denmark agrees to cede Greenland.\n\nThe announcement has drawn angry charges of “blackmail” from the US allies, and Germany’s vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil said Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures.\n\nAsked later Monday on the chances for a deal that would not involve acquiring Greenland, Bessent said “I would just take President Trump at his word for now”.\n\n“How did the US get the Panama Canal?

(Photo by Light Oriye Tamunotonye / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 19, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Gunmen kidnap 163 worshippers from two Nigerian churches—clergy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKANO, Nigeria (AFP)—Armed gangs kidnapped at least 163 Christian worshippers after storming two churches in Nigeria’s northern Kaduna State on Sunday, a member of the clergy told AFP.\n\nGangs known in Nigeria as “bandits” frequently carry out mass kidnappings for ransom and loot villages, mainly in the northern and central parts of Africa’s most populous country.\n\nSunday’s attacks are the latest in a wave of kidnappings targeting both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria.\n\n“The attackers came in numbers and blocked the entrance of the churches and forced the worshippers out into the bush,” Reverend Joseph Hayab, head of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said on Monday.\n\n“The actual number they took was 172 but nine escaped, so 163 are with them,” added Hayab.\n\nIshaku Dan’azumi, a traditional chief of Kurmin Wali said 166 people were seized from three churches in the village during Sunday service.\n\nA security report prepared for the United Nations said “armed bandits” attacked multiple churches in the area on Sunday, abducting “over 100 worshippers”.\n\nKaduna state police did not confirm the attack. But its chief told reporters after in Kaduna city that officers responded and went to the “alleged scene of crime” on Sunday.\n\n“Till now there is no information about any attack or any kidnapping,” police commissioner Muhammad Rabiu said in remarks broadcast on a local tv channel.\n\nState commissioner for internal security Sule Shauibu dismissed the “narrative” about the kidnapping as “totally false, we do not have any evidence of such”.\n\nLocal chief Wali told AFP that “It is only politicians that are denying the kidnapping of our people.”\n\n“They took away 177 people from three churches but 11 managed to escape. We now have 166 people in the hands of the kidnappers,” he said.\n\nHe said his village has lived under threat from gunmen “who kidnap our people. This has affected our farming activities as we grow less food than we used to.\n\n“We have never complained to the authorities over kidnappings in our area as we have been the ones contributing to pay for the freedom of those kidnapped. Sometimes up to 20 are abducted and we have never complained, we have been dealing with the problem on our own”.\n\n“This time we complained to the authorities because the number of those kidnapped is beyond our capacity to deal with,” he said.\n\nRoughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, Nigeria is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims, often without distinction.\n\nIn November, armed gangs seized more than 300 students and teachers from a Catholic school in Niger state, with 50 escaping and the rest being released in two batches weeks later.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has latched onto the insecurity in Nigeria, focusing on the killing of Christians and putting Abuja under diplomatic pressure.\n\nIn late December, the United States launched strikes on what it and the Nigerian government said were militants linked to the Islamic State group in the northwestern Sokoto state. Nigeria said it approved the strikes.\n\n– More attacks ‘likely’ –\n\nKaduna is one of several states in northwest and central Nigeria that have for years been terrorised by criminal gangs who raid villages, abduct residents and burn homes after looting them.\n\nKajuru district is a hotspot for bandit attacks in Kaduna State, which has witnessed clashes between Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders.\n\nThe violence centres around competition for land and dwindling resources, although on the surface it falls along ethnic and religious lines.\n\nNigeria’s kidnappings are predominantly for ransom and the crisis has “consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry” that raised some $1.66 million between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Church Nigeria worshippers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Holness urges vigilance against exploitation of ROOFS programme \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Prime Minister Andrew Holness has cautioned beneficiaries of the Restoration of Owner or Occupant Family Shelters (ROOFS) initiativ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $158.26 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Monday, January 19, ended trading at $158.26, down by 4 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Lifestyle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival serves up stellar lineup on Jan 31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n A number of stirring features are to be showcased at this year’s third annual Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival being presented by the Consulate... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shelters across Jamaica to be improved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—Shelters across Jamaica are to be improved as the Government moves to strengthen national disaster preparedness ahead of the upcomin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nhu Van Nguyen to visit Jamaica, ahead of Miss Global Jamaica coronation show \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n Twenty-six young ladies are vying for the title of Miss Global Jamaica 2026 and for a chance to represent Jamaica at Miss Global 2026.

The scale and scope of the horror of recent global events seem to dwarf much of what has transpired since the Second World War. The distressing litany of post-war global affairs that comprise Billy Joel’s seminal song “We Didn’t Start the Fire” pales in comparison to what has led to the present moment. Convicted felon Donald Trump now sits at the helm of the most powerful nation in the world, quite possibly with no intentions of leaving. He embarks on a ruthless, murderous campaign of authoritarian rule marked by tyrannical practices at home and unchecked territorial conquest abroad. His Machiavellian approach to world affairs has irreparably set back international laws and standards that have taken decades to build. Meanwhile, genocides abound across the Earth, which also faces an unfolding climate catastrophe as a result of humanity’s mistreatment of the planet. What does it matter in the greater scheme, then, if individual states violate the human right to life by executing human beings guilty of committing some of the worst crimes imaginable?\n\nThe thousands of members of “L’chaim! Jews Against the Death Penalty” – of which I am the co-founder – understand very well why abolishing the death penalty matters. Many of us see the world through the lens of the countless state-sponsored killings that continue to proliferate. Members view this as an existential threat to humanity on an individual level. We certainly do recognize that prodigious disasters are unfolding in our world, including the impending calamity of irreversible climate change, and the ever-worsening plagues of hatred, xenophobia, violence, and killing. That reality, however, does not make the execution of any one individual by any government any less urgent.\n\nWe turn to our Jewish tradition as we juxtapose the value of one human life with the survival of our species and our planet. The Talmud famously teaches that “Whoever destroys a life, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.” (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5). Various other spiritual traditions make a similar point. That sentiment invites a related rhetorical corollary: Is humanity worth saving at all if we are only going to continue unnecessarily killing each other?\n\nL’chaim has outlined time and again the manifold reasons why the abject abomination that the death penalty represents merits expeditious abolition, without exception. Capital punishment violates the human right of life, it always constitutes torture, risks executing the innocent, is racist in its application, and – from Adolph Hitler to Trump to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and National Security Minister Ben-Gvir – is used as a political tool, particularly for election campaigns. L’chaim has also illustrated how Jewish tradition makes the death penalty virtually impossible, and how many execution methods are direct Nazi legacies, including firing squad, gassing, and lethal injection. Famed death penalty abolitionist Elie Wiesel best articulated L’chaim’s stance when he said of capital punishment that – in the shadow of the Holocaust – “death should never be the answer in a civilized society.” Lawmakers should heed Wiesel’s message and realize that executions are not today – and never will be – the correct answer.\n\nThe current debate in the Knesset over Israel’s proposed death penalty for terrorists bill underscores the need for renewed attention and redoubled efforts in death penalty abolition. The stakes for the future of Jewish civilization could not be higher as Israeli society considers inviting this manufactured Angel of Death back to its shores. First and foremost, rather than deterring acts of terrorism, the death penalty would instead incite and invite more shaheeds – martyrs – to attack Israel. Furthermore, if the Knesset were to enact this medieval bill and the unconscionable stain of executions were to succeed in darkening what remains of the moral fabric of Israeli society, antisemitic extremists would assuredly blame all Jews for their state’s sponsored murder program, neatly fitting it into their warped view of Israel – and, by extension, Judaism – as a so-called “Death Cult.” Just as this bill jeopardizes the safety and security of Jews across the globe in this way, it also threatens to permanently mar what remains of Israel’s moral standing among the more than 70% of world nations that have abolished the death penalty in law and practice. In the highly volatile political climate that now imperils the rule of law in Israel, this issue also further normalizes the invocation of state violence. It widens the gap between modern-day Israel and the central Jewish value of the inviolability of life. Last but not least, the latest iteration of Israel’s proposed death penalty bill for convicted terrorists provides undeniable evidence of how quickly any procedural safeguards and notions of humanitarian practices evaporate once a civilization opens itself to the veritable danse macabre of state-sponsored killing. Attorney Robert Dunham, Director of the Death Penalty Policy Project and former Executive Director of the Death Penalty Information Center, encapsulated it most tellingly when he wrote that the current bill “is a walking human rights violation—including denial of meaningful access to counsel, non-unanimous sentencing votes in military trials, no possibility of reversing or commuting a sentence, etc.”\n\nIsraeli lawmakers would do well to realize that any nation that engages in the blatant human rights violation that is capital punishment inherently becomes unfit for civilized humanity. History has demonstrated and will continue to reveal that the death penalty not only condemns individuals to death, but it also morally condemns any civilization that enacts it. May Israel not follow this ill-fated path now. Instead, may it join the growing number of world nations that have finally put an end to this barbaric practice.\n\nIn the ancient Jewish text Pirkei Avot – Ethics of the Fathers – Rabbi Tarfon famously taught: “It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it.” (2: 16) L’chaim’s advocacy for death penalty abolition will not itself save the world. Still, it will assuredly help move the needle forward for the desperately needed advancement of civilized humanity in Israel and across the globe. There are few more sacred tasks to undertake in life than this – the protection of the inviolability of life itself.

Throughout the day there are special presentations with the curtains being drawn at 5pm following two hours of short films being shown.\n\nThe event, in recognition of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee Day on January 9, was also created, says Consul General Oliver Mair, “to celebrate our creative industries, specifically our writers and filmmakers.\n\n“It’s an event that’s a platform to tell our stories to the world – about our worth and who we are as a people,” he said.\n\nNew, will be a “Children’s Corner” of adopted Ring-Ding game and cultural activities of revered Jamaican icon, the late Louise Bennett Coverly, popularly known as Miss Lou, with children also being taught to make movies by film writer, director and producer Cleon A James. \n\nThe Children’s Corner will be staged in an area that will also highlight exhibitions by upcoming artists. A day of festive poetry and prose, there will be the usual topical panel discussions. Among the special presentations will be the theatre like production unveiling of the acronym Brew, each letter with the accompanying words highlighting ‘what’s brewing’ at the event at the very start of the presentations at 10am.\n\nBetween the respective segments there will be video features of accounts of resilience, as Jamaica continues to rebound from Hurricane Melissa, showing people putting back the pieces.\n\nThe story of author and farmer Keith Wedderburn will be told from his latest book Give Thanks For Life – Surviving Hurricane Melissa. Leading the conversation on stage on the topic of resilience in the devastation of Melissa will be acclaimed dub poet Malachi Smith. Founder of the Jamaica Poets Nomadic College and School Tour, he will share stories of the eighth annual tour to Jamaica last December (after the tour was first postponed in November) to a number of schools in the hardest hit areas across the island.\n\nGiven the event serving as a curtain raiser to Black History Month, and the accompanying cultural reflections, special presentations will also mark a closer look at Alexander Bedward and his efforts at forming the Jamaica Native Free Baptist Church. It challenged the colonial order and the established churches which were losing their membership to Bedwardism and in an effort to get rid of him he was portrayed and eventually certified as mentally ill. The Talawah Mento Band and Jamaican Folk Revue will be performing pieces from their upcoming musical Bedward as part of a closer look at these intriguing developments. \n\nThe short film segment, with another highlight on making movies, will also celebrate the life of the legendary Jimmy Cliff.\n\nThe festival will feature a range of multifaceted authors and poets, including Sharon Gordon – author, actress, producer and media personality. The winner of the 2025 fourth annual storytelling competition, What’s Your Story Jamaica, her self-narrated audio book Sheribaby has achieved the milestone of being the first audiobook in Jamaican dialect to receive Grammy consideration. \n\nAmong those also appearing at the 2026 Jamaica Brew are Kacy Garvey, Richard Blackford, Simone Russell, multilingual storyteller Raul ‘Blaze’ Davis, attorney Kaysia Earley, journalist and marketer Curtis Myrie, Oberlene Smith Whyte, Dr Aza Weir-Soley and leading communications specialist Gail Abrahams with her first publication, Heels, Hustle, HEART – Claiming your seat without losing yourself, a powerful and honest guide for women navigating the corporate life while staying true to themselves.\n\nAdmission is free to the public, but registration is required at jamaicabrew2026.eventbrite.com where inquiries may also be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Florida Jamaica Brew Literary and Film Festival Oliver Mair Pembroke Pines \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Shelters across Jamaica to be improved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—Shelters across Jamaica are to be improved as the Government moves to strengthen national disaster preparedness ahead of the upcomin... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Nhu Van Nguyen to visit Jamaica, ahead of Miss Global Jamaica coronation show \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n Twenty-six young ladies are vying for the title of Miss Global Jamaica 2026 and for a chance to represent Jamaica at Miss Global 2026.

Our journeys have shown that pageantry is more than a moment and that it can be a movement. We’ve committed to inspiring realistic change for women, both here in Jamaica and globally,” Greenwood shared in an interview with Observer Online.\n\nNational director of Miss Global Jamaica, Jermane Blair, described the moment as one that transcends ceremony.\n\n“This visit is as inspirational as it is historic.

The service comes at no additional cost to customers.\n\n“Voice over WiFi gives our customers greater reliability and more ways to stay connected,” said Danielle Savory, senior manager of communications. “As Jamaica advances further into its digital future, Flow remains committed to delivering technology that empowers people and keeps communication flowing.”\n\nVoWiFi enhances voice connectivity by allowing calls to be made over Wi-Fi, complementing Flow’s mobile network. This gives customers added flexibility to stay connected in locations where Wi-Fi provides the best calling experience.\n\nVoWi-Fi calls are billed as standard phone calls and work seamlessly in the background, switching between mobile and Wi-Fi networks when applicable to maintain call quality.\n\nCustomers with limited or no mobile coverage, including those in buildings with dense walls, remote locations, or underground areas, will experience improved call clarity and reliability.\n\nVoWiFi also offers global convenience as customers can make and receive calls over Wi-Fi from anywhere in the world.\n\nTo activate VoWi-Fi, customers need a compatible device, an active Flow LTE SIM, and access to a secure Wi-Fi network.\n\nOn Android: Go to settings>network & internet>mobile network> Wi-Fi calling and toggle on.\n\nOn iPhone: Go to settings> phone & Wi-Fi calling and enable Wi-Fi calling on this iPhone.\n\nEnsure Wi-Fi is connected and airplane mode is off.\n\nOnce enabled, a small VoWiFi or Wi-Fi Call icon will appear in the status bar, indicating that the device is connected and ready to make calls over Wi-Fi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Flow Wi-Fi calling Wi-Fi connection \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Toni Ann Singh mines gold in Canada for Burna Boy and Popcaan \n\n\n\n\n BY KEVIN JACKSON Observer Writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 19, 2026 \n\n\n The 2022 hit song Toni Ann Singh by Afrobeats star Burna Boy and Popcaan was certified gold in Canada on Monday.

his critics are somewhat more subdued after the ferocious pace of events in 2025.﻿\n\nSo what does the year ahead hold?\n\nTrump opened 2026 with the brazen abduction of Venezuelan president ﻿Nicolas Maduro, sending US troops into the capital of Caracas.\n\nHe has since radically ramped up his demand for US control of Greenland for so-called \"security\" reasons, despite the fact that a decades-old treaty allows the US military widespread access to the island.\n\nREAD MORE: Protesters storm church where ICE agent is a pastor﻿\n\nAnd he's floated suggestions of cancelling the mid-term elections and securing a possible - if unconstitutional - third term﻿ in office.\n\nTrump thrives on being perceived as unpredictable, but in these cases, one expert says, we should take him at his word.\n\n\"I think Trump has told us what is on his agenda,\" The Australia Institute's international and security affairs program director Dr Emma Shortis told 9news.com.au.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Harry's court battle against British tabloids reaches final chapter﻿\n\nShe said on the Greenland issue, Trump by now had \"talked himself into a position where he almost can't not act\".\n\nMeanwhile, European leaders were \"scrambling\" to respond, but Shortis said they had options available that could hurt the US﻿, including their anti-coercion responses.\n\nBut Shortis doubted that would be enough to sway the White House, which has imposed its own tariffs on European allies, a year after Trump made them the centrepiece of his return to power.\n\n\"As our prime minister has said, tariffs are 'an act of self-harm', but Trump doesn't care about that,\" she said.\n\nDomestically, she said, Trump was almost certainly serious about invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops against protesters in Minneapolis and other cities where citizens are battling ICE.\n\nBut the possibility of that actually taking place was \"very unpredictable\" depending on the public response.\n\n﻿The key to understanding the breakneck audacity of the second Trump administration, Shortis said, lies in the composition of the president's inner circle.\n\nThe fabled \"adults in the room\" are almost entirely absent this time around.\n\n\"I don't want to give them too much credit, but they did curb (Trump's) worst impulses,\" Shortis said.\n\nAdded to that, Trump himself and the people around him, such as senior advisor Stephen Miller, had a much keener understanding of the possibilities of presidential power - and no interest in keeping to traditional norms.\n\n\"This was a generational election victory for the Republican Party,\" Shortis said.\n\nThat was also why people should take seriously Trump's suggestion that the mid-term elections this year be cancelled.\n\n\"He will joke, he will fly kites, he will normalise it,\" she said.\n\n\"People will write their cute explainers about the law and the Constitution and that will normalise the idea further.\n\n\"They want to hold onto power.\"\n\nTypically, the US mid-terms see the president's party lose seats in the House, where Republicans hold a wafer-thin majority.\n\nBut as relatively unpopular as Trump appears to be, Shortis said he was \"so good\" at controlling the narrative, and with such a loyal base, that the results this time were less predictable.\n\nAdditionally, the Democrats are wallowing in historic levels of unpopularity as well, widely perceived as \"weak and indecisive\" and more focused on internal disputes between party factions.\n\n﻿Meanwhile, the potentially galvanising issue of the Epstein files has been silenced by Trump's recent moves in Venezuela and his rhetoric on Iran and Greenland, as well as the ordered release being smothered and delayed by the US Department of Justice.\n\nBut Shortis said it was unlikely all of the White House's recent actions were motivated to keep the files out of the headlines.\n\n\"I'm not totally convinced Trump is just distracting,\" she said.\n\n\"They are committed to this radical reshaping of American society, and of the world.\"\n\nFurther ahead\n\nShortis laughed at the idea of trying to predict the next moves of the Trump presidency beyond the next few months - particularly to the end of Trump's term in 2028.\n\nBut she fully expected the administration in some form to attempt to keep him in power past his term limit, even as potential successors like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance weigh their chances.\n\n\"(Trump) is convinced, probably rightly, that he created this movement and only he can lead it, direct it,\" Shortis said.\n\n\"There isn't a clear successor to Trump.\"\n\nTrump's legacy, in part, she said, was the final destruction of trust in many American institutions, including DOGE-gutted government agencies - but she said that was not a problem he had created.\n\n\"Trust was already eroded by the time Trump came along, it's what allowed him to succeed,\" Shortis said.\n\nThe \"political will and capital\" needed for a new administration to rebuild that trust and create a \"new America\" would be huge, she said.\n\n\"Then again, the United States is quite remarkably good at rebuilding itself,\" she said.\n\n\"The America we thought we knew before Trump is not coming back.\"﻿\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Trump is in Miami to witness the Miami Hurricanes go head-to-head with the Indiana Hoosiers in the 2026 CFP national championship on Monday, January 19. As the national anthem played and Trump was featured on the big screen, a resounding wave of noise filled the stadium - initial cheers were met with boos from some sections of the crowd, reports the Express .. The match will see the top-ranked Indiana face off against the tenth-ranked Miami for the national title in Miami, Florida. The White House has confirmed that President Donald Trump will be present at the game, accompanied by Florida native Marco Rubio , the current Secretary of State and former senator of the sunshine state. Trump's attendance forms part of his itinerary for Martin Luther King Day, marking his third College Football Playoff (CFB) national championship game. He previously attended the 2018 Alabama Georgia game along with the 2020 Clemson LSU match-up. While those in the stands are primarily there to savour the game, America and the world will be tuning in tonight with their attention firmly on the US President, who continues to ruffle feathers among European leaders with sanctions as he persists with his campaign to annex Greenland . The match takes place just days after an NBA game was held in London on Sunday, during which a spectator from the crowd shouted out in protest against the US President's endeavours regarding Greenland.

Granddaughter Kai, the eldest child of Donald Trump Jr, was also in attendance with her mom Vanessa. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio joined the group on the night and was even seen walking on the field prior to kickoff.\n\nAfter arriving at the stadium, Trump was seen waving to fans from behind the bulletproof glass in his VIP suite as he prepared to watch the game unfold.\n\nDonald Trump has made his grand arrival at Hard Rock Stadium ahead of the national title game\n\nThe president was joined at the College Football Playoff final by his daughter Ivanka (right)\n\nTrump's granddaughter, aspiring golfer Kai (left), was also seen in his VIP suite at the game\n\nNFL risks Trump fury again with controversial choice of Super Bowl performer after Bad Bunny rage\n\nWhen he was shown on the big screen during the American national anthem, the president appeared to get a huge ovation from the crowd inside Hard Rock Stadium. \n\nIndiana are strong favorites to win and have Heisman trophy winner Fernando Mendoza at quarterback, the man widely expected to be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft at the end of April, which is held by the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nHowever, Trump might be supporting the Hurricanes given his teenage granddaughter, Kai, is on a golf scholarship in Miami.\n\nThe 79-year-old has attended college football's showpiece game before. In 2018, he watched the first half between Alabama and Georgia at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.\n\nTrump also became the first sitting president in history to attend a Super Bowl in 2025 when he headed to New Orleans to watch the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs, who were on the verge of a three-peat.\n\nAside from football, he made high-profile appearances at the Ryder Cup, NASCAR's Daytona 500, a New York Yankees game on the anniversary of 9/11 and UFC 316 since returning to the Oval Office.\n\nIt's a trend that is set to continue in 2026 far beyond the college final. The United States is hosting the World Cup, starting in June where Gianni Infantino, who leads soccer's governing body FIFA, has gone to to great lengths to forge a friendship with Trump.\n\nIvanka's husband Jared Kushner (right) and their two sons joined them at Hard Rock Stadium\n\nEric Trump's wife Lara (left) was also present with her young daughter Carolina (bottom right) \n\nThe president has made attending sporting events an integral part of his second term\n\nHe is in attendance as Fernando Mendoza looks to inspire Indiana to the national championship\n\nTrump has also scheduled a UFC event to be held at the White House on June 14, which coincides with his 80th birthday, amid his close friendship with Dana White, the MMA promotion's CEO.\n\nFurthermore, the next Super Bowl is held on February 8 in Santa Clara, just outside of San Francisco. There is no word yet on if Trump will attend but it is possible, given previous form.\n\nAs for Monday's game itself, a Hoosiers victory would complete one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of college football.\n\nWhen Curt Cignetti was appointed as the team's head coach in November 2023, they had a miserable 9-26 record since 2020 in three consecutive losing seasons.\n\nNow, lead by Mendoza, the team are on the brink of glory and are 15-0 going into Monday night's game.\n\nIndianaMarco Rubio\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump enjoys family night out with Ivanka and Kai at college football playoff final as he gets raucous reception from fans in Miami\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Sport has played an integral role in Trump's second term as president, with the Commander-in-Chief attending countless events since being re-elected back in November 2024.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-football/article-15478731/donald-trump-ivanka-kai-miami-college-football-playoff.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/20/00/105649449-0-image-m-22_1768869340731.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:12:43","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.479},{"id":394354188,"title":"Trump appears at college football national championship","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSports Ncaa Fb January 19, 2026 00:23 \n\n Trump appears at college football national championship \n President Donald Trump sits with Ivanka and Kai at the college football national championship.

US markets will return on Tuesday following a public holiday for Martin Luther King Jr Day.\nInvestors were dumping dollar assets on \"fears of prolonged uncertainty, strained alliances, a loss of confidence in US leadership, potential retaliation and an acceleration of de-dollarisation trends,\" said Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG in Sydney.\n\"While there are hopes the US administration may soon de-escalate these threats, as it has with prior tariff announcements, it is clear that securing Greenland remains a core national security objective for the current administration,\" he added.\nThe yield on the US 10-year Treasury bond was up 3.0 basis points at 4.2586%. Fed funds futures are pricing an implied 94.5% probability that the U.S. central bank will remain on hold at its next two-day meeting next week, little changed from Friday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was flat at 158.175 yen after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called snap elections for Feb 8. Her vow to suspend an 8% sales tax on food for two years has focused attention on the country's shaky public finances.\nAgainst the Chinese yuan trading offshore in Hong Kong, the dollar was holding steady at 6.9536 yuan.

The showdown, on top of other tensions with Trump, is bringing home to many in Europe that the relationship has turned toxic.\n\n“Donald Trump has destroyed Western cohesion,\" said Carlo Calenda, a centrist Italian senator and longtime Atlanticist who now argues the Trump administration is a threat to Europe’s democracies. “Europe needs to make itself impermeable to every interference\" by outside powers, whether the U.S. or Russia, he said. But so far, he said, “the Europeans don’t have the strength.\"\n\nEurope has understood for years that it needs to do more for its own security—and it has begun rearming, prompted both by U.S. pressure and by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But until this past year, Europe’s capitals were aiming for a more equal partnership with Washington within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Now they are watching the future of that partnership crumble.\n\n“This past weekend felt like a turning point,\" said Rachel Ellehuus, the director general of the London-based defense-studies think tank Royal United Services Institute and a former top U.S. adviser in NATO. Ellehuus said it was remarkable to see thousands of people in both Greenland and Denmark, long among the U.S.’s closest allies, protesting the U.S.’s actions.\n\nBreaking up would be hard for the U.S., too. NATO has given Washington political influence across Europe and a network of bases that helps American power projection worldwide. European countries are also some of the biggest customers for U.S. defense companies, as well as one of the U.S.’s most important partners for trade and investment more broadly. Ellehuus said she expects Europe to now rely more heavily on its own defense companies to rearm.\n\nFrom economics to security, the relationship between the U.S. and Europe is one of the closest and deepest that the world has ever seen, so unwinding it won’t happen quickly. Some analysts also say the alliance has survived other crises in the past, including being on different sides in the crisis over the Suez Canal in the 1950s.\n\n“I think in a few weeks, this will all be solved,\" said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council think tank. While the threat to use military force against a NATO ally is unprecedented, Trump often escalates to strike a deal and often backs down when there is real pushback. Both sides, Kroenig said, will realize they have more to lose than gain from confrontation.\n\nIf not, expect Europe to fight back. For all Europe’s desire to defuse the Greenland dispute, “there is a strong sense that a line has to be drawn,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, head of Europe at political-risk consulting firm Eurasia Group. “The U.S. acquiring Greenland through hostile means—either military or economic coercion—would be unacceptable, and would set a very dangerous precedent,\" he said.\n\nEuropean diplomats describe the relationship with the White House as descending into the purely transactional. They say that on Greenland, creative solutions could potentially be found but are currently impossible given Trump’s threats and demands and uncertainty over why he really wants control of the island. Keeping heads down and avoiding confrontation with Trump is no longer working, diplomats say, making some European pushback necessary.\n\nMartin Jacob, a trade and tax expert at IESE Business School in Spain, said increasing numbers of Europeans are willing to pay an economic price if a trade war breaks out over Greenland, he said. There is also the sense Trump needs to be confronted or he won’t stop. “What’s next, Iceland?\" he said.\n\nA YouGov poll on Monday showed 67% of Brits back retaliatory tariffs if Trump goes ahead with additional tariffs on European allies, with only 14% opposed. Even Europe’s right-wing antiestablishment parties, who are Trump’s natural allies on the continent, have criticized Trump’s threats, including British populist Nigel Farage.\n\nThe past year has seen Vice President JD Vance lambasting European allies at a security conference in Munich, Vance and Trump humiliating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, Trump threatening European countries repeatedly with tariffs and the White House pushing to end the Russia-Ukraine war on terms favorable to Moscow while attacking European allies in its new national-security strategy.\n\nFor much of this year, White House officials have spoken of NATO as if it were a foreign entity—rather than an alliance that the U.S. built and leads. The Ukraine peace plan proposed by the Trump administration cast the U.S. as a mediator between NATO and Russia.\n\n“NATO, for Europeans, was a religion. It led to Europeans not being serious about defense. Suddenly we understand that if American commitment to European allies is not real, then no treaty is going to defend you,\" said Ivan Krastev, a political scientist and head of the Centre for Liberal Strategies, a think tank in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\n“We are living in revolutionary times,\" said Krastev. “You can see the shock of Europe’s political elites. In Europe, conversation is going to be that, at some point, we will be decoupling from the U.S., and what does that mean?\"\n\nWhat makes the growing alienation from Trump’s America harder for Europe to bear is that the rest of global geopolitics offers little respite.\n\nChina has turned from a lucrative customer for Europe into an industrial steamroller that threatens to crush Europe’s manufacturing sectors, from cars to machinery. Russia under President Vladimir Putin is trying not only to subjugate Ukraine but to rewrite the ending of the Cold War and rebuild Russia’s sphere of influence in Europe’s east.\n\nIncreasingly squeezed between the world’s more muscular powers, Europe is trying to compensate by deepening its trade links with Latin America as well as Asian democracies.\n\nUkraine’s prospects for surviving Russia’s invasion risk falling into the widening gulf between the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. has greatly reduced aid for Kyiv since Trump returned to the White House, but it continues to provide crucial intelligence as well as some military supplies.\n\nThere is deep concern among European officials that Trump might threaten to turn his back entirely on Ukraine to pressure Europe on Greenland, diplomats say. They say that since Trump has escalated his threats on Greenland in the past couple of weeks, there has been next to no progress on hammering out the U.S. role in security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump is once again blaming Ukraine for blocking his efforts to end the war.\n\nMoscow must be enjoying the rise in U.S.-European tensions, say many veterans of the Atlantic alliance.\n\n“Even more important and strategic for Putin than the Donbas and all of Ukraine is the longstanding Russian objective to divide the trans-Atlantic alliance. So recent U.S. actions that break the cohesion and trust within NATO are a gift to Putin,\" said Doug Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and retired U.S. Army lieutenant general.\n\n For Europe, the cost of decoupling from the U.S. would go far beyond money. The region is having to rethink its whole relationship with power, including military force. After two disastrous world wars devastated the continent in the first half of the 20th century, many European countries reprogrammed their political identities to emphasize rules and compromises over muscle-flexing.\n\n The European Union, with its cumbersome culture of consensus-building and give-and-take, was the most elaborate expression of that political way of life. Now the continent that hoped to overcome raw-power politics is watching the wider world revert to it.\n\n “The EU was founded when the world was flat,\" said Calenda, referring to the years of peak optimism that globalization would create a level playing field for people, businesses and nations. “During the end-of-history years, you could be slow, inclusive and believe that force doesn’t matter. Not any more.\"\n\n While many European leaders continue to pay lip service to the need for agreement with the U.S. and the importance of NATO, public opinion in Europe was already showing signs of a backlash against America before Trump increased his pressure over Greenland.\n\n Only 16% of Europeans view the U.S. as an ally that shares the same values, down from 21% in 2024, according to a recent survey conducted in November by the European Council on Foreign Relations, an international think tank.\n\n The decline in the U.K., long the closest U.S. ally in Europe, was stark: down to 25%, from 37% a year earlier.\n\n Europeans also have their pride and don’t like to see their countries being pushed around, said Jérémie Gallon, a French foreign-affairs expert and head of Europe for trade-and-policy consulting firm McLarty Associates.\n\n “People are starting to feel that the sense of humiliation, and vassalization, is at a point that is unacceptable,\" he said.\n\n Write to Marcus Walker at Marcus.Walker@wsj.com and David Luhnow at david.luhnow@wsj.com","url":"https://www.livemint.com/global/europe-contends-with-a-big-new-threat-the-us-11768870943887.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/20/1600x900/logo/im-36064522_1768870947853_1768871058879.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:05:20","author":"Marcus Walker","authors":["Marcus Walker"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":394351810,"title":"Stephen Miller orders local law enforcement in Minnesota to 'stand down and surrender' amid ICE protests","text":"Stephen Miller claimed that local law enforcement in Minneapolis have been 'ordered to stand down and surrender' amid local protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n\nMiller is the architect of Donald Trump's immigration policy and has strongly backed ICE in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Good earlier this month. \n\nNew York Post columnist Miranda Devine claimed that 'local cops have gone AWOL' after Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said his city was 'under siege' from ICE agents. \n\nMiller wrote in response on social media Monday: 'Only federal officers are upholding the law. Local and state police have been ordered to stand down and surrender.' \n\nA spokesperson for the Minneapolis Police Department told The Daily Mail they had not gotten such an order.\n\n'Those claims are untrue,' Sergeant Garrett Parten said. \n\nThe Daily Mail has also reached out to Mayor Frey and ICE for comment. \n\nMiller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and his homeland security adviser, has promised to oversee the 'largest deportation operation in American history' by targeting the country's estimated 11 million undocumented migrants.\n\nHe recently told The Charlie Kirk Show that protesters in Minnesota are trying to take down the Trump government. \n\n'Understand that this is clearly an insurgency against the federal government. They are describing a federal government as an occupying force. Just think about that for a second.' \n\nMiller added that they would seek charges 'not just against rioters but against government officials who are abetting and encouraging' riots. \n\nHis latest words come the day after a shocking protest at a St Paul church that saw Sunday services interrupted by left wing agitators. \n\nProtesters interrupted Sunday service at Cities Church in St Paul, angrily demanding 'ICE out' and accusing a senior leader of the church of working with the agency. \n\nOne demonstrator said they were 'demanding justice for' Renee Good, the 37-year-old Minneapolis mother fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross earlier this month.\n\n'This will not stand, they cannot pretend to be a house of God, while harboring someone who is commanding ICE agents to terrorize our communities,' Nekima Levy Armstrong said.\n\nThe protester was being questioned by Don Lemon, who followed the marchers as they stormed into the service.\n\nThe protest action disrupted the Sunday services, with many worshippers leaving in disgust after being harassed by the protesters. \n\n'These people have come into our house and they've interrupted our worship. Everybody's gone home, their point has been proven worthless and so, in the end, I think they lose,' said one churchgoer. \n\n'I feel violated, I feel interrupted, I feel angry.' \n\nLemon, who operates as an independent journalist after being fired by CNN, spoke to one of the pastors at Cities Church, who said the protesters refused to have a peaceful dialogue. \n\n'No one is willing to talk. I have to take care of my church and my family,' he said, before asking Lemon to leave.\n\nBondi wrote Sunday that she'd spoken with the pastor and reassured him that any attacks 'are being met with the full force of federal law.'\n\n'If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.'\n\nAssistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said the protesters will be investigated by the DOJ's Civil Rights Division under the FACE Act, which criminalizes using force or threats at churches. \n\nICE's social media account posted Sunday: 'Agitators aren’t just targeting our officers. Now they’re targeting churches, too. They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.'\n\nThey blamed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for 'whipping these mobs into a frenzy and then allowing them to run rampant.'\n\n'We won’t be deterred. ICE isn’t going anywhere.'\n\nThe protests grabbed the attention of Donald Trump, as Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt tweeted: 'President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship. The Department of Justice has launched a full investigation into the despicable incident that took place earlier today at a church in Minnesota.'\n\nLemon may face a federal investigation for joining the mob of protesters.\n\nDhillon warned Lemon on Monday that his antics could land him in hot water, and said the independent journalist is 'on notice.'\n\nIn another social media post, Dhillon said she was in touch with Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI, and said she would be 'all over' Lemon's actions in Minnesota.\n\n'We are investigating potential criminal violations of federal law,' the prosecutor added.","summary":"Stephen Miller claimed that local law enforcement in Minneapolis have been 'ordered to stand down and surrender' amid local protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15478797/Stephen-Miller-law-enforcement-Minnesota.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/19/23/105648153-0-image-m-9_1768865447563.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/01/19/7856535877133551745/1024x576_MP4_7856535877133551745.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:05:15","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Fresh threats from US President Donald Trump's tariffs on select European countries triggered a global risk-off mood, weighing on domestic sentiment. Persistent selling by foreign investors, along with continued weakness in the rupee against the dollar, added to the pressure on Indian equities, keeping participants defensive through the session.Stock market todayOn the outlook of the Nifty 50 index and Sensex today, Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research at Kotak Securities, said, “We are of the view that the current market texture is weak, but a fresh selloff is possible only if 25,500/82,900 is dismissed. Below this level, the market could slip to 25,400-25,350/82,600-82,500. On the flip side, above 25,650/83,500, a pullback move could extend till 25,750-25,800/83,800-84,000. The intraday market is volatile and non-directional; hence, level-based trading is the ideal strategy for day traders.”Speaking on the outlook of the Bank Nifty today, Vatsal Bhuva, Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"On Monday, Bank Nifty took strong support near its 20-day SMA, where buying interest emerged, indicating demand at lower levels. Currently, the index is consolidating with a bullish undertone, as it continues to sustain above its key short-term 20-day SMA. The RSI has moved into a bullish crossover, supporting the positive bias. However, fresh momentum is likely to be regained only if the index closes above 60,000 and sustains that level for the next 2–3 sessions. For the near term, support is placed at 59,500, while resistance is seen at 60,400, defining the expected trading range.\"Silver rate todayIn the early morning trade in the Asian markets, the COMEX silver rate today climbed to a new peak of $94.740 per ounce. Currently at 6:30 AM, the COMEX silver price is quoting $93.750 per ounce, up by around 5.90% from its Monday close.Speaking on the outlook of the MCX silver rates today, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, “The MCX silver rate has decisively broken above ₹3,05,000 levels, and the white metal is poised to touch ₹3,15,000 per kg. On the downside, dips below ₹2,90,000 may test ₹2,85,000, where strong buying interest is likely to emerge.”Gold rate todayIn early morning trade in Asian markets, the COMEX gold price opened with an upside gap and further extended its early morning gains. At 6:30 AM, the COMEX gold price is trading at $4,673.75 per ounce, up around 1.70% from its Monday close.“MCX Gold is holding firm near recent highs around ₹1,44,500 to ₹1,45,000 per kg, preserving a clean higher-high, higher-low structure within a rising channel. The recent peak near ₹1,45,500 highlights strong domestic participation, backed by global strength and a stable USD/INR near 90.70. The 20-day EMA around ₹1,40,400 continues to act as a reliable dynamic support, with dips consistently being bought into. A decisive move above ₹1,45,000 can trigger further upside toward ₹1,46,000 to ₹1,50,000 in the near term. Immediate support is placed in the ₹1,43,000 to ₹1,42,000 zone. The broader trend remains firmly bullish, and the structure favours a buy-on-dips approach,” said Ponmudi R of Enrich Money.USD vs INROn the outlook of INR against the USD, Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst - Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities, said, \"Rupee slipped further to 90.91 down 14p, as early panic in equities followed fresh US tariff moves on the EU, reviving concerns over delays in the India–US trade deal. Rising geopolitical uncertainty, including renewed US expansionary signals, has increased risk aversion and kept emerging market currencies under pressure. The rupee has immediate support near 90.45, while resistance is seen around 91.25.\"Stocks to buy todayRegarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts — Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi; and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, recommended these eight intraday stocks for today: Federal Bank, Torrent Pharma, L&T Finance, Infosys, SAIL, Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Finance, and PB Fintech.Sumeet Bagadia's stocks to buy1] Federal Bank: Buy at ₹279.70, Target ₹300, Stop Loss ₹270.The stock is maintaining a strong upward trajectory.

Trump’s name was not used in the letter.\n\n“Our country’s moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,” the cardinals wrote. “And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity’s well-being now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies.”\n\nCardinal Robert McElroy of Washington, D.C., and Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, co-authored the statement titled “Charting a Moral Vision of American Foreign Policy.”\n\nCupich heads the Archdiocese of Chicago, which includes about 2 million Catholics in Cook and Lake counties.\n\nIn an interview with the Sun-Times on Monday, Cupich said the three cardinals began talking more than a week ago about making a statement that expanded on an address by Pope Leo XIV earlier this month.\n\n“We wanted to make sure that we talked about the important principles,” Cupich said, adding that he hopes Chicago-area Catholics will reflect on the concerns.\n\nThe pope, a Chicago-area native and the first American to lead the worldwide Catholic Church, came out swinging in his address Jan. 9.\n\n“War is back in vogue and a zeal for war is spreading,” Leo said. “The principle established after the Second World War, which prohibited nations from using force to violate the borders of others, has been completely undermined.”\n\nWhite House officials didn’t respond to a request for comment on the cardinals’ missive.\n\nLast year, the pope, who grew up in Dolton as Robert Prevost, criticized Trump’s immigration policies.\n\nThe foreign policy statement Monday also calls out Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Pope Leo has called for the two sides in that conflict to negotiate a peace.\n\nThe cardinals said they “embrace this vision for the establishment of a genuinely moral foreign policy for our nation. We seek to build a truly just and lasting peace, that peace which Jesus proclaimed in the Gospel.”\n\nThey continue: “We renounce war as an instrument for narrow national interests and proclaim that military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations, not a normal instrument of national policy. We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.”\n\nCupich said he and his fellow U.S. cardinals are echoing worries from clergy around the world.\n\n“Cardinals across the globe are sounding the alarm,” he said.\n\nThe statement wasn’t meant to be timed for Monday’s holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Cupich said, but he called it “a wonderful coincidence” to come out on a day to “honor a man who stood for human dignity.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/2026/01/19/cardinal-cupich-catholics-pope-leo-donald-trump-venezuela-greenland","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22458bc/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3865x2577+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2F68%2F13e8a6ac465d819332f3216adacd%2Fpopem","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:03:29","author":"Brett Chase","authors":["Brett Chase"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.429},{"id":394350662,"title":"Trump Ties His Stance on Greenland to Not Getting Nobel Peace Prize","text":"NUUK, Greenland: U.S. President Donald Trump linked his aggressive stance on Greenland to last year’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize, telling Norway’s prime minister that he no longer felt “an obligation to think purely of Peace,” in a text message released Monday. Trump's message to Jonas Gahr Støre appears to ratchet up a standoff between Washington and its closest allies over his threats to take over Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO member Denmark. On Saturday, Trump announced a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight nations that have rallied around Denmark and Greenland, including Norway. Those countries issued a forceful rebuke . Many longtime allies of the U.S. remained resolute that Greenland was not for sale but encouraged Washington to discuss solutions. In a statement on social media, the European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc had “no interest to pick a fight” but would “hold our ground.” The White House has not ruled taking control of the strategic Arctic island by force. Asked whether Trump could invade Greenland, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Monday that “you can’t leave anything out until the president himself has decided to leave anything out.” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also sought to de-escalate tensions Monday. \"I think this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion,” he said, adding that he did not believe military action would occur. Strong opposition in Greenland to U.S. threats In a sign of how tensions have increased in recent days, thousands of Greenlanders marched over the weekend in protest of any effort to take over their island. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Monday that the tariff threats would not change their stance. “We will not be pressured,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for business, minerals, energy, justice and equality, told The Associated Press that she was moved by the quick response of allies to the tariff threat and said it showed that countries realize “this is about more than Greenland.” “I think a lot of countries are afraid that if they let Greenland go, what would be next?” Trump cites Nobel as escalation in text to Norwegian leader Trump’s Sunday message to Gahr Støre, released by the Norwegian government, read in part, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace.” It concluded, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” The White House confirmed the authenticity of the message, with White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly saying that Trump \"is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.” The Norwegian leader said Trump’s message was a reply to an earlier missive sent on behalf of himself and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, in which they conveyed their opposition to the tariff announcement, pointed to a need to de-escalate, and proposed a telephone conversation among the three leaders. “Norway’s position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,” the Norwegian leader said in a statement. “As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.” The Norwegian Nobel Committee is an independent body whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the president’s approach in Greenland during a brief Q&A with reporters in Davos, Switzerland, which is hosting the World Economic Forum meeting this week. “I think it’s a complete canard that the president would be doing this because of the Nobel,” Bessent said, immediately after saying he did not “know anything about the president’s letter to Norway.” Trump has openly coveted the peace prize, which the committee awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last year. Last week, Machado presented her Nobel medal to Trump, who said he planned to keep it, though the committee said the prize can’t be revoked, transferred or shared with others. Trump says he will use tariffs as a bargaining chip In his latest threat of tariffs, Trump indicated the import taxes would be retaliation for last week’s deployment of...","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-ties-his-stance-on-greenland-to-not-getting-nobel-peace-prize-1931439","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/01/20/2001462-aa-62956101.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:02:40","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":394352916,"title":"Democrat Hints at 2028 Presidential Bid Amid Unveiling of Trump’s Private Praise","text":"In an upcoming memoir, a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential race shares insights into a conversation he had with former President Donald Trump after experiencing a personal tragedy last year.\n\nIn “Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service,” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, recounts how Trump reached out to him following an arson attack on his home. The former president left a voicemail, offering his personal cell phone number and encouraging Shapiro to call him whenever needed.\n\nInterestingly, this interaction occurred not long after Trump survived a life-threatening incident at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. During the event, held hours before the 2024 Republican National Convention, Trump was shot at by a gunman named Thomas Crooks, narrowly escaping with a graze to his ear.\n\nWhile Trump does not play a central role in Shapiro’s memoir, this significant exchange between the two figures is highlighted.\n\nAs reported by various sources, Shapiro details how, upon returning Trump’s call, the former president took the opportunity to boast about his administration’s achievements, particularly regarding the economy and gas prices.\n\nThe discussion eventually veered into the realm of politics, with Trump speculating on who might vie for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028. However, Shapiro does not disclose any specific names mentioned by Trump, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post reports Trump complimented Shapiro on how ‘he talked to people and approached problems’ while warning him that he ‘shouldn’t want to be president given how dangerous it had become to hold the office.’\n\nTrump has survived two assassination attempts in 2024 – one in Butler and another at his Florida golf course.\n\nRyan Wesley Routh was convicted in 2025 of attempting to assassinate Trump ‘in a planned sniper attack at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida,’ according to the Department of Justice. Crooks was killed by law enforcement after trying to assassinate the then-candidate.\n\nShapiro, meanwhile, is in an extra vulnerable position due to his Jewish faith, something that has been made an issue by both his friends and his foes.\n\nIn the forthcoming book, Shapiro also writes that former Vice President Harris’s team asked him if he had ever ‘been a double agent for Israel.’\n\nThe timing of the question may have even been more offensive than the premise.\n\nMany leftists had been worried that Shapiro was too pro-Israel and Democrats were concerned his nomination would re-spark controversial conversations about Gaza and would ultimately hurt Harris’ campaign.\n\nThe former vice president addressed some of these concerns in her own memoir, 107 Days, which was released last year.\n\nShe alluded to ‘the attacks [Shapiro had] confronted on Gaza and what effect it might have on the enthusiasm we were trying to build.’\n\nYet she also noted that Shapiro had been critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nCNN reported later Monday that the Harris campaign had also probed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’ ties to China, indicating that her team’s questions about foreign ties weren’t focused solely on Shapiro. \n\nHarris ultimately chose Walz over Shapiro, even as Shapiro was considered to be the favorite to become Harris’ No. 2.\n\nWhat really seemed to motivate Harris to pick Walz over Shapiro was ‘a nagging concern that [Shapiro] would be unable to settle for a role as number two and that it would wear on our partnership,’ according to her memoir.\n\nIn her memoir she described the Pennsylvania governor as someone who was ‘peppering’ her and her staff with questions about the details of the jobs, including details on the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory.\n\nIn his book Shapiro also shared that his own family did not want him to run nationwide at the time, and that his son said he didn’t seem to want to do it. \n\nBut Shapiro’s book is now seen as the first step toward his own campaign in 2028, assuming that he’s re-elected to a second term in Pennsylvania in 2026.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn an upcoming memoir, a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrat Hints at 2028 Presidential Bid Amid Unveiling of Trump&#8217;s Private Praise first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/democrat-hints-at-2028-presidential-bid-amid-unveiling-of-trumps-private-praise/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Clearest-signal-yet-Democrat-is-set-to-run-in-2028.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 01:01:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":394355012,"title":"Borders state senator wants ICE to be 'totally torn down'","text":"Sen.

The calls to defund or abolish ICE are growing among Democratic lawmakers in the wake of Minnesota resident Renee Good being shot and killed by an ICE officer earlier this month. Good's death has sparked nationwide protests, with critics claiming that the agency has run amok. The Trump administration alleged that the ICE officer acted in self-defense and that Good was attempting to run the agent over. \"A CNN poll this week found that half of Americans, more than half, really, think ICE is making cities less safe,\" CNN host Jake Tapper said to Gallego. \"A growing number of Democrats are renewing calls to abolish ICE entirely in the wake of the death of Renee Good a couple weeks ago.

Why?\" OBAMA-ERA ICE DIRECTOR SAYS TRUMP ADMIN LIKE A ‘POLICE STATE’ BY ASKING PEOPLE TO PROVE LEGAL CITIZENSHIP \"Well, look, I think ICE needs to be totally torn down,\" Gallego replied. \"It has to be, you know, created in the image of what people want, right? And what does that look like? From my experience running in Arizona, in a very hard, hard state when it comes to immigration and immigration issues, people want immigration enforcement that goes after criminals, right, and focuses on criminals, and immigration enforcement that is actually focused on security.\" He contrasted this vision of what he says America wants ICE to be, versus \"the goon squad that has come from Stephen Miller and Donald Trump, one that issues warrants, one that doesn’t have people masked and acting like we’re a Third World police force.\" \"What we’re seeing right now is not what we want from ICE,\" he said. \"And we can create and have a force that’s actually focused on immigration and on security, and not this type of intimidation that’s happening right now.\" OMAR, MINNEAPOLIS MAYOR ACCUSE TRUMP ADMIN OF UNLEASHING 'POLITICAL RETRIBUTION,' 'INVASION' WITH ICE ACTIVITY White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson provided a statement to Fox News Digital in response. \"Wannabe presidential-candidate Gallego is saying whatever he thinks will appeal most to the Democrats’ radical left base, including attacking heroic ICE law enforcement officers.

At issue most urgently is whether resisting Trump's territorial ambitions risks damaging Europe's relationship with the United States beyond repair.Some leaders -- such as President Emmanuel Macron of France and Lars Klingbeil, Germany's finance minister -- appear willing to take that risk, urging Europe's nations to consider deploying an economic \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's latest tariff threats.Leaders from across Europe are expected to gather in Brussels this week to present a united response to Trump's provocations. Veteran observers of European politics said the alliance between Europe and the United States that formed in the aftermath of World War II had already been fundamentally altered.Live EventsIt is no longer an alliance designed primarily to advance the interests of like-minded democracies, they said. Instead, it is a relationship on Trump's terms alone -- one in which he wields the leverage that comes from American power to force Europeans to cater to his whims.\"To use what is essentially economic warfare with allies is unprecedented in this way,\" said Ian Lesser, who leads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, a research group.There appears to be a consensus in much of Europe that it needs to build new economic and military capacities to make it less dependent on the United States. But that will take years, if not decades. In the meantime, Europe's businesses and financial markets will still be intertwined with the buying power of consumers in the United States, and Ukraine will still need American weapons to defend itself against Russia.In fact, months of diplomatic effort to negotiate a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine have only underscored that NATO, which was formed to defend Europe, is unable to fend off Russian aggression without security guarantees by the United States.\"It would be foolish at a time of war in Europe to jettison all of the sort of strategic and operational benefits that come with the alliance,\" Lesser said. \"But if the United States is no longer a reliable partner in that alliance, then Europe needs to do something else.\"That effort is already underway, slowly.The same day that Trump announced his latest tariff threat on social media, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and António Costa, the president of the European Council, were in Paraguay to sign a major trade deal with a bloc of Latin American countries, one that was 25 years in the making.Trump has so far been happy to welcome European money to purchase American-made arms for Ukraine and other countries in Eastern Europe. And he relishes surprising his so-called allies, as he demonstrated Saturday when he announced tariffs on a group of European nations, including Britain, unless Greenland is sold to the United States.That raises the stakes for the decisions that Europe is grappling with in the days ahead. It must choose how aggressively to confront Trump without knowing what the always-unpredictable president will do.\"Is he serious? What does Europe do now? How does the U.S. respond?\" Lesser said. \"There will be those who say, 'OK, how do we get through this? Is it possible to simply to engage in a kind of negotiation or investment or whatever it may be, that will defer anything radical?'\"Trump has already made it clear that he views the United States' European allies with disdain.In his annual National Security Strategy, released last month, officials from Trump's administration questioned whether some European countries would remain \"reliable allies\" in the future.The document conceded that Europe was \"strategically and culturally vital\" to the United States. But it said the Continent faced the \"stark prospect of civilizational erasure\" unless the United States helped like-minded \"patriotic European parties\" -- a phrase that was widely understood to mean the far right -- to win power.For Europeans on the receiving end of those assertions, the president's threats about acquiring Greenland \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\" have further eroded the trust that was central to their alliance with the United States for decades.\"Going back to the level of trust that we saw beforehand would require, I think, generational change,\" said Rosa Balfour, the director of Carnegie Europe, a political think tank. \"The attack on Europe is not just coming from an individual, you know -- it's been turned into an ideology.\"Since the latest Greenland threats, more voices have begun urging assertive action.In a statement over the weekend, Macron vowed that \"no intimidation or threat will influence us -- neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world.\"He called Trump's tariff threats \"unacceptable\" and vowed: \"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.\"Others, like Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, have argued for a diplomatic solution and cautioned against grandstanding. \"That's an understandable instinct, but it's not effective,\" the prime minister told reporters Monday morning. \"It never has been. It may make politicians feel good, but it does nothing for working people whose jobs, livelihoods and security rely on the relationships that we build across the world.\"Still, Balfour said that more leaders were beginning to realize that capitulating to Trump's demands was not always in Europe's interests. In fact, it often leads Trump to demand more concessions.If true, that could have implications for the alliance with the United States and whether it survives in the future.\"Reality, I think, is sinking into the mindsets of those people who have been advocating caution, dialogue and 'Let's listen to what Trump has to say,'\" Balfour said. \"You can feel that kind of change.\"This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ongreenlandtrump greenlandgreenland tariffNATOeuropean union\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News ongreenlandtrump greenlandgreenland tariffNATOeuropean union \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"That question is being asked in capitals across Europe as leaders rush to respond to President Donald Trump's rapidly escalating campaign to acquire Greenland over the objections of the people who live there.

In a letter sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Trump said the decision not to award him the prize changed how he now thinks about peace and US interests. On Saturday, he said the United States would impose 10% tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries unless they agree to a deal handing Greenland to the US. Later, in a conversation with NBC, Trump was asked whether he would really move ahead with the tariffs if no deal is reached. Trump left little room for doubt. “I will, 100%,” he said. Trump links Greenland demand to Nobel Peace Prize snub “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Bloomberg. He added, “Although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” ALSO READIndia invites UAE wealth funds to invest in new infra fund New funds to be launched later this year Trump went on saying, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” It is important to note that the Nobel Peace Prize is not decided by the Norwegian government. The award is chosen by an independent committee based in Norway. Full text of Trump’s letter “Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT” (via Bloomberg). Tariff threats shake NATO allies Trump’s remarks on Greenland have already caused major tension in Europe. Over the weekend, he warned that the US could impose tariffs on several European NATO members if he does not get control of Greenland. The threat ruffled some feathers within NATO, which has long followed the US playbook. French President Emmanuel Macron called on the EU to activate its strongest retaliation tool in response. EU ambassadors met on Sunday to discuss possible countermeasures if Trump carries out his threats. These include tariffs on around €93 billion, or $108 billion, worth of American goods. European leaders are also set to meet for an emergency summit on Thursday. ALSO READIMF raises India FY26 growth estimate by 70 bps to 7.3% Trump continued to defend his stance in a post on Truth Social on Monday. He claimed NATO has warned Denmark for years about security risks around Greenland. “NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland,’” Trump wrote. “Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!” Nobel committee reacts after medal is handed to Trump The Nobel Prize controversy deepened last week after Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado handed her medal to Trump. Trump has long said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and claims he resolved multiple wars during his second term. Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, gave the medal to Trump during a meeting at the White House. Trump accepted it. The Norwegian Nobel Committee issued a statement clarifying that the prize cannot be transferred. “The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.” In another post on social media on Sunday, the committee added that “a prize can therefore not, even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed.”","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/100-will-impose-tariffs-trump-links-greenland-threat-to-nobel-peace-prize-snub/4112988/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2026/01/trump-india-pak-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 00:53:41","author":"Aditi","authors":["Aditi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.068},{"id":394350092,"title":"Syrian government deal with Kurdish fighters unravels","text":"A day after a sweeping deal was announced between the Syrian government and the country's main Kurdish-led force, the agreement appears to be falling apart. After new outbreaks of clashes on Monday, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces issued a statement calling for \"all of our youth\" to \"join the ranks of the resistance\". \"Just as our comrades in 2014 forged a historic resistance in Kobani and turned it into a graveyard for (the Islamic State group) ... today we affirm with the same resolve that we will turn our cities ... into a graveyard for the new (IS)-minded people who are directed by Turkey,\" it said. Earlier in the day, Syrian government forces and Kurdish fighters clashed around two prisons housing members of the Islamic State group in Syria's northeast. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said several of its fighters have been killed and over a dozen others wounded. The clashes came as SDF chief commander Mazloum Abdi was said to be in Damascus to discuss a ceasefire deal reached on Sunday that ended days of deadly fighting during which government forces captured wide areas of northeast Syria from the SDF. Abdi issued no statement about the meeting. The SDF, the main US-backed force that fought IS in Syria, controls more than a dozen prisons in the northeast where some 9000 IS members have been held for years without trial. Many of the detained extremists are believed to have carried out atrocities in Syria and Iraq after IS declared a caliphate in June 2014 over large parts of Syria and Iraq. The army said some of the Shaddadi Prison detainees in the town of Shaddadeh were able to flee amid the chaos and a curfew has been imposed because of the breakout, calling for information on those who escaped as search operations continue. The army and the SDF traded accusations over the release of the detainees, with the group confirming in a statement it lost control over the prison, which is about 50km from the border with Iraq. The Kurdish-led force also said nine of its members have been killed and 20 others wounded in fighting around another prison, al-Aqtan, northeast of the northern city of Raqqa. An Associated Press reporter saw a US convoy entering the prison area, apparently to mediate between the two sides. Washington has good relations with both. The office of Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa said al-Sharaa spoke by telephone with US President Donald Trump and \"affirmed the importance of preserving the unity and independence of Syrian territory\" and \"the need to guarantee the rights and protection of the Kurdish people\". The statement said they also agreed to continue co-operating in the fight against IS. The Syrian government had warned the SDF earlier not to use \"cases of terrorism for political blackmail\", saying it is ready to implement international law regarding the detainees. \"The government warns the SDF's command not to facilitate the fleeing of Daesh detainees or opening prisons as a revenge measure or for political pressure,\" read a government statement carried on state media.

Trump’s threats have rattled NATO as the alliance based on collective defense confronts the prospect that one member might use force against another.\n\n“Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,” Trump said in his message.\n\n“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The world is not secure unless we have complete and total control of Greenland,” Trump said in his note to Støre.\n\nAlthough the US has been the bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security for decades, and spent far more on defense in that period than any other NATO member, many NATO allies participated in recent US wars.

Trump — near complete control over the body, including the right to invite and expel member states at will, veto power over all decisions, and \"final authority\" on how the charter should be interpreted.\n\nThe body's subsidiary \"executive board\", which would implement decisions, is also stuffed with familiar figures such as Trump's secretary of state Marco Rubio, his longtime ally Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and former British prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nEuropean officials told Bloomberg that they are requesting changes to these terms, and that they had lobbied Arab nations to do the same.\n\nAmong the other countries reportedly invited are Australia, Belarus, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, and Ukraine.","summary":"President has described it as ‘the most impressive and consequential Board ever assembled’, but many world leaders are skeptical of its $1bn membership fee and domination by Trump allies","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-peace-board-davos-b2903572.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/20/0/10/SEI281432573.jpg?crop=5791,3860.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/r0rkL3g2-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-20 00:50:17","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":394348924,"title":"Donald Trump says he will impose Greenland tariffs ‘100%’, EU warns it will defend sovereignty","text":"US President Donald Trump has said he will “100%” go ahead with tariffs on European countries that oppose his demand to take control of Greenland, the BBC reported.

He said the same tariffs would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland.

(In fairness, he did the same in 2020 — but accepted Joe Biden’s presidency after Inauguration Day.)\n\nIn Trump’s first term, Democrats formed a “resistance” movement — as if the administration of a duly elected president was analogous to a German occupation government in World War II — and pushed the patently false claim that his victory was a “hacked election” or the product of (nonexistent) “Russian collusion.” \n\nIn his second term the “resistance” is expanding, with suggestions that Trump is ruling as a “king” — and now with the often violent protests aiming to block the legitimate enforcement of duly enacted immigration laws. \n\nDemocratic governors and mayors in Minnesota, Oregon and Illinois have gone so far as to actively enable the chaos by withdrawing police protection. \n\nFinally, winners of elections must not pose an existential threat to the losers; they can’t carry out, or even hint at, mass imprisonment or blanket prosecution. \n\nTake a lesson from history: Julius Caesar led his army across the Rubicon to seize power in Rome because his political enemies were plotting to subject him to political prosecutions that could have led to his death or exile. \n\nCaesar saved himself (for a while) — but his action, and the behavior of his opponents that triggered it, killed off the Roman Republic.\n\nHistorically in American politics, electoral losers have accepted the results, however grudgingly, and concentrated on winning the next election. \n\nThis new trend of treating Republican electoral victories as inherently illegitimate is a departure — and very dangerous.\n\nIt’s made more dangerous by widespread threats from important Democratic figures to prosecute not only Trump and his administration, but lower-level officials — and now, even federal law-enforcement agents. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has been raising this specter for months, and other prominent leftists are following his lead.\n\nIn September, Jeffries said that Democrats would prosecute members of Trump’s Justice Department once they regain power: “Donald Trump and this toxic administration will be long gone, but there will still be accountability to be had.”\n\nIn December, he issued a message on X to “all these GOP extremists and [Trump] sycophants . . . the statute of limitations is 5 years! It will be well beyond the end of the Trump admin.”\n\nWe’ve heard similar statements from Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Democratic consultant James Carville and ex-CNN gadfly Jim Acosta. \n\nThis month, the drumbeat got louder amid stepped-up immigration-enforcement operations in Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nLeftist commentator Jennifer Welch recently used her podcast to push “relentless” prosecutions of Trump, Elon Musk, Stephen Miller and other Republicans if Democrats regain power, arguing it would be necessary for “true national reconciliation.”\n\nAnd just last week Jeffries was back warning rank-and-file ICE officers to expect a Democratic administration to prosecute them for any crimes it could discover (or perhaps, given the history of efforts to prosecute Trump in the past, invent).\n\n“Every single one of these people who we see brutalizing the American people, they’re gonna be held accountable,” Jeffries said of ICE agents. “And the statute of limitations . . . is five years.”\n\nAs Caesar’s experience demonstrates, you can’t have a democratic republic if every election is an existential struggle in which the loser risks extinction. \n\nPeople don’t want to be rendered extinct, and they can be expected to take steps to prevent it.\n\nIf Democrats keep up this thuggery, Republicans will be all but forced to respond in their own defense — and any action they may take could destabilize the nation even further.\n\nThe last time such a breach happened in the United States was in 1860, where pro-slavery Democrats seceded from the country rather than abide by the results of a presidential election. \n\nThat resulted in a Civil War that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and devastated much of the nation — a war driven by Southern “fire-eater” rhetoric that’s not unlike what we’re hearing from some Democrats today.\n\nIt needs to stop, or the consequences might be much worse this time around.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"Widespread threats from important Democrats to prosecute Trump, his top aides, and now even federal law enforcement agents pose a dire threat to our nation. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/19/opinion/with-anti-ice-fury-democrats-are-playing-with-fire/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2257130863-e1768869090166.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 00:34:04","author":"Glenn H.

Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs’ favor. \n\nPlaintiffs’ lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge’s latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by U.S. Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nMichael Kunzelman, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/us-judge-refuses-to-block-new-dhs-policy-limiting-congress-members-access-to-ice-facilities/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/ZQ3LEQME3DVF7EOOALVODNI6P4.jpg?auth=2d86b85e85231f2d8ce01ec83779578fd0d8adc56ff8538aef9879e7090157ff","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-20 00:32:43","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.546}]}
