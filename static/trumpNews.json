They include the special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh field office and three other agents assigned to that office, which was responsible for the security planning ahead of the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to the law enforcement official who had direct knowledge of the matter. One of the five agents was assigned to Trump’s protective detail, the official said. The official was not authorized to publicly disclose details of the personnel investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The agents are on administrative leave, meaning they cannot do investigative or protective work. Multiple investigations have been launched as officials probe a complicated law enforcement failure that allowed a man with an AR-style rifle to get close enough to shoot and injure Trump at the rally. Trump was struck in the ear but avoided serious injury. One spectator was killed and two others were injured. The shooting was a devastating failure of one of the agency’s core duties and led to the resignation of the Secret Service’s then-director, Kim Cheatle. At a congressional hearing after the assassination attempt, Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting. She also revealed that the roof from which Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., who took over after Cheatle’s resignation, has said he “cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.”","summary":"At least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty after the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in July, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/23/at-least-5-secret-service-agents-placed-on-leave/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24196166272311.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 00:06:14","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.759},{"id":254801738,"title":"How Kamala Harris’s Berkeley neighborhood is a greater struggle for the Middle Class","text":"BERKELEY — The fog lifted early Friday over the flatlands of Berkeley where a diverse mix of homeowners and renters had gathered for a block party the night before to watch Kamala Harris on a big screen accept the Democratic nomination for president and deliver a shout-out to her childhood neighborhood. “We lived in the flats,” Harris said from the convention stage in Chicago Thursday night, “a beautiful, working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers — all who tended their lawns with pride.” This is the kind of middle class neighborhood and people, she said, she would fight for if she beats former President Donald Trump in November. But much has changed in this pocket of the Bay Area since the 1970s, when Harris’s mother, a UC Berkeley grad student, raised her two daughters in an upstairs apartment on Bancroft Way. Nurses and firefighters who may earn more than $100,000 a year would be unlikely to afford the average $1.2 million homes here, including the hefty down payment, without financial help from family. A typical 2-bedroom apartment, like the one where Harris spent her elementary school years, would likely rent for upwards of $3,500 a month — a hefty cost even for an average tech worker living on one salary. For the average California construction worker, whose median wage was less than $62,000 in 2020, the rent would be impossible. “I find it tragic that the high cost of living in Berkeley today makes it that much harder for someone like Kamala Harris’s mom to afford to live here,” said Abby Friedman, who helped organize the block party in her neighbor’s side yard on Browning Street, around the corner from Harris’s childhood home. Vernita McCray lives across the street from it. She was born here in 1956, a year after her father, a hod carrier who delivered bricks and lumber to construction sites, bought the modest corner house. He could afford the $134 monthly mortgage and raise his three daughters while his wife stayed home. They were some of the first Black residents to move into the mostly White neighborhood back then, she said, and kids across the street sometimes threw rocks at their house. In the 1970s, when Harris was school-age here, the neighborhood was mostly Black. The homes with long, narrow lots along Bancroft Way look much as they did in the 1970s, including the two-story yellow house that Harris grew up in. Instead of Regina Shelton’s day care beneath the Harris apartment where the sisters stayed after school, there is a Montessori preschool now. But as housing prices skyrocketed and the neighborhood gentrified over the next decades, the ZIP code that includes about 17,600 people is mostly White again, making up nearly half the population, according to the 2020 Census. The Black population has fallen to about 15%, followed closely by Hispanics and Asians at about 14%. McCray, 68, who spent years working for Bank of America and now works in child care, says there’s no way she could afford to buy her own home now. “Oh no,” she said, “not in my wildest dreams.” Harris has made helping the middle class a central theme of her candidacy, a demographic that Trump largely appealed to in his successful 2016 presidential campaign. In a campaign video released Friday, Harris promised to create an “opportunity economy,” for middle-class families “like the one I grew up in,” she said, “where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business.” In her Thursday night speech, she also pledged to build three million new homes and “end America’s housing shortage.” What she didn’t mention, however, is that Democratic policies and local “not-in-my-backyard” sentiments have often thwarted opportunities to build new housing, and Democratic-sponsored rent control programs that make some units affordable for the middle class also discourage development. As Trump put it in a post on his Truth Social site, “She’s talking about the Middle Class, but she’s the one who broke the Middle Class, and made it UNSAFE AND UNAFFORDABLE!” Still, Harris’s message resonates in this Berkeley neighborhood not far from the university campus called “Poet’s Corner,” for the street names of famous poets like Browning and Chaucer. “Like all of Berkeley, Poet’s Corner has gotten radically more expensive,” said Marilyn Garcia, a real estate agent who’s worked in Berkeley for two decades. “It’s definitely affected who can afford to live there… I don’t think that a teacher could afford to buy a house in that area these days.” There are still educators, therapists and working class retirees who live here, however, and attended the livestream of Harris’s speech as the sun set Thursday night. But many of them either bought their homes decades ago, have taken in renters, or are renters themselves with roommates. Celine Bonfils, a French immigrant who conducted postdoctoral research in climate science here, and her husband, also a scientist, rent a two-bedroom with their two children. Like Harris, her children are the offspring of two scientists and “we’re renting. So we are middle class,” said Bonfils, who helped set up chairs at the viewing party. “It’s not easy to buy a house.” Pramish Thapa, a Nepal immigrant, and his wife, Annie Powers, purchased their two-bedroom house across from the old Harris home for more than $1 million. But even with low interest rates when they bought the house and their tech salaries – he’s an economist and she works for an AI start-up – they still needed family help to buy it. They’re happy to be here, and take pride in living across from Harris’s childhood home. When Harris spoke about her days here – that Mrs. Shelton who lived below “became a second mother,” and that their neighbors taught them “how to make gumbo, how to play chess” and instilled the values of treating others with “kindness, respect and compassion” – Thapa believes that spirit still lives on. He missed the block party, where neighbors ate handfuls of popcorn and slices of cake with frosting that said “Kamala 47,” and where Friedman’s 11-year-old daughter, Elia (cq) Schifrin (cq), made hand-painted t-shirts that said “Keep calm and vote Kamala.” Despite the challenges to afford living here – or maybe because of them – Thapa says he’s felt the same sense of community that Harris talked about. “When we first came here, we received a cake from some of our neighbors and fruit,” he said, “and random acts of kindness.”","summary":"The homes with long, narrow lots along Bancroft Way look much as they did in the 1970s, including the two-story yellow house that Harris grew up in, but it's unlikely that Harris's mother could afford to raise her two daughters there now as a grad student.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/23/how-kamala-harriss-berkeley-neighborhood-is-a-greater-struggle-for-the-middle-class/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SJM-L-HARRISBERK-0825-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 00:02:06","author":"Harriet Blair Rowan,Julia Prodis Sulek,Kate Talerico","authors":["Harriet Blair Rowan","Julia Prodis Sulek","Kate Talerico"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.219},{"id":254801710,"title":"RFK Jr. Could 'Cost' Donald Trump, Ex-Bush Official Warns","text":"Republican pundit Scott Jennings cautioned former President Donald Trump's campaign to \"be a little careful\" with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s fresh endorsement.Kennedy, who has run as an independent for much of the 2024 election, announced that he is suspending his campaign during a speech in Arizona Friday afternoon, claiming that his internal polling showed that remaining in the race would likely benefit Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.The environmental lawyer subsequently endorsed Trump, which the former president called a \"great honor.\" There is speculation that Trump could offer Kennedy a role in his administration in exchange for his support. Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email Friday evening for additional comment.While polling has shown that Kennedy's supporters are likely to lean toward Trump's campaign with the independent out of the race, Jennings, former adviser to President George W. Bush, said that Kennedy's reputation could \"cost\" Trump's chances with some voters come November.\"Look for whatever benefit you get ... there could be some cost on the other side of the algebra,\" Jennings said during an appearance on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. \"I mean, I'm old enough to remember when RFK was a liberal conspiracy theorist,\" Jennings continued. \"Now he's more of a conservative conspiracy theorist, but the through line is he's a conspiracy theorist, and a lot of people think he's kind of a loony tune.\"\"So I would just caution the former president be a little careful here,\" he added. \"Don't make any promises you can't get out of.\"Kennedy, son of 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of Democratic President John F. Kennedy, has gained attention in recent years for his skepticism toward the COVID-19 vaccinations. He also stirred controversy on several occasions while on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, Kennedy admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan 10 years earlier, saying that he and his friends who assisted thought the act was \"amusing.\"Allegations also spread this summer that Kennedy had previously eaten a dog, which was first reported by Vanity Fair, although his campaign later dispelled the rumors. That same article included information on Kennedy being accused of sexually assaulting his former babysitter, a claim that Kennedy did not deny during a podcast appearance.\"I had a very, very rambunctious youth,\" Kennedy told Breaking Points podcaster Saagar Enjeti. \"I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.\"It's unclear how Kennedy's decision to suspend his campaign will impact an already tight race. The New York Times reported Friday that, according to its polling averages, Kennedy held about 5 percent of voters' support nationally on the day he dropped out. His support earlier in the race was closer to double digits, but started to trail off once Harris launched her reelection campaign.Kennedy's impact could be felt most in tight battleground states, although the Times reported that its most recent survey with Siena College conducted in seven swing states found that if all of Kennedy's supporters shifted toward Trump, the former president would gain 1 percentage point on average.In comparison, Harris held a 2 percent lead over Trump on average across the seven states, with or without Kennedy's inclusion in the poll.","summary":"Scott Jennings warned Friday that a \"lot of people\" view Kennedy as \"kind of a loony tune.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-jr-could-cost-donald-trump-ex-bush-official-warns-1943851","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457322/rfk-jr-could-cost-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-24 00:01:46","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":254801758,"title":"How RFK Jr’s decision to drop out could impact the outcome of the election between Trump and Harris","text":"Robert F. Kennedy’s Jr.’s voters could help Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election, according to an exclusive poll for DailyMail.com. It shows that his supporters lean towards Trump over Harris by a margin of two to one. Although the nephew of JFK is only polling in single digits, that sort of boost could be enough to tip the balance towards Trump in a tight race that will be decided by just tens of thousands of voters in a handful of swing states. The issue could take on fresh urgency on Friday, amid speculation that RFK Jr. is preparing to drop out. He is scheduled to speak in Phoenix, Arizona, ‘about the present historical moment and his path forward,’ at 2pm Eastern time, and has already withdrawn his name from the state’s ballot. Our latest poll with J.L. Partners, conducted from August 7 to 11, found that of 1,001 likely voters only five percent would vote for Kennedy if the election were tomorrow. He was far behind Trump on 43 percent and Harris on 41 percent. But when that poll was combined with a second survey to ask whether they lean more to Trump or to Harris the results appear to be decisive: More than half (51 percent) said they leaned towards the former president. About a quarter (26 percent) said they leaned more to Harris. That could swell Trump’s voter base by a point or two if Kennedy is no longer running. ‘Don’t buy the line that RFK Jr. only makes a small difference to the election,’ said J.L. Partners cofounder James Johnson. ‘This is a major third party candidate dropping out. ‘And our data show that even before that, RFK Jr.’s voters were going to go to Trump by a large margin if their man wasn’t in the race.’ RFK Jr., 70, an environmental lawyer with a nose for conspiracy theories and anti-vax arguments, entered the race as a Democrat. But he switched to independent after failing to find purchase against Biden in the primary contest. Previous J.L. Partners polls had shown he had picked up more support from the left than the right. ‘The data also show there is a small but significant group of voters who opted for Biden in 2020, moved to RFK Jr, and are now leaning Trump,’ said Johnson. ‘These voters—who used RFK Jr as a sort of gateway drug to backing Trump—could make all the difference in states on a knife-edge, and RFK Jr’s dropping out will give Trump a boost in these states. ‘It is a more significant development than anything out of the DNC this week.’ Trump is on a tour of battleground states and is due to hold a rally near Phoenix soon after RFK Jr’s announcement. His campaign has teased a special guest, heightening speculation that Kennedy will endorse the former president. During a trip to the southern border on Thursday, Trump said he was open to the possibility, calling it a ‘great honor.’ He also said there might be room in his administration for RFK Jr, the son of Robert Kennedy, JFK’s attorney general. But he will face a battle to win over RFK Jr’s supporters. Harris communications director Michael Tyler told MSNBC that her campaign would welcome his voters. ‘I think that him dropping out fully cements … that this election is going to be a choice between Vice President Harris, who is fighting for the American people, [and] Donald Trump, who … is simply fighting for himself,’ he said at the Democratic convention in Chicago. Kennedy has endured a turbulent campaign. He recently admitted he dumped a dead bear cub in Manhattan’s Central Park in 2014. And he struggled with strained campaign finances and legal challenges, including a ruling in New York that he should not appear on the ballot in the state because he listed a ‘sham’ address on nominating petitions.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobert F.

Kennedy Jr. said Vice President Kamala Harris has “no interest” in ridding the nation’s food supply of toxic chemicals or cleaning house at agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Department of Agriculture (USDA). During his announcement, Kennedy suggested that he would be involved in a future Trump administration with a focus on ending chronic health issues and raising regulatory standards for the United States food supply. “These agencies — the FDA, USDA, CDC, all of them — are controlled by giant for-profit corporations. Seventy-five percent of the FDA’s funding doesn’t come from taxpayers; it comes from pharma. Pharma lobbyists cycle in and out of these agencies,” Kennedy said: With President Trump’s backing, I’m going to change that. We’re going to staff these agencies with scientists and doctors who are free from industry funding. We’re going to make sure that the decisions of consumers, doctors, and patients are informed by unbias science. [Emphasis added]We’re going to stop subsidizing the worst foods with our agricultural subsidies. We’re going to get toxic chemicals out of our food. We’re going to reform the entire food system. For that, we need new leadership in Washington because, unfortunately, both the Democrat and Republican Party are in cahoots with the big food producers, big pharma, and big ag[riculture], which are among the DNC’s major donors. [Emphasis added] Kennedy also said Harris, who refused to take a phone call from him, “has expressed no interest in addressing this issue.” “Four more years of Democratic rule will complete the consolidation of corporate and neocon power, and our children will be the ones who suffer most,” Kennedy said. ﻿﻿ Trump, Kennedy said, “has adopted these issues as his own to the point that he has asked to enlist me in his administration.” Among the issues Kennedy will spearhead while campaigning with Trump is massively reforming the U.S. food supply, which he blames for widespread chronic illnesses among Americans that financially are a boon to big pharmaceutical corporations. “Today … we spend more on healthcare than any country on Earth, twice what they pay in Europe. And, yet, we have the worst health outcomes of any nation overall. We’re about seventy-ninth in health outcomes — behind Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mongolia, and so many other countries. Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have,” Kennedy said: Two-thirds of American adults and children suffer from chronic health issues. Fifty years ago, that number was less than one percent. We’ve gone from one percent to 66 percent. In America, 74 percent of Americans are now overweight or obese — and 50 percent of our children. One hundred and twenty years ago, when somebody was obese, they were sent to the circus. They were literally case reports about them. Obesity was almost unknown … today, one out of every three kids is diabetic or pre-diabetic. [Emphasis added]…There’s been an explosion of neurological disorders — ADD, ADHD, speech delays, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, Asperger’s, autism. In the year 2000, the autism rate was one in 1,500. Now, autism rates in kids are one in 36 nationally. Nobody is talking about this … this is a crisis that 77 percent of our kids are too disabled to serve in the United States Military. [Emphasis added]About 18 percent of American teens now have fatty liver disease … that disease, when I was a kid, only affected late-stage alcoholics who were elderly. Cancer rates are skyrocketing in the young and the old … one in four American women are on anti-depressant medication. Forty percent of teens have a mental health diagnosis, and 15 percent of high schoolers are on aderrol, and half a million children are on SSRIs. [Emphasis added] Kennedy said “ultra-processed food” as well as “toxic chemicals in our food, our medicine, and our environment” are responsible: “About 70 percent of American children’s diet is ulta-processed — that means manufactured in the factory. These foods consist primarily of processed sugar, ultra-processed grains, and seed oils. Laboratory scientists … deployed thousands of scientists to find new chemicals to make the food more addictive. These ingredients didn’t exist 100 years ago. Humans aren’t biologically adapted to eat them. Hundreds of these chemicals are banned in Europe but ubiquitous in American processed food.The second culprit is toxic chemicals in our food, our medicine, and our environment. Pesticides, food additives, pharmaceutical drugs, and toxic waste permeate every cell of our bodies. This assault on our children’s cells and hormones is unrelenting. To name just one problem, many of these chemicals increase estrogen. Because young children are ingesting so many of these hormone disrupters, America’s puberty rate is now occurring at age ten to 13, which is six years earlier than girls were reaching puberty in 1900. Our country has the earliest puberty rates of any continent on the Earth. No, this isn’t because of better nutrition, this is not normal. Breast cancer is also estrogen-driven, and it now strikes one in eight women. We are mass poisoning all of our children and our adults. [Emphasis added] As a result, Kennedy said, the federal government is spending twice as much on treating chronic illnesses as it is on funding the U.S. military. At the same time, Kennedy said the government’s agricultural subsidies for processed food are “destroying small farms, and they’re destroying our soils.” “What is happening in our country? Why isn’t this in the headlines every day … why are we allowing this to happen to our children?” Kennedy said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWhile dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing former President Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: RFK Jr. Criticizes Kamala Harris&#8217;s Stance on Food Supply Safety and Corporate Influence in Federal Agencies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/rfk-jr-criticizes-kamala-harriss-stance-on-food-supply-safety-and-corporate-influence-in-federal-agencies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-RFK-Jr-Kamala-Harris-Has-No-Interest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:48:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":254801352,"title":"RFK Jr. makes his Trump rally debut hours after endorsing GOP nominee: ‘I’m proud of Bobby’","text":"GLENDALE, Ariz. – Former independent presidential candidate Robert F.

The Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling has wreaked havoc on Trump’s case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and in other venues where the former president is criminally charged. But in New York, the only venue where Trump was charged and convicted, defense attorneys Emil Bove and Todd Blanche contend that the high court’s ruling has effectively put a damper on any “official acts” they argue were presented in evidence. The immunity decision translates to the guilty verdict being overturned or at the very least, they have argued, it should warrant a new trial where protected “official” conduct would not be admitted. Trump, Blanche and Bove insist the former president may not be prosecuted for exercising his “core constitutional powers.” Merchan’s silence on the request to delay sentencing currently set for Sept. 18 may indicate the judge is methodically poring over this decision. Bragg wasn’t much help: while he scoffed at Trump’s “bizarre” arguments to delay until after the election, he also didn’t stand in the way. The wisdom on whether Trump should be sentenced without delay was explored this week by Law&Crime in an op-ed from trial lawyer and legal analyst Bradford Cohen. Cohen, with his 27 years handling white-collar cases in federal and state courts, said he felt confident the right course of action would be to continue sentencing until after the presidential election. “Most attorneys will agree,” he said, noting that the trial was “marred by procedural irregularities and concerns of prosecutorial overreach.” Merchan is expected to issue his ruling on the immunity issue on Sept. 12 — just four days before sentencing. Cohen argues that whatever his ruling is, it would dictate whether appellate issues could be raised that would, and once again, delay sentencing. At least one legal analyst feels differently: Norman Eisen, the co-founder and a board member of State Democracy Defenders Action and the Brookings Institute senior fellow and legal analyst, argued in an op-ed for MSNBC on Aug. 20 that there is no cause to delay because the Manhattan case concerned unofficial conduct: a presidential candidate who conspired to interfere in the 2016 election by covering up payments he made to a porn star and then falsifying those records is not conduct covered by the “official” category. Whatever lawyers and legal experts may think, it will be Merchan who makes the call and by Monday, there will be only 70 days left until Election Day. Law&Crime takes a look at this and other key developments in Trump’s cases in New York, Florida, Georgia, and Washington, D.C. NEW YORK CRIMINAL Still no word from acting New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan on whether there will be a delay of sentencing for the former president turned convicted felon. Sentencing is currently set for Sept. 18 and Trump’s lawyers would like it delayed past the 2024 election. New York Attorney General Letitia James urged an appellate court to uphold Trump’s roughly $500 million civil fraud judgment ahead of oral arguments slated for next month.In a separate civil matter, barring any last minute delays, the E. Jean Carroll case has oral arguments of its own slated for Sept. 6. The GOP’s 2024 presidential nominee was found liable for defamation and sexual abuse in the first case involving the veteran writer and a jury awarded her $5.5 million in damages.Left: New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks to the media, Nov. 6, 2023, in New York.

Carr shot down an effort by local Republicans to reopen an investigation into whether votes in the state were “stolen” from Trump.No votes were stolen from Trump in 2020, according to the nation’s intelligence agencies and officials at the U.S. Justice Department including members of Trump’s own administration like former Attorney General Bill Barr. While the door has closed on relitigating 2020 Georgia state election results, it is worth noting, as Law&Crime reported weeks ago: there’s potential for new drama ahead. In case you missed it, the Trump-backed Georgia election board recently enacted a new rule that is poised to cause major headaches in vote certification for the state in November.Background: This image, contained in the indictment against former President Donald Trump, shows boxes of records stored in a bathroom and shower in the Lake Room at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.

SUPREME COURT No news to report from the high court specific to Trump’s many legal woes, but notably this week, the man who threatened to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, is set to go to trial in the spring. The California man vowed to kill Kavanaugh and himself so it would “give his life purpose.“ CRIMINAL Nothing new to report in the Jan. 6 election subversion case a week after a classified and redacted one-page brief appeared on the docket signifying that special counsel Jack Smith‘s team may have provided a small amount of classified material for pretrial discovery. CIVIL U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, the jurist overseeing civil litigation brought against Donald Trump by lawmakers and police who endured the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has agreed to give the former president and convicted felon more time to obtain records from the Secret Service and Metropolitan Police Department that have been missing in action since June. Tump has until Aug. 29 to update Judge Mehta.OF NOTE: Should the former president ultimately be found culpable for violating the rights of protesters who say they were unconstitutionally removed from Lafayette Park during the racial justice protests in 2020, the U.S. Justice Department appears to have agreed to assume liability for the former president because he was “acting within the scope of federal office” at the time.Former President Donald Trump and high-level officials, including Bill Barr, walk in Lafayette Park to visit outside St. John’s Church across from the White House in Washington in June 2020 (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky).","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft to right: Donald Trump (AP Photo/Mike Roemer), New York Supreme Court&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Negative impact on immunity paves the way for Election Day first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/negative-impact-on-immunity-paves-the-way-for-election-day/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Immunity-blowback-opening-path-to-Election-Day.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:44:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":254801826,"title":"Robert F.

However, in the world of politics, DeChambeau recently did something McIlroy has also done previously by enjoying a game of golf with ex-US President Donald Trump. And he shrugged off any claims that this move was making a political point. \"It's sad some people feel that way,\" said DeChambeau during a GOLF.com interview responding to the backlash he faced, a fate McIlroy also suffered a few years ago. The American golfer has launched an episode titled \"Break 59\" featuring President Trump on his YouTube channel \"Bryson DeChambeau\", which has so far garnered over 11 million views. He explained: \"First of all, that video delivers solid golf content and it raised a quarter of a million dollars for a veterans' charity [the Wounded Warrior Project]. That was the main focus of the video. Of course, Trump is a figure and a character, we need some of those vibrant moments. John Daly is also such a character. That's what makes videos entertaining.\" McIlroy, who relocated to south Florida in 2012, made the decision to play golf with Trump at the start of his presidency, a move he says was \"out of respect\" for the office. Despite having significant policy differences with Trump at the time, McIlroy found him to be charismatic and personable during their game, and initially enjoyed the experience. However, after facing backlash on social media, the Northern Irish golfer later said he regretted the decision due to Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a May 2020 conversation with the McKellar Journal, McIlroy mentioned that he has deliberately not played with Trump since, \"out of choice\". \"There's some stuff that just is terrible. It's not the way a leader should act,\" he added. \"There is a bit of diplomacy that you need to show, and I just don't think he's showing that, especially in these times. \"I don't know if he'd [Trump] want to play with me again after what I just said. I know it's very self-serving of me to say no, and if I don't, then it means I'm not putting myself in position to be under scrutiny and that I'm avoiding that. But no, I wouldn't.\" In 2022, McIlroy stirred up the golfing world with his strong criticism of players defecting from the PGA Tour to the controversial LIV Golf League, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The Northern Irishman didn't mince words, calling those who moved \"duplicitous\" and expressing he'd be \"super happy\" to see LIV Golf vanish. DeChambeau, known for his support of the 45th President, made headlines when he joined LIV in June after pledging allegiance to the PGA Tour. The Saudi-funded league has further ties to Trump, hosting three events at courses linked to the former president's real estate portfolio.","summary":"Bryson DeChambeau has responded to the criticism he received for playing golf with Donald Trump, claiming that the duo &quot;need some of those [colorful] moments&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/bryson-dechambeau-donald-trump-mcilroy-33530110","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article33530109.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-1249643322.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:43:01","author":"Declan Walsh","authors":["Declan Walsh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.18},{"id":254801388,"title":"Secret Service agents placed on leave in Trump assassination attempt probe","text":"Secret Service agents placed on leave in Trump assassination attempt probe CBS News has learned that multiple Secret Service agents have been placed on leave amid the investigation into last month's attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

I recently read a letter with the words “Vote for results” in the headline — ironically it was about Donald Trump. I can’t speak for everyone, but why would you vote for a person who doesn’t know the meaning of the words morality, honesty or ethics and who obviously doesn’t live by them? Why would you vote for someone who has admitted he wants to be a dictator: “You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good you’re not going to have to vote.” I want to live in a free country, one where democracy is the word used to describe it. Please vote. Geraldine Mellen San Leandro Harris’ ethnicity, race should be off-limits Donald Trump’s comments about Kamala Harris’ race and ethnicity are reprehensible. Respect is due, Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris Is the first Black woman to serve as vice president, and the first Indian American woman to serve as vice president. She is also the first Black woman to be nominated for president by a major party, and the first Indian American to be nominated for president by a major party. Race and gender have no place in this election. I cannot fathom why Trump keeps bringing it up. He needs to stop — now. James Hightower Hayward Urge Congress not to take out Prop. 12 Certain special interests in the pork industry are pressuring Congress to overturn Proposition 12 via the Farm Bill. Proposition 12 sets commonsense animal welfare and food safety standards on certain animal products and was passed overwhelmingly in California in 2018. Nullifying this law via the federal Farm Bill would not only overrule the will of voters, but it would be a step backward and undermine the progress of treating animals more humanely. The proposed Farm Bill language in the U.S. House of Representatives would go beyond dismantling Proposition 12; it could invalidate hundreds of other state laws that protect public health and have devastating repercussions. As a voter in California who cares deeply about how animals are treated, I respectfully urge Senator Alex Padilla to stand against these controversial attempts to gut Proposition 12 and work to keep language that invalidates state animal welfare and agriculture laws out of the final Farm Bill.

And being tied to Project 2025 continues to freak the hell out of Trump. On Thursday, he even went to his favorite cable news refuge, “Fox & Friends,” to claim ignorance yet again. “I have no idea what Project 25 is, but they use it, and they know it.” Trump said. While hate-watching Vice President Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, he posted about the right-wing scheme again on Truth Social. The most hilarious evidence of his panic has to be this GOP mailer that hit mailboxes in Michigan this week. The denial is in bright blue and red letters: “Straight from Trump’s Platform,” it says. “NOT PROJECT 2025, WHICH TRUMP DIDN’T WRITE AND DOES NOT SUPPORT.” Oh, Donald—still fighting these inconvenient truths about The Heritage Foundation’s scheme. Like the fact that the project’s chief architect admitted on hidden camera that Trump has given them his blessing. Or the story this week from CBS News, headlined “Hundreds of proposals in Project 2025 match Trump's policies.” CBS “identified at least 270 proposals in Project 2025's published blueprint for the next Republican president that match Trump's past policies and current campaign promises.” Those include: bringing back at least 80 of Trump’s executive orders from his tenure; 170 Project 2025 proposals that are on Trump’s website or that he talks about in speeches; and another 21 that “match both Trump's past actions and his campaign promises and statements.” That builds on this July story from CNN, titled “Trump claims not to know who is behind Project 2025. A CNN review found that at least 140 people who worked for him are involved.” For starters, CNN found that six former Cabinet secretaries, four Trump ambassador nominees, his first deputy chief of staff, and “several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown” had helped craft Project 2025. This is a serious case of the gentleman protesting too much. And it’s hilariously ironic that the more he insists it has nothing to do with him, the deeper journalists dig—the Streisand Effect in action. Trump isn’t credible on just about anything, but on this one, he’s lost the battle. Fox News might indulge his repeated disavowals, but it won’t work: Trump and Project 2025 have become inextricably linked. Trump’s campaign keeps yammering on about how Harris has no policies—as if they want this to be an election about policy. But now that Project 2025’s proposed policies are on everyone’s lips, they’re panicked by that. Trump’s cronies at The Heritage Foundation put it all out there on paper, and everybody hates it. Even worse for Republicans, people are now likely to cast their votes with Project 2025 in mind. That makes the Democrats’ strategy of putting the focus on it very smart. This is Trump’s vision for another term in the White House, and the people who wrote it are the people who would enforce it if given the chance. Like vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, Minnesota governor and former high school football coach, said: “When somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, trust me, they're gonna use it.” RELATED STORIES","summary":"Democrats were laser-focused on Project 2025 during this week’s Democratic National Convention, devoting segments each night to describing the different policy disasters that are part of the extremist blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd being tied to Project 2025 continues to freak the hell out of Trump.

The event is scheduled for Sept. 5. (Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Proceeds for the Sept. 5 event, which is selling tickets starting at $1,500 and is billed as the “J6 Awards Gala,” will go to the Stand in the Gap Foundation, a nonprofit organization financially supporting Jan. 6 defendants’ legal bills. Trump’s campaign told Axios on Thursday the former president will not attend the event, though LJ Fino, a producer on the chart-topping “Justice For All” song by Jan. 6 inmates and an event organizer, told Forbes, \"President Trump is 99.99% going to be there.” An appearance from Trump would not be unprecedented, as the former president attended a fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants last year also at his Bedminster golf club, according to NBC News, reportedly telling attendees he would make a contribution to the legal fund supporting them. General admission tickets for the fundraiser are $1,500, single VIP tickets cost $2,500 and VIP table tickets start at $30,000, according to Vote Your Vision, one of the event’s organizers. Former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani was listed among the invited guests alongside Trump and will be in attendance, according to Fino, who noted former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and ex-Trump aide Peter Navarro were also invited. The event will also provide award plaques to members of the “J6 Prison Choir” who contributed to “Justice For All,” a collaborative track featuring Trump, which topped Billboard’s Digital Song Sales chart in March with 33,000 downloads. Fino said organizers believed Trump’s Bedminster golf club would be the most appropriate place to hold the event, citing the former president’s frequency of visits to the club this summer.

Surprising Fact The Stand in the Gap Foundation was co-founded by Sarah McAbee, the wife of a former Tennessee sheriff currently serving five years in prison over his involvement in a “prolonged multi-assailant attack on police officers” at the Capitol, The New York Times reported. Tangent The event is scheduled the same day U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan will decide how to proceed with Trump’s election subversion case after the Supreme Court ruled in July that Trump has some immunity from prosecution for acts he took while he was president. Key Background Trump has historically embraced Jan. 6 defendants, describing many as “hostages” and “unbelievable patriots” who should be freed from prison. He has also pledged to free Jan. 6 rioters as one of his first official acts as president if he is elected to a second term in November. More than 1,265 defendants were charged in relation to the Capitol attack as of January 2024, according to the Justice Department, which noted about 749 of those people received sentences. The former president has also played “Justice For All” at some of his events. The song features Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance mixed with about 20 members of the J6 Prison Choir, who recorded their lines from prison phones, singing the “Star-Spangled Banner.” Critics have linked Trump’s incendiary speech on Jan. 6, 2021, with inciting violence, as the former president refused to accept his defeat to President Joe Biden and told his supporters \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.” The proceeding march and riot at the Capitol resulted in five deaths. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the election results.

Abraham is the U.S. Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and is based in Indonesia. A U.S. official confirmed that Abraham will conclude his tenure in Jakarta in the coming days. In his new role, Abraham is expected to have a small team tasked with putting in place operations for Vice President Kamala Harris to begin building an administration after the election, if she defeats former President Donald Trump. The source said that the team will not be making decisions about personnel in a potential administration or developing policies before Election Day. Covington and Burling LLP, the law firm where former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder works, will help the transition team get set up. Holder vetted potential running mates for the Harris campaign. A State Department spokesperson said Abraham has spent his two years as ambassador working to expand and deepen the relationship between the U.S. and nations in southeast Asia. Before that, he was chief of staff of the National Security Council and oversaw the White House Situation Room. Transition teams are familiar territory for Abraham. In 2020, he was executive director of the Biden transition. During that time, he worked closely with Harris, according to the source. Abraham's appointment comes as the General Services Administration prepares to engage the Harris and Trump campaigns in the presidential transition process. A spokesperson for the GSA said the agency will offer its services to both transition teams through a letter on Aug. 27. Next steps include accepting the offer in writing and executing a memo of understanding in order to get office space in Washington, D.C., and administrative support to do their work. Federal law related to presidential transitions stipulates Sept. 1 as the deadline for GSA to enter into formal agreements with presidential transition teams. It’s not clear how that timeline will be affected given the short period between the offer of services and the start of next month, which falls on a Sunday before a federal holiday. The Trump campaign announced last week that it has formed a transition team headed by Linda McMahon, who led the Small Business Administration under Trump, and Howard Lutnick, CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald. The choice of McMahon and Lutnick also serves to further distance Trump from Project 2025. The collaboration by conservative groups offered about 900 pages of policy proposals and includes a personnel database aimed at staffing a future Trump White House.

Several former Trump administration staffers are part of the groups behind Project 2025, but McMahon and Lutnick haven’t been connected to the effort.

Kennedy Jr.’s 2024 campaign never got the traction some might have expected given his famous name and ability to get earned media. But now that the effort is suspended, the maverick politician may end up playing a pivotal role between now and November — particularly in battleground states. That’s the case made by Chris LaCivita, one of former President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, in a “confidential” memo Friday arguing that “in every single state RFK Jr.’s vote breaks for President Trump.” “This is good news for President Trump and his campaign – plain and simple,” the veteran political consultant declares about the key states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and their 93 combined electoral votes that could swing the race for the White House if they perform in a bloc. Among the seven battlegrounds, Nevada (with six electoral votes) is the place where RFK voters are most primed to switch to Trump now that their preferred candidate has endorsed the Republican. A full 66% of the RFK voters in Team Trump’s “most recent round” of internal surveys back the Republican with Kennedy out of the race, while 16% say they would back Harris and the remainder claim they are undecided. Kennedy had 4% support in Nevada according to LaCivita’s polling. To put that number in perspective, Biden won the state by 2.39% in 2020. Though Nevada offers the most striking example of an exodus to Trump, it’s not the only one according to the Trump operation’s calculations. Trump won North Carolina in 2016 and 2020; but a recent poll showed Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of Trump in the race for the state’s 16 electoral votes on the strength of the Democratic National Convention showcase. The LaCivita numbers suggest Kennedy voters, who make up 3% of the Tar Heel State electorate, are also moving over to the Trump column. With Kennedy out of the race, 58% of his backers say they will switch to Trump, against just 22% moving to Harris. An additional 21% say they are undecided. Wisconsin, whose 10 electoral votes Biden won by 0.63% four years ago, is yet another state where Kennedy backers moving to Trump could make the difference in November. RFK had 4% support according to the internal polling, and the former oresident is poised to get 55% of those voters, with 25% likely to back Harris and 20% undecided. If Trump gets all the undecided voters, that’s good for a 2% gain in his vote share. If he’d had that cushion in 2020, he would have carried the state. Arizona, where Kennedy announced his withdrawal from the race, is another state where Trump disproportionately benefits from RFK’s exit and the dispersal of his support, measured at 5%. The former president takes 53% support, with Harris at 28% and 19% undecided. Biden won the state’s 11 electoral votes by 0.3% — or fewer than 11,000 votes — in 2020. LaCivita notes that “the net vote gained in a state like Arizona based on just a 2020 turnout model would be over 41,000 votes, nearly 4 times Biden’s winning margin.” In Pennsylvania and Georgia, where Biden won 35 electoral votes by narrow margins four years ago, a similar scenario plays out with somewhat less intensity. Trump leads Harris with RFK voters 49% to 35% in the Keystone State and 47% to 34% in the Peach State. Kennedy was at 4% in Pennsylvania and 3% in Georgia, where LaCivita observes “the net gain would be over 19,000 votes, nearly twice Biden’s margin.” The only state where RFK voters look likely to break evenly according to the Trump internal poll is Michigan, where Harris takes 43% of Kennedy voters and the 45th president (appropriately enough) takes 45%. Fifteen electoral votes are up for grabs in the Wolverine State. If Trump sweeps all seven of these states, he has a pathway to 312 electoral votes. While it’s premature to allocate all Kennedy’s voters to the Republican column, the reality is if RFK Jr. can deliver them, the man from Mar-a-Lago is headed back to DC.","summary":"Robert F.

The whistleblower allegations were revealed in a Friday letter from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, in which the lawmaker demanded answers to Rowe’s “apparent contradiction” that no security assets were denied for the event. “You must explain this apparent contradiction immediately,” the senator wrote. The whistleblower claimed that the officials at Secret Service headquarters told agents in charge of the Butler campaign event to forgo asking for any additional security via a formal manpower request — which are typically made by lead advance agents ahead of trips and submitted to the local field office, in this case, Pittsburgh. The request, which includes the number of personnel and other security assets, is submitted to the Secret Service’s Office of Protective Operations – Manpower for final review. By allegedly informing agents not to ask for extra security in the formal request, the Secret Service was “effectively denying these assets through informal means,” Hawley (R-Mo.) claimed in the letter to Rowe. The whistleblower claims that officials with the Secret Service’s Office of Protective Operations – Manpower “preemptively informed the Pittsburgh field office that the Butler rally was not going to receive additional security resources because Trump is a former president and not the incumbent President or Vice President. “The manpower request did not include extra security resources because agents on the ground were told not to ask for them in the first place,” Hawley said. The resources requested included counter-sniper teams — which were ultimately approved a day before the event — and counter surveillance division [CSD] personnel, who were not at the rally. “Personnel from CSD would have handcuffed the gunman in the parking lot after he was spotted with a rangefinder, but they were not present on the day,” Hawley said. When Rowe testified before the Senate on July 30, he told lawmakers “all assets requested were approved” for Trump’s Pennsylvania rally. The Post has reached out to the Secret Service for comment. The whistleblower’s allegations were shared publicly by Hawley hours after the head of the Secret Service’s Pittsburgh field office and at least four other agents were placed on leave amid the ongoing investigation into how 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks got so close to assassinating Trump on July 13. Those sidelined include one member of Trump’s personal protective team and four Secret Service members, including the special agent in charge. The agents remain employed by the agency but are barred from working in the field and doing investigative work. Another whistleblower said in July that local law enforcement offered to help with drone technology at the campaign rally, but was turned down by the Secret Service. Hawley penned a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on July 25 demanding answers about a whistleblower’s allegations that the Secret Service “repeatedly” rejected the offer. “The night before the rally, US Secret Service repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally,” Hawley wrote to Mayorkas citing the whistleblower. The Department of Homeland Security oversees the Secret Service.","summary":"Secret Service top brass encouraged agents not to request additional security for Donald Trump&#8217;s Butler, Pa. rally last month where a would-be assassin nearly killed the former president, according to a whistleblower.

According to the Houston Chronicle, Paxton was hoping to have Harris County District Judge R.K.

The Chronicle's Brooke Kushwaha reported that Paxton was hoping to force FIEL Houston to cease operations after the group spoke out against former President Donald Trump, Republican Governor Greg Abbott and the draconian Senate Bill 4 immigration law Abbott signed in 2023.

She added: \"The case against FIEL Houston is the first time, however, that Paxton has targeted an organization for political speech.\" Earlier this year, Paxton announced an investigation into the Catholic-run Annunciation House in El Paso. In a letter to the organization, Paxton's office gave the group just one day to turn over documents containing sensitive information about the migrants that stayed in the group's facilities. The Texas Tribune reported that Paxton's office described the Annunciation House as \"an illegal stash house\" that was \"engaged in the business of human smuggling.\" But on the group's website, Annunciation House \"accompan[ies] the migrant, refugee, and economically vulnerable peoples of the border region through hospitality, advocacy, and education.\" READ MORE: 'Grave irreparable harm': Judge blocks Texas' draconian immigration bill from taking effect Immigrant-focused charities have been a frequent target of the far right in recent years.

But it wasn’t just that unbroken line of logic. There were mountains of evidence!! Source: Larry Busacca/PW18 / Getty First came the whispers, then the much louder rumors and then White House political director Emmy Ruiz posted an emoji of a bee at around 4:30 pm! It was mos def Beyoncé! Why else a bee emoji if it wasn’t related to Queen Bey and the Beyhive???I mean, it was true that Ruiz never said that in actual, literal terms. But what other possible reason for The Bee Emojiiii???? It was the equivalent of Gotham City lighting up the sky with the Bat Signal. But being astute people we are who would never believe something without solid confirmation, we only really, really believed it when TMZ dropped the word and said. It’s. About. To. Go. Down. The Shocking Case of The Six-Year-Old and The Bumble Bee Yellow Red Herring Imagine the shockwaves across all of our investigative brains, all the wide-eyed pearl clutching and Whaaaaaaa??? when we learned that it wasn’t to bey (sorry again) and The Bee Emoji was a cleverly conceived red herring sent out to all of us innocents by Ruiz’s apparently prodigy of child who knew how to get us and get us good. It seems, Ruiz claimed, her precious little one got hold of Mama’s phone and the rest, well.. is…hivstory (forgive me)I’m not sure anyone is swallowing something so simple and obvious, but we’re not the ones to get all national security involved. Not good for the health. So… no Beyoncé live and in-person, but we were actually okay with that because hearing her masterpiece with Kendrick Lamar blasting as the first Black woman of color stepped on the stage to accept the Democratic Party’s nomination as the next POTUS filled us All The Way Up–especially after all that was poured into us by Barack Obama and Michelle Obama’s words, Oprah’s incredible energy and call to action, and the big, beautiful heart of Tim Walz’s son, 17-year-old son, Gus. Source: Justin Sullivan / Getty But in no way least of all, there was also all that incredible music weaving the week together. What a gift! Because think about it: the DNC, with like a month to pull this off, didn’t have to go that hard in the Chi. I mean, could the bar have been set any lower after the RNC and Kid Rock? DNC showed up to say they weren’t there to compete against those guys. They were there to show them and the world how it’s done. And they did that, over and over again and the only thing really missing were our beloved mothers and grandmothers who didn’t make it witness this day, this hour. But if I know them, they were probably there, hiding their wings in the wings holding each other and whispering a soft, powerful chorus of, “G’head Baby. Cause we not going back. We’re not going back.” Here are 5 of the best musical moments from the 2024 DNC! DJ Cassidy’s Roll Call! Source: The Washington Post / Getty Every convention features a state-by-state roll call, where each state accounts for its respective delegates and announces its endorsements. This ending component of the primary process was enhanced at the DNC when DJ Cassidy played music that corresponded with each state. For Indiana, Cassidy played “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough” by the late Michael Jackson, a Gary native. Lil Jon Turns Up With the Turn Down! Source: Chip Somodevilla / Getty DJ Cassidy helped the crowd get motivated with his musical roll call. But for the state of Georgia, he got some assistance from an Atlanta native. Platinum-selling producer and artist Lil Jon brought his trademark boisterousness to the DNC during Georgia’s roll call, briefly performing his smash collaboration with DJ Snake, “Turn Down For What.” Sheila E. and John Legend Honor Prince Source: Myung J. Chun / Getty To coincide with Harris’ running-mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the DNC incorporated a tribute to Minnesota’s favorite song, the late, great Prince. Performing a medley of the legendary singer/songwriter, the DNC featured a Prince medley performed by John Legend and long-time Prince collaborator, percussionist Sheila E. The highlight of the medley was their rendition of “Let’s Go Crazy,” featuring a blistering guitar solo from Ariel “Ari” O’Neal. The Maryland native previously played for Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Ariana Grande. Stevie Wonder Elevated DNC to a the Highest Ground Source: Myung J. Chun / Getty In a moment people will talk about for a long time to come, the national treasure who is Stevie Wonder got everyone up onto a higher ground before he even sung a note. He began by endorsing Harris and calling for peace for the country and “courage over complacency,” and then he took us to the sky with his legendary song, “Higher Ground.” And there’s nothing else to say–except we soared. We soared far up into the clearest sky. And Patti LaBelle Called Our Loved Ones into the Room Source: Justin Sullivan / Getty And still, with all the many triumphant musical moments at the DNC, the power of what was done was the way they chose to honor the breadth of our emotions, and it would be difficult to imagine anyone but Ms. Patti LaBelle doing it better. In a poignant and deeply moving performance of “You Are My Friend,” LaBelle tributed beloveds of ours who had passed away since the 2020 DNC. Behind her we saw images of so many, including the once-in-a-generation actor, Chadwick Boseman, Calvin O. Butts, III, who’d been the cherished senior pastor of Harlem’s world-renowned Abyssinian Baptist Church and defining feminist, theorist, professor and author, bell hooks.

Can they make an impact?","text":"When U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday night, she highlighted an issue that dominated the party’s convention this week: the reality millions of women face without access to abortion. Each day of the convention, audiences inside Chicago’s United Center and watching from home heard harrowing stories from women who faced the prospect of carrying their rapist’s child to term, nearly dying from a miscarriage at home after being denied medical treatment, and almost losing their ability to get pregnant when they chose to be. Harris said she’s heard similar stories from women, as well as their husbands and fathers, across the country in the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which led to abortion bans and restrictions in more than half of all U.S. states. And she warned that Donald Trump and the Republican Party won’t stop there. “This is what’s happening in our country,” she said Thursday. “And understand: he’s not done.” Abortion access was set to be a key election issue well before Harris, an outspoken advocate for reproductive rights and women’s health, replaced U.S. President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. But Democrats are betting it will gain even more attention under Harris, who leads Trump on abortion by 27 points among voters, according to an early August poll by Ipsos. They’re also hoping that wide margin will overcome the leads Trump has over Harris on the economy and immigration. Nine states will also have measures on their ballot in November that will ask voters whether they want to protect access to abortion. Some of those states have enacted new laws since Roe v. Wade was overturned that restrict access during the earliest stages of pregnancy, which would be nullified if voters approve those measures. The complicated legal minefield created by handing the issue of abortion back to the states — which Trump has called a “beautiful thing” — set the stage for women to share their stories at the convention this week. On Monday, Kentucky activist Hadley Duvall recalled how she became pregnant at age 12 after being raped by her stepfather. She was able to have an abortion at the time, but Kentucky has since enacted an abortion ban that does not include exceptions for rape or incest. “I can’t imagine not having a choice,” Duvall, who’s now in her early 20s, said, adding that Trump was to blame by appointing the Supreme Court justices who grew the conservative majority. “He calls it ‘a beautiful thing.’ What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent’s child?” Monday’s audience also heard from Amanda Zurawski, who described being denied an abortion in Texas after her water broke at 18 weeks, and Kaitlyn Joshua, who told of being denied miscarriage care in Louisiana. All three women spoke in front of stark black backdrops. Zurawski and Florida woman Anya Cook, who spoke Thursday, spoke alongside their husbands, with Cook’s holding the couple’s infant daughter — underscoring the impact the health restrictions have on families. “Two years ago, a miscarriage nearly killed me,” Cook said. “I needed care, but my state’s abortion restrictions kept it from me. I miscarried in a bathroom. “I’ll never forget my husband’s face as he tried to stop the bleeding — trying to do what doctors should have been doing.” There were also moments of joy. Kate Cox, a Texas mother who made international headlines after suing the state and then travelling to another state for abortion care that doctors said she needed to ensure her fertility, announced during Tuesday’s celebratory roll-call for Harris that she’s pregnant again. “There’s nothing pro-family about abortion bans,” she said as she helped pledge Texas’s delegates to Harris. Advocates for women’s reproductive and sexual health say the stories heard at the convention can make an impact outside of U.S. politics. “Those stories are a window into understanding the humanity behind a topic that often is used to separate us,” said Debbie Owusu-Akyeeah, co-director of policy and advocacy at Action Canada for Sexual Health & Rights. Owusu-Akyeeah singled out Duvall in particular for “being brave enough to go on stage and tell that story.” “There was just something about that bravery that I thought was super important and beautiful,” she said. Democratic lawmakers also shared their own stories of being able to choose when to start a family, or the difficulty they faced with infertility treatments. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office in 2018, said in her convention remarks that she was only able to conceive her daughters through in vitro fertilization (IVF). During his speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz also reiterated his now well-known story of how he and his wife needed fertility treatments to conceive their daughter Hope. Democrats have warned that Republicans will seek to ban access to IVF after an Alabama Supreme Court decision in February temporarily blocked the treatment, and GOP lawmakers voted against an effort to enshrine access into law. The current and former presidents of Planned Parenthood, Alexis McGill Johnson and Cecile Richards, respectively, spoke at the convention Wednesday about the importance of voting for abortion access, as did Mini Timmaraju, CEO and president of Reproductive Freedom for All. So did surprise guest Oprah Winfrey, who touched on reproductive rights during her speech. “If you do not have autonomy over this,” she said, gesturing toward her body, “if you cannot control when and how you choose to bring your children into this world and how they are raised and supported, there is no American dream.” Democrats repeatedly warned that Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law “with or without Congress,” something Trump has denied. But the Project 2025 policy document that has been tied to his campaign and members of his past administration suggests such measures as banning or limiting the availability of abortion medication, increased data collection on abortions from states and an “unapologetically pro-life” co-ordinator of women’s health initiatives in the U.S. government. “Simply put, they are out of their minds,” Harris said Thursday night, vowing to sign a bill that restores abortion access nationally. “We trust women.” While the stories heard at the convention may affect votes in the U.S., Owusu-Akyeeah said the impact will go beyond America’s borders. “I hope this will be a reminder for many Canadians who are thinking about what this all means for us, and (understanding that) access is still not 100 per cent guaranteed for everybody,” she said. “This is health care, and everyone should be able to access this and make decisions that impact their bodies, their health and their future.”","summary":"The Democratic National Convention heard personal stories from women who faced restrictions on reproductive care, which advocates say will resonate beyond U.S. voters.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10710856/dnc-abortion-womens-health-kamala-harris/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/CP172954233-e1724450101950.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 23:01:51","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":254800692,"title":"Letters: Rules needed | Trump will take | Presidential qualities | Halloween desensitizes","text":"Federal and state rules needed for e-bikes Re: “Cities struggle to get a handle on e-bike safety” (Page A1, Aug. 19).

Ed Kahl from Woodside is already crying wolf regarding inflation under a Harris presidency. He believes that Joe Biden’s administration is the reason for our inflation. Ed apparently forgot about COVID and the global supply shortages that were caused by it. I never read that Ed complained about Donald Trump calling the pandemic a hoax and that it would “just go away,” but he’s now complaining about inflation that has been decreasing slowly but still decreasing. Inflation in the United States is high, but it’s higher around the world in other democratic countries. The government gave millions of Americans a hand during the pandemic. That helped many Americans. The other hand (that of Trump) will take any money given to the middle class by the government and give it to his rich friends. The government gives with one hand and the other takes it away, right?

His newly minted Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, had just accused him of groveling to dictators, imperiling democracy, betraying American values and, to top it off, deemed him “an unserious man.” So Trump picked up the telephone and called Fox News. The network quickly patched him in to its live coverage of the Democratic convention, and the former president proceeded to issue a meandering, stream-of-consciousness rebuttal. Several times, Fox anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum tried to interject to ask a question. Several times, Trump ignored them. “Mr. President, let me interrupt,” Baier pleaded at one point. Trump kept talking. The impromptu call-in — which lasted for 10 minutes, until Fox News informed Trump that the network had run out of time — came shortly after he had taken to his social media platform, Truth Social, to provide real-time commentary on Harris’ speech. His posts there, capitalized in a haphazard manner, were less directed at her specific remarks than at broader complaints about issues that Trump wants to keep the focus on: crime, immigration and the economy. At times, he digressed. “WHERE’S HUNTER?” Trump asked as Harris came onstage, reviving one of his favorite slogans about the son of President Joe Biden, who withdrew his candidacy weeks ago. At one point, referring to Harris, Trump asked, in all capital letters, “Is she talking about me?” (She was, often.) Trump also accused Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, of puffing up his resume as a leader of a high school football team. “Walz was an ASSISTANT Coach, not a COACH,” he wrote. A few minutes later, on Fox News, Trump argued that Harris had not accomplished much during her tenure as vice president. “All of these things that she talked about — ‘We are going to do this, we are going to do that, we are going to do everything’ — but she didn’t do any of it!” Trump said on the air, complaining that “she didn’t talk about China, she didn’t talk about fracking, she didn’t talk about crime.” His one concession? The Democrats’ convention hall. “It was a nice-looking room,” he said. When MacCallum observed, accurately, that Harris was “having some success” with women, Hispanic and Black voters, Trump objected. “She’s not having success; I’m having success,” he said. “I’m doing great with the Hispanic voters, doing great with Black men, I’m doing great with women.” “It’s only in your eyes that they have that, Martha,” he added. “We are doing very well.” At several points during the call, a familiar beeping sound interrupted Trump’s remarks. It appeared that the former president was accidentally pressing buttons on the keypad of his phone. Finally, while Trump was still midsentence, Baier moved to end the interview and thanked his guest for his time: “We appreciate that live feedback.” The network immediately shifted to an episode of its late-night comedy program, “Gutfeld!” The host, Greg Gutfeld, looked bemused. “That wasn’t my fault, Donald Trump,” he said, speaking to the president through the TV. “He’s still talking, by the way,” Gutfeld joked.

Kennedy, who belongs to one of the most-known American families in politics, said on Friday that he was dropping out because he did not see a “real path to the White House” for himself. “I promised the American people that I would withdraw from the race if I became a spoiler,” Kennedy said at a rally. “In my heart, I no longer believe that I have a realistic path to electoral victory in the face of this relentless, systematic censorship and media control.” As for his reasons for supporting Trump, Kennedy said it was the same as his reasons for leaving the Democratic party and running as an Independent. Free speech and Ukraine were among the reasons he cited more specifically. “We just had a very nice endorsement from RFK,” Trump said. “We’re going to be talking about that … great guy, respected by everybody,” Trump said. Polls suggest his exit will likely help Trump, who has slipped behind Vice President Kamala Harris in polls. Kennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. Kennedy’s long-shot campaign was beset with troubles from the start. His own family opposed it and relatives attacked him publicly and brutally. “It is a sad ending to a sad story,” they wrote in a statement after his announcement. The statement was signed by Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Courtney, Kerry, Chris and Rory Kennedy, children of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in California while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. Kennedy’s campaign appeared to be in even more trouble after reports said he had been in talks with the campaigns of former President Trump and Vice-President Harris.

The coalition filed suit Friday to halt the program launched by President Biden in June, saying in court filings that the administration bypassed Congress to create a pathway to citizenship for “blatant political purposes.” “This action incentivizes illegal immigration and will irreparably harm the Plaintiff states,” the suit filed in federal court in Tyler, Texas, says. Under the policy, which started taking applications Monday, many spouses without legal status can apply for something called “parole in place,” offering permission to stay in the U.S., apply for a green card and eventually get on a path to citizenship. But the program has been particularly contentious in an election year where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty for people who broke the law. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement Friday that the plan “violates the Constitution and actively worsens the illegal immigration disaster that is hurting Texas and our country.” The suit filed against the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other Biden administration officials accuses the agency of attempting to parole spouses “en masse,” which the states contend is an abuse of power. The states also filed a motion asking for the program to be put on hold while the lawsuit proceeds. In a post on X, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said her state is challenging the parole in place policy because she believes the Biden administration “is illegally using ‘parole’ in a systematic way to advance their open-borders agenda.” The conservative nonprofit America First Legal, which is headed by Stephen Miller, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, is serving as co-counsel in the lawsuit. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Mayra Alejandra said the agency will defend the Keeping Families Together program in court and continues to process already submitted applications as well as accept new applications. “Keeping Families Together is grounded in well-established legal authority, and its purpose – enabling the families of U.S. Citizens to live without fear of separation – is consistent with fundamental American values,” Alejandra said. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández fired back against Republicans “playing politics” and characterized the lawsuit as another form of family separation. “This lawsuit is seeking to force U.S. citizens and their families, people who have lived in the United States for more than ten years, to continue to live in the shadows,” Fernandez said in a statement. The bipartisan immigration and criminal justice organization FWD.us said the program is in compliance with the law and noted the timing of the lawsuit – as Vice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for president. “The only motivation behind this lawsuit is the cruelty of tearing families apart and the crass politics of hoping a judge might do the bidding of the anti-immigrant movement,” the organization said in a statement. Karen Tumlin, founder and director of the Justice Action Center, called the legal challenge “unsurprising yet extremely disappointing and cruel.” “However, it’s important to emphasize that nothing changes for now, and the process is still open and accepting applications,” she said. To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security threat or have a disqualifying criminal history, and have been married to a citizen by June 17 – the day before the program was announced. They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application, including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the country. If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency. During that period, they can get work authorization. The administration estimates about 500,000 people could be eligible, plus about 50,000 of their children. Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen. They can be required to return to their home country – often for years – and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in. The lawsuit contends that states will bear the burden of additional immigrants staying in the country. Texas, the suit says, spends tens of millions of dollars each year on a program that provides health insurance for children, including those in the country illegally. It says that the state also spends millions each year “for increased law enforcement as its citizens suffer increased crime, unemployment, environmental harm, and social disorder due to illegal immigration.” Because the program beneficiaries will be entitled to work authorization, those additional workers “will drive down the wages of Texas residents, directly harming the State and its citizens,” the lawsuit says. Evelyn Wiese, an immigration attorney at American Immigrant Justice, described the lawsuit as an “attack” on mixed status families who have spent years contributing to their communities in the United States. “Trying to rip apart these families and prevent them from accessing a lawful pathway to status in the U.S. is cruel and reflective of anti-immigrant extremism,” she said.

Joy, 81, was eager to know ‘what shade of orange’ Trump was, as Sunny explained: ‘It’s a burnt sienna. I had never seen him in person and I didn’t realize he was that orange. Ana [Navarro] has been making jokes about how orange he is… it’s almost like a radioactive orange.’ Sunny continued: ‘It’s very shocking to see in person, it really is, because he’s a tall person and also a little thinner now, I don’t know if he’s taking the shot or whatever…’ before Joy butted in and claimed: ‘He’s on Ozempic, you know it!’ referring to the controversial drug being used for weight loss. Spilling more details from inside the courtroom, Sunny said: ‘He’s actually looking thinner, but then here’s the tea, okay… so he is unlike any defendant sitting in a court room that I’ve ever seen. ‘He’s stretching out like this,’ she claimed, while demonstrating with her arms out. ‘He’s like fist bumping with attorneys, he took a little nap… like most defendants do not do that. They are instructed to sit there, pay attention, look with some humility. That’s not Donald Trump.’ Comedian Joy then asked: ‘So out of all the seven dwarfs is he Grumpy or Dopey or Sleepy?’ to which Sunny replied: ‘I think he’s Sleepy and Dopey combination,’ as the live studio audience burst out laughing. Ana, 52, then joked: He’s allegedly farty!’ as Sunny confirmed: ‘I did not smell the farting yesterday, I was sitting down wind but I did not smell the farting.’ The View panel then debated whether or not they think Trump will go to jail if he’s convicted. The former President has denied 34 counts of falsifying business records by hiding the reimbursement to former lawyer Michael Cohen over the $130,000 he paid Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their alleged affair. Sunny shared her predictions and said: ‘I really think that he will be convicted. There are [34] counts, he’ll be convicted of some of them, if not all of them. I do believe that he will appeal the conviction. ‘I think it will matter that he was convicted, and I think he won’t serve four years in prison, but I can’t imagine that he gets off with no jail time. I think that would send the wrong message, it will send that he’s above the law.’ Joy fired back: ‘I don’t believe he’ll go to jail,’ as Trump’s former White House aide Alyssa, 34, chimed in and said: ‘If I could just mention, I want to be clear, I think he will be convicted. My skepticism is that I’m not sure they’ve proven the case completely yet but there’s two more weeks of this.’ Ana then spoke up and said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t want to put all my eggs in the basket. I guess I don’t want to get my hopes up because I’ve gotten my hopes up when it comes to Trump so many times. ‘I think he’s guilty as can be. I think, in my eyes – but I realize I’m biased – in my eyes, this has been absolutely proven and I think part of the stupidity of Trump and his lawyers is denying this affair, which I think anybody and everybody with a brain knows happened and that’s why they’re having to go into such salacious detail.’ ‘But all that being said, I’m not holding my breath that he gets convicted,’ she added as Sara Haines agreed and said: ‘I think he’s guilty and I think he should be, I don’t think they’ll hold him accountable in the sense of serving any time.’ ‘There’s a lot of people who we all thought were guilty that didn’t end up going to jail, right?’ Ana argued as Sunny claimed: ‘It would send a message that he broke the law but he is above the law and I don’t think the American people will stand for it.’ Ana then pointed out: ‘A lot of people felt that way about O.J. Simpson who was also a powerful, rich celebrity,’ before joking: ‘But I guess this time, if the condom don’t fit, then you must acquit!’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe View&#8217;s Joy Behar has accused Donald Trump of being &#8216;on Ozempic&#8217;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joy Behar of The View claims Donald Trump is taking OZEMPIC as Sunny Hostin provides inside information about his trial, all while making fun of the former President&#8217;s &#8220;radioactive orange&#8221; complexion. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/joy-behar-of-the-view-claims-donald-trump-is-taking-ozempic-as-sunny-hostin-provides-inside-information-about-his-trial-all-while-making-fun-of-the-former-presidents-radioactive-orange-complexi/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-The-View039s-Joy-Behar-accuses-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:36:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":254800332,"title":"How much momentum will RFK Jr.'s endorsement give Trump?","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Friday that he had suspended his campaign for the presidency and endorsed former President Donald Trump (though he said he will remain on the ballot in states that are not competitive at the presidential level). Kennedy's bid failed to garner enough support to contend in any state, and support for him in national polls fell by nearly half after President Joe Biden dropped out of the running to be the Democratic Party's nominee. Our analysis of the polling data suggests Kennedy's endorsement of Trump will have a minimal impact on the race. Kennedy, who has consistently polled around 5 percent since Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee, was drawing roughly equally from both Trump and Harris, with that support coming from both traditionally Democratic and traditionally Republican groups. His endorsement of Trump may marginally help the Republican among white, male, and older voters. But the effect of his departure on overall support for either candidate will be small. Kennedy's candidacy has a small effect on our polling averages So where will Kennedy's voters go? There are a few ways to calculate a guess. The most straightforward method is to calculate an average of support for Harris and Trump using only the polls that allow voters to express support for Kennedy, and then compare those results to their average support in polls that do not include Kennedy as a response option. This allows us to guess where his voters might be going if they're forced to pick other options. 538's national presidential polling average is doing similar math when combining polls with different response options, so we can extract an estimated effect from the aggregation model as a first guess. Our model tells us that support for Harris is 1.3 percentage points higher in polls testing support only for Harris and Trump than in polls where Kennedy is included. In comparison, Trump's support is 1.5 percentage points higher in two-way polls than when voters get the third-party option. Adding it up, this suggests that Kennedy's presence in the race is drawing slightly more support away from Trump and increasing Harris's margin by about 0.2 percentage points on average across the states. To put that in context, the daily absolute change in 538's margin for Harris in our national polling average is, on average, 0.21 percentage points. In other words, the direct effect of Kennedy dropping out, according to polling toplines alone, is about the same as the amount that polls tend to fluctuate based on the average day's news or campaigning. With Kennedy gone, heavily partisan groups will repolarize Another way to guess who Kennedy is pulling more votes from is to look at voting patterns at the demographic level and compare results poll-by-poll instead of inferring aggregate trends (which is what our polling average does). To do this, we collected all of the Harris-Trump polls that have been conducted since July 21 and included both two-way and multiple-candidate questions on presidential support. Then, we aggregated support for each candidate at the demographic group level using the published crosstabs for these polls, where available, and looked at how the margin between Harris and Trump differed within each of these groups when Kennedy was or was not included in the question.* (To be clear, this is not the same as our topline polling average: No fancy modeling has been applied to this data, just a simple average of all the polls.) When Kennedy is absent from surveys, support for Harris rises most among Asian, Black and Hispanic voters,** as well as with nonwhite voters without college degrees and young voters. Trump, meanwhile, consolidates support with men, white and rural voters, and voters over 30. That means Trump is best situated to capitalize on Kennedy's endorsement among the groups already friendliest to both of them. For the most part, however, Kennedy is drawing few votes from either candidate and, once again, the effect of his withdrawal on the race is likely to be small. Harris's margin over Trump changes by less than two percentage points in 16 out of the 18 groups we considered, and by less than one percentage point in more than a third. In fact, the most notable trend in our demographic-level analysis is a repolarization of solid Democratic and Republican groups; that is, without Kennedy on the ballot, Harris tends to gain among groups that are typically solidly Democratic, while Trump does better with key Republican demographics. But vote intention among the more swingy groups — suburbanites, college-educated nonwhites, and women — changes little. Exit this way While running for president, Kennedy was often discussed in terms of whether he would be a spoiler candidate for either Trump or Biden/Harris. This was a distinct possibility: As of Aug. 23 at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, our election forecast for Trump and Harris gives Kennedy a 0-in-100 chance of winning the majority of Electoral College votes, but a 40-in-100 chance of third-party candidates winning more votes in any decisive state than the margin between Harris and Trump in that state. With Kennedy's exit likely to lower those odds, that's a big reason Trump is likely glad to have Kennedy's support, even if he doesn't bring many votes to the table. When Ross Perot bowed out of the 1992 presidential race (before later reentering it), he said he did not want to send the election to the House of Representatives by siphoning off enough electoral votes to prevent any candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority. And while Kennedy also specified in his announcement Friday that he is withdrawing his name in battleground states where he might prove to be a spoiler, he struck a different (and, to be clear, not very realistic) tune by technically remaining in the race. \"I encourage you to vote for me,\" he said, specifying that his name will appear on the ballot in most states. \"And if enough of you do vote for me, and neither of the major-party candidates win 270 [electoral] votes, which is quite possible … I could conceivably still end up in the White House in a contingent election.\" In order to be eligible to be elected president by the House, however, Kennedy would need to win at least one Electoral College vote from a state's slate of presidential electors. That is likely an overly optimistic forecast (following an overly optimistic campaign). Toward the end of his press conference, Kennedy officially threw his support behind Trump. That may reflect a more prescient prediction of where his future in American politics lies. Footnotes *When pollsters released results among different populations, we preferred polls of likely voters over those of registered voters and registered voters over all adults. When a pollster released multiple different multi-candidate matchups, we included the matchup with the largest candidate field when calculating the margin including Kennedy. We included all national polls conducted after July 21 and released by Aug. 22 at 11:59pm. **Some pollsters include a \"Hispanic\" demographic group in their crosstabs, and others include a \"Latino\" group. We included both categories in the Hispanic/Latino averages.","summary":"Polls show Robert F.

Tim Walz to accept their party’s nomination as president and vice president of the United States. It turned into an all-out political festival filled with powerful speeches, surprise performances and touching moments that brought all Americans — no matter race, gender or creed — together by the tens of millions The DNC kicked off on Monday and wrapped Thursday. It was a full house in Chicago, with what looked like all 23,500 seats in the Windy City’s United Center completely filled. Couples, parents with young children, students, celebs and large face cutouts of Harris and Walz could be seen from every view of the room. And while a falsely reported Beyoncé performance of “Freedom,” Harris’ main campaign number, would have been a nice cherry on top, the event was lively from start to finish, and that’s why it captivated everyone who tuned in. This DNC is better than any award show in the last 5 years— Wilma M. Holla ✨ (@LetAnthonyRock) August 23, 2024 In short: the DNC was just one hell of a good time, and there were key moments that made it so. Take a look at the best viral moments from the 2024 DNC. 1. Jesse Jackson gets a standing ovation On the first night of the convention, Rev. Jesse Jackson, 82, received a standing ovation when he appeared on stage. The moment marked 40 years since Jackson ran his presidential campaign in 1984, seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination. He lost to Walter Mondale, who was ultimately defeated by Republican contender Ronald Reagan. 2. Parents of Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin take the stage Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg, the parents of Hamas hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, took the stage to call for the immediate return of their son, and pushed for a cease-fire deal in one of the conventions most rivetingly emotional speeches. 3. Chuck Schumer dances it out U.S. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gained a lot of attention from folks during the DNC, but it wasn’t because of his remarks at the podium — it was how he paraded to it. Before he gave his speech, he showed off some of his moves. For whatever reason, the moment went viral and late night hosts haven’t been able to stop laughing about it. 4. Lil Jon goes from the window to the Walz One of the most exciting moments from the convention was one no one anticipated. During the 50 states’ roll call, the city of Atlanta, Georgia brought out iconic record producer and rapper Lil Jon, who did a performance of his hit track “Turn Down for What.” 5. Tim Walz’s son, Gus Walz, breaks down in tears This moment speaks for itself, and showcases vice presidential nominee Tim Walz as the family man he is. 6. Hillary Clinton relishes chants of “lock him up!” against Trump After bringing up former President Donald Trump’s 34 felony charges, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton inspired chants of “lock him up!” in the arena, echoing the Trump and his supporters’ 2016 threats to imprison Clinton. 7. Kamala Harris’ nieces teach the world how to pronounce her name One of the cutest moments from the convention, whilst also a very serious matter, was the appearance of Harris’ grandnieces. With the help of actress Kerry Washington, the three guided the audience through how to pronounce Harris’ first name. The teaching lesson came after Trump and members of the GOP have consistently mispronounced her name. 8. Michelle Obama reads Trump for his “Black jobs” comments During former First Lady Michelle Obama’s speech, she called out Trump’s repeated use of the term “Black jobs,” as well as the former president’s history of attacking the Obamas. 9. D.L. Hughley apologizes for spreading lies about Kamala Harris Actor and comedian D.L. Hughley took the stage, not just to encourage the support of Harris, but to also apologize to her for previously spreading misinformation about her history in politics. 10. Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn share a “Scandal” reunion Last but not least, “Scandal” fans were falling over in their seats when they saw Kerry Washington and Tony Goldwyn take the stage together and ask the crowd for a group selfie.","summary":"The ratings blowout event came to us live from Chicago this week with the Obamas, Kamala Harris and Coach Tim Walz\n\n\nThe post The 10 Best 2024 DNC Moments, From Tim Walz&#8217;s Son to That &#8216;Scandal&#8217; Reunion | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/dnc-best-viral-moments-2024/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rump-18.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:33:41","author":"Raquel 'rocky' Harris","authors":["Raquel 'rocky' Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.152},{"id":254799032,"title":"Harris Narrowly Tops Trump In Convention Speech Viewership—DNC’s Final Night Draws 26 Million Viewers","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline The Democratic National Convention’s fourth night attracted 26.2 million viewers on average, according to data from Nielsen, with viewership surging during Vice President Kamala Harris’ acceptance speech, which peaked with a couple hundred thousand more viewers than the peak of former President Donald Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last month.

We’ve tried to do these Wang Yi-Jake Sullivan touch points about once a quarter,” he said.“(The election) is always in the background in any engagement we have with foreign officials concerned about what comes next or what the transition will be like, but this meeting will be focused on the topics and the issues that we are dealing with,” the official added.Sullivan, during his visit, would push for a resumption of theatre-level military-to-military talks with China, and is also likely to raise the US’s concerns about China’s “increased military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan.”Notably, China-US relations have been turbulent in recent years. The two countries have sparred over their economic ambitions, and incidents like the US downing of a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon last year further inflamed tensions, Al Jazeera reported.Notably, this is the first visit by a US national security adviser since 2016, though other senior US officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, have visited China over the past two years.Sullivan’s visit comes within months of the US’s general election in November, in which Vice President Kamala Harris is running to succeed outgoing president Joe Biden.If she wins, Harris is expected to continue to seek dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure. Meanwhile, her Republican rival Donald Trump has vowed to pursue a harder line with China, with some of his aides seeing a far-reaching global showdown ahead, as reported by Al Jazeera.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/08/us-nsa-jake-sullivan-to-visit-china-next-week-discuss-taiwan-issue-fentanyl-crisis/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/us-nsa-jake-sullivan-to-visit-china-next-week-discuss-taiwan-issue-fentanyl-crisis.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:31:16","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":254799388,"title":"An attack at a festival in a German city kills 3 people and wounds 4 seriously, police say","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories BREAKING BREAKING | An attack at a festival in a German city kills 3 people and wounds 4 seriously, police say Three people were killed and four were seriously wounded in an attack on Friday at a festival in the western German city of Solingen, police said.

The lawsuit argues the program, which began accepting applications on Monday, oversteps the administration’s authority to provide relief to those without legal status and circumvents the intent of U.S. immigration laws. The initiative, called Keeping Families Together, provides a path to citizenship to an estimated 500,000 immigrant spouses who entered the U.S. illegally and have at least 10 years of residence. Without this option, many would need to leave the U.S. for years before being able to return legally. Republicans have made illegal immigration a central focus of the Nov. 5 presidential election where former President Donald Trump, a Republican, will face off against the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. America First Legal, an organization led by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, served as co-counsel in the lawsuit alongside Texas and 15 other states with Republican attorneys general. Miller, a driving force behind Trump’s restrictive policies during his 2017-2021 presidency, called the Biden program “brazenly unlawful” in a statement. Keeping Families Together also allows some 50,000 children under age 21 with a U.S.-citizen parent to obtain temporary “parole” status that creates a path to citizenship. White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez said the Texas lawsuit aimed to separate families and “goes against our nation’s values.” Texas has repeatedly clashed with the Biden administration in court over immigration and border issues. A federal appeals court in July said Texas could keep a large floating barrier in the Rio Grande River intended to block migrants illegally crossing from Mexico.","summary":"Texas, Florida, and others sued President Joe Biden’s administration over a new immigration program for spouses of U.S. citizens.

Kennedy Jr.’s running mate Nichole Shanahan expressed doubts about Donald Trump and said their campaign would never “sell out,” hours before RFK Jr. endorsed the former president. In an interview on the Adam Carolla Show that aired on Friday, Shanahan described the challenges the RFK campaign has had getting on the ballot in states like New York and tried to calm speculation they were about to endorse Trump, telling Carolla only RFK would make that announcement. “We would never sell out this campaign ever. It’s not what we would ever choose to do nor are we defeated in this moment, but I have to say something. We are up against something that is unprecedented,” she said. “My statement was that we are weighing our options of staying in or working however we can with a plan b to ensure that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz do not end up in office in November,” she added, referring to comments on a different podcast where she described the campaign “looking at” endorsing Trump. Elsewhere in the interview, Shanahan described certain reservations about allying with Trump, including his record on Covid, including \"the vaccinations, the lockdowns letting Fauci and Francis Collins run the show, the firing of the other folks at the NIH and individuals at the CDC that were censored.\" \"There was a lot that happened under Donald Trump’s watch that should not have happened and cannot happen again,\" she said. Later that day, RFK Jr. did in fact endorse Trump, suspending his campaign and removing his name from the ballot in 10 battleground states. The decision was “agonizing”, Kennedy said, but he argued it aligned with his stances against Big Pharma and his belief a Trump administration would work to combat chronic disease. Other members of the Kennedy family, many of whom opposed RFK Jr.’s candidacy to begin with, condemned the endorsement. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” they said in a statement. “It is a sad ending to a sad story.” The Kennedy campaign was projected to get about five percent of the expected share of national votes, and it’s unclear how his supporters will impact the race going forward, given the tight margins between the two leading candidates.","summary":"RFK eventually threw support behind Trump, calling the decision ‘agonizing’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-trump-nicole-shanahan-b2601122.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/20/19/Screenshot-2024-08-20-at-2.08.49%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WHDHqlFQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:30:16","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":254799666,"title":"MARSDEN: Kamala Harris has forgotten Canada","text":"David Marsden is a Calgary writer and editor. It’s often said an omission is worse than a lie. In other words, if you don’t reveal the complete truth, you are intentionally peddling a falsehood. That doesn’t speak well of an individual’s character.Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris did that Thursday in her stirring speech to close out the party’s convention in Chicago. She spoke passionately of her hardscrabble upbringing and moving around America as a young girl with her teacher mother, an immigrant from India.Harris never mentioned she spent many of her formative years in Canada. She arrived at age 12 in Quebec and graduated from high school in the province. So when Harris shared that a high school classmate revealed that she was being sexually abused, the conversation presumably happened in Canada.One of Harris’s Montreal schoolmates told the CBC that Harris changed her life.“When I was in high school, I was being molested by my stepfather, and Kamala and I were best friends. I shared the story with her, which is not always easy to do, to tell someone. And I was close with her.“I told her and she went home and told her mom, and her mom, she said, ‘she has to come stay with us.’ So I stayed with them for the latter part of the high school year.”Harris said Thursday that the emotional exchange persuaded her to pursue a career in law and bring offenders to justice — but again no mention of Canada.It’s clear that a candidate who characterizes her mother — who was a respected researcher focusing on breast cancer cures — as a teacher, is pandering to the lowest level of voter. If a person is truly proud of their past, they share it all, including their mother’s professional success and the time they spent in a foreign country.Perhaps that’s what politics does to a person. Democrats would rather rally around the daughter of poor immigrants, rather than someone who makes $284,600 a year and spent her early life in Canada. Harris talks a good talk, but has little in common with the average American she pretends to represent. They don’t fly around the world in a huge private jet while blathering about climate change. The average wage in the United States is shy of $64,000 a year, far short of the salary of the leader that is supposed to be one of them.But, of course, few people are interested in anything beyond their doorstep. They’d rather absorb Pollyanna rhetoric about freedom and a woman’s right to get an abortion, than hear the truth about a person’s past. Such soothing messages sell well with the electorate, so that’s what Democrats put on the shelf with tremendous flourish with their star-studded gala posing as a political convention.Her dismissal of Canada is reminiscent of the Canadian Caper, maybe better known as the theme of the 2012 movie Argo, starring Ben Affleck. After America granted asylum to the Shah of Iran in 1979, extremists attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, but six diplomats escaped and were given protection in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor.Part of the ruse was to conduct an imaginary film and provide the embassy staff with Canadian passports. If you watch Argo, Canada plays a small role, even though Taylor is widely credited for his resourcefulness in support of an important ally in volatile circumstances.For the Americans, it’s all about America. There’s nothing wrong with that, but a true telling of the facts would be welcome.Harris, for instance, pointed out Thursday her government worked out a bipartisan bill to ensure border security in the south. It’s not wrong to say Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pressured his party’s representatives to oppose the deal, so the problem of illegal immigration would survive for the election. But she declared Thursday, she would sign the bill into law as president.If that wasn’t possible this year, how will that be possible next year?Harris also spoke about ensuring Israel has the right and means to defend itself. Then she said Palestine has the right to safety and security. Isn’t that the struggle that has plagued the region for decades?She said the president and herself have been working around the clock to secure a peace deal in the Middle East. That claim either speaks to the intransigence of the Mideast parties or the ineffectiveness of President Joe Biden and Harris.There’s little doubt Harris would be a preferable president for Canadians. Unlike Trump, she isn’t threatening to cut off malingering NATO allies such as Canada. She’s also a bridge-builder, not a knocker-downer like Trump.Still, she should tell the truth, and when she fails to mention her Canadian connection during the biggest speech of her life, it raises question about her character. Americans deserve a fulsome account, if she’s going to ride on her past, not someone who picks and chooses the facts.David Marsden is a Calgary writer and editor.","summary":"It’s often said an omission is worse than a lie.

He said in his announcing press conference Friday he believes he would’ve won the election “in an honest system.” However, Kennedy could still technically win the White House with a contingent election. Here’s what that means: If Kennedy receives at least one electoral vote and neither Vice President Kamala Harris nor former President Donald Trump reach 270 electoral votes, the presidential election will go to Congress to decide. House congressional delegations would vote for the president, and the Senate would vote for the vice president. Both would need to come to a majority vote to elect either. In that scenario, Republicans or Democrats could revolt against their candidate and vote for Kennedy, and he would only have to lobby a couple of hundred congressional members instead of millions of voters. What makes the situation more than improbable is that even if this tie does happen, more likely than not, Republicans, who lead in House delegations 26-22, would choose Trump. Two states are tied, Minnesota and North Carolina. For a tie to happen, Kennedy would need more than one electoral vote as well. He’d need at least two because a 269-269 tie gives no room for him to have a vote. That’d mean he’d either have to win two of the single-vote congressional districts in Maine or Nebraska or an entire state. Either of those scenarios would be close to impossible but still not technically impossible. The most likely impact of Kennedy’s campaign will be his withdrawal from all swing states. The public perception is that it will benefit Trump because Kennedy endorsed him, but it’s no guarantee. Trump’s campaign has already come out with their own numbers of how this will benefit them Even if it’s a swing of a point or two to Trump or Harris in these states, Kennedy can make a massive difference with his withdrawal.","summary":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F.

It was a disappointing, if entirely predictable, outcome. And many, many other stars did grace the convention stage. Both Republican and Democratic convention organizers worked hard to secure headline-making names to drum up attention, followed hopefully by votes and possibly donations. But even without Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, it was clear that only one party truly understood the assignment. At the DNC, Democrats used celebrities across all four days to promote the specific policies of the party, and to connect each celebrity’s brand with their brand. On Thursday night, the convention featured Pink, a singer who has used her music to fight for LGBTQ+ equality long before it became fashionable, and The Chicks, who boldly risked their careers in country music to speak out against right-wing militarism. Comedian D.L. Hughley, known for his clever commentary on race, took the stage to hilariously call out Trump’s race-baiting politics. Common and John Legend, both known for music that advocates and celebrates the quest for racial justice, took the stage earlier in the week. And Oprah Winfrey, an iconic figure who famously overcame the obstacles of race, class and gender to become a billionaire cultural behemoth, endorsed Harris’ historic quest to do the same. Trailblazing director Spike Lee watched from the crowd as barrier-breaking actresses Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Mindy Kaling helped host. And heard throughout was the official campaign song, Beyoncé's “Freedom,” the rare instance of a singer and song matching the message and meaning of a political campaign. Contrast this with the strange Republican mélange of Kid Rock, Amber Rose, Russell Brand, reality star Savannah Chrisley, UFC head honcho Dana White and Hulk Hogan that assembled a few short weeks ago in Milwaukee. These celebrities didn’t reinforce any message or create any vibe. They certainly didn’t connect to any policy. Some seemed to contradict the actual policies of the reality TV candidate they were allegedly endorsing, leading to such outlandish moments as Amber Rose saying Trump is “all love.” Rose probably should have watched more of the actual RNC speakers, who spent much of the convention advocating for bigotry and hate. The biggest theme of the RNC celebrity choices, if you can call it a theme, was that “Trump is cool.” One could argue this is an actual political strategy, based on wooing young male voters. But even then, it’s unclear how widespread the 71-year-old Hulk Hogan’s fan base is anymore. Kid Rock has recently made more headlines for boycotting beer than he has for any particularly artistic endeavor. And Amber Rose is … barely a celebrity. This isn’t to say that Democrats always get celebrity politics right. As someone who worked on the 2016 Democratic convention, it’s clear to me now that we failed to connect many of the celebrities to any meaningful message or strategy. Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz performed, and both Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver took to the stage — but it wasn’t always clear why. What were they saying about the campaign Hillary Clinton was waging against Donald Trump? Similarly, when Robert De Niro showed up at Trump’s hush money trial, his appearance seemed like a tabloid distraction. A better strategy would have been to have a pro-choice female celebrity connect Trump’s sexist behavior with his sexist policies and discuss how Trump wants to put the government in our bedroom, while expecting privacy in his. Why does any of this matter? We can never know for sure, but in the same way that Will Rogers’ everyman persona helped FDR position himself as the champion of ordinary Americans, or the Italian Catholic Frank Sinatra reinforced Irish Catholic JFK’s message of generational change, a good celebrity surrogate can complement, bolster and spread a candidate's message.

The convention's final night aired across 15 television networks and drew about 820,000 more viewers than the estimated 25.4 million people who watched the final night of the Republican event, Nielsen reported. Vice President Kamala Harris' speech accepting her party’s nomination aired from approximately 10:31 p.m. to 11:11 p.m. ET and averaged 28.9 million viewers. That edged out the audience that tuned in for former President Donald Trump's acceptance speech by about 500,000 viewers — about 28.4 million people watched Trump speak during the 10:45 to 11 p.m. ET window, Nielsen said. The DNC in Chicago attracted a larger audience each night than the RNC, which took place last month in Milwaukee. The first night of the Republican convention drew an estimated 18.13 million viewers, compared to around 20 million viewers on the DNC's opening night, according to Nielsen. Viewership for the DNC increased to an estimated 20.7 million people on Tuesday night, which included remarks from former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. The figures show an increase from four years ago, when the party’s virtual convention, consisting of a mix of recorded and live events that were all done remotely, lacked the energy of the past week’s live, in-person event. The DNC's closing night exceeded viewership for the convention’s final night four years ago, when 24.6 million viewers tuned in across cable and TV for President Joe Biden’s speech. Virtual convention aside, fewer viewers overall were watching on Thursday night than they have on the final nights of conventions in years past, as TV viewership has broadly continued to decline. In 2016, 30 million viewers tuned in for the final night of the 2016 Democratic convention.","summary":"The Democratic National Convention in Chicago attracted a larger audience each night than the RNC, which took place last month in Milwaukee.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/final-night-democratic-convention-outpaces-closing-night-rnc-rcna168018","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240823-kamala-harris-ew-526p-41ee20.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:20:57","author":"Zoë Richards","authors":["Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":254801308,"title":"Trump's worst nightmare: DNC trounces RNC in TV ratings","text":"Donald Trump’s worst nightmare has come true: He lost—in TV ratings. The Democratic National Convention, which ended on Thursday, smashed the Republican National Convention in viewership, according to data released by Nielsen. The DNC averaged 21.8 million viewers across its four nights, compared with the RNC’s average of roughly 19.1 million per night. That’s an average of 2.7 million more viewers per night for the DNC. Trump’s speech scored the RNC its best ratings all week, with an average of about 25.4 million viewers tuning in that night. “We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win,” Trump declared on stage in Milwaukee. Unfortunately for him, he lost, lost, lost. On Thursday, the DNC pulled in nearly a million more viewers, with an average of 26.2 million. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ speech even beat Trump’s in peak viewership, with 28.9 million watching her and 28.4 million watching him. And digging into the data further only highlights the RNC’s weaker engagement. Night by night, the DNC steadily outperformed the RNC: The RNC’s second night scored the fewest eyeballs, with a paltry average of just over 14.8 million viewers. That night’s closing speech came from Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump, who—total coincidence—happens to be Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. Other speakers that night were 2024 presidential also-rans Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley. Compare that to the DNC’s lowest-performing night, the first evening, which saw an average of 20 million viewers—better than any night of the RNC, except the night when Trump spoke. And it makes sense. The night saw speeches from President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, among others. However, to put things in perspective, it’s unlikely that convention viewership translates to election turnout. In the past 16 presidential cycles, the party with the higher convention viewership won the subsequent election eight times and lost eight times, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. At the same time, this isn’t a normal election and Donald Trump isn’t a normal candidate. In the days leading up to the DNC, Rolling Stone reported that the former host of “The Apprentice” was worried about how the RNC’s ratings would compare. Reportedly, he also thought it was unlikely Harris’ speech would be able to top him in the ratings game. It’s possible that Trump’s loss here will make the media-obsessed candidate spiral even further.","summary":"Donald Trump’s worst nightmare has come true: He lost—in TV ratings.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, which ended on Thursday, smashed the Republican National Convention in viewership, according to data released by Nielsen.

Kennedy Jr.'s decision to drop out of the race and endorse Trump is \"good news\" for Republicans.But there was one line of that caught the attention of political observers. After calculating how Kennedy's vote will break for Trump, Fabrizio—a veteran GOP pollster and longtime Trump ally—acknowledged that Trump lost Arizona and Georgia to President Joe Biden four years ago. Trump has still not conceded the 2020 election.\"To put these numbers into perspective, the net vote gained in a states like Arizona based on just a 2020 turnout model would be over 41,000 votes nearly 4 times Biden's winning margin or in Georgia the net gain. would be over 19,000 votes nearly twice Biden's margin,\" the memo reads.Biden flipped both Arizona and Georgia blue in the last presidential election. In the past 72 years, only two Democratic presidential nominees—Bill Clinton and Harry Truman—have won Arizona in the general election. Biden's win in Georgia was another major victory for the Democratic Party, who had not won the Southern state in nearly 30 years.The memo was obtained by NBC News' Sahil Kapur. Newsweek reached out to the Trump campaign via email for comment.Fabrizio's note comes hours after Kennedy suspended his presidential campaign and threw his support behind Trump.At a press conference from Arizona, the independent candidate said the \"principled causes\" that pushed him to leave the Democratic Party, and now back Trump were \"Free speech, the war in Ukraine, and the war on our children.\"\"One of the two candidates has adopted these issues as his own to the point where he has asked to enlist me in his administration,\" he said. \"I'm speaking, of course, of Donald Trump.\"It's not only Kennedy's endorsement that Trump benefits from. Polls show that Kennedy had more appeal with Trump voters than Biden or Harris voters, meaning his decision to drop out means those votes could likely go to the GOP.For much of the election cycle, Democrats portrayed Kennedy as a \"spoiler\" who was taking votes from Biden and thus, helping Trump. But after Biden withdrew from he race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, surveys began showing that Kennedy was hurting Trump more than Harris.\"Whe you hear or see the Harris team and/or the Democrats try and spin otherwise, now that the data clearly paints a different picture,\" Fabrizio wrote. \"This is good news for President Trump's campaign — plain and simple.\"","summary":"A new memo from Trump's internal pollster mentioned \"Biden's winning margin\" in two critical swing states.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-campaign-memo-admits-lost-election-2020-1943797","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457264/donald-trump-admits-2020.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-23 22:09:31","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":254798018,"title":"Trump stumps in Sin City for tax-free tips after RFK Jr. endorsement: ‘Democrats treated him very badly’","text":"LAS VEGAS — Donald Trump stopped in swing-state Nevada Friday to stump for his popular proposal “No Tax on Tips,” even as he picked up a potentially huge tip himself: an endorsement from departing independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “We just had a very nice endorsement from RFK,” Trump told a crowd of 200 supporters in a Sin City restaurant’s banquet room. “I want to thank Bobby. That was very nice. He’s a great guy and respected by everybody.” Trump used the nod from the Democratic scion to take a shot at his original opponent, who withdrew from the race after pressure from his own party. “The Democrats treated him very badly, and then they treated Biden just like him,” the ex-prez told reporters after the event. Trump addressed other news of the day, saying there’s “a lot to learn” from the suspension of at least five Secret Service agents, including one from his protection detail, this week following an investigation of the Butler, Pa., assassination attempt that left one rally attendee dead and two wounded. Twenty-year-old shooter Thomas Crooks hit the former president, who narrowly escaped death with a serendipitous turn of the head. Trump views Nevada — where a Redfield and Wilton poll this week shows him leading Vice President Kamala Harris 43% to 42%, though that may change depending on what the 6% backing Kennedy decide — as a crucial element in his quest to return to the White House after losing in 2020. “If we win this state, if we win Nevada, we’re going to win something that’s going to be very, very special,” he told the crowd. Opponents hit Trump hard during this week’s Democratic National Convention, but he defended the 2022 6-3 Supreme Court overturn of Roe v. Wade, which returned abortion regulation to the states: “Nobody wanted it — nobody wanted it — in the federal government.” As a female reporter asked Trump about “taking away abortion rights,” the crowd erupted with shouts of “Bulls-it” and “Baby killer” directed at the journalist. As typical at his rallies, the former prez addressed a litany of issues. Of Harris’ corporate-tax-hike plan, he said, “If they charge too much on taxes, these companies will leave the United States and take the jobs with them.” He pushed the release of federal land for development: “We’re gonna have housing built, and it will be great for Nevada.” But “No Tax on Tips” remained the focus. Trump chided Harris for appropriating proposal he first made June 9 at a massive outdoor rally here. “They copied us two months later. She’s the greatest flip-flopper in history. She went from communism to capitalism in two weeks,” he said. He said Harris sponsored legislation to eliminate the tip credit and impose a service charge instead, forcing workers to earn a minimum wage. Not everyone in the service industry here is confident about the Trump pledge. Two hours before the event, local Democrats trotted out union officials, workers and a local barbershop owner to throw cold water on the plan, despite the Culinary Union’s quick endorsement of Trump’s proposal months before Harris followed his lead. But Nicole Williams, a Local 226 member who tends bar at the Wynn resort on the Las Vegas Strip, sharply disagrees with union leadership, telling The Post Trump’s plan would help her and her husband raise their family of seven children. “I had to return to work a lot sooner than planned after my nine-month-old baby was born eight weeks prematurely last November because of the economy,” Williams said at the Trump event. “The increased cost means that our family has had to cut back on extras, like my girls taking gymnastics, my six-year-old doing flag football.” Williams said keeping “the money in my own family’s pockets, rather than the federal government, would make a huge difference in my life and the lives of those in my community.”","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Donald Trump stopped in swing-state Nevada Friday to stump for his popular proposal “No Tax on Tips,” even as he picked up a potentially huge tip himself: an endorsement from departing independent presidential candidate Robert F.
