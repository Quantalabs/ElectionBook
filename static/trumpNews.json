DPS confirmed a report from The Texan that the arrested man held far-left political views and was heading to the Capitol with the intent to harm individuals with opposing beliefs.\n\nEarlier Saturday, DPS had warned state lawmakers and legislative staffers of \"credible threats\" to legislators planning to attend the Austin \"No Kings\" protest.\n\nThat DPS alert was sent out just before 1 p.m., according to screenshots of emails obtained by The Texas Tribune, and a DPS spokesperson told the Tribune the Capitol was evacuated shortly after. The warning came hours before several Texas federal, state, and city elected officials spoke at a protest against President Donald Trump in downtown Austin.\n\nIn a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott and DPS Director Freeman Martin around the start of the protest, Texas House Democratic Leader Gene Wu and 43 other members of the Democratic caucus requested updates on what steps DPS is taking to protect lawmakers and other elected officials. The caucus also said the shooting against the Minnesota lawmakers was \"the direct result of years of inflammatory rhetoric, threats, and dehumanization that have turned political disagreements into insurgent violence.\"\n\n\"The rhetoric that has poisoned our national political discourse - calling political opponents 'enemies of the people,' describing immigrants as 'invaders,' and urging followers to 'Fight, fight, fight,' - has now also claimed the lives of dedicated public servants,\" they continued. \"For years, and just like the shooting in El Paso, violent rhetoric has stoked the flames of division and resulted in tragedy.\"\n\nBefore DPS confirmed the arrest, Jeffrey Clemmons, communications director for state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, told the Tribune that DPS arrested someone \"who was going to agitate the protest.\"\n\nEckhardt was among the officials scheduled to speak at the Capitol protest. Other elected officials who spoke at the event include Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett and Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III.\n\nAustin City Council Member Zo Qadri, who was also at the Capitol protest, expressed gratitude to law enforcement over the arrest.\n\n\"Everyone - lawmakers and attendees alike - deserves to gather and protest without fear,\" Qadri said in a written statement to the Tribune. \"It's important to condemn the winds of hate that give rise to political violence that has been threatened in Austin today, and tragically witnessed in Minnesota this morning.\"\n\nIn a social media post before the arrest was announced, Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who leads the Texas Senate, condemned the Minnesota attacks and urged people to take appropriate precautions. Death threats are a part of serving in public life today, he continued.\n\n\"There's a difference between free speech complaints, which we welcome, and making death threats. The latter can be a crime,\" Patrick wrote. \"What happened today in Minnesota was an absolute criminal act and a tragic loss of life.\"\n\nProtests, marches, and rallies condemning the Trump administration are taking place across Texas and the country on Saturday. The events are in response to a range of his policies, including his immigration enforcement tactics and what many critics consider his authoritarian actions. The demonstrations coincide with the Trump administration's planned military parade in Washington, D.C., which falls on the president's birthday and the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary.\n\nTexas organizers of some of the \"No Kings\" and \"Kick Out The Clowns\" demonstrations stressed the protests would be nonviolent. That rhetoric continued through the protest, with Doggett claiming during his speech that anyone who committed vandalism or violence would be helping Trump.\n\n\"Whatever their motivations, they're the ones Trump is counting on. They're the best allies that he's got,\" Doggett said during his speech at the Capitol steps on Friday.\n\nAfter the \"No Kings\" scheduled protest ended at 8 p.m., gatherers poured out of the Capitol grounds and into the streets of downtown Austin, oftentimes redirected by police blockades. While a few odd protesters knocked over construction signs, the protest ended largely without incident.\n\nEarlier Saturday morning, a man dressed as a police officer in Minnesota shot two state legislators and their respective spouses at their homes, according to the Associated Press. Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, were killed in one of the shootings, according to Governor Tim Walz's office. Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times in their home.\n\nIn a separate email also sent to state lawmakers and Capitol staff, Texas House Administration Chair Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, said officials are taking \"all necessary precautions.\"\n\n\"I am in communication with our federal partners, and currently, it seems to be an isolated incident,\" Geren said in the statement. \"However, we're always concerned about copycats and those who this attack might inspire.\"\n\nEven with the threats looming, the protest in Austin was largely jovial. Ice cream carts and trucks lined the edges of Capitol grounds as families set up towels on the grass or huddled at the Capitol steps around speakers. But through a dove release, coordinated dances, and organizers adorned in clown costumes, speakers' messages were still stern and pointed at Trump.\n\n\"We gather day beneath the sun, under no crown, before no throne, because this is a republic, not a kingdom,\" Bucy said during his speech to protesters. \"We stand here today because that idea is under siege because one man, one disgrace, twice impeached, four-time indicted man has clawed his way back to power.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans - and engages with them - about public policy, politics, government, and statewide issues.","summary":"Texas DPS makes arrest after warning state lawmakers of \"credible threats\" tied to Capitol protest","url":"https://abc13.com/post/texas-dps-makes-arrest-warning-state-lawmakers-credible-threats-tied-capitol-protest/16760223/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16760349_061525-ktrk-texas-dps-threat-arrest-sw-img.PNG?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 00:32:15","author":"KTRK,The Texas Tribune","authors":["KTRK","The Texas Tribune"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":331750788,"title":"World News | Trump Vetoed Israeli Plan to Kill Iran's Supreme Leader, US Official Tells AP","text":"Washington, Jun 16 (AP) President Donald Trump rejected a plan presented by Israel to the US to kill Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to a US official familiar with the matter. The Israelis informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei. Also Read | Donald Trump Vetoed Israeli Plan to Kill Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, US Official Tells AP. After being briefed on the plan, the White House made clear to Israeli officials that Trump was opposed to the Israelis making the move, according to the official, who was not authorised to comment on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration is desperate to keep Israel's military operation aimed at decapitating Iran's nuclear programme from exploding into an even more expansive conflict and saw the plan to kill Khamenei as a move that would enflame the conflict and potentially destabilise the region. Also Read | Israel-Iran Conflict: Israeli Strikes Killed at Least 406 People, Wounded 654, Rights Group Says. Asked about the plan during an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Special Report with Bret Baier\", Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not directly address whether the White House rejected the plan. \"But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do, we will do what we need to do,\" Netanyahu said. \"And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.\" Netanyahu's spokesperson, Omer Dostri, later called reports about the Israeli plan to kill Khamenei \"fake\". Netanyahu in the Fox interview also said regime change \"could certainly be the result\" of the conflict \"because the Iranian regime is very weak\". Trump's rejection of the proposal was first reported by Reuters. Meanwhile, Trump on Sunday issued a stark warning to Iran not to retaliate against US targets in the Middle East. Trump in an early morning social media posting said the United States \"had nothing to do with the attack on Iran\" as Israel and Iran traded missile attacks for the third straight day. Iran, however, has said it would hold the US -- which has provided Israel with much of its deep arsenal of weaponry -- responsible for its backing of Israel. \"If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,\" Trump said. Hours later Trump took to social media again to predict \"Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal\" and that it could come \"soon\". But as he departed the White House on Sunday evening for the Group of Seven leaders summit in the Canadian Rockies, Trump was more tempered in comments to reporters about when the Israeli strikes and Iranian retaliation would wind down. \"I hope there is going to be a deal, and we will see what happens, but sometimes they have to fight it out,\" Trump said. The conflict is expected to loom large during his talks with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the European Union. The US president said he has a track record for de-escalating conflicts, and that he would get Israel and Iran to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan to\" after the two countries' recent cross-border confrontation. Trump also pointed to efforts by his administration during his first term to mediate disputes between Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia. \"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" Trump posted. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\" There is a divide in Trump world about how far the president should go in backing Israel. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson are among the prominent backers of Trump who have argued that voters supported Trump because he would not involve the nation in foreign conflicts. GOP Kentucky Senator Rand Paul praised Trump for having shown restraint and said he hoped the president's \"instincts will prevail\". \"So, I think it is going to be very hard to come out of this and have a negotiated settlement,\" Paul told NBC's \"Meet the Press\". \"I see more war and more carnage. And it is not the US's job to be involved in this war.\" In an interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation\", GOP South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said he preferred diplomatic efforts, but if diplomacy does not work, Trump should \"go all in\" on destroying Iran's nuclear programme. \"If that means providing bombs, provide bombs,\" he said. \"If that means flying with Israel, fly with Israel.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

This statement followed President Donald Trump’s appeal for both parties to begin negotiations.\n\nTal, who is part of the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committees, shared his views with Fox News Digital on Sunday from near Jerusalem, amidst ongoing exchanges between Israel and Iran for the third consecutive day.\n\n“We are currently engaged in a conflict with Iran, one that I believe holds historical significance. I hope that through this, we will not only free ourselves and the Iranian people but also rid the world of the threat posed by Iran’s oppressive regime,” he stated.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Trump said on TRUTH Social that “Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal,” noting how his administration has successfully negotiated other conflict resolutions, including between India and Pakistan, “by using TRADE with the United States to bring reason, cohesion, and sanity into the talks with two excellent leaders who were able to quickly make a decision and STOP!” \n\nTal said Iran has suffered “an unbelievable amount of damage” and the IDF “basically has total control over the Iranian airspace.” Israeli forces, he argued, are targeting military bases, nuclear facilities and officials, while Iran is targeting civilian populations. Some Iranian missiles have made it past Israel’s aerial defense systems. \n\n“That’s a culture that glorifies death, doesn’t care about civilian casualties, and we’re a culture that sanctifies life,” he said. \n\nTal said he has received support from U.S. officials, including members of Congress. \n\nHe believes that Israel’s actions are in line with Trump’s “America First” policy, in that the ongoing operation will prevent the United States from being pulled into a broader conflict. \n\n“We’re getting the support from the Trump administration 100 percent,” Tal said. “Trump is supporting America First Policy. We are also supporting America First Policy because fighting this evil regime will help to prevent much, much bigger war.”\n\n“If the Iranians would have managed to get their desire and acquire a weapon, that would not have just been a threat to America,” he continued. “We’re not asking [for] American boots on the ground, we’re not asking America to fight for us. We’re just asking them to support us in taking away the threat coming from Iran.” \n\nFox News’ Peter Doocy contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

His previous appearance at this event was in 2021, when Spaun missed the cut at Torrey Pines.\n\n“I don’t think I did keep my composure”, said Spaun when asked how he endured his awful start.\n\n“I was trying to dig deep, but honestly the weather delay we had changed the whole vibe for the day. I bounced back and fought really hard on the back nine.”\n\nSpaun started the day one shot behind overnight leader Sam Burns but started miserably, bogeying five of his first six holes, with his only par coming on the par-five fifth. Spaun would have been forgiven for feeling luck had deserted him too, as a stunning approach shot into the second green clattered against the pin and rolled all the way off the green.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early wobble left him as far as four shots off the lead, until he benefitted from a lengthy rain delay in the middle of his round.\n\nA steadied Spaun re-emerged to a sodden course, and a string of pars allowed him climb a wildly volatile leaderboard, with players continually dropping shots and falling back to the field. Spaun then found birdie on 12 and again on 14 to take the solo lead at even-par, only to quickly bogey 15.\n\nAhead of him, Robert MacIntyre hung toughest of them all. The Scot opened with two bogeys on his first three holes, but extinguished them with a monster, 51-foot eagle putt on four. MacIntyre made the turn at even-par for his round and then found a big finish, birdieing 14 and 17 before a nerveless par putt on 18 gave him the clubhouse lead at one-over par for the tournament.\n\nSpaun, however, responded with the shot of his lifetime, driving the par-four, 17th green to set himself up for an eagle. That putt drifted three feet by, but Spaun holed the birdie putt to take a one-shot lead to the 72nd hole. Needing two putts from 64 feet to win the US Open, Spaun poured it in with one to bring the crowd around the 18th green to raptures. He signed for a closing round of 72 between tears.\n\nSam Burns and Adam Scott, both playing in the final group, got caught in the carnage of a brutal course brought to the edge of playability by the deluge of rain. Burns’ challenge ended in controversy, as he was denied a drop on the 15th fairway, despite the fact his ball appeared to be lying in standing water. He made double-bogey and then finished with an eight-over 78, to tie Jon Rahm and Scottie Scheffler in seventh place.\n\nLIV duo Tyrell Hatton and Carlos Ortiz both got themselves in the mix, though Hatton’s challenge foundered with a bogey on the scoreable 17th hole. He finished in a tie for fourth place with Ortiz and Cameron Young. Viktor Hovland struggled to a third-placed finish, ending three shots behind Spaun after a fitful 73. Scott, meanwhile, struggled to a nine-over round of 79, ending up in a tie for 12th place.\n\nEarlier in the day, Rory McIlroy ended a difficult week on a high with an impressive closing round of 67, finishing in a tie for 19th place.\n\n“Hopefully I can continue that on into next week”, said McIlroy at the end of the tournament. “Physically I feel like my game’s there. It’s just mentally getting myself in the right frame of mind to get the best out of myself.”\n\nWritten by Gavin Cooney and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won’t find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women’s sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) heightens the tension for upcoming disputes between Democrats and the administration, as demonstrations have been met with rapid police intervention.\n\nDemocrats have pledged to persistently challenge the administration on its immigration policies, but the Padilla incident and President Trump’s decisive actions against Democratic protesters raise concerns about how these altercations will evolve.\n\nThe striking footage captures Padilla being taken to the ground and handcuffed after interrupting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem’s press briefing, during which the senator identified himself and stated his intent to pose a question.\n\nTrump administration officials said Secret Service agents responded as trained — removing an unknown figure as he pushed his way toward the front of a press conference.\n\nDemocrats see it as the manhandling of a colleague and an escalation after the administration brought charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) over her involvement in a scuffle that erupted when she and colleagues were attempting to visit a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility.\n\n“This is another incident of Trump and his administration abusing their power and stopping members and elected officials from doing their jobs. I mean, this is just going to keep escalating,” McIver said in response to a question from The Hill.\n\n“This is why we must continue to do oversight. We must continue to do our jobs, and be vocal about what this administration is doing. And it’s a threat to our democracy. It’s very sad. It’s a sad day in America to see everything that is happening, from the situation with me to now with the United States senator being basically tackled to the ground.”\n\nRep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) raised a more chilling prospect.\n\n“It is a further dissension into anarchy and authoritarianism, and it is time that Republicans in the House and the Senate not only stand up for our institution, but stand up for democracy and call on Donald Trump to stop this lawlessness, or someone is going to get killed,” he told The Hill.\n\nThe condemnation from Democrats of Padilla’s treatment was immediate, with California Democrats walking down the Capitol steps in unison for a press conference that swelled as more of their colleagues from other states arrived.\n\nRep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said Padilla was “assaulted.” Numerous lawmakers said he was “manhandled.” And Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) raised concerns that Democrats could face violent consequences even as he stressed the need to push back on what he dubbed an effort by Trump “to show that he is not controlled by our Constitution.”\n\n“We’re heading down a dark, dark path, something that in my imagination I never thought we would reach. But this is where we are, and if, if they can do that to a member of Congress from New Jersey, a senior senator who was shouting at the top of his lungs, ‘I am Sen. Alex Padilla,’” Gomez said.\n\n“If it can happen to Alex, it can happen to any of those senators on the other side, or any member of Congress, or anybody. So I want to just stress that we’re not going to give up. We’re not going to be intimidated. We’re not going to be cowards. We’re going to keep fighting for our communities. … When is it going to be enough? When somebody gets shot in the streets of Los Angeles? When a member gets shot?” he said before trailing off as he became overcome with emotion.\n\nBut many also urged caution and stressed the need to respond peacefully.\n\n“They are trying to stage as many violent and political provocations as possible. And so we’re in a dangerous situation right now. So I urge everybody on our side to act with maximum restraint and in the best traditions of nonviolence,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told The Hill before referencing Trump’s Saturday parade.\n\n“Because Donald Trump has a $100 million military extravaganza parade coming to Washington. They told people not to come to work on Friday. And he’s threatening to send troops to other cities. So I regard the situation with immense gravity.”\n\nThe potential for charges against Democrats engaging with law enforcement is no small matter.\n\nMcIver, who was indicted by a grand jury this week after the administration accused her of using her forearms to attack law enforcement, could face up to 17 years if convicted. Democrats have called the prosecution a politically motivated case that twists her efforts to brace herself in the scuffle.\n\nAnd while Padilla is the only lawmaker who has been handcuffed, a staffer for Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) was also handcuffed after DHS officers pushed their way into the office without a warrant while looking for those protesting arrests at immigration courthouses.\n\nAt the same time, there are risks to law enforcement, though it’s highly unlikely the Trump administration would pursue any charges.\n\n“These thugs who manhandled the senator probably don’t know it’s a federal offense to attack a member of Congress, but that’s not what it’s about,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on the Capitol steps.\n\n“It shouldn’t be anybody in our country [who is] treated this way. So we speak out for Sen. Padilla. We’re speaking out for everyone who has a right to speak.”\n\nShortly after Padilla was removed, Noem addressed the matter, saying the lawmaker behaved inappropriately but said she would meet with him, which she did not long after the press conference ended.\n\n“I think everyone would agree that wasn’t appropriate,” she said.\n\n“When I leave here I’ll find him and visit and find out really what his concerns were. I think everybody in America would agree that that wasn’t appropriate, that if you wanted to have a civil discussion, especially as a leader, a public official, that you would reach out and try to have a conversation,” she said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security later incorrectly said Padilla failed to identify himself and said he was not wearing his Senate pin, though he was wearing a shirt with the Senate logo on it.\n\nFew Republicans have answered Democrats’ calls to rebuke the response to Padilla.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called the incident “horrible.”\n\n“It’s horrible. It is shocking at every level. It’s not the America I know,” she said.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said, “It looks like he’s being manhandled and physically removed, and it’s hard to imagine a justification for that.”\n\nBut Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) leveled criticism at Padilla for missing scheduled votes that day. \n\n“I think he should have been here in Washington voting,” Barrasso told reporters. \n\n“He has a responsibility to his constituents to show up at work,” he continued. “Not to go try to make a spectacle of himself.”\n\nFor his part, Padilla was also surprised by his treatment, saying in an interview with “Pod Save America” that it took “maybe half a second for multiple agents to be on me.”\n\nHe said he snapped when he heard Noem describe herself being in Los Angeles to “liberate” the city from its governor and mayor, motivating him to interject.\n\nHe encouraged people to “continue to speak up.”\n\n“We have First Amendment rights in this country. Speak up, protest peacefully. But continue to speak up because Donald Trump would want nothing more than for all of us to just cower away and say nothing, and let him continue to abuse his power,” he said.\n\n“We cannot let this be the norm.”\n\nBut in the aftermath of the incident, he said he’s left wondering what happens when there aren’t cameras rolling, and when people who do not have powerful positions like the one he holds encounter DHS and ICE agents conducting the raids.\n\n“If a senator asking a question scares them so much that they’ll deploy agents to put a United States senator in handcuffs, imagine what they’re doing to people out there, maybe subject to an immigration raid, who have a question … maybe requesting their lawyer but not getting that opportunity,” he said.\n\n“These are dangerous times for the United States of America.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe arrest of Sen.

President Trump continues to keep the opportunity to engage diplomatically open if the Iranians have the sense to take it.” \n\nUnlike India and Pakistan, for now, neither Israel nor Iran is backing down from the conflict that began last week when Israel launched a preemptive strike on Iran’s nuclear program. \n\nIsrael continued to hit targets in Iran over the weekend, including strikes on Iran’s Defense Ministry headquarters in Tehran. Iranian state media confirmed on Sunday that Israeli strikes killed Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ intelligence chief, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Kazemi and his deputy Hassan Mohaqiq. \n\nIranian state media said an Israeli drone struck Iran’s South Pars gas field, causing a fire and halting gas production. \n\nIsrael targeting Iran’s ballistic missile launch sites on Sunday, and the Israel Defense Forces said it “completed a wide-scale wave of strikes on numerous weapon production sites” in Tehran. \n\nThe IDF has repeatedly stated it is targeting Iran’s military and nuclear infrastructure, and accuses Iran of targeting civilians. \n\nWhile Israel’s Iron dome has intercepted most of the missiles Iran has fired, some have made landfall across Israel. \n\nOn Sunday, a missile struck the northern Israeli city of Haifa, the southern Israeli community of Zavdiel, and an apartment building in Bat Yam, just outside Tel Aviv. That strike left about 100 injured and at least 9 dead, according multiple reports. \n\nThe Iranian Ministry of Health says more than 220 people have been killed in Iran since the strikes began on Friday. In Israel, officials say more than a dozen people have been killed, including two children. \n\nOn Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video in which he spoke to the American people and explained why Israel launched the preemptive attack on Iran’s nuclear program. \n\n“Our enemy is your enemy,” Netanyahu said. “And by doing what we’re doing, we’re dealing with something that will threaten all of us sooner or later. Our victory will be your victory.” \n\nIsraeli officials reportedly asked the U.S. to get involved in the fight against Iran and aid in the effort to eliminate Iran’s nuclear program, but the U.S. has not indicated plans to do so, and Trump has said multiple times that the U.S. has not been involved in Israel’s targeted strikes on Iran. \n\nIsrael’s strikes are reported to have damaged multiple Iranian nuclear sites, but Iran’s Fordow uranium enrichment site is one of Iran’s major nuclear sites and is located underground in northern Iran. Eliminating the site, or even causing significant damage to it, would likely require assistance from the U.S. \n\nTrump also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend and Trump said Putin “feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end.”","summary":"President Donald Trump said Sunday Iran and Israel should come to the negotiating table even as the two nations continued to carry out missile strikes against...

Regardless - Israel or not Israel - Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb,' the president added.\n\nIn a sensational development Sunday, two US officials revealed that the president vetoed an Israeli plan this week to kill Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe plot signals the intent and velocity with which Israel is moving to dismantle Iran's leadership amid fears it is deliberately fomenting regime change.\n\nThe president is now facing calls from Iran hawks in the GOP to join Israel's bombing campaign.\n\nAny military action in the region threatens to put Trump at odds with major allies in the MAGA movement, not least Carlson, who has accused the commander-in-chief of being 'complicit' in Israel's strikes.\n\nTrump heavily campaigned last year as the man who would keep America out of foreign wars, while at the same time projecting 'peace through strenght.' \n\nEarlier this week, Carlson cautioned the Trump administration publicly on social media after he learned that Levin had visited the White House.\n\n'Mark Levin was at the White House today, lobbying for war with Iran,' Carlson wrote in a social media post. \n\n'To be clear, Levin has no plans to fight in this or any other war. He’s demanding that American troops do it.'\n\nCarlson wrote that Levin's 'hyperventilating' about Iran's nuclear plans was a distraction from the dangers of sending American troops back into the Middle East.\n\n'A war with Iran would amount to a profound betrayal of his supporters. It would end his presidency. That may explain why so many of Trump’s enemies are advocating for it,' he wrote.\n\nLevin responded to the Politico report on his radio show Tuesday evening telling his listeners that he met with President Trump last week after he was invited to the White House.\n\n'He and I are very close friends,' Levin said, adding that 'the president knows exactly where I stand on Iran and he told me he knows exactly where I stand on Iran because he watches my shows on Fox.'\n\nHe described the Politico report as sourced by 'a group of people who were pushing propaganda.'\n\n'What I am not doing and what I would not do to Donald Trump is lead a lobbying campaign of hawks,' he said.\n\nIt comes as Trump this morning refused to rule out involvement in the conflict, while at the same time denying any American participation to this point. \n\nSpeaking with ABC News Sunday morning, Trump addressed reports that Israel was encouraging Administration to join the conflict with Iran to eliminate its nuclear program.\n\n\"We're not involved in it. It's possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,\" the president said.\n\n'The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight,' the president wrote on Truth Social in the early hours of Sunday morning.\n\nTrump vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran's Khamenei, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n\"Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we're not even talking about going after the political leadership,\" said one of the sources, a senior U.S. administration official.\n\nIsrael launched \"Operation Rising Lion\" with a surprise attack on Friday morning that wiped out the top echelon of Iran's military command and damaged its nuclear sites, and says the campaign will continue to escalate in coming days. Iran has vowed to \"open the gates of hell\" in retaliation.\n\nIsrael and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other overnight into Sunday, killing scores and raising fears of a wider conflict.\n\nIsraeli rescue teams combed through rubble of residential buildings destroyed by Iranian missiles, using sniffer dogs and heavy excavators to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, raising the two-day toll to 13.\n\nSirens rang out across Israel after 4 p.m. on Sunday in the first such daylight alert, and fresh explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv.\n\nIn Iran, images from the capital showed the night sky lit up by a huge blaze at a fuel depot after Israel began strikes against Iran's oil and gas sector - raising the stakes for the global economy and the functioning of the Iranian state.\n\nIran has not given a full death toll but said 78 people were killed on Friday and scores more have died since, including in a single attack that killed 60 on Saturday, half of them children, in a 14-storey apartment block flattened in Tehran.","summary":"In a newsletter sent out Friday, Carlson called Trump 'complicit in an act of war.'

Trump's trade ambitions at the G7 come against the backdrop of his administration's struggling \"90 deals in 90 days\" promise.Announced in April alongside sweeping tariffs, the initiative has yielded only two agreements so far—with the UK and China—far short of the ambitious 90-deal target before the July 9 deadline.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that the administration would likely extend the 90-day pause on tariff implementation to allow more time for negotiations with trading partners acting \"in good faith.\"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has made the unprecedented decision to abandon the annual practice of issuing a joint communique at the summit's conclusion, reflecting the challenging diplomatic climate. The summit risks becoming a series of bilateral conversations rather than a unified display of international cooperation.Trump's inflammatory threats to make Canada the \"51st state\" and take over Greenland loom over the proceedings. French President Emmanuel Macron made a symbolic stop in Greenland on Sunday, declaring that the territory is \"not to be sold\" nor \"to be taken.\"Other invited leaders from India, Ukraine, Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, and the UAE will be focused on avoiding potential U.S. tariffs.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump on Middle East tensions: \"Sometimes they have to fight it out, but we're going to see what happens. I think there's a good chance there will be a deal.\"French President Emmanuel Macron on Greenland: \"Everybody in France, the European Union thinks that Greenland is not to be sold, not to be taken. The situation in Greenland is clearly a wakeup call for all Europeans.\"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Canada's sovereignty: \"Canada is an independent, sovereign country and a much-valued member of the Commonwealth.\"Former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien on Trump's approach: \"He tends to be a bully. If Trump has decided to make a show to be in the news, he will do something crazy. Let him do it and keep talking normally.\"What Happens NextThe summit officially begins Monday with Trump's bilateral meeting with Carney, followed by multilateral discussions throughout the week.World leaders will navigate complex negotiations on trade agreements while addressing the Israel-Iran crisis and surging oil prices.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Trump heads to G7 summit promising new trade deals while his \"90 deals in 90 days\" pledge falls behind schedule with growing global tensions.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-new-trade-deals-critical-g7-summit-2085809","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2663551/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 00:09:09","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.198},{"id":331749128,"title":"Terrifying new 'hit list' with a dozen more targets found at suspected Minnesota shooter's home","text":"BREAKING NEWSTerrifying new 'hit list' with a dozen more targets found at suspected Minnesota shooter's home\n\nBy MELISSA KOENIG and BEN ASHFORD FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:34 BST, 16 June 2025 | Updated: 01:08 BST, 16 June 2025\n\nA second hit list written by alleged fugitive assassin Vance Boelter has been discovered at his home as the manhunt for the double homicide suspect continues.\n\nBoelter, 57, is wanted for allegedly shooting dead Democratic State Representative Melissa Hortman and wounding his Democratic State Senator John Hoffman on Saturday. \n\nHe is facing both state and federal charges, with authorities announcing on Sunday that there is both a 'nationwide warrant' for Boelter's arrest for the murders and attempted murder at the state level as well as a federal warrant for 'unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.'\n\nHortman and her husband Mark were killed at their home in Champlin, in northern Minneapolis, while Hoffman and his wife Yvette were wounded at their house in nearby Brooklyn Park.\n\nIt is believed Boelter, a Trump supporter, was motivated to kill the two Democrats due to their support for abortion rights after police uncovered a hit list of about 70 people from his car Saturday morning.\n\nMost of the names on that list were Democrats or people with ties to Planned Parenthood or the abortion rights movement, CNN reports.\n\nA second hit list with more than a dozen new names was also found during a search of one of Boelter's homes on Saturday as police continued their manhunt for the suspect. \n\nAuthorities located Boelter's car, a Buick that appeared to be dumped in Faxon Township, on Sunday and found a cowboy hot lying on the ground that was identical to one Boelter was wearing in CCTV images released by the FBI.\n\nBy around 4pm, a four-door dark blue Buick Regal sedan was seen being removed from the search area on a flatbed truck.\n\nMinnesota police have found fugitive assassin Vance Boelter, 57, dead in an isolated farming community\n\nMinnesota State Patrol, SWAT teams, and a US Marshals Fugitive Task Force arrived in a dozen or more vehicles including heavily armored trucks about 11am on Sunday\n\nThe military-style convey traveled in armored vehicles with rooftop snipers, but as of 7pm, the fugitive was still at-large\n\nHere's what you need to know about the political assassinations in Minnesota:\n\nBoelter is wanted for the killings of Democratic State Rep Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in Champlin. The suspect also shot and wounded Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette in nearby Brooklyn Park.\n\nCops first responded to a call about the shooting at Hoffman's home about 2am on Saturday. They then went to check Hortman's home where they spotted the suspect.\n\nThe suspect, dressed in police gear, exchanged gunfire with cops before retreating inside the house and then fleeing out the back on foot.\n\nBoelter's wife Jenny was pulled over by police with suspicious items in her car about 10am on Saturday, but was let go\n\nThe FBI believes the attacks were politically motivated and is offering a $50,000 reward to find Boelter.\n\nCops found several rifles in Boelter's vehicle and believe he may still be armed with a pistol.\n\nInside the car they found handmade 'No Kings' flyers, an anti-Trump protests that took place across the US on Saturday that he may have planned to attack.\n\nBoelter was a Trump supporter and opposed abortion, according to his roommate.\n\nInside his car cops found a hit list of prominent abortion rights campaigners, many of them Democratic lawmakers.\n\nDonald Trump called the shootings 'terrible' after being briefed on the matter. 'Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,' he said. \n\nBoelter is accused of fatally shooting Democratic State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark (pictured)\n\nHe also allegedly wounded his Democratic State Senator John Hoffman\n\nThe development came after state troopers equipped with rifles and full body armor went house to house searching yards, outbuildings and garages.\n\nThe military-style convey traveled in armored vehicles with rooftop snipers, but as of 7pm, the fugitive was still at-large.\n\nMinnesota State Patrol, SWAT teams, and a US Marshals Fugitive Task Force arrived in a dozen or more vehicles including heavily armored trucks about 11am on Sunday. \n\nThe convoy included officers from the Bloomington Bomb Squad, one of four specialist units on call across the state to detect and defuse explosives. \n\nHundreds more police set up a command post in Green Isle, near Boelter and his wife Jenny's home, to coordinate the manhunt.\n\nThe search area includes around 120 acres of fields and woodland belonging to Brian Liebhard, 65.\n\nHe said he was having trouble sleeping and was on his porch alone at 2.30am when he heard gunshots - about eight hours before the police arrived.\n\nHis nephew later told him he'd found a dark Buick abandoned in a secluded side road along with a cowboy hat.\n\n'I heard two shots. I have no idea if it’s related to this,' he previously told DailyMail.com.\n\nBoelter was seen in CCTV footage wearing a cowboy hat identical to one found on Sunday\n\nAuthorities went house to house in rural Belle Plaine, Minnesota on Sunday as the search for Boelter continued\n\nThe property law enforcement was searching on Sunday includes several abandoned, crumbling homes and barns\n\nCamouflaged law enforcement agents carefully swept the area \n\nLiebhard said he went to church on Sunday morning and came back and found access to his property blocked by a police cordon.\n\nHe gave officers permission to begin an extensive search of his land, which includes several abandoned, crumbling homes and barns.\n\nThe area is waterlogged and difficult to traverse without sinking deep into the mud, Liebhard added.\n\n'My daughter brought up where this guy lived and said \"Dad he’s only four miles from us,\"' he said.\n\n'I've never seen him myself. As far as I know they are still searching for him there.'\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, locals gathered at the cordon to exchange theories and gossip about the manhunt.\n\n'So the hat is just sat there on the side of the road?' said one. 'It’s too convenient. It's obviously a decoy. You fellas can't see the wood for the trees.'\n\nAuthorities have also questioned Boelter's wife, Jenny, who was stopped at a convenience store while driving a car with three other relatives inside near Onamia about 10am on Saturday\n\nBy around 4pm Sunday, a four-door dark blue Buick Regal sedan was removed from the search area on a flatbed truck\n\nAuthorities have also questioned Boelter's wife, Jenny, who was stopped at a convenience store while driving a car with three other relatives inside near Onamia about 10am on Saturday.\n\nShe was found with a weapon, ammunition, cash, and passports about 75 miles from where the shootings took place in northern Minneapolis eight hours earlier. \n\nMore than a dozen officers swarmed Jenny's car during the traffic stop and they were at the scene for two to three hours.\n\nJenny was detained for questioning after officers found the items inside the vehicle, but no one was arrested as she was released.\n\nAuthorities have since said she and other family members were cooperative with the investigation. \n\nBut it remains unclear whether Boelter's vehicle was stopped randomly or being tracked by police, as the FBI offers a $50,000 reward for any information leading to his capture.\n\nPolice said on Sunday they have already received more than 400 tips, and have recovered evidence from his vehicle.\n\n'We continue to conduct interviews on the investigative piece, not only to learn his whereabouts, but also to follow up on the case and gather the information as part of the prosecution related to him,' Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension at Minnesota’s Department of Public Safety added.\n\nHortman and her husband Mark were then fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park about 3am on Saturday\n\nOfficers then encountered the gunman fleeing Hortman's home at 3.35am and exchanged gunfire with him\n\nPolice say Boelter the shot Hoffman and his wife Yvette at their home in Champlin at around 2am on Saturday, but they survived the attack with multiple wounds.\n\nHortman and her husband Mark were then fatally shot at their home eight miles away in Brooklyn Park about 3am. \n\nOfficers then encountered the gunman fleeing Hortman's home at 3.35am and exchanged gunfire with him, which is when they reportedly found the initial hit list.\n\nChilling photos showed the suspect donning an unsettling costume mask covering his entire head. \n\nYet officers somehow let the suspect slip through their fingers as he escaped the scene on foot.\n\nIt remains unclear where he may have fled to, but Evans noted on Sunday 'he certainly had a lot of time to be able to cover a lot of distance once we knew that he had escaped from the crime scene.'\n\nThe detective added that authorities are continuing to operate 'as though he's still alive, and believe he is at this time.' \n\nWhen authorities began their search for the suspect, Boelter's best friend and roommate David Carlson told local news outlet KARE11 he was an avid Trump supporter and voted for the Republican candidate. \n\nHe also described the suspect as a Christian who opposed abortion.\n\nChilling photos showed the suspect donning an unsettling costume mask covering his entire head during the shootings\n\nIn fact, the suspect worked as a pastor and was seen in a newly unearthed video dancing in a church service in Africa. \n\nThe clip, filmed in February 2023, showed him delivering a passionate testimony about how he met Jesus at the age of 17.\n\n'I met the Lord when I was 17 years old and I gave my life to Jesus Christ,' he says in the clip.\n\nHe went on to describe naming his five children - who he shares with Jenny - after Christian virtues, Grace, Faith, Hope, Joy, and David, in what he calls a testament to God's blessings on his life.\n\nThe alleged assassin also has armed security experience in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, and North America through the Praetorian Guard Security Services, his biography on the website detailed. \n\n'He brings a great security aspect forged by both many on the ground experiences combined with training by both private security firms and by people in the US Military,' it read.\n\n'Vance Boelter has focused all this experience to make sure Praetorian Guard Security Services covers the needs you have to keep your family and property safe.'\n\nBoelter had also lived a life of public service before Saturday's tragedies, and he even served on the Governor's Workforce Development Board, which works closely with Gov. Tim Walz to give advice on the state's workforce.\n\nHe served on the board from June 2016 to June 2018 as a private sector representative and from December 2019 to January 2023 as a board member. \n\nHe was appointed under Walz both times.\n\nAdditionally, Boelter was the chief executive of Red Lion Group, which was based in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nRed Lion Group has since deleted its website and LinkedIn pages, but Boelter's LinkedIn said he started at the company in December 2021.\n\nBoelter had previously been appointed by Minnesota Gov.

But the question here is not a legal proposition, the question here is what do we do now? We know Iran is a threat. We know that its nuclear program poses a threat to international peace and obviously to Israel. What do we do about it? And how do we respond in a way that lessens the risk of more civilians particularly in the region being brought in to this conflict.”\n\nAirspaces have been closed in Israel and Iran, as well as neighbours Syria, Jordan, and Iraq.\n\nWong said the Middle East was facing a perilous period and that Australians in both sides are being told to shelter. \n\n“Obviously this is a very perilous situation.

The military parade on Saturday honored the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary, which also coincided with Trump's 79th birthday. However, the parade came as riots and protests continue in Los Angeles and across the country over the Trump administration's policies. \"Correct. You’re really correct about that, Chris, and it’s something we were watching for. I’m just sort of surprised by the number of people who were at the front of the parade watching, cheering, and then would come and ask to take a selfie. This is a very different, this is a very different mood here. People seem to be going out of their way to say that they’re here to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday,\" Velshi said. MILITARY PARADE DRAWS PATRIOTIC AMERICANS FROM NEAR AND FAR: 'NO BETTER TIME TO COME TO DC' Velshi said that politicization was still present at the event, but that it wasn't dark or tense. \"Now, there are people walking around with signs. Moments ago, while you were talking to Jen, a guy just came around and said, ‘Trump 2028!’ and I said, ‘How does that work exactly?’ and he was, like, laughing and had a big flag on him. So there’s some politicization here, but it’s not dark, it’s not tense, it’s not amped up. It’s different. It’s different from covering a Trump rally,\" he continued.

There genuinely is a democratic and civic culture in this country that I think, I think, most Americans still hang on to,\" he said.

They want it to be up to 3.5 per cent. You’re going to be dogged by those demands by the Trump administration for the remaining three-and-a-half years. \n\n“They’re in power, and it’s hard to argue against it, given we are so isolated where we are and we are vulnerable to our neighbours.”\n\nMr Marles replied: “Well, the point to make here is that we have increased our defence spending.\n\n“We’ve engaged in the biggest peacetime increase in defence spending in Australia’s history. That’s the fact of the matter.\n\n“And we will continue to look at what we need as a nation in terms of our national security needs, in terms of our defence needs, and we’ll resource it.”\n\nBut Today show host Karl Stefanovic pressed Mr Marles on “what leg do we have to stand on.”\n\n“I mean, who’s going to come to our rescue? The US,’’ Stefanovic asked.\n\n“So if the US wants us to increase our spending as part of a relationship that’s been ongoing for a long, long time, then why would we say no?”\n\n“Well, that’s a conversation we will respectfully have with the United States,’’ Mr Marles responded.\n\n“We’ve made that clear as well. And we’ve also made clear that where our defence needs resourcing, we will do it. And we have been doing it over the last three years in, in a way which has seen the biggest peacetime increase in defence spending in Australia’s history.\n\n“And that is a fact which is very much understood by the United States.”\n\nFuel prices under the pump\n\nMr Marles was also asked if the conflict in the Middle East would have flow on effects here, most notably, short term fuel prices.\n\n“Well, we’re very mindful of the impact on the economy,’’ he replied. “And you’re right to highlight fuel prices. We’re obviously very mindful of the impact on the oil price.\n\n“And we have seen that go up over the course of the last few days. While this conflict has been ongoing. I mean, it has an impact. It will have an impact on the global economy. That’s what conflicts do. That’s what we’ve seen. You know, with the war in\n\nUkraine. And that is an inevitable consequence of conflict of this kind.”\n\nEarlier, Labor frontbencher Amanda Rishworth dodged questions over whether she supports Israel’s war with Iran.\n\n“Obviously it’s really alarming the escalation,’’ she said. “Of course, Israel has a right to defend itself, but we would be urging all parties for dialogue and de-escalation. \n\n“There needs to be … tensions brought down here because the consequences will be significant if it spills over into a wider conflict.”\n\nAUKUS in the spotlight\n\nAmerica’s bombshell review into the future of the AUKUS nuclear power submarine deal could be the “moment Washington saves Australia from itself”, former prime minister Paul Keating warned last week.\n\nAustralia made its first AUKUS down payment to the US in February, transferring nearly $800 million to help boost the country’s submarine production.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has now announced its biggest AUKUS sceptic Elbridge Colby will head a review into whether the US should pull out of the submarine deal.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Keating described AUKUS as being “hurriedly scribbled on the back of an envelope by Scott Morrison, along with the vacuous British blowhard Boris Johnson, and the confused president, Joe Biden – put together on an English beach, a world away from where Australia’s strategic interests primarily lie”.\n\n“The Albanese government had the chance to undertake a review on its own terms when first elected to office in May 2022, but denied itself the opportunity for fear of being seen as dodgy on the alliance,” Mr Keating said.\n\n“Now President Trump’s Pentagon, as it is entitled to do, is subjecting the deal to the kind of scrutiny that should have been applied to AUKUS in the first instance.\n\n“The review makes clear that America keeps its national interests uppermost. But the concomitant question is: why has Australia failed to do the same?”\n\nTurnbull trashes Aussie sub ‘fiasco’\n\nFormer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier warned the deal risks becoming a billion-dollar “fiasco” for Australia, telling news.com.au that the “terrible deal” inked by Mr Morrison had always included a clause or caveat that no submarines will be handed over unless it had submarines to spare.\n\n“So this is a risk that Australia has taken with its eyes wide open,” Mr Turnbull said.\n\n“It will be a fiasco, I think. So that’s one alternative. Another alternative is to go back to France. They’ve been double crossed once before.\n\n“It is a debacle. I’ve been saying this for years. It was a debacle when Morrison recklessly entered into it, and it was a debacle when Labor, to avoid a political wedge, went along.\n\n“It’s fundamentally a bad deal. I’m not saying naval nuclear propulsion is a bad idea. It’s a good idea, but it’s, you know, a very expensive one, and you sure you can pay for it.\n\n“But the, but the problem with this deal is it’s so asymmetrical, you know, we give the Americans $3 billion, they only have to give us submarines if they feel they could spare them.\n\n“This whole exercise is designed to get us nuclear powered submarines, but the upshot could be that we end up with no submarines at all.”\n\n‘All or nothing’ deal\n\nAustralia’s former US ambassador Joe Hockey said Australia’s defence spending is likely being used by Washington as an excuse to launch a review into the AUKUS pact.\n\nSpeaking with ABC’s Radio National Breakfast, Mr Hockey said the deal was “all or nothing”.\n\n“If we don’t get the Virginia Class submarines in 2032, we have no options left. We have no submarines,” he said.\n\n“So this is all or nothing for Australia. And for the sake of our national security, we need to make sure that we can at least provide some deterrent for potential hostile threats to our nations.”\n\nA former top adviser to Mr Trump has also warned that cancelling the AUKUS pact would be “catastrophic”.\n\nJohn Bolton, who served as President Trump’s national security adviser, told Nine the review is likely aimed at scaling back AUKUS, or abandoning the pact altogether.\n\n“It’s more a question of how much of a downsize (of AUKUS) they are looking at, including potentially total cancellation — which would be catastrophic, a huge mistake for the US with enormous consequences for Australia and the UK.”","summary":"Today host Karl Stefanovic asked Australia’s Defence Minister one pointed question amid a grilling about our relationship with the US.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/military/australia-under-pressure-to-lift-defence-spending-ahead-of-trump-talks/news-story/85c765e96ff2e9b4c1ba3b7fa8be8119?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/db38169b5399ce36dabfb2a0db933e31","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 23:57:17","author":"Samantha Maiden","authors":["Samantha Maiden"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":331751274,"title":"Friends say Minnesota shooting suspect was deeply religious and conservative","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — The man accused of assassinating the top Democrat in the Minnesota House held deeply religious and politically conservative views, telling a congregation in Africa two years ago that the U.S. was in a “bad place” where most churches didn’t oppose abortion.\n\nVance Luther Boelter, 57, was at the center of a massive multistate manhunt on Sunday, a day after authorities say he impersonated a police officer and gunned down former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home outside Minneapolis. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz described the shooting as “a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nSen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were shot earlier by the same gunman at their home nearby but survived.\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press described Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for President Donald Trump. Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota where voters don’t list party affiliation.\n\nNear the scene at Hortman’s home, authorities say they found an SUV made to look like those used by law enforcement. Inside they found fliers for a local anti-Trump “No Kings” rally scheduled for Saturday and a notebook with names of other lawmakers. The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nBoth Hortman and Hoffman were defenders of abortion rights at the state legislature.\n\nSuspect not believed to have made any public threats before attacks, official says\n\nDrew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at a briefing on Sunday that Boelter is not believed to have made any public threats before the attacks. Evans asked the public not to speculate on a motivation for the attacks. “We often want easy answers for complex problems,” he told reporters. “Those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation.”\n\nFriends told the AP that they knew Boelter was religious and conservative, but that he didn’t talk about politics often and didn’t seem extreme.\n\n“He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,” said Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.\n\nA glimpse of suspect’s beliefs on abortion during a trip to Africa\n\nBoelter, who worked as a security contractor, gave a glimpse of his beliefs on abortion during a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023. While there, Boelter served as an evangelical pastor, telling people he had first found Jesus as a teenager.\n\n“The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong in many churches,” he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.\n\nHe appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.\n\n“He never talked to me about abortion,” Schroeder said. “It seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.”\n\nA married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.\n\nSeeking to reinvent himself\n\nHe worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online.\n\nAfter getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master’s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.\n\nAfter moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.\n\nIn that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.\n\nLaunching a security firm\n\nRecords show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter’s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company’s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and “Praetorian” painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company’s name across the front.\n\nIn an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.\n\n“It has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,” he wrote in a message shared with the AP.\n\nBut once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities — a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter “voluntarily left” that position about four months ago.\n\n“This is devastating news for all involved,” Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter’s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nBoelter had also started spending some nights away from his family, renting a room in a modest house in northern Minneapolis shared by friends. Heavily armed police executed a search warrant on the home Saturday.\n\n‘I’m going to be gone for awhile’\n\nIn the hours before Saturday’s shootings, Boelter texted two roommates to tell them he loved them and that “I’m going to be gone for a while,” according to Schroeder, who was forwarded the text and read it to the AP.\n\n“May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” Boelter wrote. “I don’t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don’t know anything about this.

Democratic Gov. Tim Walz described the shooting as “a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nSen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were shot earlier by the same gunman at their home nearby but survived.\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press described Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for President Donald Trump. Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota where voters don’t list party affiliation.\n\nNear the scene at Hortman’s home, authorities say they found an SUV made to look like those used by law enforcement. Inside they found fliers for a local anti-Trump “No Kings” rally scheduled for Saturday and a notebook with names of other lawmakers. The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nBoth Hortman and Hoffman were defenders of abortion rights at the state legislature.\n\n Suspect not believed to have made any public threats before attacks, official says \n\nDrew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at a briefing on Sunday that Boelter is not believed to have made any public threats before the attacks. Evans asked the public not to speculate on a motivation for the attacks. “We often want easy answers for complex problems,” he told reporters. “Those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation.”\n\nFriends told the AP that they knew Boelter was religious and conservative, but that he didn't talk about politics often and didn't seem extreme.\n\n\"He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,” said Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.\n\n A glimpse of suspect's beliefs on abortion during a trip to Africa \n\nBoelter, who worked as a security contractor, gave a glimpse of his beliefs on abortion during a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023. While there, Boelter served as an evangelical pastor, telling people he had first found Jesus as a teenager. \n\n“The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong in many churches,” he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.\n\nHe appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.\n\n“He never talked to me about abortion,” Schroeder said. “It seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.”\n\nA married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.\n\n Seeking to reinvent himself \n\nHe worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online. \n\nAfter getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master’s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.\n\nAfter moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.\n\nIn that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.\n\n Launching a security firm \n\nRecords show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter’s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company’s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and “Praetorian” painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company’s name across the front.\n\nIn an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.\n\n“It has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,” he wrote in a message shared with the AP. \n\nBut once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities — a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter “voluntarily left” that position about four months ago.\n\n“This is devastating news for all involved,” Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter’s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nBoelter had also started spending some nights away from his family, renting a room in a modest house in northern Minneapolis shared by friends. Heavily armed police executed a search warrant on the home Saturday.\n\n ‘I’m going to be gone for awhile' \n\nIn the hours before Saturday’s shootings, Boelter texted two roommates to tell them he loved them and that “I’m going to be gone for a while,” according to Schroeder, who was forwarded the text and read it to the AP.\n\n“May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” Boelter wrote. “I don’t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don’t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I’m sorry for the trouble this has caused.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Balsamo contributed to this report from Washington.

Garcia was granted no bond, according to his arrest affidavit.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets on Saturday, protesting President Donald Trump, specifically his policies targeting illegal immigration and what some call “authoritarian or tyrannical-like” actions by his administration.\n\nIn Jacksonville, a man was arrested and charged with sending written threats to conduct an act of terrorism after he was accused of posting on social media, threatening to run over those protesting the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said last week that drivers who feel threatened by protesters are allowed to defend themselves, even if that means running protesters over.\n\nAdditionally, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey issued warnings to those who employ violence at protests across the state.\n\n“If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at, because we will kill you. Graveyard, dead. We’re not going to play, this has got to stop,” Ivey said at a press conference Thursday.\n\nProtests were largely peaceful in Tampa and Jacksonville, with no reported arrests during the ‘No Kings’ protests in either city.\n\nShare this @internewscast.comFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\n You May Also Like \n\n \n\n US \n\n An interesting perspective on the initial half-year of Donald Trump’s potential second…\n\n InternewscastJune 15, 2025\n\n \n\n US \n\n The arrest of Sen.

The Israelis informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei. After being briefed on the plan, the White House made clear to Israeli officials that Trump was opposed to the Israelis making the move, according to the official, who was not authorized to comment on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Trump administration is desperate to keep Israel’s military operation aimed at decapitating Iran’s nuclear program from exploding into an even more expansive conflict and saw the plan to kill Khamenei as a move that would enflame the conflict and potentially destabilize the region. Asked about the plan during an interview on Fox News Channel’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not directly address whether the White House rejected the plan. “But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do, we’ll do what we need to do,” Netanyahu said. “And I think the United States knows what is good for the United States.” Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri later called reports about the Israeli plan to kill Khamenei “fake.” Netanyahu in the Fox interview also said regime change “could certainly be the result” of the conflict “because the Iranian regime is very weak.” Trump’s rejection of the proposal was first reported by Reuters. Meanwhile, Trump on Sunday issued a stark warning to Iran not to retaliate against U.S. targets in the Middle East. Trump in an early morning social media posting said the United States “had nothing to do with the attack on Iran” as Israel and Iran traded missile attacks for the third straight day. Iran, however, has said it would hold the U.S. — which has provided Israel with much of its deep arsenal of weaponry — responsible for its backing of Israel. “If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” Trump said. Hours later Trump took to social media again to predict “Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal” and that it could come “soon.” But as he departed the White House on Sunday evening for the Group of Seven leaders summit in the Canadian Rockies, Trump was more tempered in comments to reporters about when the Israeli strikes and Iranian retaliation would wind down. “I hope there is going to be a deal, and we’ll see what happens, but sometimes they have to fight it out,” Trump said. The conflict is expected to loom large during his talks with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the European Union.

He added that reports suggesting Iran sought U.S. involvement in promoting a ceasefire or restarting nuclear talks were inaccurate.

So for all of those wonderful people who don’t want to do anything about Iran having a nuclear weapon – that’s not peace.’ \n\n‘Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb, very simple. Regardless – Israel or not Israel – Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb,’ the president added.\n\nIn a sensational development Sunday, two US officials revealed that the president vetoed an Israeli plan this week to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe plot signals the intent and velocity with which Israel is moving to dismantle Iran’s leadership amid fears it is deliberately fomenting regime change.\n\nThe president is now facing calls from Iran hawks in the GOP to join Israel’s bombing campaign.\n\nAny military action in the region threatens to put Trump at odds with major allies in the MAGA movement, not least Carlson, who has accused the commander-in-chief of being ‘complicit’ in Israel’s strikes.\n\nTrump heavily campaigned last year as the man who would keep America out of foreign wars, while at the same time projecting ‘peace through strenght.’ \n\nEarlier this week, Carlson cautioned the Trump administration publicly on social media after he learned that Levin had visited the White House.\n\n‘Mark Levin was at the White House today, lobbying for war with Iran,’ Carlson wrote in a social media post. \n\n‘To be clear, Levin has no plans to fight in this or any other war. He’s demanding that American troops do it.’\n\nCarlson wrote that Levin’s ‘hyperventilating’ about Iran’s nuclear plans was a distraction from the dangers of sending American troops back into the Middle East.\n\n‘A war with Iran would amount to a profound betrayal of his supporters. It would end his presidency. That may explain why so many of Trump’s enemies are advocating for it,’ he wrote.\n\nLevin responded to the Politico report on his radio show Tuesday evening telling his listeners that he met with President Trump last week after he was invited to the White House.\n\n‘He and I are very close friends,’ Levin said, adding that ‘the president knows exactly where I stand on Iran and he told me he knows exactly where I stand on Iran because he watches my shows on Fox.’\n\nHe described the Politico report as sourced by ‘a group of people who were pushing propaganda.’\n\n‘What I am not doing and what I would not do to Donald Trump is lead a lobbying campaign of hawks,’ he said.\n\nIt comes as Trump this morning refused to rule out involvement in the conflict, while at the same time denying any American participation to this point. \n\nSpeaking with ABC News Sunday morning, Trump addressed reports that Israel was encouraging Administration to join the conflict with Iran to eliminate its nuclear program.\n\n“We’re not involved in it. It’s possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved,” the president said.\n\n‘The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, tonight,’ the president wrote on Truth Social in the early hours of Sunday morning.\n\nTrump vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s Khamenei, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n“Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership,” said one of the sources, a senior U.S. administration official.\n\nIsrael launched “Operation Rising Lion” with a surprise attack on Friday morning that wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command and damaged its nuclear sites, and says the campaign will continue to escalate in coming days. Iran has vowed to “open the gates of hell” in retaliation.\n\nIsrael and Iran launched fresh attacks on each other overnight into Sunday, killing scores and raising fears of a wider conflict.\n\nIsraeli rescue teams combed through rubble of residential buildings destroyed by Iranian missiles, using sniffer dogs and heavy excavators to look for survivors after at least 10 people, including children, were killed, raising the two-day toll to 13.\n\nSirens rang out across Israel after 4 p.m. on Sunday in the first such daylight alert, and fresh explosions could be heard in Tel Aviv.\n\nIn Iran, images from the capital showed the night sky lit up by a huge blaze at a fuel depot after Israel began strikes against Iran’s oil and gas sector – raising the stakes for the global economy and the functioning of the Iranian state.\n\nIran has not given a full death toll but said 78 people were killed on Friday and scores more have died since, including in a single attack that killed 60 on Saturday, half of them children, in a 14-storey apartment block flattened in Tehran.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump made it clear who the leader of the MAGA movement&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Fiery Comeback to Tucker Carlson&#8217;s Accusations of Dropping the &#8216;America First&#8217; Agenda first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/trumps-fiery-comeback-to-tucker-carlsons-accusations-of-dropping-the-america-first-agenda/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Trumps-blistering-response-to-Tucker-Carlsons-claims.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 23:11:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":331744966,"title":"Report: Trump Opposes Israeli Proposal to Target Iran’s Supreme Leader Khamenei","text":"President Donald Trump shut down an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in recent days, two members of the Trump administration reportedly said.\n\n“Have the Iranians killed an American yet?

Then on Saturday, the Islamic state struck the Arab Muslim town of Tamra, east of Israel’s port city of Haifa.\n\nPresident Trump reacted to the developing conflict between Israel and Iran in a Truth Social post, saying, “I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal.

Today is day 61,” President Trump added in a follow-up Truth Social post Friday. “I told them what to do, but they just couldn’t get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!”\n\nMoreover, Israel’s morning strikes on Iran on Friday came after Trump said on Thursday that he did not want Israel to attack if a deal could be reached about Iran’s nuclear program, suggesting that it could hurt talks with the U.S., but also noting it could be helpful in a way.\n\nOn Saturday, President Trump announced he wants the war between Iran and Israel to come to an end, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a phone call they had that morning.\n\n“Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Sunday, adding, “We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran,” before revealing, “Many calls and meetings now taking place.”\n\nAlana Mastrangelo is a reporter for – News.

It was unclear what further actions were taken.\n\nWitnesses told reporters people were gathering for a concert at the swap meet that was later canceled following the raid. Federal immigration authorities detained an unknown number of people at the swap meet, the venue said in a statement on Facebook Sunday.\n\nSwap meet officials said they did not contact immigration officials or know they would be at the venue and didn’t consent to their presence at the swap meet.\n\n“These actions were completely out of our control,” swap meet officials said.\n\n“We understand how concerning this is for our customers, vendors, and staff,” they continued. “The Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet has always been a place of connection, culture, and commerce for all.”\n\nThe Trump administration has continued widespread immigration enforcement activities — with a reported goal of up to 3,000 deportations per day — even as it scales back raids and arrests at agricultural sites, hotels and restaurants in response to complaints from employers.\n\nThe revised plans were put in place Friday, but the details were not made public.\n\n“President Trump has always stood up for our farmers, who were a major part of his November victory, by working to negotiate fairer trade deals and cut red tape,” Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to The New York Times. “He will continue to strengthen our agricultural industry and boost exports while keeping his promise to enforce our immigration laws and remove the millions of unvetted illegals who flooded into the United States under Joe Biden.”\n\nThe Trump administration began conducting immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles on June 6, prompting daily demonstrations in the street that have often turned violent and resulted in widespread graffiti and other property damage in the downtown area.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has arrested 561 people related to protest activity since then, police said Sunday.\n\nOn Sunday, protesters returned to the streets of downtown Los Angeles, one day after a nationwide series of “No Kings” demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration policy saw massive crowds in the Civic Center and other cities throughout Southern California and the nation.\n\nThe size of the gathering was not immediately apparent, but transportation officials said shortly before 3 p.m. that downtown’s DASH bus system would not be serving the following stops until further notice:\n\n— Temple and Alameda Street\n\n— Temple and Los Angeles Street\n\n— Temple and Main Street\n\n— Temple and Spring Street\n\nAlso Sunday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified two more of the people detained in the recent raids who allegedly had criminal records. Alfredo Vasquez-Petronilo was described as a Mexican national with prior convictions for battery, assault and DUI, while Jose Jonathan Delgado was described as a Mexican national who’s been previously deported and was convicted of battery with serious bodily injury.\n\nOfficials said Vasquez-Petronilo would stay in ICE custody pending immigration proceedings, and Delgado would stay in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.\n\nLast week, Trump deployed 4,000 California National Guard troops and 700 Marines to tamp down the disruptive demonstrations while the immigration raids continue.\n\nMaj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 — the contingent of troops ordered into the city by Trump — said Friday morning the deployment of Marines in the Los Angeles area will free up the National Guard, who have been primarily protecting federal property, to serve a more protective role for federal agents conducting enforcement operations in the field.\n\n“I would like to emphasize that the soldiers will not participate in law enforcement activities,” Sherman told reporters. “Rather, they’ll be focused on protecting federal law enforcement personnel.”\n\nA federal court hearing is set for Tuesday to determine whether Trump or California Gov. Gavin Newsom will control future National Guard activity going forward.\n\nNewsom challenged Trump’s decision to federalize the Guard, an action U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco said in a ruling last week did not follow congressionally mandated procedure.\n\nHis ruling was stayed by a three-judge appellate panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in response to a Trump administration notice of appeal, temporarily keeping the National Guard troops under federal control, at least through Tuesday.","summary":"Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet officials confirmed a federal immigration enforcement operation at their venue.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/15/southern-california-immigration-raids-continue-including-at-santa-fe-springs-swap-meet/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WDN-Z-SWAPMEET-0616.jpg?w=1024&h=640","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 23:07:03","author":"Andrea Klick,City News Service","authors":["Andrea Klick","City News Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":331741540,"title":"After years of waiting, the work to excavate the unmarked burial site at the Tuam home is starting today","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

A barrier is due to be erected around the perimeter and 24-hour security monitoring will be implemented. MacSweeney said families were given an opportunity to visit the site before the work commenced.\n\nThe legislation enabling the excavation was passed in 2022.\n\nGreen Party leader Roderic O’Gorman, who was Minister for Children at the time and had responsibility in Government for work related to mother and baby homes, said the bill would “allow us, at long last, to afford the children interred in Tuam a dignified and respectful burial”.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“My sincere hope is that this will finally bring some form of solace and closure to the families and survivors who have been so deeply affected by this abhorrent situation,” O’Gorman said.\n\nFor survivors and their families of mother and baby homes across the country, the excavation of Tuam marks an important step in trying to find some kind of justice – but it’s also a reminder of how long it has taken to get to this point, and how many other sites around the country deserve the same examination as Tuam.\n\nLaura Angela Collins is a campaigner whose mother, aunt and grandmother were all subjected to the cruelties of institutions.\n\nHer grandmother Angelina Collins (who was renamed Angela in the laundry) was kept in a Magdalene laundry for decades and buried in a mass grave in Cork along with other women, and her mother Mary Teresa Collins grew up in an industrial school. \n\nLaura Collins and her brothers as children at the site of her grandmother's grave in CorkLaura Collins\n\nLaura Collins\n\nSpeaking to The Journal, Laura said that there are mixed emotions surrounding the Tuam excavation. \n\nShe said the excavation represents “some hope” in a “dark situation”.\n\n“It’s welcomed, and it’s something that emotionally is kind of positive, because we hope that there is an addressing of the treatment of these children and rectifying of what we believe to be crimes of the State and Church,” she said.\n\nBut at the same time, Laura said, the excavation in Tuam must be the start, not the end, of this type of work to uncover the extent of the atrocities at similar institutions around the country.\n\n“There are so many places that deserve proper acknowledgement that haven’t received it, and neither has Tuam yet, and this is where it has to happen for Tuam but we can’t stop after Tuam either.”\n\nLaura Collins with Catherine Corless, who presented Laura with a Traveller Pride award in 2019 for her work highlighting the injustices done in Magdalene laundries, industrial schools, mother and baby homes, and county homes.\n\nLaura said that survivors and their families have waited far too long for recognition and justice.\n\n“The government knew, we as a society knew, the people that lived next to the convents knew [what was happening],” she said.\n\n“My family is still looking for the exhumation of my grandmother.

We don’t want them here, they don’t need to be here. Our local law enforcement has complete control of the situation,\" Bass said on \"State of the Union\" Sunday. Trump deployed an initial round of 2,000 federalized National Guard troops to the City of Angels after chaotic anti-I.C.E. protests – in which demonstrators threw rocks at federal vehicles, brandished Mexican flags, and set Waymo cars on fire – on Saturday, June 7 and subsequently deployed an additional round of 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines. 'SOCIAL CHAOS': GOP, DEM LAWMAKERS SOUND OFF ON LOS ANGELES UNREST The Marines detained a former Army veteran, Marcos Leao, 27, who became a U.S. citizen after serving in the military, after he wandered into a restricted area on his way to the Veterans Administration office. Leao told Reuters that the Marines treated him \"very fairly.\" \"They treated me very fairly, understand, this is a whole stressful situation for everybody, and we all have a job,\" Leao said. Protests continued in Los Angeles over the following week, culminating in a large demonstration as part of the nationwide \"No Kings\" protest on Saturday. Bass downplayed the unrest in her city, saying that recent protests took place in a \"small sliver of our town\" and put the blame for any unrest squarely on Trump’s deportation raids. Bass called Saturday’s protests \"overwhelmingly peaceful\" and said that there were sectors of Los Angeles’ economy that couldn’t survive without illegal immigrant labor. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"There were a lot of people out, about 30,000. Out of that big crowd five people were arrested, about 30 were given citations and there were injuries on both sides. Officers were injured and so were people that were there,\" Bass said. \"If the raids hadn’t happened, then that protest would have been a ‘No Kings’ protest, we know that was planned months in advance. But the disruption and the fear that has been caused by the outrage by the raids has really had a devastating effect and has been a body blow to our economy.\" I.C.E has made several high-profile raids in Los Angeles and across the country as part of the president’s campaign promise to deliver mass-deportations. Trump promised to prioritize criminal illegal aliens, but critics allege the administration is separating families and targeting non-criminal workers. \"I don’t think the president understands that we have entire sectors of our economy that cannot function without immigrant labor,\" Bass said.

The move came out of fears that the sweeping raids were hurting key industries in the U.S. \"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long-time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday.","summary":"LA Mayor Karen Bass came out against deploying federal troops in her city to deal with unruly protests, saying local law enforcement was on top of the situation.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/la-mayor-hits-back-trump-marine-deployments-saying-we-dont-want-them-here","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/bass-protest.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 23:00:50","author":"David Spector","authors":["David Spector"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.074},{"id":331746508,"title":"Elon Musk has an idea for a new political party—that already exists","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nAbout a week ago, as his breakup with President Donald Trump went supernova, multibillionaire Elon Musk hit on a favorite idea among political dilettantes: “A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!”\n\nMusk is no centrist, and his highest-profile policy moves have been widely unpopular, so who knows what kind of party he’s imagining. But the general idea—a party that appeals to a so-called middle majority—has recently been promoted by TV-friendly businessman Mark Cuban, presidential also-ran Andrew Yang, and the enervate political organization No Labels.\n\nBut these elites are all missing the same crucial fact: A political party that focuses on broadly popular policies already exists.\n\nIt’s the Democratic Party.\n\nMusk’s “80% in the middle” dream demonstrates his extreme political naivete. Eighty percent of Americans agree on only a handful of policies, like having the Food and Drug Administration inspect food or requiring car companies to submit accident data on self-driving vehicles—and Musk is adamantly against the latter. But when it comes to more expansive party-defining policies, like those around abortion rights or health care, an 80% consensus very rarely exists.\n\nBut let’s be generous to this man who does not deserve it and say he basically means “a decisive majority of Americans”—say, 60%. After all, that’s about the share of Americans (58%) who want a viable third party to exist, according to Gallup. So what would a party of the 60% believe?\n\nA party of the 60% would increase taxes on billionaires and large corporations, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and pour more federal funding into affordable housing. Its economic agenda would also expand antitrust enforcement against Big Tech and advocate for stricter environmental regulations, even if they cost jobs and dent the economy. This hypothetical party would prioritize expanding wind and solar power over fossil fuels, and it would want to tax corporations based on how much carbon they release. Hell, this party would even favor making power plants completely eliminate carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nA party of the 60% would support abortion being legal in most or all cases. It would see the government as responsible for ensuring all Americans have health insurance. It would strongly support Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. It would want to pour billions into research for women’s health and cap yearly out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs on all insurance plans. It would support creating a public option for health insurance and lowering the enrollment age for Medicare from 65 to 60, though it wouldn’t be sold on Medicare for all. Nonetheless, this party would increase benefits for Social Security and Medicare. \n\nA party of the 60% would believe it’s too easy to legally obtain a gun in the U.S. It would fight for banning assault rifles and implementing universal background checks and red-flag laws.\n\nA party of the 60% would want to provide free college tuition to low- and middle-income families and free breakfast and lunch to students at public schools. It would maintain that kids should be required to get vaccinated in order to attend public school. And while the party wouldn’t have a solid stance on school vouchers, it would support increasing funding for public schools over putting that new money into private-school vouchers. \n\nA party of the 60% would support protecting access to contraception, legalizing recreational marijuana, implementing universal paid family and medical leave, increasing food assistance for low-income families, setting term limits for Supreme Court justices, and providing many types of foreign aid, especially when it comes to donating food and medicine.\n\nSound familiar? All of these policies are supported by at least 60% of respondents, and virtually all of them are parts of the Democratic Party’s platform—and reviled by the Republican Party.\n\nBut what about immigration, which is arguably Trump’s signature issue?\n\nLast summer, 55% of Americans wanted to decrease the number of immigrants coming into the U.S. And this past January, a majority (53%) supported “arresting and deporting millions of illegal immigrants,” according to a YouGov/Economist poll. (Notably, both figures are less than 60%.)\n\nHowever, when asked more detailed questions, the public is more liberal. For instance, 61% of Americans oppose deporting undocumented immigrants who are longtime U.S. residents and haven’t committed a crime, according to a new YouGov poll for The Economist. Majorities of Americans also oppose deporting undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids (61%), who are married to a U.S. citizen (66%), or who have young children who are U.S. citizens (54%). \n\nThe same poll doesn’t even find majority support for deporting undocumented immigrants convicted of nonviolent crimes. Only 47% support such deportations. (Of course, as research consistently shows, undocumented immigrants are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit crimes.)\n\nOther polling shows that majorities oppose deportation raids at funerals, weddings, churches, schools, playgrounds, and other sensitive areas. And only 15% of Americans who support “some” deportations for undocumented immigrants would kick out those who have a job, according to the Pew Research Center. \n\nWhen faced with the details, Americans end up being pretty sympathetic toward undocumented migrants—and closer to Democrats’ stance than the deport-them-all position pushed by Republicans. After all, 64% of Americans say that undocumented immigrants should be able to stay if they meet certain requirements, like passing a background check or having a job. And 61% support providing such immigrants with a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThese “we need a third party” elites are simply out of touch, unable or unwilling to see that a big-tent party already exists. The Democratic Party often comes across as disjointed—or, dare I say, in disarray—but that’s because it’s the party of the 60%. If only the 60% realized that.\n\nAny updates?\n\n As some House Republicans’ support for Trump’s cruel tax bill is waffling, the public appears to be starkly against it. Fifty-three percent of voters oppose the legislation, according to a new Quinnipiac University poll. However, the really bad sign for Trump is that just 27% support the bill, with the remaining 20% unsure. In fact, only 2 in 3 Republican voters (67%) support the bill. Seems bad!\n\n Trump has called in the National Guard and Marine Corps to assist federal agents in a brutal immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, and early polling found Americans were widely skeptical of the military deployments. Additional polling confirms that response: 44% of Americans are opposed to the deployments, while 41% support them, according to a new poll from The Washington Post/Schar School. Among Californians, 58% oppose the deployments, and just 32% support them.\n\n Trump’s economic agenda is pushing the country closer to a recession—so close that most Americans think either that we’re in a recession (36%) or that one is likely in the next 12 months (27%), according to the latest YouGov/Economist poll.\n\nThough Musk may have deluded himself into believing his hard-right politics are shared by “80%” of Americans, the public itself isn’t too hot on his brief tenure in the Trump administration. \n\nPluralities of Americans think Musk had “too much” influence in Trump’s White House (49%) and that his work in the government did more harm than good (46%), according to new data from YouGov.\n\nOn top of that, as of Friday, only 37.1% of the public has a favorable view of Musk, while 55.2% has a negative view, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling average.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nAbout a week ago, as his breakup with President Donald Trump went supernova, multibillionaire Elon Musk hit on a favorite idea among political dilettantes: “A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!”\n\n\n\nMusk is no centrist, and his highest-profile policy moves have been widely unpopular, so who knows what kind of party he’s imagining.
