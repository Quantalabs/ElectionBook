The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier reported that Xi told Trump the return of the island to China was an “integral part of the post-war international order” forged in the joint US-China fight against “fascism and militarism”.\n\nXi’s overtures came as his country faced off against Japan over the future of the self-governing island, which China considers its territory. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi recently said Japan’s military could intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.\n\nAccording to China’s Foreign Ministry, Trump told Xi that the US, which does not officially recognise Taiwan’s claim to statehood, yet remains the island’s most important partner and arms supplier, “understands how important the Taiwan question is to China”.\n\nThe phone call also coincided with the Trump administration’s latest push to end the war in Ukraine. China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the conflict. In Monday’s call, Xi said he supported “all efforts that are conducive to peace”, expressing hope that the crisis be resolved “at its root”, according to the Foreign Ministry.\n\nThe conversation came nearly one month after the two men met in person in the South Korean city of Busan as a trade war between the two countries rocked international markets.\n\nA tentative deal reached in October’s meeting saw Beijing agree to suspend export restrictions on critical minerals for one year.\n\nWashington said it would cut back tariffs on Chinese products and that Beijing would up purchases of soya beans from US farmers after shunning the product for months.\n\nTrump said on Monday that he had spoken about “Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products” with his Chinese counterpart.\n\n“We have done a good, and very important, deal for our Great Farmers – and it will only get better,” Trump wrote, without providing further details.","url":"https://haitigazette.com/trump-says-very-good-phone-call-with-xi-builds-on-fragile-trade-truce/","image":"https://haitigazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AFP__20251124__84ZL363__v2__HighRes__ComboUsChinaPoliticsDiplomacyTrumpXi-1764009893-2HvodU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 01:06:05","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ht","sentiment":0.014},{"id":381890838,"title":"Trump orders blacklisting Muslim Brotherhood branches as ‘terrorist’ groups  - Haiti Gazette – Daily Haiti","text":"Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has ordered his aides to start a process to label the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan as “terrorist” organisations, citing their alleged support for the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nTrump issued the decree on Monday as Washington intensified its crackdown on Israel’s foes in the region.\n\nThe decree accused Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Jordan of providing “material support” to Hamas and the Lebanese branch of the group – known as al-Jamaa al-Islamiya – of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah in their war with Israel.\n\nIt also claimed that an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader “called for violent attacks against United States partners and interests” during Israel’s war on Gaza. But it was not clear what the White House was referring to. The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.\n\n“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.\n\nTrump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.\n\nA formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.\n\nThe process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner. The decree also opens the door to blacklisting other Muslim Brotherhood branches.\n\nThe White House is also pushing to label the groups as “designated global terrorists”.\n\nThe designations would make it illegal to provide material support to the group. It would also mostly ban their current and former members from entering the US, and enable economic sanctions to choke their revenue streams.\n\nEstablished in 1928 by Egyptian Muslim scholar Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood has offshoots and branches across the Middle East in the shape of political parties and social organisations.\n\nAcross the Middle East, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties take part in elections and say they are committed to peaceful political participation.\n\nBut the group has been outlawed by several countries across the region.\n\nBlacklisting the Muslim Brotherhood has been a longstanding demand for right-wing activists in the US.\n\nBut critics say that the move could further enable authoritarianism and the crackdown on free political expression in the Middle East.\n\nThe decree could also be used to target Muslim American activists on allegations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood or contributions to charities affiliated with the group.\n\nRight-wing groups have long pushed to outlaw Muslim American groups with unfounded accusations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said the designation should not have an impact on Muslim American advocacy groups and charities.\n\n“The American Muslim organisations are solid,” Awad told Al Jazeera. “They are based in the US. The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”\n\nBut he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.\n\nRecently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.\n\nCAIR has sued the governor’s office in response.","url":"https://haitigazette.com/trump-orders-blacklisting-muslim-brotherhood-branches-as-terrorist-groups/","image":"https://haitigazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-22T170417Z_924680305_RC2R1IAYKGWL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1764024330-ov0c4N.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 01:06:03","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"ht","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":381889524,"title":"America’s new sanctions on Russian oil may be biting too late","text":"The most effective sanctions yet on Russia’s oil exports since the start of the war in Ukraine are set to become irrelevant if Donald Trump pressures Ukraine into accepting a peace plan that might have looked quite differently had they been in place earlier.\n\nLast Friday, sanctions on two of Russia’s biggest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, came into effect.

war before last year's ceasefire was agreed.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group, which opposes Israel, has been badly weakened by the war but remains armed and financially resilient.\n\nIn September

Deadline reported Monday that Adam Levy, a Washington DC-based executive producer and news editor, abruptly left the BBC after complaints were made about his \"management style.\" Sources told Deadline that a recent incident was the \"final straw\" for Levy, who reportedly spoke to a young producer in an \"aggressive\" manner following a mistake that was made. WHAT'S BEHIND TRUMP'S HEADED FEUD WITH THE BBC THAT RESULTED IN $5 BILLION LAWSUIT THREAT? Levy joined the BBC in March 2023 following a 15-year stint at CNN. His former colleagues at CNN describe Levy as being a \"good producer\" and \"harmless,\" but that he was also \"very by the book.\" One ex-colleague told Fox News Digital that while it \"wasn't the most pleasant\" to work with Levy, \"It wasn't anything that was awful,\" either. A spokesperson for the BBC declined to comment on individual HR matters. Levy did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. EX-BBC DIRECTOR GENERAL TELLS NETWORK THEY SHOULDN'T AGREE TO PAY TRUMP ANY MONEY The BBC also provided an update to its review of its Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee (EGSC), which is responsible for \"overseeing the corporation’s editorial standards and guidelines\" and reports to the BBC board. A review of the EGSC began in June, before the broadcaster was under fire for a documentary that included a misleading edit of President Donald Trump's Jan. 6 comments. In a press release Monday, the BBC said it will assess whether changes made to the EGSC have made a positive impact and make sure there is \"appropriate action\" when its coverage \"falls short of our editorial standards.\" The Guardian reported Friday that a member of the BBC's board resigned after he was allegedly \"cut out\" of discussions that led to the abrupt resignations of BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and BBC Director-General Tim Davie. Trump said he plans to file a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the BBC. The controversy began with a bombshell report from The Telegraph that featured excerpts from a whistleblower dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, a communications advisor hired by the BBC to review its editorial standards. The whistleblower alleged that a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary released last year included a misleading edit of comments Trump made during his Jan. 6, 2021, rally protesting the 2020 presidential election results. EX-BBC CEO DEBORAH TURNESS OVERSAW A STRING OF MEDIA CONTROVERSIES The documentary, \"Trump: A Second Chance?,\" omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, creating the impression that he was calling for violence. \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And I'll be there with you. And we fight — we fight like hell,\" the documentary showed Trump saying. In reality, Trump said, \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\" It wasn't until 54 minutes later that Trump called on his supporters to \"fight like hell\" for election integrity.

Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and more than 75 per cent of Canada's exports go to the US. Most exports to the US are exempted by the USMCA trade agreement but that deal is up for review in 2026.\"This is a completely new approach to foreign policy that is responsive to the global economic environment in which we find ourselves,\" Anand said. \"There is a new government, a new foreign policy, a new prime minister and a new world order where countries are becoming more protectionist and this is a moment for Canada as a trading nation.\" Canada is also seeking better relations with Beijing. Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping took a step toward mending the long-fractured ties between their countries last month with a meeting at the Asia-Pacific summit.In 2023, Ottawa suspended trade talks after going public with allegations from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that the Indian government was behind an assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.Nijjar, 45, was fatally shot in his pickup truck after he left the Sikh temple he led in Surrey, British Columbia. An Indian-born citizen of Canada, he owned a plumbing business and was a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland.Four Indian nationals living in Canada were charged with Niijar's murder and are awaiting trial in Canada.Relations improved in June when Carney invited Modi to the G7 summit in Alberta and when both countries agreed to restore their top diplomats in August.\"This is a step by step process. And in the last six months, significant steps have been taken,\" Anand said.Anand said both countries expect to be able to double bilateral trade by 2030, to USD50 billion, and noted that Canada is India's seventh largest trade partner for goods and services, and one of the largest foreign investors in India.Trump ended trade talks with Carney after the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the US, which upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over the president's insistence that Canada should become the 51st US state.Anand said Canada remains ready to resume trade talks with Trump.\"We are operating under the fact that the United States has fundamentally changed all of its trading relationships,\" Anand said. \"We look forward to getting back to the table.\" Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onCanada India trade dealAnita AnandMark CarneyNarendra ModiCanada India relationstrade talksCanada foreign policy\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Marjorie Taylor Greene may have little political runway left.\n\n“I’m thinking there’s some other opportunity, perhaps in the media ecosystem, that she’s looking at,” CNN political commentator and Republican campaign strategist Shermichael Singleton said Sunday on State of the Union. “But I think her future life in politics is over.”\n\nThe Georgia Republican had once been one of the president’s staunchest defenders in Congress, but their alliance frayed throughout the year over issues like foreign policy, healthcare, and, most explosively, the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.\n\nGreene was among a handful of House Republicans who forced a vote on releasing the Epstein files, a proposal President Trump later signed onto after months of demonizing the effort. \n\nTrump, despite branding Greene a “traitor” and vowing to back a primary challenger against her, has also left the door open for a reconciliation with his former ally and said he’d “love” to see Greene re-enter politics.\n\n“It’s not going to be easy for her” he told NBC News, adding, “I can patch up differences with anyone.” \n\nGreene, who will leave Congress in January before the upcoming midterms, has kept relatively quiet about what she plans next. \n\nShe has steadfastly denied reports that her recent split with Trump is part of a larger attempted rebrand ahead of a 2028 run for president. \n\nIn a resignation letter, Greene spoke of the toll her political career has taken on her and her family, including having to face death threats, though she suggested to constituents in her district she would be “here by their side” as they sought to take power back from the “Political Industrial Complex.”\n\nAmong Republicans, Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump, Jr., Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and Marco Rubio are considered the top four Republican frontrunners in the 2028 presidential race, according to poll averages.\n\nGreene may not be the only Republican set to depart Congress soon, a development that would even further imperil a GOP already on shaky foundation ahead of the midterms.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” an unnamed senior House Republican told Punchbowl News. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower.”\n\n“This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage,” the lawmaker said. “And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen.

(AP) — A task force ordered by President Donald Trump to combat crime in Memphis, Tennessee, has made thousands of arrests, compounding strains on the busy local court system and an already overcrowded jail in ways that concerned officials say will last months or even years as cases play out.\n\nSince late September, hundreds of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel tied to the Memphis Safe Task Force have made traffic stops, served warrants and searched for fugitives in the city of about 610,000 people. More than 2,800 people have been arrested and more than 28,000 traffic citations have been issued, data provided by the task force and Memphis police shows.\n\nThe task force, which includes National Guard troops, is supported by Republican Gov. Bill Lee and others who hope the surge reduces crime in a city that has grappled with violent crime, including nearly 300 homicides last year and nearly 400 in 2023.\n\nOn Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi traveled to Memphis to meet with officers and tout the task force’s success in taking suspects and illegal guns off the street. Bondi and other law enforcement leaders later served food to officers to thank them for their work.\n\nAsked about the strain on the local criminal justice system, U.S. Marshals Service Director Gadyaces Serralta said authorities are bringing as many cases as they can in federal court. He said federal officials are open to working with state prosecutors to find ways to speed up prosecutions.\n\n“If we don’t speed up the process, it’s going to continue to back up,” Serralta said. But, he said, “because we can’t put them through the criminal justice system does not mean that it’s a free pass to commit crimes. We’re going to keep arresting folks. They keep committing crimes, we’re going to keep arresting them.”\n\nFrom 2018 to 2024, homicides in Memphis increased 33% and aggravated assaults rose 41%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crimes across the country using local law enforcement data for its Real-Time Crime Index. But AH Datalytics reported those numbers were down 20% during the first nine months of this year, even before the task force got to work.\n\nOpponents of the task force in majority-Black Memphis say it targets minorities and intimidates law-abiding Latinos, some of whom have skipped work and changed social habits, such as avoiding going to church or restaurants, fearing they will be harassed and unfairly detained. Statistics released at the end of October showed 319 arrests so far on administrative warrants, which deal with immigration-related issues.\n\nThe effects have rippled beyond the streets, into the aging criminal courthouse and the troubled jail. Officials are concerned about long waits in traffic court causing people to miss work and packed criminal court dockets forcing inmates to spend extra days waiting for bail hearings.\n\n“The human cost of it is astounding,” said Josh Spickler, executive director for Just City, a Memphis-based organization that advocates for fairness in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, has requested more judges to hear cases that could span months or years. County officials are discussing opening court at night and on weekends, a move that would help manage the caseload but cost more.\n\nMeanwhile, Shelby County Jail inmates are being moved to other facilities because of overcrowding, officials say. Inmates at jail intake are sleeping in chairs, and jail officials are asking county commissioners for funding to help address problems, such as a corrections employees shortage.\n\nThese issues raise concerns from activists and officials about safety in a jail that has seen 65 deaths since 2019, according to Just City. Court case backlogs mean defendants and crime victims could spend an unfair amount of time dealing with the criminal justice system, said Steve Mulroy, the county’s district attorney.\n\n“The task force deployment probably could have used more planning,” said Mulroy, a Democrat whose office is cooperating with the task force. “More thought could have been put into the downstream effects of the increased arrest numbers.”\n\nJail official asks for help\n\nThere were hundreds more jail bookings and bail settings during the first several weeks of the task force’s operation than during the comparable period last year, an increase of about 40% in each category, according to county statistics.\n\nThe jail, which has a regular capacity of 2,400, had an average daily population of 3,195 inmates in September, the most recent month when statistics were available. County officials said that number was expected to rise for October.\n\nAs of mid-November, 250 overflow jail detainees were being housed at other facilities, compared with 80 in November 2024. Some of those are outside Shelby County, which makes it harder for lawyers and relatives to visit and increases the cost of bringing defendants to Memphis for hearings.\n\nIn a letter to commissioners, Chief Jailer Kirk Fields has requested at least $1.5 million in emergency funds, noting that more inmates means more expenses for food, clothing, bedding and linens.\n\nHelp with the courts\n\nOne issue is whether there are enough judges to hear cases, especially after lawmakers eliminated two judgeships during last year’s session.\n\nOn Oct. 31, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris wrote to state court officials asking for additional judges, saying the county is preparing for at least 3,500 to 5,000 people being arrested. More arrests increase jail expenses and the possible hiring of more public defenders, prosecutors and jail employees, he wrote.\n\n“This places Shelby County in extreme financial peril,” Harris wrote.\n\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court’s response said that while lower court judges reported more judges are not necessary at this time, it has designated two senior judges to help should they be needed.\n\n“Part of it is, understanding just what the cadence is going to look like over the next few months and then developing a strategy,” the governor said earlier this month, noting that the state is monitoring the situation.\n\nSome officials have proposed Saturday court sessions and night court sessions two or three nights a week, Mulroy said. They’ve considered having a clinic where people facing misdemeanor warrants could surrender, to help clear those up.\n\nMulroy’s office also is reevaluating whether detention is necessary for people jailed in hundreds of low-level cases.\n\n“If there’s no basis to think they’re a danger to the community or a flight risk, and they’re in there just because they can’t afford their bail, we can take a second look,” he wrote.\n\nTask force says it’s being effective\n\nRyan Guay, a U.S. Marshals Service and task force spokesperson, told The Associated Press that the high volume of arrests reflects the force’s effectiveness.\n\n“We recognize that this success places additional demands on the broader criminal justice system, including courts and detention facilities,” Guay said.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons has said that it is making a satellite prison camp available to the task force. The bureau said the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office would assume oversight of the facility. A sheriff’s office spokesperson declined to comment on the camp’s location, citing operational security.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Christopher L. Keller in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Alanna Durkin Richer in Memphis contributed.","url":"https://www.pilotonline.com/2025/11/24/federal-enforcement-memphis/","image":"https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Federal_Enforcement_Memphis_37489-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:42:07","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":381888548,"title":"Thousands of arrests by Trump’s crime-fighting task force in Memphis strain crowded jail and courts","text":"By ADRIAN SAINZ\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.

Not that it's too high, but because the pace of price increases is worryingly low. Fixing this will require more than the standard prescription — simply cutting interest rates. The promise of an aggressive and sustained easing is needed, one that brings its own share of challenges. This will be tough for Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra to get right. Markets already appreciate the need for a change. The rupee is the worst-performing Asian currency this year against the dollar and, on Friday, it fell to a record low. Traders attributed at least part of the slide to the RBI's reluctance to intervene, breaking with the practice of recent months as the currency weakened largely because of an elusive trade deal with the US. The bank's absence may be a strong signal that a policy shift is in the wings; lower borrowing costs tend to weigh on a currency. (The central bank returned to the market on Monday.) For Malhotra, this could be a Janet Yellen moment. For years after the end of the Global Financial Crisis, inflation failed to pick up in the US and was, in the view of the-then Federal Reserve chair, a little too low for comfort. Asked why inflation remained stubbornly low, she conceded in 2017 that it was a “mystery.” Two years later, her successor, Jerome Powell, called the phenomenon “one of the major challenges of our time.” It took Covid, massive fiscal stimulus, and the supply chain pressures the pandemic uncorked for inflation to awaken.Humility regarding India's projections is in order. The central bank's forecasts have consistently overestimated inflation. A surprisingly low reading for October means forecasts of 2.6% for the year to March are already looking out of date. And that call was made as recently as last month. Considering the bank's target is 4%, policy is now way too tight.Live Events The moment calls for boldness. The RBI should embrace the low-inflation environment when its committee meets in two weeks. At the prior gathering in early October, the bank emphasized prudence and a neutral stance, one that neither holds the economy back nor stimulates it. It's now time to shift to an “accommodative” posture, according to Bloomberg Economics. This would tell investors and consumers that Malhotra's strong preference is to keep cutting. After a period of excessive caution, the RBI should let its hair down a bit. It would also help growth, which has been faltering.Recognizing that inflation isn't the threat it was comes with its own dangers. The rupee is likely to come under further pressure. Sure, the RBI could pair its change in rate outlook with more intervention. This should be restricted to what central banks and finance ministries like to call “smoothing” — not standing totally against the market, but watching that things don't get out of hand. To be more aggressive would risk looking like authorities are conflicted, recognizing the need for easier money, but unwilling to embrace the full implications.And there's more ailing the rupee than the rate picture. Malhotra recently said that securing a good trade deal with the US would bring money back to India's currency. The US currently levies 50% tariffs on Indian exports, the harshest among Asian nations. Assuming an accord is reached sooner or later, the definition of “good” will be in the eye of the beholder. Southeast Asian nations, for example, got a reduced levy, but agreed to certain American priorities, some aimed at constraining China. Whatever agreement Prime Minister Narendra Modi hatches with US President Donald Trump has to be sold domestically. It could be messy.The RBI can't control this. It can, however, attend to matters on its own patch. Acknowledging the inflation miss is part of that. Doing something about the problem, and adjusting mindsets to avoid repeating it, is critical. December's meeting is shaping up as eventful. In that, there should be little mystery.

Lauren Underwood warns Chicago immigration crackdown not over as ICE plans major staff expansion","text":"Republican President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area may have ebbed in recent weeks, but U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood cautioned Monday against assuming the effort is over after she was granted special access to the federal government’s controversial immigration processing center in west suburban Broadview.\n\nOpponents of Operation Midway Blitz, the chaotic and at times violent joint deportation mission carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol, were heartened by this month’s departure of controversial Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino. But Underwood, the top Democrat on the congressional subcommittee that oversees the budgets for ICE, Border Patrol and other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters the officials she spoke with Monday “have not received any instruction around an end date.”\n\nIn fact, Underwood said, ICE is looking to “probably triple” the size of the staff at its Broadview processing center and Chicago field office “by January.” The agency also is “pursuing contracts for temporary office space,” she said.\n\nPointing to $150 billion allocated to ICE in the spending package Trump muscled through Congress over the summer, Underwood said that even if another government shutdown occurs early next year when the current funding deal runs out, the agency would “be able to hire and bring in these temporary structures to continue to grow immigration enforcement across our community.”\n\nUnderwood’s tour of the Broadview processing facility, which has been the epicenter of local protests over the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration policies and the subject of an ongoing federal lawsuit over the conditions inside, came after months of similar access requests from Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation were denied. The four-term lawmaker from Naperville said she was the first member of Congress in “several years” to get a look inside the facility.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed in federal court last month described the two-story brick building on an industrial side street as a “black box,” where those taken into custody have been cut off from most outside contact and kept in dirty and unsafe conditions. After a judge earlier this month ordered Homeland Security to improve conditions, the number of people being held there dropped substantially, the Tribune reported last week.\n\nBy the time Underwood arrived late Monday morning, no one was being held at the facility, with only a small contingent of security guards and the three ICE officials who conducted the tour present, she said. Underwood was told that the last person processed at the facility was overnight before she arrived, she said.\n\nThe congresswoman said she was told the facility was nearly empty because “they were updating their security systems and installing new security cameras.”\n\nICE did not respond Monday to questions about Underwood’s visit or her description of the agency’s future plans.\n\nTrying to conduct proper oversight with little staff present and no one being held at the facility was “challenging,” Underwood said.\n\nNevertheless, Underwood said she saw only three showers and eight cots available in a facility that at times has held more than 100 people. The facility has no vendor providing food service, with meals purchased from sandwich shops and big-box retailers, she said, and there likewise is no one under contract to provide medical care.\n\n“They had one package of Huggies, they had some sanitary pads for menstruating women, and they had foot powder,” Underwood said.\n\nThe Monday tour, led by Sam Olson, outgoing director of ICE’s Chicago field office, was arranged through Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s office, Underwood said.\n\nWhile the congresswoman intends to return to Broadview and has requested a tour of all other Homeland Security facilities in Illinois, the department only committed to Monday’s visit, she said.\n\n“The way that immigrants and U.S. citizens have been treated here is unacceptable, and it doesn’t make us more safe,” Underwood said.\n\nDespite her position on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Underwood said Monday that she did not know what Operation Midway Blitz has cost taxpayers to date.\n\nUnderwood’s visit came on the same day new data was released detailing the federal government’s immigration enforcement actions nationwide over the past two months, the first update since before the record 43-day shutdown that ended Nov. 13.\n\nAs of Nov. 16, ICE was detaining 65,135 people, an increase of nearly 5,400 from Sept. 21, the last day of available data prior to the shutdown, according to an analysis from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC. Among that net increase in detainees, 97% had no criminal conviction, not even a minor traffic offense, indicating that “during the government shutdown, increasingly ICE targeted individuals with no criminal history,” according to the analysis.\n\nIn addition, “despite the enormous increase in the resources and government personnel devoted” to immigrant removal operations, there has been only a 7% increase in deportations since Trump took office compared with the last full year of President Joe Biden’s administration, the analysis showed.\n\n“The Trump administration continues to conceal most concrete details about its immigration enforcement activities — both on the level of resources the government is devoting to this effort as well as who it is targeting and has actually removed,” TRAC said in a report released Monday.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/24/rep-lauren-underwood-broadview-visit/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-underwood-broadview004_249383928-e1764025495494.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:34:57","author":"Dan Petrella","authors":["Dan Petrella"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":381891512,"title":"US pressed Ukraine to accept deal at Geneva talks, official says","text":"The United States pressed Ukraine to accept its proposals to end the war with Russia during talks in Geneva, a senior official told AFP, despite Kyiv's protests that the plan conceded too much to Moscow.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not directly threaten to cut off aid if Kyiv rejected its proposals, but that Ukraine understood this was a distinct possibility.\n\nThe US plan, originally made up of 28 points, would see Ukraine effectively cede its eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions to Russia and slash the size of its military -- demands that Kyiv has described as unacceptable.\n\nWhile negotiators wrangled to find a way out of the war, early Tuesday, powerful explosions rocked Kyiv, and the air force warned of a countrywide threat of missiles.\n\nIn Switzerland on Sunday, Ukrainian, US and European officials met to draft an \"updated\" version of the plan to end the war, but the Kremlin responded Monday that it would not accept European amendments.\n\nAlthough US pressure on Ukraine eased during the meeting in Geneva, \"overall pressure\" remained, a senior official briefed on the talks said.\n\nThe source said they did not understand why Washington was hurrying towards a deal, but that \"everyone\" was for an end to the war if there was a real opportunity to do so.\n\nThe White House pushed back on criticism that President Donald Trump was favouring Russia in his efforts to end the war.\n\n\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nKyiv and its European allies say the war, the largest and deadliest on European soil since World War II, is an unprovoked and illegal land grab that has resulted in a tidal wave of violence and destruction.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians and military personnel have been killed since the invasion began, while millions of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes.\n\n- 'Critical moment' -\n\nTrump initially gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky until Thursday to respond to the first version of the plan.\n\nBut German Chancellor Friedrich Merz threw doubt on Trump's deadline, saying at an EU-Africa summit in Angola that discussions would be a \"lengthy, long-lasting process\".\n\nA new version of a draft worked on in Geneva has not been published but all sides agreed that any deal must \"uphold Ukraine's sovereignty.\"\n\nCountries supporting Kyiv -- part of the \"coalition of the willing\" -- are due to hold a video call Tuesday following the Geneva talks.\n\nZelensky said his country was at a \"critical moment\", after last week warning Ukraine risked losing either its \"dignity\" or Washington as an ally.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin had welcomed the original US plan, saying it could be a basis for a deal.\n\nBut in Ukraine's southern city of Zaporizhzhia, residents balked at the idea of ceding land to Russia.\n\n\"We cannot give up any territory.

The assassination attempts on Trump's life and the murder of TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk have sparked a national conversation about whether accusing one’s political opponent of extremism is contributing to a dangerous political environment. The friendly meeting between the two elected leaders made headlines for being surprisingly chummy after months of wary rhetoric from both. In one viral moment, Trump gracefully shrugged off a reporter asking Mamdani about his past comments of Trump being a fascist, saying he doesn’t care. Charlamagne argued in the \"Donkey of the Day\" segment of Monday’s episode of the \"Breakfast Club\" that the Trump-Mamdani meeting proved such accusations are overused and hypocritical. CHARLAMAGNE TELLS VAN JONES TO 'SHUT THE F UP FOREVER' AFTER CALLING MAMDANI’S VICTORY SPEECH DIVISIVE \"I don't want to hear any politicians call each other ‘fascists,’ ‘authoritarians,’ ‘wannabe dictators,’ ‘communists,’ none of that kind of rhetoric anymore. It's all dead. Because if you call someone that, and then turn around and say, ‘But I'm willing to work with them,’ it looks hypocritical,\" he said. Charlamagne also reacted to Mamdani’s interview on the following Sunday, when he told NBC host Kristen Welker on \"Meet the Press\" that he still believes Trump is a fascist, but even so, was willing to work with him. \"So, if Zohran truly believes Trump is a fascist, then working with him makes zero sense, but this is my issue. He doesn't fully believe Trump is a fascist, just like Trump doesn't fully believe Mamdani is a communist. It's all political theater,\" Charlamagne said. Charlamagne argued that while such rhetoric is irresponsible on its own, it leaves the voters divided. \"You know who it hurts the most? Us!\" Charlamagne said. \"You done told your aunt and three of your cousins, ‘F you, you [are] not invited to Thanksgiving this year’ because of who they supported politically. Meanwhile, the people we supported politically are willing to support each other. If Zohran and Trump can be in the White House smiling at each other and excessively touching on each other, then you and your family can enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together. Okay?\" ZOHRAN MAMDANI SAYS HE WILL DISCOURAGE 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA' PHRASE He warned, \"Listen, to all elected officials, if you call somebody a ‘fascist’ or ‘communist,’ but then sit down and work with them like everything is normal, you make those words meaningless. Alright? It's dangerous to do that. It's dangerous to weaken those terms, and it confuses the public!\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"The friendly Trump-Mamdani meeting proves fascist and communist accusations are meaningless political theater that divides families, says Charlamagne tha God.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/charlamagne-says-chummy-trump-mamdani-meeting-shows-all-fascist-communist-accusations-political-theater","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/CTG5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:13:45","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":381888164,"title":"US to tap government data for AI innovation platform","text":"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to launch a government-wide effort to build an integrated artificial intelligence platform to harness federal scientific datasets to train next-generation technologies.

Signed by Trump on Nov. 19, 2025, the law requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all unclassified records, communications and investigative materials related to Epstein within 30 days. The order allows limited redactions for victim privacy or to protect active investigations, but those must be narrowly tailored and justified in the Federal Register. The department asked the court to expedite the unsealing of grand jury transcripts and exhibits and to modify orders that block public release of discovery materials. TRUMP CALLS ON HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES: 'WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE' It argued that Congress explicitly authorized disclosure under the law, overriding the secrecy of grand jury proceedings outlined in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The law, the DOJ said, also supersedes earlier court rulings that denied unsealing. The judge in the Maxwell case set a briefing schedule Monday, ordering Maxwell to file her position by Dec. 3. He also directed prosecutors to notify victims, who may submit letters to the court by the same date. The government has until Dec. 10 to respond, and the judge will rule afterward, though he has not set a specific date. The judge has acknowledged the law’s 30-day release deadline for Bondi. REPS. MASSIE, KHANNA SOUND OFF ON WHETHER GHISLAINE MAXWELL SHOULD RECEIVE PARDON, BLAST MIKE JOHNSON The House voted 421-1 last Tuesday to release the files after months of pressure from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., cast the lone \"no\" vote, saying the bill \"reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., supported the measure but voiced similar concerns. The Senate passed the bill hours later by unanimous consent. Trump signed the law amid renewed scrutiny of his past association with Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI said in July they would not unseal related materials, citing the case’s closure. KHANNA, MASSIE, GREENE URGE SENATE TO PASS EPSTEIN BILL UNCHANGED, WARN OF ‘RECKONING’ The law directs the department to release all unclassified records related to Epstein and Maxwell, as well as files referencing individuals in Epstein’s prior cases, trafficking allegations, internal communications and details about his death. Files containing victims’ names, child sexual abuse material, classified content or information that could affect active investigations may be withheld or redacted. Bondi said Wednesday she would comply with the law, which requires the department to post the files online in a searchable format within 30 days. VIRGINIA GIUFFRE'S MEMOIR RECOUNTS RAPE BY FORMER PRIME MINISTER; EPSTEIN'S TIES TO BILL CLINTON, TRUMP The release has drawn strong interest from Trump supporters who have urged the department to disclose Epstein’s alleged \"client list\" and details of his death. While the documents are authentic, Epstein’s statements in the emails remain unverified. They do not allege wrongdoing by Trump and only reference him in passing. Trump has not been formally accused of misconduct related to Epstein, and no law enforcement records link him to Epstein’s crimes.

Maxwell was later convicted of similar offenses and is serving a 20-year sentence.

She also stressed that the end goal is always to put Americans in those jobs.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt laid out the administration's position during a briefing where she described Trump's stance on H-1B visas as common sense.\"The President does not support American workers being replaced,\" she said. \"He wants to see the American manufacturing industry revitalised better than ever before. That's part of what he's doing with his effective use of tariffs and good trade deals around the world.\".preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;} Leavitt said Trump's approach balances the economy with practical realities facing companies building advanced manufacturing plants.\"If foreign companies are investing trillions of dollars in the United States and bringing in foreign workers to create niche products like batteries, he wants to see that at the beginning to get those manufacturing facilities up and running,\" she said.But once production stabilises, Leavitt said Trump expects those companies to transition to an American workforce.\"Ultimately, the President always wants to see American workers in those jobs,\" she said. \"He's told these foreign companies that if you're going to be doing business in the United States, you better be hiring my people,\" Leavitt added.Trump has repeatedly targeted the H-1B visa system, which allows US companies to hire skilled foreign workers, for criticism from his \"America First\" base. While he has publicly defended the programme’s value in certain contexts, he also blamed it for undercutting American wages and reducing jobs for US workers.The White House confirmed a sharp crackdown with proposed changes, including a $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions and tighter vetting to \"stop abuses of the system and protect American jobs\".TRUMP BACKS FOREIGN WORKERSHowever, the US President recently signalled support for the H-1B visa programme, widely used by Indian tech professionals, saying the US needs global talent to fill gaps in its own workforce.In a Fox News interview recently, Trump was pressed on whether his administration would keep H-1B visas flowing despite criticism that they can undercut American wages. Trump didn't hesitate, indicating he was open to the programme and arguing the country must stay competitive by attracting skilled workers.When the interviewer intervened and said, \"We have plenty of talented workers,\" the President quickly shot back, \"No, you don't. You don't have certain talents. People have to learn. You can't take people off an unemployment line and say, 'I'm going to put you into a factory where we're going to make missiles.\"He also praised foreign students, saying they are important for business.

The decision came after the court ruled that president Donald Trump’s appointment of interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan in Virginia was invalid.Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, in her order, wrote that the attorney general’s attempt to install Halligan as the interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia “was invalid,” and that all actions taken under her “defective appointment”, including the indictments, were unlawful.Letitia James welcomed the decision, saying, “I am heartened by today’s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,” she said. “I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.”Comey responded in an Instagram video, saying, “I’m grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence and a reflection of what the department of justice has become under Donald Trump, which is heartbreaking.” The White House said the justice department will appeal the ruling. Attorney general Pam Bondi repeated this at a press conference, saying the government would take “all available legal action” to hold Comey and James accountable. Currie explained that only judges of the eastern district of Virginia can appoint a temporary US attorney until the Senate confirms a nominee. Halligan, a former White House adviser, had taken over after the Trump administration pushed out her predecessor. Defence lawyers argued that the 120-day limit for interim appointments had already expired when she stepped in, making her appointment unlawful. Currie agreed, saying the government cannot bypass Senate confirmation by repeatedly installing short-term appointees.The judge also noted that accepting the government’s argument would allow officials to send “any private citizen off the street” to lead a grand jury, as long as the attorney general approved it later, something she said “cannot be the law.”Comey had been accused of passing information to reporters through his lawyer in 2017 and of giving false statements to Congress. James faced charges of making false statements to a financial institution and bank fraud, which she also denied. Trump has repeatedly demanded prosecutions of Comey, James, and other critics. In one Truth Social post, he wrote that they were “guilty as hell,” though the justice department argued these posts were opinions, not directives.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/court-quashes-comey-and-letitia-james-cases-trumps-interim-attorney-pick-ruled-invalid-white-house-to-appeal/articleshow/125552627.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125552634/125552634.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:06:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":381887966,"title":"Zelenskyy visit to Ireland up in the air as Trump's peace deal deadline looms","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

He addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2022 and earlier this year the Taoiseach met the president in Shannon on a stop-over.\n\nIreland has offered non-lethal military support to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in 2022, with the Taoiseach reiterating that Ireland is militarily neutral, but not politically neutral when it comes to the Russian invasion.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nEurope's proposed peace plan for Ukraine 'doesn't suit us', Kremlin says\n\nZelenskyy welcomes 'strong' US and EU sanctions targeting Russian energy\n\nTrump denies Zelenskyy US long-range missiles, says Putin wants to end war\n\nUkrainians in Ireland\n\nA total of 119,043 PPS numbers have been issued to beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine. \n\nOf the 83,594 individuals which showed recent activity in administrative data, women and men aged 20 years and over made up 45% and 27% respectively of arrivals, while 28% were people aged under 20 years.\n\nOf all arrivals, 17,282 beneficiaries of temporary protection from Ukraine have enrolled in schools in the academic year 2025/26, with 59% of these in primary schools and the remaining 41% in secondary schools.\n\nThere has been a recent increase in people arriving in Ireland due to a change in Ukrainian policy allowing young men aged 18 to 22 to leave the country.

And now look, believe it or not, I have quite a few Trumper friends.”\n\n “I even have friends that didn't vote, they didn't like either candidate,” she continues. “But I think it's important to be around people that do have different opinions and we get along. So there's an understanding. And then there are some Trumpers that find me very triggering because of the Trump head picture. So I still am confronted about that photo to this day and complimented about that photo. But I get both.”\n\n Still, the Emmy winner, who was honored at the event as Advocate of the Year, says she feels it is necessary to be outspoken about what she believes in, including being an ally to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n “I think a lot of people are fearful, and I am fearless,” Griffin says. “I'm trying to get a little fear. I don't have any. If you have any, I'd love some because this fearless thing is kind of scary sometimes. But like I said, whether it's a court case or marching, organizing or mobilizing, it's important to have our voices heard.”\n\n “This administration is really coming for the LGBT community and everything, from making conversion therapy legal again, which as a comic was a joke in my act,” Griffin adds. “The idea that you think that could work is — it was something to laugh at — now it's real.

It announced Monday that it was permanently shutting down, claiming it had fulfilled its mission. \"We have succeeded in our mission of showing there's a better way to deliver aid to Gazans,\" GHF director John Acree said in a statement.\n\nThe operations of the GHF were shrouded in secrecy during its short time in operation. Launched with U.S. and Israeli backing as an alternative to the United Nations, the group never revealed its sources of funding and little about the armed contractors who operated the sites.\n\nIt said its goal was to deliver aid to Gaza without it being diverted by Hamas.\n\nRisking life to get aid\n\nPalestinians, aid workers and health officials have said the system forced aid-seekers to risk their lives to reach the sites by passing Israeli troops who secured the locations. Soldiers often opened fire, killing hundreds, according to witnesses and videos posted to social media. The Israeli military says it only fired warning shots as a crowd-control measure or if its troops were in danger.\n\nGHF said there was no violence at the aid sites themselves but acknowledged the potential dangers people faced when travelling to them on foot. However, contractors working at the sites, backed by video accounts, said the American security guards fired live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scrambled for food.\n\nAcree said that GHF would hand off its work to the U.S.-led centre in Israel overseeing the Gaza ceasefire, called the Civil-Military Coordination Center.\n\n\"GHF has been in talks with CMCC and international organizations now for weeks about the way forward and it's clear they will be adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted,\" he said.\n\nTommy Piggott, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on the social media platform X that GHF had \"shared valuable lessons learned with us and our partners.\"\n\nUN opposed GHF\n\nGHF began operating in late May, after Israel had halted food deliveries to Gaza for three months, pushing the population toward famine.\n\nIsrael intended for the private contractor group to replace the UN food distribution system, claiming Hamas was diverting large amounts of aid. The UN denied the claims.\n\nThe UN had opposed the creation of GHF, saying the system gave Israel control over food distribution and could force the displacement of Palestinians. Throughout the war, the UN led a massive humanitarian effort with other aid groups, distributing food, medicine, fuel and other supplies at hundreds of centres around Gaza.\n\nIn the release, GHF said it had delivered more than three million food boxes to Gaza, totalling 187 million meals.\n\nRemains of hostage located\n\nMeantime, the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said in a statement later on Monday that it had located the body of a hostage in an area controlled by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip. It did not say when the handover would take place.\n\nThe hostage's body is one of three still in Gaza.\n\nHamas and Israel signed a truce on Oct. 9, halting two years of devastating warfare. But the agreement left the most intractable disputes for further talks, freezing the conflict without resolving it.\n\nAs part of the deal, Hamas released all 20 surviving hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and wartime detainees held by Israel.\n\nThe agreement also provided for the return of the remains of 28 hostages in exchange for the remains of 360 militants. Both sides have, since the deal, accused each other of deadly breaches of existing commitments in the agreement and of pushing back against later steps required by U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza. \n\nThe war began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. \n\nSince then, over 69,700 Palestinians have been killed and over 170,800 injured, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nThe ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.","summary":"The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, set up to distribute aid to Gaza as an alternative to the United Nations — but which Palestinians said endangered the lives of civilians as they tried to get food — said Monday it would shutter operations.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gaza-humanitarian-foundation-operations-cease-aid-hostage-israel-hamas-9.6991005?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/ais/d4fed34c-df77-427d-961b-714fdd14d529,1764026525420/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C410%2C5500%2C3093%29%3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:04:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":381880570,"title":"Trump orders blacklisting Muslim Brotherhood branches as ‘terrorist’ groups  - Jamaica Inquirer – Daily","text":"Washington, DC – United States President Donald Trump has ordered his aides to start a process to label the branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Lebanon and Jordan as “terrorist” organisations, citing their alleged support for the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nTrump issued the decree on Monday as Washington intensified its crackdown on Israel’s foes in the region.\n\nThe decree accused Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Jordan of providing “material support” to Hamas and the Lebanese branch of the group – known as al-Jamaa al-Islamiya – of siding with Hamas and Hezbollah in their war with Israel.\n\nIt also claimed that an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader “called for violent attacks against United States partners and interests” during Israel’s war on Gaza. But it was not clear what the White House was referring to. The Muslim Brotherhood has been banned in Egypt and mostly driven underground.\n\n“President Trump is confronting the Muslim Brotherhood’s transnational network, which fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against US interests and allies in the Middle East,” the White House said.\n\nTrump’s order directs the secretary of state and the treasury secretary to consult with the US intelligence chief and produce a report on the designation within 30 days.\n\nA formal “foreign terrorist organisation” label would then officially apply to the Muslim Brotherhood branches within 45 days after the report.\n\nThe process is usually a formality, and the designation may come sooner. The decree also opens the door to blacklisting other Muslim Brotherhood branches.\n\nThe White House is also pushing to label the groups as “designated global terrorists”.\n\nThe designations would make it illegal to provide material support to the group. It would also mostly ban their current and former members from entering the US, and enable economic sanctions to choke their revenue streams.\n\nEstablished in 1928 by Egyptian Muslim scholar Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood has offshoots and branches across the Middle East in the shape of political parties and social organisations.\n\nAcross the Middle East, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties take part in elections and say they are committed to peaceful political participation.\n\nBut the group has been outlawed by several countries across the region.\n\nBlacklisting the Muslim Brotherhood has been a longstanding demand for right-wing activists in the US.\n\nBut critics say that the move could further enable authoritarianism and the crackdown on free political expression in the Middle East.\n\nThe decree could also be used to target Muslim American activists on allegations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood or contributions to charities affiliated with the group.\n\nRight-wing groups have long pushed to outlaw Muslim American groups with unfounded accusations of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nNihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said the designation should not have an impact on Muslim American advocacy groups and charities.\n\n“The American Muslim organisations are solid,” Awad told Al Jazeera. “They are based in the US. The relief organisations serve millions of people abroad. I hope that this will not impact their work.”\n\nBut he noted that anti-Muslim activists have been trying to promote “the conspiracy theory that every Muslim organisation in the US is a front to the Muslim Brotherhood”.\n\nRecently, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott designated both the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations”.\n\nCAIR has sued the governor’s office in response.","url":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/trump-orders-blacklisting-muslim-brotherhood-branches-as-terrorist-groups/","image":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-22T170417Z_924680305_RC2R1IAYKGWL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1764024330-kk3QnP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:02:49","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"jm","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":381885944,"title":"Starmer to host call with Ukraine’s coalition of the willing allies","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is set to speak to Ukraine’s European allies on Tuesday following the latest talks to secure peace in the war-torn nation.\n\nThe Prime Minister will host a coalition of the willing call after efforts over the weekend between the US and Kyiv to broker a truce with Moscow.\n\nSir Keir and other western leaders had pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s original 28-point peace plan ahead of the talks in Geneva, Switzerland, raising concerns about the prospect of a cap on Ukraine’s armed forces and land being ceded to Russia.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested after the talks ended there were fewer demands of his nation in the revised peace plan than in the original proposal.\n\nWriting on messenger app Telegram, he said: “Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable.

But you know who is probably having a worse day? President Donald Trump. \n\nHalligan’s indictments against both former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James just got tossed. The sham investigation into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff is also disintegrating into a gossipy mess. \n\nThe mortgage fraud allegations against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook are problematic, as several Trump administration officials have the same arrangements that are ostensibly so fraud-sy for Cook. \n\nHow dare so many people stand in the way of Trump’s desire to wreak vengeance??\n\nThe defeat that has to sting the most right now is seeing Halligan, Trump’s handpicked interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Nevada, absolutely crash and burn. \n\nFam, is it good when 100% of the cases you brought are dismissed, and you also learn you are not legally in your job and never have been? Honestly, it makes U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro’s cavalcade of no-bills and trial losses look positively minor by comparison.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Cameron McGowan Currie, who was hearing both Comey’s and James’ challenges to Halligan’s appointment, found that Halligan’s appointment violated both 28 U.S.C. § 546, which specifically covers the attorney general’s power to fill vacancies, and the Appointments Clause. \n\nSo what does this mean for our favorite insurance lawyer/Smithsonian DEI cop/Interim U.S. attorney for retribution for the Eastern District of Virginia?\n\nWell, first, she can no longer put interim U.S. attorney on her resume, as the ruling says she was never in her job legally, not even from day one. And what flows from that, of course, is that the indictments she secured while flying completely solo are out. \n\nGoodbye, indictment of James Comey. Goodbye indictment of Letitia James. Currie was basically able to cut and paste the order dismissing Comey’s indictment into the order dismissing James’. \n\nThe reason Halligan is not legally in her job is similar to the reasons that three other Trump interim picks—Alina Habba, Sigal Chattah, and Bill Essayli—are not. All of these people were named as interim or acting U.S. attorneys, so Trump doesn’t have to try to secure Senate confirmation for this passel of pliable nitwits. The courts keep finding that all these appointment shenanigans do not add up to being an actual U.S. attorney.\n\nBut Halligan was the only one specifically tasked with delivering Trump’s retribution, so this one no doubt really stings.\n\nCurrie found that since Halligan’s installation violated the Appointments Clause, the only remedy is to dismiss the indictment, as she wasn’t an attorney authorized by law to conduct grand jury proceedings when she did. And since she was flying solo on those, there’s no way to save the indictments by arguing that some other eligible attorney presented and signed them as well.\n\nThe judge apparently did not buy Attorney General Pam Bondi’s argument that she could somehow magically ratify Halligan’s indictments by reviewing Halligan’s grand jury testimony and deciding it was dandy. The problem with that approach was that the government didn’t yet have the complete transcription at the time Bondi was bragging about having read it all. \n\nUnfortunately, the judge dismissed both Comey’s and James’ indictments without prejudice, which means the government could theoretically bring new charges. However, it isn’t at all clear what happens with Comey’s indictment, as the statute of limitations has already run out. \n\nYou can expect appeals. You can expect howling from Trump and Bondi. You can expect some sort of attempt to refile both of these. You can expect an attempt to have the Cool Big Friends at the Supreme Court fix this, but it’s not clear that even this court would step into this mess.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump and Bondi are going to have to figure out how to salvage the investigation into Schiff, which is currently way, way off the rails. Christine Bish, a full MAGA activist in California, seems to have gone rogue. Bish has been bragging on social media about how she wrote the “report” that led to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte referring Schiff to the DOJ for criminal charges. \n\nBut now prosecutors are investigating Bish to determine whether Pulte and jack-of-all-bad-trades Ed Martin used improper tactics in their investigation of Schiff and whether the criminal investigation was revealed to unauthorized people.\n\nThings aren’t as tacky in the Cook case, but things are equally shambolic. Trump and his minions targeted Cook with the same sort of vague mortgage fraud allegations. Too bad that multiple high-level Trump appointees have the same arrangements, including Pulte’s father and stepmother who managed to save themselves $158,000 in taxes in 2025 alone. \n\nMuch like Halligan having learned that securing an indictment doesn’t somehow magically mean that Comey and James would have to go to jail immediately, Trump seems to be learning that howling for revenge doesn’t carry the day either. \n\nGetting a criminal conviction in these situations is hard work, and no one in the administration is cut out for it. That doesn’t mean they’ll stop trying, but it might mean they keep failing.","summary":"Lindsey Halligan is not having a great day. But you know who is probably having a worse day? President Donald Trump. \n\n\n\nHalligan’s indictments against both former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James just got tossed. The sham investigation into California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff is also disintegrating into a gossipy mess. \n\n\n\n\nSo much for New York Attorney General Letitia James’ indictment. \n\n\nThe mortgage fraud allegations against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook are problematic, as several Trump administration officials have the same arrangements that are ostensibly so fraud-sy for Cook. \n\n\n\nHow dare so many people stand in the way of Trump’s desire to wreak vengeance??\n\n\n\nThe defeat that has to sting the most right now is seeing Halligan, Trump’s handpicked interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Nevada, absolutely crash and burn. \n\n\n\nFam, is it good when 100% of the cases you brought are dismissed, and you also learn you are not legally in your job and neve","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/11/24/2355386/-Trump-s-retribution-tour-hits-another-snag?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1472693/story_image/AP25031757969870.jpg?1756497892","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:00:10","author":"Lisa Needham","authors":["Lisa Needham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.337},{"id":381890884,"title":"Pioneer in short","text":"Trump, Xi discuss trade, Taiwan\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Monday to discuss trade, Taiwan, and the Ukraine crisis, nearly a month after their Busan summit. Xi emphasised that Taiwan’s return to China is “an integral part of the post-war international order” and highlighted the shared history of US-China cooperation during World War II.

The plan thus crossed several long-standing Ukrainian red lines, drawing criticism from Ukraine and across Europe, according to reports.\n\n Representatives from the United States, Ukraine and European countries met in Geneva on Sunday as the White House pushed for agreement on the 28-point plan.\n\n Following a meeting between the Ukrainian delegation and national security advisers from Britain, France and Germany, the Ukrainian side held bilateral talks with the U.S. representatives.\n\n It's reported that Sunday's Geneva meeting was attended on the U.S. side by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll, with Zelensky's office chief Andriy Yermak leading the Ukrainian delegation.\n\n According to a joint statement issued by the White House on Sunday night, the talks between U.S. representatives and Ukrainian officials in Geneva made \"meaningful progress toward aligning positions.\"\n\n The Kremlin said it has not received official details from Geneva and does not plan talks with U.S. officials this week, according to a Newsweek report.\n\n Trump has set Thursday as the deadline for reaching an understanding with Kiev on the framework, while suggesting that talks could continue beyond that date if progress is being made.","url":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/worldwide/46411/US-Ukraine-narrow-28-point-peace-plan-to-19-points","image":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2025/11/25/image-46411-1764027223.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-25 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.386}]}
