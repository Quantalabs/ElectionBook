Sky News’ Sharri Markson revealed the footage on Monday night, which showsMr Rudd speaking in a webinar with Dr Shashi Tharoor, an Indian politician and former diplomat.\n\n“The United States, in the past four years, has been run by a village idiot,” Mr Rudd said in the unearthed footage.\n\n“People have seen China continuing to be competent in its national statecraft and the United States increasingly incompetent in its national statecraft under Trump.”\n\nAt a press conference in Tasmania, the Prime Minister smacked down calls to sack his former Labor colleague. \n\nWhen asked whether Mr Rudd was the “right person” to continue as Ambassador to the US, Mr Albanese responded: “Yes.” \n\nMr Albanese also rubbished opposition foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham’s calls for the PM to seek a meeting with Mr Trump in Florida at the end of a scheduled G20 summit in Brazil next week.\n\n“If you have a look at the map, it’s actually not on the way,” Mr Albanese told reporters.\n\n“Simon Birmingham does two things. One, he says I do too many trips. And secondly, he says I should do more.\n\n“Simon Birmingham is someone who never has much constructive to say at all. I had a really constructive discussion with President-elect Trump last week. It was a very good beginning to our relationship.\n\n“We support trade and I know that the US has a trade surplus with Australia. \n\n“It is in the United States’ interest and also Australia’s interest for there to continue to be trade between our two great nations and I’m confident that that will continue to occur.”\n\nLiberal leader Peter Dutton is urging the Albanese Government “read the room” after the US election and work “with and not against our most important ally”.\n\n“When we were in government we were able to negotiate with the Trump administration and exemption from tariffs that were being applied at that time,” he said.\n\n“The onus will be on the prime minister to negotiate a similar outcome with the Trump administration and that will be a question for him as to whether or not they are able to craft that.\n\n“But I think it is obvious America has charted a different course now and the government here needs to course correct and make sure they are working with and not against our most important ally. The prime minister says that we live in the most precarious period since the Second World War, but we need to have a very strong and trusted relationship with our Five Eyes partners including the United States.”\n\nMr Dutton said the clear message of the US election is that “families in the US are hurting under higher inflation and unsurprisingly, that is exactly what is happening in our country”.\n\n“Secondly, incumbent governments that do not read the room and do not understand the priorities that people have will be punished for it,” he said.\n\n“And the Albanese government has got themselves into all sorts of problems and a muddle at the moment because they have made bad decisions early in this term.” \n\nPrior to his appointment as Australia’s ambassador to the United States, Mr Rudd also described Mr Trump as a “political liability”, a “problem for the world” and a “traitor to the west”.\n\nIn June 2021, Mr Rudd mocked Mr Trump’s distinctive style with a Mar-a-Lago joke during a speech at the Harvard Asia Centre and quipping he could add it as a subtitle to a 2015 paper he authored on US-China relations.\n\n“I hope to publish again soon, hopefully early next year. The future of US China relations under President Trump and the subtitle will be a call for a new tremendous piece of very big, beautiful Mar-a-Lago chocolate cake,” Mr Rudd joked to applause from the Harvard Asia Centre crowd.\n\n“That’s the working title. Any other suggestions, I’ll greatly receive. But I think it’s innovative and tasty. Tremendously tasty.”\n\nMr Rudd also attended a political science webinar at Duke University in 2022 and described the president-elect as “incoherent” and occasionally “in love with dictators”.\n\n“Donald Trump had a habit of wanting to shred most of the allies in terms of their political standing and cause doubted uncertainty as to whether he’d actually have their back if a crisis emerged,” he said.\n\n“But the underpinnings of (the trans-Pacific Partnership) was still incoherent because Trump himself was incoherent, and he waxed and waned from being in love with dictators to not knowing what he wanted from dictators.”\n\nAt an address to the Oxford Union in 2017, Rudd said of then-President Trump he was a “problem” for Australia and the world.\n\n“Trump at present represents a political liability for both sides of Australian politics,” Mr Rudd said.\n\n“This guy is a problem. He is an objective problem, for the world, for the region, for my country.”\n\nLast week it was revealed that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who appointed Mr Rudd to the Washington post, had previously been caught on tape saying that Mr Trump’s presidency “scared the sh*t out of me”.\n\n“We have an alliance with the US, we’ve got to deal with him, but that doesn’t mean that you’re uncritical about it,” Mr Albanese said in 2017.\n\n“He scares the sh*t out of me, and I think it’s of some concern the leader of the free world thinks that you can conduct politics through 140 characters on Twitter overnight.”\n\nMr Trump was previously asked about Mr Rudd’s comments in a British TV interview in March, suggesting that the former Australian PM turned diplomat was “not the brightest bulb” and “nasty”.\n\n“He won’t be there long if that’s the case,” Mr Trump said.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News Australia days before the election, the President-elect’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who also serves as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, suggest it was “hard” to keep someone in a diplomatic position who had said “such nasty things about a person”.\n\n“I do think it would be nice to have a person who appreciates all that Donald Trump has gone through to want to serve our country at this moment.”","summary":"Anthony Albanese has rejected calls to fire Kevin Rudd, after revelations he previously called the US President-elect a “village idiot”.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/unearthed-footage-shows-kevin-rudd-calling-donald-trump-a-village-idiot/news-story/e11e2acc6e3415267a8f38e4a34e1b66?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d6557af226f8224f885b2b86bd6c676b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 01:07:40","author":"Samantha Maiden","authors":["Samantha Maiden"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":264187410,"title":"Arizona GOP Rep.

Juan Ciscomani has won the rematch with Democrat Kirsten Engel for Arizona’s 6th Congressional District, 49.5% to 48.2%, with 86% of the vote counted, Decision Desk projects.\n\nCiscomani is a freshman Republican who sits on the prestigious Appropriations Committee, as well as Veterans Affairs. He previously worked for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s administration. \n\nEngel teaches law at the University of Arizona and is a former state representative.\n\nCiscomani narrowly defeated Engel in 2022 with 50.7% of the vote — just a 1.4-point margin. The Republican’s victory at the time flipped the seat red with Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick’s retirement. \n\nAs the district is along the southern border, the issue came to the forefront numerous times throughout the race. The Tucson Sector saw more than 463,000 migrant encounters in fiscal year 2024 alone, per US Customs and Border Protection data. \n\nVoter registration in this toss-up district slightly favored Republicans, and it includes parts of Tucson, surrounding suburbs and a significant portion of rural southeastern Arizona. The district sits partially in the more densely populated and bluer Pima County, along with nearby rural counties. \n\nArizona presented relatively strong election results for Republicans, as Rep. David Schweikert also retained his seat, President-Elect Donald Trump won the state’s 11 electoral votes and the state legislature maintained its Republican majorities. However, GOP Senate nominee Kari Lake is projected to lose her race to Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego. \n\nA target of both parties’ campaign committees and other outside groups, this expensive race generated more than $20 million in ad spending, per Open Secrets.\n\nShortly after Decision Desk HQ called Ciscomani’s race, the desk then projected that Republicans would maintain control of the House of Representatives at exactly 218 seats so far. The congressional seat is one of the last few in the nation to be called, as some in California are amongst the last in the country for the results to become clear. The projection comes as chatter looms over Republicans in both chambers about who will lead next, including whether Speaker Mike Johnson will continue to serve in his role.","summary":"PHOENIX — GOP Rep.

Beijing, however, has let Hong Kong move ahead to build up its digital-asset industry.\nIf China was to restore development of its digital-asset market, the country could start with a payment-clearing system based on regulated stablecoins, according to Xiao. A stablecoin is a fixed-price cryptocurrency, with a market value attached to certain fiat currencies including the US dollar or the euro.\n“Stablecoins are currently the best solution for cross-border business-to-consumer trade,” he said, citing fast transaction time and low fees as among the reasons.\nXiao said his team at HashKey recently did a survey at mainland manufacturing and trade hub Yiwu, where it was found that almost all merchants received inquiries from buyers on whether they could make payments using popular US-dollar-based stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC.\n\nXiao’s insights are based on his experience in banking and finance before becoming involved in digital assets. He previously held senior positions at the People’s Bank of China’s Shenzhen branch and the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s Shenzhen office. In 1998, he founded Bosera Asset Management, one of China’s largest fund houses, among various stints in traditional securities.\nHe joined Wanxiang Group Corp in 2011 before establishing the conglomerate’s digital-asset arm HashKey in Hong Kong in 2018. HashKey operates HashKey Exchange, one of the city’s three licensed cryptocurrency exchanges, among other cryptocurrency and blockchain ventures.\nThe company – with businesses covering venture capital, tokenisation and blockchain infrastructure solutions – expects to launch its own blockchain, the HashKey Chain, next month, according to Xiao.\nHashKey has been expanding its operations across Asia and other markets around the world. The company currently has some 300 employees at its Hong Kong headquarters, 50 staff in Singapore and a headcount of 11 in Tokyo. It also has teams in Dubai, Bermuda and Europe, according to Xiao.\nXiao said HashKey is committed to Hong Kong, even as many crypto firms relocate to other jurisdictions including Dubai and Singapore. “Only by staying in Hong Kong can we serve mainland China when that market opens up,” he said. “We firmly believe that day will come.”","summary":"HashKey chairman and CEO Xiao Feng said a number of factors may compel mainland China to open its digital-asset market in about two years.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/blockchain/article/3286069/trumps-crypto-support-may-see-china-restore-digital-asset-market-hashkey-head-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/11/14f165ff-f9a3-46ee-bd8f-1fd4f397b4f5_1f432ec6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 01:00:15","author":"Xinmei Shen","authors":["Xinmei Shen"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.011},{"id":264186726,"title":"Donald v Gary: Why the crypto world is so excited about Trump","text":"The Trump family, incidentally, recently emerged with a 75 per cent stake in a new crypto bank, World Liberty Financial, which describes Trump as “chief crypto advocate.” While it does create an obvious conflict of interest, the crypto sector sees it as a reassuring alignment of interests.\n\nTrump has said (to wild applause from crypto companies) that he will fire Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Gary Gensler on his first day in office.\n\nGensler has likened the sector to the Wild West and has launched more than 100 legal actions against its participants.

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:50 GMT, 12 November 2024 | Updated: 00:52 GMT, 12 November 2024\n\nThe disastrous Kamala Harris campaign suffered from incompetent staff members, consequences of Joe Biden refusing to drop out and lack of intellectual diversity.\n\nIn the week since Donald Trump's dominant victory, Democrats have turned into a circular-firing squad against one another, blaming anyone and everyone for Harris' defeat.\n\n'The campaign has been broken since the beginning,' admitted a Democrat insider. 'I'm amazed that we even got close.'\n\nNot only did their campaign end in disaster, but to add insult to injury the operation is reportedly in debt, Politico reports, to the tune of $20 million dollars.\n\nBiden staff say the vice president ran a terrible, three-month campaign and squandered millions of dollars from their top donors.\n\nThe disastrous Kamala Harris campaign suffered from incompetent staff members, consequences of Joe Biden refusing to drop out and lack of intellectual diversity\n\nBiden staff say the vice president ran a terrible, three-month campaign and squandered millions of dollars from their top donors\n\nAccording to sources within the Harris campaign, many of the major problems were set in motion by Joe Biden's failed attempt to run for a second term from the jump.\n\nMany sources said that Biden not only stayed in the race so long, but did so as an unpopular incumbent, to the point that almost no Democrat could stop Trump from winning.\n\nSources told NOTUS that Biden's re-election camp was filled with people who had little experience because few wanted to either work with the lame duck president or move to his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWorse still, they didn't think Harris could fully comprehend that she was inheriting this same sinking ship with just 100 days before voters went to the polls. \n\n'Kamala did not want to shake things up. She thought that what she could do is install certain people into leadership roles to make sure that she got the campaign that she wanted,' one source claimed. \n\nWhen Harris' people did try to change things, they found stiff resistance from campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who wanted to run an 'insular and micromanaged' campaigned dominated by analytics. \n\n'If you believe that campaigns matter — and if you look at Tammy Baldwin, Jacky Rosen, Ruben Gallego and even Bob Casey in many ways — if you believe that campaigns matter and that's why the results are a little different, then you have to say that she lost because of her campaign,' one anonymous operative said. \n\nDillon also refused any intellectual diversity, only hiring staffers who would back her up.\n\n'There was no one who had a different viewpoint. And anybody who had a different viewpoint was always sidelined.' \n\nThat campaign includes a culture that was troublesome for minority staffers, despite constant worries of appearing too 'woke' in an attempt to appease the far left.\n\nMultiple sources said that black aides had been 'mistreated and demoralized' to the point that some wanted to make formal complaints but did not, over worries it would hurt their careers. \n\nMuch of the staff appeared to have a 'nine-to-five work mentality' in a world where campaigns have to be active at all hours.\n\nOthers worried whether Harris was going too far against the Biden administration, demanding to allow a Palestinian speaker at the DNC amid the war in Gaza following the October 7 terrorist attacks. \n\nSources say the national security team shot it down, which led to huge criticism from left-wing activists and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \n\nHowever, many of the Harris campaign's problems appear to stem from preparation.\n\nWhile much hay was made about how Elon Musk was running Donald Trump's get-out-the-vote operation, Harris had a difficult time getting the team of 90,000 volunteers together.\n\nWhen they did, many were without proper literature or talking points. Worse, over a million yard signs weren't ready to be given out until late October. \n\nOthers wonder if they underestimated rage at the way Trump was able to frame Harris as being an extremist on transgender issues. \n\nTheir data team saw no reason to respond to the infamous 'Kamala is for they/them' commercial.\n\nWhile Harris shares in the blame, many wonder what exactly she could've done with the amount of time she had. \n\n'She wasn't handed much of a campaign infrastructure,' said one aide. 'And it was very difficult for that infrastructure to actually reflect her.'\n\nAs Democrats still try and gather themselves following their loss to Trump earlier this week, Biden and Harris' teams are blaming each other for wasting their cash. \n\nWorkers in the White House and on the campaigns are ruthlessly continuing their blame game as to whether the president or vice president really dropped the ball.\n\nKamala HarrisJoe BidenDemocrats\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nKamala Harris insiders reveal why her campaign was 'broken since the beginning'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The disastrous Kamala Harris campaign suffered from incompetent staff members, consequences of Joe Biden refusing to drop out and lack of intellectual diversity.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14070239/Kamala-Harris-insiders-reveal-campaign-broken-beginning.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/12/00/91954909-0-image-a-6_1731372579895.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:52:55","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Will Crypto Keep Going Up?","text":"The Federal Reserve quarter-point rates cut has strengthened crypto market, but what does FOMC crypto impact mean for Bitcoin FOMC rally?The Fed's FOMC quarter-point rate cut has ignited a speculative wildfire, especially among cryptocurrencies. With a new federal funds rate target nestled between 4.5% and 4.75%, the Fed is aiming to navigate a cooling labor market and mitigate inflation without causing economic shockwaves.Here's what the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting will mean for the future Bitcoin price.FOMC Rate Cut Sparks Crypto Market VolatilityThe air was thick with anticipation as the FOMC's decision approached on Thursday, with Bitcoin recently hitting new highs above $75,0000. Analysts predicted heightened volatility driven by the impending rate cut—seen as a near-certainty at 97.4% by CME Group's FedWatch Tool.The thing is, Bitcoin's price didn't soar as traders hoped, leaving us mired in a stagnant crab market. Instead, most of the crypto gains resulted from Donald Trump's Wednesday morning presidential victory.Everyone's eyes are on Bitcoin's shot at reaching that elusive $100,000. Even though the FOMC turned into a 'sell the news' event, we're primed for a six figure Bitcoin by year's end.Why did this happen? Well, everyone knew the FOMC was going to happen, and it was already priced.Moreover, assets typically stagnate or tank after a presidential election—and this one was only different because Trump is likely to cut taxes and deregulate crypto for developers and traders.Analysts at IBT are eyeing the possibility of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 soon, thanks to a stablecoin market surge. Significant whale activity is also driving Bitcoin's price movements, with two major players scooping up large BTC amounts post-FOMC. These whales, or big-time investors, are key influencers in market trends.Recent data shows that two whales bought 1,910 BTC worth $145.16 million on Binance in the past 24 hours. With patience, things are about to get wild for crypto.Navigating the Crypto Market Amid Rate CutsAs the Fed tweaks interest rates, the crypto market can't dodge the fallout. The spotlight is on Bitcoin, holding its ground and eyeing new peaks. With the economy in flux and big players making calculated moves, Bitcoin's future seems bright, though not without hurdles.The key will be to hold out even if we don't see an immediate pump. Shouldn't be too hard, yeah?Fed moves and Trump's cabinet picks will dictate Bitcoin's price story in the coming months. However, the current setup hints at Bitcoin breaking $100,000 before 2025.","summary":"The Federal Reserve quarter-point rates cut has strengthened crypto market, but what does FOMC crypto impact mean for Bitcoin FOMC rally?","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/what-does-fomc-mean-bitcoin-price-will-crypto-keep-going-3750564","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4560930/federal-reserve.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:41:20","author":"Isaiah McCall","authors":["Isaiah McCall"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":264186324,"title":"How will Democrats handle Trump's Cabinet picks?","text":"How will Democrats handle Trump's Cabinet picks?\n What do Donald Trump's moves so far as president-elect say about his incoming administration?

Since Trump’s victory last week, Musk is about $70 billion richer on paper.\n\nMost of Musk’s wealth is wrapped up in his holdings of Tesla, and in the four trading days since the election, the electric vehicle maker’s stock has soared by about 39%. That’s lifted the company’s market cap well past $1 trillion.\n\nMusk’s net worth has swelled to $320 billion, according to Forbes, putting him close to $90 billion ahead of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the world’s second-richest person. Ellison, a close friend of Musk’s and a former Tesla board member, is a longtime Republican donor who’s seen his own Trump bump, with Oracle’s 10% increase lifting his net worth by about $20 billion.\n\nFor Musk, getting Trump back into the White House became another full-time job. He funded a swing-state operation to register right-leaning voters, and he led rallies as a surrogate for his favored candidate. He started $1 million giveaways to registered voters who signed one of his America PAC petitions, and he faced a lawsuit over running an illegal lottery in Pennsylvania.\n\nMusk also used X, the social media platform he acquired in 2022, to constantly tout his support for Trump while frequently spreading misinformation about his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as topics like immigration and voter fraud.\n\nNow, Musk is trying to make sure he cashes in on his investments. \n\nAfter the election last week, Musk briefly joined Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, NBC News reported. Other outlets, including The New York Times and ABC, have reported that Musk has been weighing in on staffing decisions for the next administration, and he’s spent a lot of time since the election at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and President-elect Donald Trump are far apart.\n\nSo it was surprising that New York City’s 14th Congressional District — which sent liberal AOC back to Congress on Nov. 5 by a vote of 123,269 to 55,580 over Republican challenger Tina Forte — majorly boosted its votes this year for conservative Trump when it came time to select a president.\n\nIn 2020, 77% of the district voted for Joe Biden and 22% for Trump. That Trump total changed in 2024, as 33% of voters cast a ballot for the red team. In a heavily blue district, that rise is startling. AOC decided to ask her vast collection of social media followers to explain themselves on Monday.\n\n“Let’s do this right now. If you voted for Donald Trump and me, or if you voted for Donald Trump and voted Democratic down-ballot, I would really love to hear from you,” Ocasio-Cortez said on her Instagram story. “This is not a place of judgment. I’m not going to put your stuff on blast or anything like that, or dunk on it. That’s genuinely not the intent here. I actually want to learn from you. I want to hear what you were thinking.”\n\nShe closed her caption, “I’m listening.”\n\nThe respondents’ gist is that they believe Trump and AOC “are both real,” as one reaction summed up. Other notable posts along those lines included:\n\n“I feel that you both are outsiders compared to the rest of D.C., and less ‘establishment.’”\n\n“It’s real simple… Trump and you care for the working class.”\n\n“Trump is going to get us the money and let’s [sic] men have a voice.

United States, which granted different levels of criminal immunity for presidents’ official conduct, barred the use of certain evidence and witness testimony.\n\nIn his July response to the request to dismiss the indictment, Bragg argued that Trump had waited too long to raise some of his arguments about immunity. He also said a federal judge had deemed the conduct in question—an alleged payment to Cliffords—outside of a president’s official duties.\n\n“Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority,” Southern District of New York Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in September, when he refused a request to move the case out of state court on the basis of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision.\n\nBragg’s office also pointed Merchan to a portion of Hellerstein’s opinion remarking on Trump’s conduct after he entered office.\n\n“Reimbursing Cohen for advancing hush money to Stephanie Clifford cannot be considered the performance of a constitutional duty,” Hellerstein said. “Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty.”\n\nCohen paid Clifford before the 2016 presidential election, and Trump was charged for allegedly reimbursing Cohen after Trump had begun his first term of office. Trump maintained the payment was part of a retainer he had with Cohen. Prosecutors said it wasn’t actually part of a retainer but reimbursement for an illegal payment.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the Trump Organization illegally falsified documents in order to conceal the payments and in furtherance of another crime, namely, influencing the 2016 election.\n\nIn order to prove that, prosecutors heard testimony from former White House staff, as well as from both Cohen and Clifford. That testimony, as well as posts from Trump’s social media account, involved official acts protected under the Supreme Court’s immunity decision, Trump’s legal team said.\n\nAfter trial, Trump’s attorneys filed a motion telling Merchan, “Because of the implications for the institution of the Presidency, the use of official-acts evidence was a structural error under the federal Constitution that tainted [the District Attorney of New York’s] grand jury proceedings as well as the trial.”\n\nIn Trump v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that official acts—including certain communications to the public—may not be used as evidence against a president.\n\n“It would permit a prosecutor to do indirectly what he cannot do directly—invite the jury to examine acts for which a President is immune from prosecution to nonetheless prove his liability on any charge,” Chief Justice John Roberts said, writing for the majority.\n\nPart of Merchan’s decision-making might take into account what’s known as “harmless error”—an error in the conduct of a trial that is considered not damaging enough to justify overturning a conviction.\n\nIn his July memo to Merchan, Bragg said, “And even if some of this evidence was improperly admitted, any error was harmless in light of other overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt.”\n\nBragg added that the Supreme Court’s decision on immunity didn’t preclude the evidence Trump was challenging—such as Trump’s tweets and testimony by former Trump adviser Hope Hicks. And even if it did, Bragg’s office argued, Trump waited too long to make objections based on immunity and should have made them during trial.","summary":"Regardless of how New York Judge Juan Merchan rules, experts say it is unlikely the President-elect will face prison time.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/judge-to-rule-on-whether-trumps-conviction-should-stand-in-light-of-presidential-immunity-ruling-5757677","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/02/id5642357-Trump-Judge-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:35:58","author":"Sam Dorman","authors":["Sam Dorman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.329},{"id":264185028,"title":"Worries in Chicago area and Congress Grow over President-elect Trump’s Mass Deportation Proposal","text":"CHICAGO (WLS) — President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportations are raising many concerns from leaders in Chicago’s immigrant communities to the halls of Congress.\n\nThere are calls for President Joe Biden to act before leaving office.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nThe plans by the Trump administration to begin the mass deportation of millions of immigrants lacking permanent legal status are setting off alarm bells in Little Village and other communities with large immigrant populations.\n\n“So, we are terrified with those threats of deportation,” said Pastor Emma Lozano, with Lincoln United Methodist Church.\n\nLozano, who famously provided sanctuary at her Humboldt Park church for Elvira Arellano nearly two decades ago, is calling on Biden to act now.\n\n“To give temporary protection status for those people that have been living here for decades, paying taxes, possibly married to U.S. citizens or have U.S. citizen children or ‘Dreamer’ children,” Lozano said.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration is preparing to do all it can to protect families with members lacking permanent legal status.\n\nThe deputy mayor for Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights said Chicago will not be bullied because of its Welcoming City Ordinance.\n\n“We are not able to cooperate with ICE to assist in mass deportations; our mayor has made very clear that he will not flinch,” said Beatriz Ponce de Leon, deputy mayor for Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights. “We will continue to maintain our ordinance in place and to comply with that.”\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is if deportations separate families.\n\n“This idea that he’s only going to deport on day one, people who are undocumented, who have a criminal record, is an absolute lie,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, a Democrat who represents Chicago and some western suburbs.\n\n“Watch what happens. Watch what happens when that debate begins. People are going to come to their senses and leave some of this rhetoric behind them. They’re going to say, ‘Yes, dangerous people, get rid of them. For God’s sake, don’t tear that family apart. Those are good people,'” Sen. Dick Durbin said.\n\nCommunity leaders like Lozano believe that if mass deportations start hitting home in Chicago, churches may need to step up to provide families with sanctuary.","summary":"CHICAGO (WLS) &#8212; President-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s plans for mass deportations are raising&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/worries-in-chicago-area-and-congress-grow-over-president-elect-trumps-mass-deportation-proposal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-President-elect-Donald-Trump-administration-mass-deportation-plan-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:34:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":264185460,"title":"Ông Donald Trump muốn ‘lách’ Thượng viện Mỹ để bổ nhiệm nội các","text":"Tổng thống Mỹ đắc cử Donald Trump hôm 10.11 cho rằng tân thủ lĩnh đa số kế tiếp của thượng viện nên đồng ý để ông bổ nhiệm các vị trí then chốt của nội các mới mà không cần thượng viện phê chuẩn.\n\n Tổng thống Mỹ đắc cử Donald Trump có yêu cầu đối với thủ lĩnh đa số kế tiếp của Thượng viện Mỹ khi đảng Cộng hòa giành lại quyền kiểm soát thượng viện.

It’s no golf with his regular buddies and friends who are members at the club. There will be occasional games with Elon Musk or [Sen.] Lindsey Graham. But he’s focusing 24/7 on the country with history in mind.” \n\n“Some of his buddies have just been told their weekly games are on hold until the country is back on track!” the source said. \n\nMusk, 53, appeared on the golf course with Trump and his grandkids on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n\nGraham told Trump, 78, after congratulating him on election night, “See you on the golf course!”\n\nNBC News previously reported that after an apparent assassination attempt close to one of his courses on Sept. 15, Trump would lay off the links until after the election for security reasons. \n\nThe NBC report cited a source as saying federal agents could not ensure Trump’s safety on the course the way they’d like. But he was back at it after defeating Kamala Harris this month in the election. \n\nThe real estate mogul owns 18 golf properties internationally. \n\nDuring his last term as president, he reportedly spent more than 260 days at his own golf properties — though it’s not clear whether he played during those visits. \n\nHe’s been known to play at least once per week since leaving the White House, according to reports.\n\nTrump also famously was critical of President Barack Obama for playing golf when he was a GOP candidate during his first campaign against Hillary Clinton. \n\nA rep for Trump did not get back to us.","summary":"\"Some of his buddies have just been told their weekly games are on hold until the country is back on track!\" a source said.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/11/11/gossip/donald-trump-tells-golf-buddies-hes-laying-off-links/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/93469491.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:31:57","author":"Ian Mohr","authors":["Ian Mohr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":264186682,"title":"Only Fools And Horses star Sir David Jason, 84, reveals he struggles to get parts because of his age: 'I'm trying to convince producers I've got many characters left to play'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Nov 12th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: The favourites to replace Gary Lineker as Match of the Day presenter - with England legend set to leave iconic BBC show after 26 years at the end of the season\n\nFounder of world's oldest breastfeeding charity QUITS in protest at inclusion of transgender women - saying it has become 'a travesty' that 'indulges the fantasies of adults'\n\nTerrified friends burned to death 'trapped inside crashed Tesla after its electronic doors failed'\n\nThe Church of England's most prolific abuser John Smyth beat scores of boys till they bled.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy GRANT TUCKER ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \n Published:00:16 GMT, 12 November 2024 |Updated:00:31 GMT, 12 November 2024 \n\nSir David Jason has played some of the most iconic roles in television history, but the 84-year-old admitted he now struggles to get new parts.\nThe actor, who played the hapless Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses for two decades, told the Radio Times that he was 'desperately' trying to get television bosses to cast him in his twilight years.\nThe Touch of Frost actor said: 'I'm trying desperately to convince producers and directors that I've got many characters still left to play. Senior actors have got a tremendous amount to offer.'\nHis most recent television job was co-presenting the 15-part BBC series Jay and David's Touring Tool Shed with Jay Blades at the beginning of the year,\nMr Blades has since been charged with controlling and coercive behaviour against his estranged wife, and Sir David confirmed there will be no follow-up series.\n\nSir David Jason has played some of the most iconic roles in television history, but the 84-year-old admitted he now struggles to get new parts\n\nThe actor, who played Del Boy in Only Fools and Horses (centre) for two decades, told the Radio Times that he was 'desperately' trying to get television bosses to cast him \nSir David said he was 'open to offers', despite not appearing in a scripted project since 2019 when he played Granville in an Open All Hours reboot.\nHe's not the first actor to complain about casting struggles in later life. \nIn the 2018 documentary Nothing Like A Dame, Dame Joan Plowright, 95, confessed: 'My agent said, 'Well if you do want to act again, we'll look around for a nice little cameo that Judi Dench hasn't got her paws on.'\nSir David said that despite not appearing as Del Boy since 2003, the character is still a big part of his life.\nHe said: 'You walk around with the ghost of Del Boy on your shoulder or behind you, peering over your shoulder saying, 'Go on. Tell her Bonjour'. [And I'm thinking] 'Will you shut up!?' But that is what the character would do. He'd say, 'Well, bonjour, bonjour! Bonnet de douche?'.\nSir David also revealed that he will spend Christmas with his long-lost daughter and only grandchild Charlie at his 18th-century farmhouse near Wendover, Buckinghamshire.\nAbi Harris, 53, is the daughter of actress Jennifer Hill - who starred in James Bond film Octopussy - after her mother and Sir David had a brief relationship in 1970.\nIn 2022, Ms Harris wrote an 'astonishing letter' to Sir David and a paternity test later confirmed he was her father.\n\nThe Touch of Frost actor said: 'I'm trying desperately to convince producers and directors that I've got many characters still left to play. Senior actors have got a tremendous amount to offer'\n\nSir David said: 'We'll share some Christmas time together and will probably play lots of games. Charlie loves bingo – and I'm usually the caller, which generally provides a lot of amusement!'\nIn 2001 aged 61, Sir David and his now wife Gill Hinchcliffe welcomed their first child Sophie.\n David previously revealed his 'real regret' over his Only Fools and Horses character and admits he feels haunted by the role. \nThe actor revealed his true feelings in a candid interview on BBC Breakfast with Jon Kay where he explained that the character has overshadowed his other work.\n\nDavid's full interview can be read in the new issue of Radio Times \nDavid told the show that he feels the 'ghost' of Derek Trotter is following him and explained that he feels the character hangs over him.\n\n Sir David Jason addresses rumours of a feud with Nicholas Lyndhurst 20 years after Only Fools and Horses ended \nHe said: 'That Derek Trotter thing, he's a bit of a ghost that comes along behind me like A Christmas Carol.'\nThe star expressed frustration that despite a decades-long career in film and television he is most know for playing Del Boy. \nHe said the character 'only hangs me back, only upsets me slightly is because that seems to be the only thing that people remember me for.'\n'I'm delighted in one way that it's reached so many people and they've enjoyed what I've done with the character, but I've done so many other things that everybody seems to have forgotten about. It's like I've only ever played Derek Trotter.'\nDavid revealed that while he isn't disappointed with his career, there are still so many goals he hasn't achieved and put that down to being followed by the ghost of his most iconic character. \nThe star explained: 'My real disappointment or regret, if you like, is I always wanted to be a National Theatre player. \n'I always wanted to be on the stage of the National Theatre. It was just that romantic image of playing those big productions with all those big, wonderful actors. That never happened.'\nDavid JasonBBCJay Blades\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOnly Fools And Horses star Sir David Jason, 84, reveals he struggles to get parts because of his age: 'I'm trying to convince producers I've got many characters left to play'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nGary Lineker 'will QUIT Match of the Day at the end of the season' after 26 years presenting the show\n\nMegan Fox is PREGNANT: Star expecting first child with Machine Gun Kelly as she debuts bump\n\nShe's expecting \n\nI'm A Celeb's Coleen Rooney reveals vast list of instructions to look after her four children on two HUGE boards during her jungle stint\n\nEXCLUSIVECher: As I swore at the driver of a white convertible who had cut me up, I realised it was Warren Beatty.

Perhaps such is our world.\n\nIt is demoralizing how cowardly and arrogant the Democratic Party is. To offer people nothing but (deserved) criticism of the other candidate, and then expect their votes, is dumb. Had Harris strongly supported taxing the rich, cutting the military budget, cutting arms to Israel, Medicare-for-All, she would have won decisively. Instead, she spent a billion dollars running a smiley-face, empty phrases, say-nothing-meaningful campaign, and emphatically lost.\n\nThe Democratic Party should be put out of its misery.

It’s about our country: a belief that a woman should not be president; it’s about fear-mongering race-based hatred, and deeply rooted dehumanization of immigrants.\n\nThis vote is a backlash against being a multicultural society, against women having control over their bodies, against LGBTQ rights, against the regulations that are in place to combat global warming and so much more.\n\nAlthough we are fearful and filled with grief, despair is a privilege we can’t afford for too long.

What to know about crypto’s post-election rally","text":"By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump’s victory last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency topped $87,000 for the first time on Monday. As of around 3:45 p.m. ET, bitcoin’s price stood at $87,083, per CoinDesk, up over 28% in the last week alone.\n\nThat’s part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election last week. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated “crypto-friendly” nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.\n\nStill, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nBack up. What is cryptocurrency again?\n\nCryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.\n\nIn basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money — but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.\n\nWhy are bitcoin and other crypto assets soaring now?\n\nA lot of it has to do with the outcome of last week’s election.\n\nTrump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year’s presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nCrypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.\n\n“Crypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,” Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being “crypto-friendly” and a potential shift in regulatory backing.\n\nEven before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.\n\nInflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, “have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,” Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nCrypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value — which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.\n\nIn short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.\n\nAt the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.\n\n“Investors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. “Because we’ve seen these wild swings in the past.”\n\nWhat about the climate impact?\n\nAssets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\n\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\n\nIn the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has “grown very rapidly over the last several years,” adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.\n\nAP Business Writer

Hong Kong developers to go for reforms and megaprojects?","text":"Beijing is worried that Hong Kong developers’ tepid response to local megaprojects may further erode investor confidence and this was why a top central government official took on the task of cajoling the private sector on behalf of city authorities, political analysts have said.\nEconomic and property specialists said the central government’s “explicit” call to the local private sector was a rare approach as they expressed scepticism over whether developers would heed the advice and risk potential financial losses.\nAs businessmen, their prime consideration is profit and being accountable to shareholders, but as patriots, they also have to oblige or risk incurring Beijing’s displeasure, some have said, arguing this could skew free-market principles on which the city’s economy is based.\nBut the message from Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was not just about megaprojects but a direct appeal for tycoons and businessmen to be more committed to the city’s longer-term vision and to embrace reforms, others said.\nDuring a full-day meeting in Shenzhen with about 30 representatives from real estate developers, commerce chambers, tech firms and state-owned enterprises operating in the city, Xia had appealed for “concrete” action and for them to “recognise their responsibilities”.\nIn his full remarks published by the office on Sunday, he urged them to go beyond their traditional advantages and not to rely only on the same old ways to succeed.\nThe city’s business leaders, whom he praised as a “major force” in growing the economy and supporting national development strategies, were asked to show their patriotism by taking the lead in the city’s reinvention and replacing inertia with reforms.\nXia also put forward a list of suggested actions, such as promoting the city’s image overseas, to make further contributions for improving people’s livelihoods and firmly supporting local authorities’ long-term development plans.\nPolitical pundit Sonny Lo Shiu-hing said the appeal appeared to coincide with the city government’s plan to grant private real estate companies large land parcels under the Northern Metropolis drive, a 30,000-hectare (74,000-acre) project earmarked for housing and technology development.\nWhile the government would only begin to gauge interest from potential bidders by the end of the year, Beijing could be concerned that the large-site development pilot scheme might attract a lukewarm response, he said.\nSecretary for Development Bernadette Linn Hon-ho, who joined city leader John Lee Ka-chiu and seven other top local officials at Friday’s meeting, said over the weekend that Xia had urged property tycoons to back the government’s long-term development drives such as the Northern Metropolis by actively bidding for the projects involved.\n“Believing that the local government of Hong Kong has been traditionally weak, [Beijing] is trying to turn it into a stronger administration, but still it is unable to mobilise the business community on something like this, and that’s why Beijing has stepped in,” Lo said.\n“To Hong Kong’s business sector, this is an important signal: it’s not just talk, it’s action that [Beijing] … is asking for.”\n\nVeteran China-watcher Johnny Lau Yui-siu said: “From a macro perspective, if those real estate developers refrain from land bidding, the entire investment atmosphere in Hong Kong will also have problems, something Beijing does not want to see, especially when Donald Trump is returning to power.”\nWith the new challenges, Beijing had turned to the well-tested approach of providing “guidance” to businesses, the veteran observer said.\n“This is an organised and public effort that will put pressure on capitalists, in which everyone needed to express their stance with a 10-minute speech to explain what investments they could make,” he said.\nA government source said that while these messages had been shared with businesses in previous closed-door meetings, the public statement from Xia this time, which was also reported by the state news agency Xinhua, was meant to demonstrate Beijing’s commitment to supporting Hong Kong’s economy and to highlight the social responsibilities of private companies.\nStewart Leung Chi-kin, chairman of the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong, said most firms would support the call by looking at as many government projects as possible.\n“We are doing business, of course, we will look at every opportunity. But whether we will go ahead still lies in how much profit we can gain,” he said, calling on the government to come up with detailed plans for such projects as soon as possible.\nProfessor Chau Kwong-wing, who heads the Ronald Coase Centre for Property Rights Research at the University of Hong Kong, said asking developers to actively join government land sales was similar to asking them to risk suffering losses.\n“Direct pressure from central authorities could affect international investment in Hong Kong, which is known for its free-market economy,” he said, adding he was taking a cautious stance on whether developers would respond to the call.\nKevin Tsui Ka-kin, chief economist at research firm Orientis, agreed the call was essentially a top-down instruction from Beijing.\n“It is a rare practice in Hong Kong’s private sector, so the risks it might bring are unknown,” he said. He added that the potential dangers could include uncompleted projects, a problem that was happening in some mainland Chinese cities.\nBut Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of Hong Kong-based Sunwah Group, who joined Friday’s meeting, said high-level officials such as Xia would not get involved in specific details such as requiring Hong Kong developers to buy government land, but would instead focus on providing overall direction for development.\n“He wanted the business sector to explore and invest in new directions beyond traditional areas,” Choi said. “And, of course, the sooner, the better.”\nThe group chairman said the business community welcomed Xia’s guidance and it was still expecting more details from the government, particularly regarding development plans for the Northern Metropolis.\nThe Hong Kong government has run into difficulties in selling land in recent years, with the Urban Renewal Authority rejecting a joint-venture offer from CK Asset Holdings earlier this month for a site in Kowloon City, as the sole bid deviated from the development plan.\nData from the Rating and Valuation Department showed lived-in home prices fell by about 1.7 per cent in September, hitting their lowest level since August 2016 and taking the 12-month decline to 12.5 per cent.\nPrices have slumped 7.5 per cent so far this year.","summary":"Experts say meeting between Beijing’s point man on Hong Kong affairs and private sector leaders represents ‘explicit’ call to action.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3286121/why-beijing-prodding-hong-kong-developers-go-reforms-and-megaprojects","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/11/d2edab20-584f-4ae6-aa9d-9fddc6ecd0e8_c434357a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:30:06","author":"Kahon Chan,Willa Wu","authors":["Kahon Chan","Willa Wu"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.193},{"id":264186688,"title":"Liam Payne's $9,500-a-month Florida mansion he moved into with girlfriend Kate Cassidy weeks before his death is back on the rental market","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Nov 12th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: The favourites to replace Gary Lineker as Match of the Day presenter - with England legend set to leave iconic BBC show after 26 years at the end of the season\n\nFounder of world's oldest breastfeeding charity QUITS in protest at inclusion of transgender women - saying it has become 'a travesty' that 'indulges the fantasies of adults'\n\nTerrified friends burned to death 'trapped inside crashed Tesla after its electronic doors failed'\n\nThe Church of England's most prolific abuser John Smyth beat scores of boys till they bled.

We were supposed to be there for five days, turned into two weeks and I was just, like, I need to go home.'\nShe then proudly shows off her first class ticket with American Airlines revealing she's in seat 1D before saying she has 'such anxiety before flying' that gives her 'a weird rash'. \nThere were 'no food options' at the first class lounge in the airport, she complains. But the footage continues with her eating steak on the plane.\nAmid a shot of her cases on the paved driveway of her new home, she says: 'I landed at 6am…I was so happy to be home, it's just so relieving.'

People saying I look 30, 35 I've gotten, I've even gotten 40. I don't know, I don't think I look over 30. I think maybe I look 27, I'm 25.'\nClearly hurt, she says someone came up to her at an event and asked:' What are your kids doing to Halloween this year?' \nPutting her hands on her hips, she continues: 'I mean I'm flattered, I look this good after having kids, not one kid but multiple kids.\n'I don't know. Like young moms are a thing. I'm like, am I \"giving\" mom?' She then coquettishly turns, gives a little back kick with one leg and adds: 'Maybe like milf…I don't know, it's just like, do I really look that old. I don't understand. \n'How do I make myself look younger. Mom, mommy?

But what he found about the 'Nostradamus effect' of betting markets will reduce him - and Albo - to trembling wrecks\n\nFollow DailyMail.com's presidential election live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy PETER VAN ONSELEN, POLITICAL EDITOR FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:29 GMT, 12 November 2024 | Updated: 00:29 GMT, 12 November 2024\n\nThe betting markets have flipped, they now have the Coalition as the favourites to form government after the next federal election, not the incumbent Labor Party.\n\nSportsbet has the Coalition at $1.80 with Labor at $2. The TAB has Labor out at $2.10 and the Coalition at $1.72.\n\nClearly the impact of cost of living pressures, a decreasing likelihood of an interest rate cut early next year and the criticisms surrounding Albo's Qantas upgrades and purchase of a $4.3m waterfront coastal holiday house have spooked punters. \n\nThey are putting more money on the Coalition than Labor thus driving down the Opposition's odds. \n\nPerhaps the election of Donald Trump has also helped shift sentiment since his resounding win last Tuesday.\n\nBut before we go any further, a word of caution to anyone who sees this shift as a clear sign that Labor's chances at the next election are waning. Gamble responsibly!\n\nBetting markets, while often a good guide to which party is likely to form government, become more accurate the closer we get to polling day and as more money gets tipped into the pot.\n\nHistorically political betting markets tend to load up with bets closer to the day of the election, which still isn't due for another six months.\n\nBetting markets often offer a good guide to which party is going to form government\n\nA lot can change in six months, and the PM gets to choose the timing of the election.\n\nHe'll call it when he thinks he can win, you can bet on that. In other words, he still has the whip hand to a significant extent. \n\nFurther, no first term government has lost a re-election attempt federally in this country since way back in 1931, so history is on Labor's side.\n\nPlenty of first term governments have come close to losing, however. \n\nJohn Howard's Coalition scraped home at the 1998 election with less than 50 percent of the two party vote. \n\nJulia Gillard's Labor Party was reduced to minority government at the 2010 election. \n\nAnd Malcolm Turnbull's team won the 2016 election with the slimmest majority possible. \n\nAll these first term governments were re-elected, albeit only just.\n\nAlbo's fate may well be to win ugly and only form minority government with Greens support. \n\nBut winning one way or the other remains the more likely outcome in my opinion, despite what the betting markets and the opinion polls are currently saying.\n\nYesterday's Newspoll mirrored the betting markets, with Labor's two party vote trailing the Coalition's 49-51 percent.\n\nBut one person who would have to be watching the shift in the betting markets with more than a little bit of interest is Andrew Leigh - a Labor Party minister who works for Albo.

Trump has favored the deep-red Alabama, while Biden favored the deep-blue Colorado. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) told Mobile radio FM Talk 106.5 that Trump would settle the dispute as one of his first moves in office.\n\n“President Trump said in the campaign that he was going to reverse that decision if elected,” he said, referring to Biden’s decision to move the headquarters to Colorado. “But I knew he would because if you remember, not only did Alabama win two nationwide competitions, but President Trump’s secretary of the Air Force recommended Huntsville, President Biden’s secretary of the Air Force recommended Huntsville, and then Biden took it away for political reasons.”\n\n“But it’s going to be a big point now because President Trump’s already announced it, and I think you’ll see in the first week that he’s in office, he’ll sign an executive order reversing Biden’s directive,” he continued. “And we will start construction next year in Huntsville.”\n\nThe office of Rep.-elect Jeff Crank (R-CO) expressed its opposition to the prospect.\n\n“He’s definitely against the move,” a spokesman for Crank told the Washington Examiner.\n\nSpeaking with Al.com, Crank pledged to “resist any attempt” to move the headquarters to Alabama. He also issued some rare criticism of the president-elect by an elected Republican.\n\n“With Donald Trump, you never know,” he said. “He changes his positions and his stance on issues by the day, and sometimes by the hour. If he wants to build out the Space Force and Space Command and have it meet the national security moment and our threats, then he will keep it here.”\n\nAnother Colorado Republican, Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO) also defended keeping the base in Colorado.\n\n“Today’s USSPACECOM [full operational capability] announcement is the pinnacle of more than four years of hard work by General Raymond, General Dickinson, and our Guardians,” he said in a statement last year. “This achievement continues to show that Colorado Springs is the right location for USSPACECOM for our nation’s readiness. I am confident our Guardians will do what is necessary to maintain the highest levels of readiness to counter our adversaries’ malign ambitions in space. Our nation and its Allies are counting on it.”\n\nThe Biden administration always defended its move to keep the headquarters in Colorado Springs as a purely national security-focused move, without any political considerations. Its main argument was the perceived threat to readiness.\n\nA senior White House official told the Colorado Springs Gazette last year that Biden primarily considered the “impact a move would have to operational readiness to confront space-enabled threats during a critical time in this dynamic security environment. U.S. Space Command headquarters will achieve ‘full operational capability’ at Colorado Springs later this month. Maintaining the headquarters there maintains operational readiness and ensures no disruption to its mission or to its personnel.”\n\nA senior administration official told the Washington Examiner at the time of Biden’s decision that a new site in Alabama would not open until “the early to mid-2030s.”","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump isn&#8217;t expected to waste any time going through with the plan to move Space Command headquarters out of Colorado to Alabama.

Kennedy Jr. argued Saturday that the incoming Trump administration should “act fast” to implement massive changes at the National Institutes of Health, including replacing as many as 600 people at the federal agency. \n\n“We need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,” Kennedy said during an appearance at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Ariz. \n\nThe Democrat-turned-Trump-ally has long argued that federal health agencies have been “captured” by the pharmaceutical industry that they are supposed to regulate, likening it to “corruption” that has had a negative impact on the health and safety of Americans. \n\nKennedy, 70, noted at the Genius Network event that he’s working to raise $10 million before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration to help fill key Department of Health and Human Services roles, according to ABC News. \n\n“We need to be able to respond very quickly and need to have a really, really good crack staff right now – we have the people, [but] we need to get them paid, we need to get them, housing in Florida, so they can be right there when we walk into these transition meetings day after day,” he said. \n\nKennedy also provided insight into how Trump, 78, is going about considering people to staff his incoming administration. \n\n“He comes into the meeting and he very quickly – you know, there are eight giant screens and each person has a picture of themselves on the screen, they have a biography next to them, you can press a button and see three different clips of that person …and he goes through them very very quickly and he says, ‘I want that guy,’” the former environmental lawyer said. \n\n“He listens to what people say, but he makes the decisions and he gets very, very firm ideas. And he decides very quickly. And the meetings are very quick when he comes in,” Kennedy explained. \n\nThe former presidential candidate noted that himself, his daughter-in-law, Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk are among the people in the room when Trump is making personnel decisions. \n\n“These are all alpha people,” Kennedy said. “They’re, you know, they have very strong ideas about what should happen, but [Trump] makes the decisions.” \n\nKennedy is expected to have some sort of major health-policy related role in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nTrump’s White House transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, however, dismissed the possibility of RFK Jr. becoming HHS secretary prior to the election.\n\n“That’s not what he wants to do,” Lutnick said last month. “He just wants data, and he wants to prove things [about vaccines] are wrong. And he says, ‘If I can’t prove they’re wrong, that’s fine.

Those will be the first targets,’ Vazquez explained.\n\nNO MORE BOGUS ASYLUM CLAIMS \n\nTrump’s newly named ‘Border Czar,’ Tom Homan, has expressed particular interest in removing asylum-seekers, who he believes are gaming the legal system. \n\nThe US is obligated to hear asylum claims, even though between 60- to 70-percent of all cases are ultimately denied by courts.\n\n‘The one group that they are targeting immediately are the fake asylum seekers,’ prominent San Antonio Republican Kyle Sinclair shared of his conversations with Homan. \n\n‘That was, by far, the one (group) he mentioned to me were the fake-asylum seekers. \n\n‘They’re known. They have their addresses.’\n\nENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP \n\nHoman has also been telling supporters he’s looking for ways to end birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution that gives automatic citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.\n\n‘He’s mentioned that he’s going to end birthright citizenship,’ Vazquez added. \n\n‘Just because someone’s born here doesn’t automatically make them a citizen.’\n\nIt’s unclear how Homan and the Trump administration would get around the Constitutional protection and legal challenges that would arise from any changes to birthright citizenship, with Vazquez only saying ‘the way he’s going to approach it is different.’\n\nFor years, some Republicans have attacked so called ‘anchor babies’ – children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrant parents or other non-citizens.\n\n‘Trump won because of his “America first” agenda,’ Sinclair stated. \n\n‘We want to be taken care of, and by allowing millions of people into the United States, no other country does this. \n\nTrump has every right, under executive order, to try to fulfill what he’s doing.’ \n\nRESTORING THE REMAIN IN MEXICO PROGRAM \n\nThe new border czar intends to bring back the controversial ‘remain in Mexico’ program or Migrant Protection Protocols, which says that asylum seekers must wait in Mexico until their court date instead of being granted entry into America. \n\n‘MPP will be back in place,’ Vazquez said.\n\n‘I’m sure they’re going to attack it differently because there’s been a lot of litigation regarding MPP, so when they implement it, they’re going to take into account everything that’s happened in the court system.’\n\nTrump launched the policy in 2019 when he was last in office. \n\nBiden, echoing the complaints of human rights groups that the policy was leading to increased rape and abduction cases, vowed to end it.\n\n‘Donald Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy is dangerous, inhumane, and goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants. \n\n‘My administration will end it,’ he tweeted in 2020, before making good on his promise. \n\nMexico has consistently resisted the effort. \n\nENDING TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS \n\nTemporary Protected Status, (TPS) a program that has allowed thousands of newly arrived migrants, including Venezuelans and Haitians, will likely be closed to anyone new. \n\nIf a migrant is granted TPS, they are allowed to legally remain in the US and given a work permit for 18 months. \n\nVazquez had not heard of plans to take it away from people who have been awarded the opportunity to stay in the US on a humanitarian basis, but rather, it would be closed to anyone who isn’t already part of it.\n\nWidespread raids at businesses or other work places are not being discussed, mainly because many of the migrants who will be initially targeted for removal from the country are already known to the government. \n\nAny migrant in the process of seeking asylum, with TPS or parole status has been given permission to be in the US temporarily, and the feds already have their addresses and whereabouts. \n\nMany are required to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and/or have regular court dates. \n\nBetween ousting the migrants who arrived during the Biden Administration, Trump’s border czar plans to go after a second group. \n\nSHUTTING DOWN THE SUPER GANGS \n\n‘They are going after Tren de Aragua,’ Vazquez detailed. ‘They’re going to go after them, and they’re going to go after the Mexican cartels.\n\nThe Venezuelan super gang, known as TdA to law enforcement, is a vicious prison gang turned international criminal organization.\n\nIts thug members snuck over the border mixed in with asylum seekers and have been linked to a crime wave across the nation including cop beatings, murders, child prostitution and violent robberies.\n\n‘These are very dangerous people,’ the lawyer, who was among the first in the US to ring the alarm on TdA, said. \n\n‘I’ve spoken to so many Homeland Security Investigation agents who are so eager to get back to work. During this (Biden) Administration, there has been so much red tape– agents haven’t been able to do their job.’\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, TdA dominated headlines after law enforcement made it known the gang had control of entire apartment complexes in cities like Aurora, Colorado and San Antonio, Texas. \n\n‘It’s time. We need to clean up our communities,’ Vazquez added. ‘We have our own criminals to deal with. We can’t be taking in all the criminals from all over the world .’\n\nHoman also has members of the the Chinese Communist Party and other migrants gangs, like MS-13, in his cross-hairs.\n\nENLISTING THE POLICE AND MILITARY \n\nInsiders have been hesitant to wade into the details of whether the Trump Administration even has the manpower to deport millions of people, although suggestions of using the military and local police departments have been floated. \n\nEach immigration program Trump is proposing to end is legally complex and will no doubt face court challenges from the left. \n\nOn top of that, countries like Venezuela and China, whose citizens have flooded the border and US courts with refugee claims, do not have diplomatic relations with the US, making the return of its citizens nearly impossible.\n\nNo other country, like Mexico, is obligated to take any migrant from other countries– only its own citizens. \n\nBut Vazquez believes Trump’s brash brand of international relations can help convince those countries into working with him.\n\n‘I know he’s going to make moves in Venezuela, and he’s going to do whatever he has to to make these people take back their people,’ Vazquez said.","summary":"Donald Trump and his new border czar Tom Homan will start their&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-and-tom-homans-strategy-to-remove-millions-of-immigrants/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/11/19/91946889-14068635-image-a-15_1731351952860.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-12 00:26:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":264184016,"title":"Trump taps Tom Homan for \"border czar\"","text":"Trump taps Tom Homan for \"border czar\"\n President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Tom Homan as his \"border czar.\" Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be overseeing border security and the potential deportation of millions of people.

The word “hate” was under Trump’s face, while the words “hope,” “heal,” and “grow” corresponded with the Democratic politicians.\n\n“Not that anyone cares, but as an Independent voter, I would really like to see both the political parties in our country pick better candidates,” he wrote in July. “We can do better than a binary choice between fascism and not fascism.”\n\nAnthony Nephew had previously issued a chilling warning about his struggles with mental health, writing in an op-ed for the Duluth News Tribune in 2021, “For millions of Americans, a breakdown leads to suicide — or homicide before suicide.”\n\n“Mental health in this country is stigmatised, ignored, or treated as a burden for the individual to bear alone, with little help and even less understanding,” he wrote.\n\n“Americans deny they have mental health struggles — because they have to, because they’re told to, or because they don’t realise their mind is broken.”\n\nPolice in Duluth, a city of nearly 90,000 residents about 135 miles north of Minneapolis, have not yet determined a motive for the shootings.\n\nPolice said there is no ongoing threat to the community. – Agency report","summary":"A United States man, Anthony Nephew, shot himself, his wife, ex-partner, and two children after the November 5 election that brought President-elect Donald Trump into office.

One person under consideration for Wray's job is Trump adviser Kash Patel, who is also being considered to lead the CIA, according to two other sources. Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 to a 10-year term, enjoys leading the FBI and had intended to serve out his term, one source said. But he's also preparing for the possibility that Trump will seek to replace him, according to a separate source. All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity to recount sensitive discussions. Replacing might not mean firing. Wray could resign if he was told Trump wants him gone, as is widely expected. Trump campaigned in part on the idea of cleaning house at an FBI he has claimed is full of politically motivated and corrupt executives. He has frequently criticized Wray over the years, though not nearly as much as he’s gone after other officials at the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI. Wray told NBC News in April that he was “enjoying doing this job.” “As long as I think I can do that in a way that adheres to all those rules and norms, I’d like to keep doing it,” Wray said at the time. In July, Trump demanded Wray resign “NOW” after he testified before Congress that Trump’s ear injury from the attempt on his life that month might not have come from a bullet. The FBI later confirmed in a statement that a bullet struck Trump's ear. Trump responded on his social media website Truth Social. “I assume that’s the best apology that we’ll get from Director Wray, but it is fully accepted!” he wrote. In recent days, Trump has been making staffing announcements for top posts in his administration, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and \"border czar\" Tom Homan. Installing a new FBI director would require Senate confirmation in a chamber where Republicans will be in the majority starting in January. Patel is a former House and National Security Council staffer who worked for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and became a top Defense Department official in the waning days of the first Trump administration. He's also a longtime critic of the Justice Department and the agencies that he is under consideration to helm. In his memoir titled “Government Gangsters,” Patel called for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of the Justice Department and FBI, including firing many in leadership and prosecuting those who “in any way abused their authority for political ends.” Trump sought to make Patel deputy CIA director toward the end of his term in office, but blinked after CIA Director Gina Haspel promised to resign if he went through with it.

Albanese dismisses call to divert to Florida and seek out Donald Trump","text":"Anthony Albanese has dismissed calls for him to seek a face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump while Peter Dutton warns the Government needs to “course correct” to make sure Australia does not fare poorly under the new US administration.\n\nThe Prime Minister travels to Peru and Brazil on Wednesday for the APEC and G20 leadership summits over the next week.\n\nShadow foreign affairs minister Simon Birmingham said Mr Albanese should be proactively seeking a meeting with Mr Trump while in the region.\n\n“The Albanese Government should be doing all it can to try to get Anthony Albanese in the door for an early meeting with Donald Trump,” he told Sky News on Tuesday morning.\n\n“The chance is there for him to go up to Florida and seek this meeting.”\n\nBut Mr Albanese dismissed this suggestion.\n\n“If you have a look at the map, it’s actually not on the way,” he said.\n\n“I had a really constructive discussion with President-elect Trump last week, it was a very good beginning to our relationship.”\n\nMr Albanese has never met Mr Trump in person.\n\nHe did not meet the Republican candidate or any of his team while in Pennsylvania for the Quad meeting in September, unlike Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHowever, ministers including Penny Wong, Richard Marles and Jim Chalmers have held talks with some inside the Republican camp.\n\nDFAT officials told Senator Birmingham in estimates last week that, by convention, the only formal engagement the Australian Government could have with the new administration was the congratulatory phone call Mr Albanese made to Mr Trump after his election victory.\n\nThe only break in this protocol they could recall was then-UK leader Theresa May visiting Washington in 2016 before Mr Trump was sworn in the first time.\n\nMr Dutton said the Government must make sure Australia continued to have a strong and trusted relationship with the US.\n\nThe Opposition Leader pointed out that the Coalition, under Malcolm Turnbull, had been able to negotiate tariff exemptions during Mr Trump’s first time in the White House.\n\n“The onus will be on the Prime Minister to negotiate a similar outcome with the Trump administration, and that will be a question for him as to whether or not they’re able to craft that,” he said.\n\n“But I think it’s obvious that America has charted a different course now, and the government here needs to course-correct and make sure that they’re working with and not against our most important ally.”","summary":"Anthony
