Authorities said Friday that Livelsberger acted alone.\n\n“This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wakeup call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives,” Livelsberger wrote in a letter found by authorities who released only excerpts of it.\n\nInvestigators identified the Tesla driver — who was burned beyond recognition — as Livelsberger by a tattoo and by comparing DNA from relatives. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, according to coroners officials.\n\nPentagon officials have declined to say whether Livelsberger may have been suffering from mental health issues but say they have turned over his medical records to police.\n\nAuthorities excerpted the messages from two letters Livelsberger wrote using a cellphone note application, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said.\n\nThe letters covered a range of topics including political grievances, domestic issues and societal issues, Koren said.\n\nTesla engineers, meanwhile, helped extract data from the Cybertruck for investigators, including Livelsberger’s path between charging stations from Colorado through New Mexico and Arizona and on to Las Vegas, Koren said.\n\n“We still have a large volume of data to go through,” Koren said. “There’s thousands if not millions of videos and photos and documents and web history and all of those things that need to be analyzed.”\n\nThe new details came as investigators sought to determine Livelsberger’s motive, including whether he sought to make a political point with the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect’s name.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has recently become a member of Trump’s inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday, the day of the explosion. Both had attended Trump’s New Year’s Eve party at his South Florida estate.\n\nMusk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, who has named Musk, the world’s richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government’s size and spending.\n\nInvestigators suspect Livelsberger may have been planning a more damaging attack but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built explosive.\n\nInvestigators said previously that Livelsberger shot himself inside the Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks just before it exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day.\n\n“It’s not lost on us that it’s in front of the Trump building, that it’s a Tesla vehicle, but we don’t have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology,” Spencer Evans, the Las Vegas FBI’s special agent in charge, said Thursday.\n\nAsked Friday about whether Livelsberger had been struggling with any mental health issues that may have prompted his suicide, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters that “the department has turned over all medical records to local law enforcement.”\n\nA law enforcement official said investigators learned through interviews that he may have gotten into a fight with his wife about relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla in Colorado on Saturday and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.\n\nAmong the charred items found inside the truck were a handgun at Livelsberger’s feet, another firearm, fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards, an iPhone and a smartwatch, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. Authorities said both guns were purchased legally.\n\nLivelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. He had recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official.\n\nHe was awarded a total of five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor.\n\nAuthorities searched a townhouse in Livelsberger's hometown of Colorado Springs Thursday as part of the investigation. Neighbors said the man who lived there had a wife and a baby.\n\nCindy Helwig, who lives diagonally across a narrow street separating the homes, said she last saw the man she knew as Matthew about two weeks ago when he asked her if he could borrow a tool he needed to fix an SUV he was working on.\n\n“He was a normal guy,” said Helwig, who said she last saw the wife and baby earlier this week.\n\nThe explosion of the truck, packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, came hours after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police. The FBI says they believe Jabbar acted alone and that it is being investigated as a terrorist attack.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

What Video Shows","text":"A video of U.S. Senator Dave McCormick's daughters posing for a photo with Vice President Kamala Harris took off online after a local news outlet said that in the video, one of McCormick's daughters could be heard saying she voted for Harris.Newsweek could not verify the reported remark and reached out to McCormick's press office for comment via email on Friday.Why It Matters President-elect Donald Trump enthusiastically backed McCormick's 2024 Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, in which he successfully unseated longtime incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey. Trump also picked up every battleground state, including Pennsylvania, where he notched more than 50 percent of the vote.It is typically assumed that family members vote for their relatives running for office and fall along party lines; however, that has not always been the case, as seen with Trump's estranged niece Mary Trump, who backed Harris, and relatives of former Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, who publicly supported Trump.What To Know McCormick was sworn in as on Friday, the first day of the 119th Congress. As vice president and president of the Senate, Harris oversaw the swearing-in of the new class of senators.McCormick has six daughters, five of whom were in photos and videos of the swearing-in.A video of McCormick's daughters taking a photo with Harris was shared by the media outlet Heartland Signal, which describes itself as delivering the news \"through a progressive lens.\"Accompanying the video was the following caption: \"While taking pictures after Sen. Dave McCormick's (R-PA) ceremonial swearing in, one of his daughters appears to tell Vice President Kamala Harris 'I voted for you.' Harris responds: 'I could tell.'\"The video shows McCormick's daughters thanking Harris after taking the photo. One daughter then raises her hand near her mouth and appears to mouth something to the vice president. What she said cannot be heard in the video.Harris is heard responding, \"I could tell,\" though it is unclear what she was responding to.As of Friday evening, the video has 1.2 million views from several accounts that shared it.What People Are Saying McCormick reaffirmed his support for Trump in a radio interview this week: \"My goal is to try to make sure President Trump has what he needs to be successful.\"The anti-Trump X account, @DisavowTrump20, shared the video on X with the caption: \"Senator David McCormick's (R-PA) family taking their own picture with Vice President Harris. One of them whispers: 'I voted for you!'\"Call to Activism, an X account with 1 million followers, posted: \"This is AWESOME!!

We have a lot to do, and we can do it in a bipartisan fashion,” Johnson said as he pledged to help Trump transform the economy.\n\n“We can fight high inflation, and we must. We’ll give relief to Americans, and we’ll extend the Trump tax cuts… We’re going to drastically cut back the size and scope of government, we’re going to return the power back to the people.”\n\nWith the exception of Kentucky conservative hardliner Thomas Massie, the opposition to Johnson always looked soft, and he had spent much of the week working the phones and holding meetings with the conservatives who had opposed his candidacy.\n\n– ‘Greater than ever’ –\n\n“Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary. The People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership,” the president-elect posted on social media.\n\n“America will be greater than ever before!” \n\nDefeat for Johnson would have marked another embarrassment for Trump, who was shown the limits of his sway over House Republicans after they rebuffed his demands for a suspension of the country’s borrowing limit in December.\n\nTrump’s looming presidential inauguration had also raised the stakes of the speakership fight, since the House would not have been able to certify the 78-year-old Republican’s victory, set for Monday, without electing a leader.\n\nThe speaker wields key influence in Washington by presiding over House business and is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president.\n\nBut Johnson has been weakened by the standoff with his party’s hard-liners, who demonstrated the leverage they hold given the Republicans’ wafer-thin majority in the lower house of Congress.\n\nWith the vote looking set to go down to the wire, former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is 84 and recently suffered a fractured hip, turned up to cast her ballot, wearing flat heels for possibly the first time in her career.\n\nHouse Republicans are scheduled to gather for a retreat in Washington on Saturday to talk about their plans for 2025, and the leadership meets again on Sunday in Baltimore.\n\nBut the first order of business will be to consider a controversial change to its rules package — which governs daily operations — that would allow only Republicans to force a vote on removing the speaker.\n\nDemocrats argue that the reform would leave Johnson answerable only to his own side rather than the whole chamber. In the last Congress, any single House member could introduce a “motion to vacate” the speaker’s chair.\n\nThe 36-page rules package for the 119th Congress raises the threshold to nine co-sponsors from the majority party.","summary":"Republican Mike Johnson was returned as speaker of the US House of Representatives on Friday with the crucial backing of incoming president Donald Trump, ending a bitter standoff that threatened to see the 2025 session opening in chaos.

It'll be funny. It'll have funny women on it that are going to tell jokes and tell stories, and health and wellness,\" Schneider said. He added that people are sick of politics and the shaming that comes along with it. \"We're going to have an entertaining show with people — from all over America. We're not just trying to bring people who are angry and bitter and reinforcing their political echo chamber.\" \n\nSchneider, who is an outspoken Donald Trump and free speech supporter, said the show would be filled with \"household names\" and would begin filming before Trump's inauguration on January 20. \n\nAnd news came out today that potentially reinforces that. The actor met with billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong and allegedly pitched the show, presumably looking for someone to help back it financially. Soon-Shiong is a South African-born surgeon and businessman who invented the drug Abraxane, which is used to help treat various forms of cancer. He's also a minority owner of the Los Angeles Lakers NBA team, and he owns the Los Angeles Times newspaper. \n\nDuring the meeting, Schneider was reportedly joined by another big name out of Hollywood: actress Cheryl Hines of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" fame. Hines is, of course, the wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services. It sounds like maybe he already has one host lined up? \n\nRelated: 'The View' Hosts Forced to Read Four 'Legal Notes' on Friday for Lying, and It Was Glorious\n\nThe New York Post reports that Schneider's rep did confirm that the meeting took place and said, \"Rob did have a wonderful meeting with Mr. Soon-Shiong and liked the new direction the L.A. Times is taking,\" but the rep did not confirm that they talked about anything to do with the conservative talk show or whether there are any specific plans in place to make it happen. However, Schneider himself did add a post to his X timeline featuring the New York Post story. \n\nEx-‘SNL’ star Rob Schneider pitched LA Times’ billionaire owner to fund ‘conservative version’ of ‘The View’: report https://t.co/2z72AT1bJ2 pic.twitter.com/dFuMcFrgvf— New York Post (@nypost) January 3, 2025\n\nAll of this comes after it was reported in November that the bosses at ABC were in \"panic mode\" to find more conservative voices to add to the panel on \"The View,\" as well as some of their other network programming. Someone will have to tell me if they ever did because I don't think I'd watch that show if you paid me. \n\nAnd admittedly, I don't know that I'd personally watch any kind of \"all-female\" talk show. Conservative or liberal, it's just not my cup of tea. However, I really like the idea of having a legitimate alternative to \"The View\" available to the audiences who would enjoy it. And if it's done well enough, I'm willing to bet the ratings will be much higher than they are for Whoopi, Joy, and the rest of the sour patch gang over at ABC. \n\nSo, what say you?

It has been one helluva start to the new year, hasn't it? Maybe it is time to lighten it up just a touch. I have a feeling that Trump or no Trump, certain factions out there will do everything possible to make 2025 the Year of the Antacid. \n\n The best things in life never change\n\nThere is nothing like starting a new era in America's history with a fond look back at some of the people who have made the last eight years entertaining and occasionally infuriating.\n\nRemember Kathy Griffin? No? She is an alleged comedian. I believe she may have told a joke sometime around 1995. Not ringing any bells? Okay, she was the one waving the Donald Trump mask around that was decked out like a severed head. Ah! Now you remember!\n\nApparently, Griffin is on tour and will likely be seen by about a dozen fewer people than have seen Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. Breitbart reports that she put in an appearance on WGN radio, hoping to get the few people who ran out of other entertainment options and decided to waste money on a sitter to possibly wander in out of the cold and waste a couple of hours of their lives:\n\nCome see me before I’m in one of those internment camps. I’m on the enemies list. That’s very obvious. He was very, very scared when I did a parody photo of him and a Halloween mask and a lot of ketchup. And he brings up my name every chance he gets.\n\nDoes anyone remember the last time Trump mentioned her name? At this point, I'm not sure Trump remembers her name. To put this in perspective, she recently laid the blame for Kamala Harris' defeat at the feet of none other than Taylor Swift for not making any appearances with her. So there's that. \n\nNot to be outdone, Trump has not even taken the oath of office, and Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar, the Head Harpies on \"The View,\" are already predicting that all the president's men will take Trump out:\n\nABC News moderators Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar claim Elon Musk and JD Vance are planning to kill Trump and usurp control of the government together as Musk/Vance.\"[Trump] stay away from the stairways.\" - Whoopi pic.twitter.com/bMRmOSwdrk— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) December 19, 2024\n\nTreasure these moments. One day, you will tell your grandkids how these ladies once did more than pitch commemorative plates and arch supports on QVC.\n\nWine recommendation\n\nBecause, well, how many reasons do I have to give you?\n\nAt Stately Brown Manor, we opted for the usual prosecco to ring in the New Year. But our libations were augmented by this gift from my daughter: The Midtown Room Strawberry Daiquiri Cocktail Mixer Infusion Blend.\n\nNormally, I am not a daiquiri guy, ditto piña coladas. That is not just because they are frou-frou drinks. Anyone who waited tables or tended bar and had to clean a daiquiri machine at closing time hates these drinks. Servers, you know what I am talking about.\n\nThe decanter itself did not contain the requisite fifth of rum; I added that later. It did, however, contain bits of dried lemon and, of course, strawberries and a sugar-laced flavored powder that I could not identify. You add a fifth of the rum of your choice and let it infuse for 48 hours. Serve over cracked ice with some sparking water, and... enjoy.\n\nThe result was... punchy. Really punchy. Think of those scenes from the movies where some kid pours a bottle of hooch into the punchbowl at prom. Once I got past the immense amount of sugar and uncrossed my eyes a few times, I could almost remember my zip code. Definitely a specialty drink. But it was a cute idea, and I was grateful our daughter remembered Mom and Dad this year. Plus, the decanter will make a nifty home for a single-malt scotch to be named later. \n\nThat's all for me. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you next time.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/lincolnbrown/2025/01/03/weekend-parting-shot-left-wing-entertainers-go-down-for-the-third-time-n4935641","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/311/d958d9e8-7f01-4761-9ed9-83957b5881f5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:51:12","author":"Lincoln Brown","authors":["Lincoln Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.001},{"id":278121518,"title":"Breaking down judge's order for Trump to face sentencing in \"hush money\" case","text":"Breaking down judge's order for Trump to face sentencing in \"hush money\" case\n The judge overseeing President-elect Donald Trump's Manhattan criminal \"hush money case\" has ordered the president-elect to face sentencing on Jan. 10.

A small collection of hardline Republicans convened in the back of the House chamber, one by one declining to vote or choosing another lawmaker. Johnson's face turned grim, acknowledging fresh turmoil and signaling trouble ahead for him as Trump returns to the White House and unified GOP control of Washington. \n\nIn the end, however, Johnson was able to flip two remaining holdouts who switched to support him, and Trump called one of the dissenting Republican lawmakers from the golf course. The final tally was 218-215.\n\nJohnson, visibly relieved, vowed to “reject business as usual” in his first speech with the gavel.\n\n“We're going to drastically cut back the size and scope of government,” he promised.\n\nJohnson’s weak grip on the gavel has threatened not only his own survival but Trump’s ambitious agenda of tax cuts and mass deportations as Republicans sweep to power. The stark vote tally laid bare the challenges he faces. Even his backing from Trump himself, usually a surer bet for Republicans, was no guarantee of Johnson's ability to stay in power.\n\nThe House Democratic leader Hakeem Jefferies attempted to push past the Republican tumult of the past two years, saying it was time to come together, put party politics aside “to get things done” for Americans. \n\nWhat was once a ceremonial day with newly elected lawmakers arriving to be sworn into office, often with family, friends and children in tow — Republicans this year wearing long Trump-style red ties — has evolved into a high-stakes vote for the office of House speaker, among the most powerful elected positions in Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris was swearing in the senators. \n\nWhile the Senate is able to convene on its own and has already elected party leaders — Sen. John Thune as the Republican majority leader, who vowed in his first speech to keep the legislative filibuster in place, and Sen. Chuck Schumer for the Democratic minority — the House must first elect its speaker, a role required by the Constitution, second in the line of succession to the president. \n\nWith opposition from his own GOP colleagues, Johnson arrived at the Capitol with outward confidence after working into the night to sway dissenters. A flop by Johnson could have thrown Monday’s congressional certification of Trump’s 2024 election victory into turmoil without a House speaker. \n\nTrump had endorsed Johnson, and was on the phone during the vote to secure the outcome. “Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary,” Trump posted on social media after the vote.\n\nCongress has been here before, when it took Republicans nearly a week and 15 rounds of voting to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker in 2023, a spectacle otherwise unseen in modern times. McCarthy was then dumped by his party, a historic first, but he was also part of a long list of GOP speakers chased to early exits.\n\nThe stakes were higher this year as Trump prepares to return to the White House with the House and Senate in GOP control and promising to deliver big on a 100-day agenda. \n\nJohnson worked diligently to prevent losing his post, up to the final moments, spending New Year's Day at Mar-a-Lago as he positioned himself alongside Trump. The speaker often portrays himself as the “quarterback” who will be executing the political plays called by the “coach,” the president-elect. \n\nDuring the dramatic roll call, the strain on Johnson was clear. More than a half-dozen Republicans refused to vote for him, many from the conservative Freedom Caucus simply staying silent as their names were called. \n\nThe chamber came to a standstill, and then a few of those Republican holdouts announced their support. But Johnson was still falling short. One hard “no” was Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who voted for a different GOP Leader, and had made it clear he would not switch. \n\nBut there were two others. Johnson's allies huddled with Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Rep. Keith Self of Texas, some taking calls and passing them their phones. Norman said later that Trump told him that Johnson was the only leader likable enough to get the job.\n\nJohnson led the two GOP lawmakers off the chamber floor. A short time later, Johnson reentered the chamber upbeat, and Norman and Self cast their votes for him, to cheers. \n\nEventually, Johnson, and all the House lawmakers, were sworn into office.\n\nJohnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, having lost seats in the November election. With the sudden resignation of Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the tally dropped to 219-215. That leaves Johnson relying on almost every Republican for support to reach the typical 218 threshold for a majority in the face of Democratic opposition —- on the speaker’s vote or other party priorities. \n\nTexas GOP Rep. Chip Roy was among the most notable holdouts, a Freedom Caucus member who lashed into Republican leadership’s handling of the year-end spending bill for failing to cut spending. \n\n“Something MUST change,” Roy posted on social media. He eventually voted for Johnson.\n\nIt’s unclear what concessions Johnson made to win support. Already, centrist conservatives pushed a new House rule hat would require at least nine members of the majority party on any resolution to oust the speaker — raising the threshold McCarthy had lowered to just one.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus released a list of demands after its members delivered votes to make Johnson speaker, including on immigration, federal spending cuts and banning members of Congress from stock trading.\n\n“I think the holdouts are going to have to realize that, listen, Trump is right all the time,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, exiting the speaker's office late Thursday. “It’ll help you make a decision real simple.”\n\nIn many ways, Johnson has no choice but to endure political hazing from his colleagues, as they remind him of who has leverage in their lopsided relationship. He was a last-ditch choice for the office, rising from the back bench once other leaders failed in the aftermath of McCarthy's ouster. \n\nThe speaker's election dominated the opening of the new Congress, which brings a roster of history-making members.\n\nIn the Senate, two Black women — Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland — were being sworn in, both wearing suits in the white of the suffragettes, the first time in the nation's history two Black women senators will serve at the same time.\n\nSen.-elect Andy Kim of New Jersey also is making history as the first Korean American to join the chamber.\n\nIn the House, Sarah McBride is the first openly transgender person in the Congress.\n\nAssociated Press writers Adriana Gomez Licon, Matt Brown and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nLisa Mascaro, Farnoush Amiri And Kevin Freking, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/world-news/republican-mike-johnson-reelected-house-speaker-in-dramatic-floor-vote-10028920","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/01/745a31936e6ea82dd090c4cfa0e3530b7d1f4431aec37f296d74cb5f4661b4ce.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:27:12","author":"Stephen Groves","authors":["Stephen Groves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.075},{"id":278119434,"title":"Soldier who died in Las Vegas explosion left note saying it was to be a wakeup for country's ills","text":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — An Army soldier who fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck just before it exploded outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day left notes saying it was stunt to serve as a “wakeup call” for the country’s ills, investigators said Friday. \n\nMatthew Livelsberger, a 37-year-old Green Beret from Colorado Springs, Colorado, also wrote in the note that he needed to “cleanse my mind” of the lives lost of people he knew and “the burden of the lives I took.” \n\nLivelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials said.\n\n“Although this incident is more public and more sensational than usual, it ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other issues,” FBI Special Agent In Charge Spencer Evans said at a news conference.\n\nThe explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the Trump International Hotel.

The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, according to coroner officials.\n\nAuthorities excerpted the messages from two letters Livelsberger wrote using a cellphone note application, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren said.\n\nThe letters covered a range of topics including political grievances, domestic issues and societal issues, Koren said.\n\nTesla engineers, meanwhile, helped extract data from the Cybertruck for investigators, including Livelsberger’s path between charging stations from Colorado through New Mexico and Arizona and on to Las Vegas, Koren said.\n\n“We still have a large volume of data to go through,” Koren said. “There’s thousands if not millions of videos and photos and documents and web history and all of those things that need to be analyzed.”\n\nThe new details came as investigators sought to determine Livelsberger’s motive, including whether he sought to make a political point with the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect’s name.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has recently become a member of Trump’s inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday, the day of the explosion. Both had attended Trump’s New Year’s Eve party at his South Florida estate.\n\nInvestigators have not yet explained how Livelsberger shot himself inside the Cybertruck while simultaneously igniting fireworks and camp fuel packed inside, causing the explosion.\n\nInvestigators suspect Livelsberger may have been planning a more damaging attack, but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built explosive.\n\nAmong the charred items found inside were a handgun at Livelsberger’s feet, another firearm, fireworks, a passport, a military ID, credit cards, an iPhone and a smartwatch, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill said. Authorities said both guns were purchased legally.\n\nA law enforcement official said investigators learned through interviews that he may have gotten into a fight with his wife shortly before he rented the Tesla in Colorado on Saturday and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. \n\nIn recent years Livelsberger confided to Alicia Arritt, a former girlfriend who had served as an Army nurse, that he faced significant pain and exhaustion she attributed to traumatic brain injury.\n\nHe opened up to Arritt, 39, whom he met and began dating in Colorado in 2018, about exhaustion, pain that kept him up at night, and reliving violence from his deployment in Afghanistan, Arritt said.\n\n“My life has been a personal hell for the last year,” he told Arritt in text messages during their early days of dating that she shared with The Associated Press.\n\nThe Green Berets are highly trained U.S. Army special forces who specialize in guerrilla warfare and unconventional fighting tactics.\n\nLivelsberger served in the Army since 2006. He rose through the ranks and deployed twice to Afghanistan and served in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, according to the Army. He recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official. \n\nHe was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. \n\nAuthorities searched a townhouse in Livelsberger's hometown of Colorado Springs Thursday as part of the investigation. Neighbors said the man who lived there had a wife and a baby.\n\nAcross-the-street neighbor Cindy Helwig said she last saw him when he asked to borrow a tool to fix an SUV.\n\n“He was a normal guy,” said Helwig.\n\nThe truck explosion came hours after 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter early on New Year’s Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police. The FBI says they believe Jabbar acted alone and that it is being investigated as a terrorist attack.\n\nCopp, Richer and Long reported from Washington.

Merchan, who presided over Trump’s trial, signaled in a written decision that he'd sentence the former and future president to what's known as an unconditional discharge, in which a case is closed without jail time, a fine or probation. Trump can appear virtually for sentencing, if he chooses.\n\nMerchan wrote that he sought to balance competing interests: Trump’s ability to govern “unencumbered” by the case, the U.S. Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity, the public’s expectation “that all are equal and no one is above the Iaw,” and the importance of protecting the “sanctity of a jury verdict.”\n\n“This court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding,” Merchan wrote in an 18-page decision.\n\nHe rejected Trump’s push to dismiss the verdict and throw out the case on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending return to the White House. The judge said that he found “no legal impediment to sentencing” Trump, and indeed that it was “incumbent” on the court to do so before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.\n\n“Only by bringing finality to this matter” will the interests of justice be served, Merchan wrote.\n\nTrump communications director Steven Cheung reiterated that the case, which Trump has long described as illegitimate, should be dismissed outright. \n\n“There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,” Cheung said in a statement. \n\nTrump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. \n\nAfter Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case. \n\nTrump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional “disruptions” to the incoming president’s ability to run the country. \n\nProsecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insisted the conviction should stand. \n\nThey suggested various options, such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases.\n\nMerchan ruled that Trump’s current status as president-elect does not afford him the same kind of immunity granted to a sitting president and does not require that the verdict be set aside and the case dismissed -- a notion the judge described as “drastic” and “rare.”\n\nDoing that “would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways,\" Merchan wrote. He opined that it wouldn't address the Supreme Court's concerns about presidential immunity, either.\n\nTrump takes office Jan. 20 as the first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office.\n\nHis conviction left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.\n\nThe case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels payment.\n\nThe lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself.\n\nProsecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign.\n\nTrump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family, not to influence the electorate.\n\nTrump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has decried the verdict as the “rigged, disgraceful” result of a “witch hunt” pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.\n\nBefore Trump’s November election, his lawyers sought to reverse his conviction for a different reason: a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July that gave presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution. That request was still pending when the election raised new issues.\n\nWhile urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also sought to move the case to federal court, where he could also assert immunity. A federal judge repeatedly said no, but Trump appealed.\n\nThe hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial.\n\nSince the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases. One pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss; the other alleged he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nA separate, state-level election interference case in Georgia is largely on hold.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that Smith’s decision to dismiss the federal indictments against Trump meant all criminal cases against him must cease immediately. But Merchan said he found that argument unpersuasive, noting that the New York state hush money case was in a “vastly” different stage.\n\nMichael R.

The S&P 500 climbed 1.3% Friday, its best day in nearly two months and its first gain since Christmas. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.8%. Big Tech stocks led the way, and Nvidia and Tesla in particular helped pull the market higher. They offset drops for beer, wine and liquor companies after the U.S. Surgeon General warned of cancer risks related to alcohol. Treasury yields ticked higher in the bond market following a better-than-feared report on U.S. manufacturing.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is rallying out of its holiday-season funk on Friday, and its best day in nearly two months is helping to trim U.S. stock indexes’ losses for the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.2% toward its first gain since Christmas. It's on track to break a five-day losing streak, its longest since April, and cut its loss for the week to 0.5% thanks in large part to Big Tech stocks.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 313 points, or 0.7%, with an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.7% higher. \n\nNvidia helped drive the market higher, despite criticism that prices for it and other tech companies have vaulted too high in the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia rose 4.3% and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. Super Micro Computer, which sells servers for AI and other uses, jumped 7.8%.\n\n“While the easy gains in AI may be behind us, we think this rally looks far from over,” according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer, Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nAnother influential Big Tech stock, Tesla, rose 6.7% to bounce back from its 6.6% tumble the day before, when it disclosed it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected. \n\nRival Rivian jumped 22.3% after saying it delivered more than 14,000 vehicles during the last three months of 2024. That was more than analysts expected. \n\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was U.S. Steel, which fell 5.4% after President Joe Biden blocked a nearly $15 billion deal proposed by Japan’s Nippon Steel to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. \n\nBeer, wine and liquor companies sank after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned about the direct link between alcohol consumption and increased cancer risk. He called for an update on the health warning label on alcoholic drinks, as well as for a reassessment of guidelines for alcohol consumption to account for cancer risk. \n\nMolson Coors Beverage fell 3.4%. Brown-Forman, the distillery behind Jack Daniel's, lost 1.6%.\n\nWall Street’s pullback over the last week has dimmed its shine by only a bit following two stellar years for U.S. stock indexes. They’ve vaulted to records after the U.S. economy managed to keep growing despite high interest rates that have helped bring high inflation nearly all the way down to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. \n\nBut even though the economy and job market look solid at the moment, the path ahead is not assured. Part of the reason the S&P 500 set more than 50 all-time highs last year was because of the expectation that the Fed would keep cutting interest rates through 2025, after it began easing them in September. \n\nTraders are now ratcheting back their expectations for coming cuts to rates. Inflation is proving to be stubborn as the Fed tries to wring the last percentage point of improvement from inflation to get it to its 2% goal. Worries are also rising that tariffs and other policies coming from President-elect Donald Trump could put further upward pressure on inflation. All the while, critics say U.S. stock prices simply look too expensive after rising so much faster than corporate profits. \n\nThe threat of Trump’s tariffs has also hurt stock markets overseas. For China, it’s compounded worries about the world’s second-largest economy, which is already contending with a struggling property market and other challenges. \n\nStocks dropped 1.6% in Shanghai to bring their loss for the week to 5.6%, though they climbed 0.7% in Hong Kong to trim their weekly loss below 2%. European stock indexes also fell. \n\nSouth Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.8% after the acting president and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, promised to do more to stabilize the economy. The country is in the midst of a political crisis that has seen two heads of state impeached in under a month. \n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields ticked higher after a report said U.S. manufacturing is not as weak as economists expected. \n\nThe report from the Institute for Supply Management showed another month of contraction for manufacturers, the 25th in the last 26, but it wasn't as severe as feared. Manufacturing has been one of the areas of the economy hit hardest by the high interest rates of recent years.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.59% from 4.56% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.28% from 4.25% late Thursday.\n\nStan Choe, The Associated Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/national-business/stock-market-today-sp-500-rallies-to-its-first-gain-since-christmas-10026675","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/01/f9074012acaed500bbd6e58a3237028b7444de6f330e5e19f9c78ac16815a7f5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:27:12","author":"Stan Choe","authors":["Stan Choe"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":278122418,"title":"Greenland’s PM pushes for independence from Denmark","text":"Greenland's Prime Minister, Mute Egede, has renewed calls for independence from Denmark following US President-elect Donald Trump's reiterated interest in purchasing the Arctic island.\n\nIn his New Year's address, Egede emphasized the need to “remove the obstacles to cooperation –which we can describe as the shackles of the colonial era –and move on,” signaling a potential referendum on independence.\n\n“Our cooperation with other countries and our trade relations cannot continue to take place solely through Denmark,” he said. “Work has already begun on creating the framework for Greenland as an independent state.”\n\nGreenland, the world's largest island with a population of around 56,000, has been an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1979, managing its internal affairs while Copenhagen oversees foreign and defense policies.\n\nThe island has the legal right to declare independence, but concerns persist regarding economic sustainability, as Greenland's economy heavily relies on fishing and annual grants from Denmark, which constitute about two-thirds of its budget. A 2016 poll indicated that 64% of Greenlanders favored full independence. However, a 2017 survey revealed that 78% voiced opposition if it would lead to a decline in living standards.\n\nThe US President-elect stated in a December post on Truth Social that “for purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the US feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.”\n\nDuring his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed his intention to buy Greenland, referring to the possible purchase as “a large real estate deal.” His renewed interest has met firm rejections from both Greenlandic and Danish officials.\n\n“Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale,” Egede stated unequivocally in December. Similarly, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen dismissed the proposal, emphasizing that Greenland is not on the market.\n\nShortly after Trump’s post, Denmark announced plans to bolster its military presence in the region and in Greenland. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen revealed a defense package exceeding $1.5 billion aimed at enhancing surveillance and security in the area. This initiative includes deploying patrol vessels, long-range drones, and additional personnel to the Arctic Command.\n\n“We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years; now we are planning a stronger presence,” Poulsen said, calling the timing of the announcement an “irony of fate.”\n\nGreenland's strategic importance has grown due to its abundant natural resources, such as rare earth minerals, and its pivotal location in the Arctic, which is becoming increasingly accessible due to climate change. The Arctic’s potential for resource extraction and new shipping routes has attracted global interest, particularly from Russia, China, and the United States.\n\nThe upcoming parliamentary elections in Greenland, scheduled before April 6, 2025, are expected to play a crucial role in determining the island's path forward. “It is necessary to take major steps… The upcoming election period must, together with the citizens, create these new steps,” Egede said.","summary":"Greenland’s PM Mute Egede has renewed calls for independence from Denmark following US President-elect Donald Trump’s reiterated interest \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/610414-greenland-denmark-independence-colonialism/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/67787fc12030276ba41affaf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:25:41","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.238},{"id":278120128,"title":"2025 got off to a violent start, but it doesn't have to stay that way","text":"This was not an auspicious way to start out 2025.\n\nIn Kankakee, an early-morning New Year’s Day mass shooting killed two brothers and injured five others at a house party. People ran outdoors in an attempt to flee.\n\nIn Chicago, three people were killed and 17 were wounded in shootings over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.\n\nOn New Orleans’ Bourbon Street, police say a 42-year-old man drove a pickup truck into a crowd on a busy street, killing 14 people and injuring 35. The suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was an Army veteran born in Texas who got out of the truck and shot at police before officers shot and killed him. Authorities say Jabbar had planted explosives in ice coolers in the French Quarter — which police, luckily, were able to render safe before anyone else could be injured.\n\nAnd in Las Vegas, the driver of a Tesla Cybertruck died and seven other people were injured outside the Trump Hotel on New Year’s Day after the truck, which was loaded with fuel canisters and fireworks mortars, exploded. Police said the driver, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, 37, of Colorado Springs, was an active-duty U.S. special forces soldier who shot himself dead before the blast.\n\nIt all made for a sobering New Year’s Day for everyone who hoped to enjoy the holiday in peace.\n\nThe impact of disinformation\n\nAmericans are beset by violence. Gun violence alone took 16,576 lives, excluding suicide, in the U.S. in 2024, according to The Trace, which reports on guns and gun violence in America. That was the third consecutive yearly decline in a row, The Trace found. As of Friday, there have already been five mass shootings nationwide in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\n\nIn Chicago, the total number of murders and carjackings also were down in 2024. But those numbers remain far too high, and homicides remain far higher than the number of gun deaths in many other nations.\n\nThe causes of violence are multi-faceted. The solutions need to be, as well.\n\nBut efforts to tamp down violence certainly are not helped when disinformation is spread, especially by those in positions of authority. President-elect Donald Trump, for example, said the New Orleans and Las Vegas attacks were due to a policy of open borders — but both Jabbar and Livelsberger were U.S. citizens. Trump later insisted he was right, despite being publicly proven wrong.\n\nIn fact, disinformation like that makes it harder for people to work together to find solutions. It’s corrosive and invites chaos.\n\nIt also makes it harder for people to spot disinformation from other sources. On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury said a Moscow-based nonprofit closely associated with Russia’s main intelligence unit, and a subordinate organization of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, spread disinformation, including via artificial intelligence, during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThis cannot become the new normal.\n\nWhat’s needed to prevent that is a wide consensus that neither violence nor disinformation is an acceptable way to resolve differences or achieve goals.\n\nYet a 2022 study found 12% of Americans were willing to threaten or intimidate another person for political reasons. One in five thought political violence could be justified, and 7% thought it could be OK to kill over political disagreements. Half of Americans thought there would be a civil war within the next few years.\n\nThose are troubling statistics, given that a recent Gallup poll found a record 80% of American adults believe the nation is vastly divided on the most important values.\n\nAll of this is alarming, and a call to action. Americans, starting with our leaders, should be seeking peaceful ways to reduce violence and come together to settle conflict.

How do they … come together and place maximum pressure on the prime minister, make it obvious that he can't stay and secure that departure commitment from him,\" said Scott Reid, CTV News political analyst and former communications director to then-prime minister Paul Martin.\n\n\r\n This meeting comes after calls for Trudeau to step down grew over the holidays from caucus members across the country. Liberals are also contemplating the party's leadership rules and the kinds of preparations needed for a potentially expedited race.\n\n\r\n \"There's a very spirited discussion happening behind the scenes within the Liberal party as to how to select the next leader. People are already looking past the prime minister, and the challenge they have, is that the parliamentary calendar and the constitution of the Liberal party, which dictates how and when you pick a new leader, those things are starting to collide,\" Reid said.\n\n\r\n \"There's so little time left on the parliamentary calendar. There's so grave a threat that the government will be defeated in the spring, that the desire to pick a new leader and how they're going to pick it, that's a big topic for discussion.\"\n\n\r\n Trudeau returns to Ottawa\n\n\r\n Trudeau, after a week out west with his family, was not expected to be part of this meeting. However, he did make his first brief public appearance of the new year, visiting the Embassy of the United States in Ottawa to sign the book of condolences for former president Jimmy Carter.\n\n\r\n The prime minister did not speak in front of the cameras gathered to capture the moment. He remained largely neutral-faced and had facial hair reminiscent of what he sported while in the thick of managing the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\r\n According to the pool reporter permitted in the room, Trudeau wrote: \"As a leader, president, and humanitarian, Jimmy Carter left the world a better place. A fundamentally decent man, he showed what it means to live a life of purpose, to serve. I will always be grateful for his thoughtful advice, and will continue to draw inspiration from his extraordinary life. From your 41 million Canadian neighbours: Merci, Jimmy.\"\n\n\r\n\r\n Capital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\r\n\n\r\n Earlier, the prime minister attended a morning meeting of the Canada-U.S. cabinet committee.\n\n\r\n The meeting of ministers, who are tasked with managing relations with the incoming Donald Trump administration, was expected to include some discussion of Finance and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly's meeting at Mar-a-Lago last week. No formal read-out from the meeting has been issued.\n\n\r\n At a press conference on Parliament Hill Friday morning, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May offered her suggestions for how Canada should be preparing for Trump, and said the country needs strong leadership to stand up for this country in the face of the next president's \"51st state\" talk.\n\n\r\n Asked if she thinks Trudeau can still be that leader, May said \"sure,\" but because \"we are not a country that relies on a prime minister solely for leadership.\"\n\n\r\n \"Obviously, Justin Trudeau's position is tenuous. That doesn't mean Canada's position is tenuous,\" she said.\n\n\r\n As for whether she thinks it's time for the prime minister to resign, May said that she was hesitant to weigh in.\n\n\r\n \"I think the prime minister obviously has to consider his role as leader of the Liberal party. But I do think that's an internal question for Liberals,\" May said.\n\n\r\n \"I'm not in his shoes, and I think that the resignation of Chrystia Freeland and the circumstances under which she was dismissed from his cabinet right before the fall economic statement calls into question Justin Trudeau's judgment.\"\n\n\r\n With files from CTV News' Judy Trinh, Vassy Kapelos, and Stephanie Ha","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/liberal-caucus-chairs-meet-to-talk-trudeau-pm-attends-canada-u-s-cabinet-committee-1.7163957","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2025/1/3/justin-trudeau-1-7164153-1735930335893.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:19:25","author":"Rachel Aiello","authors":["Rachel Aiello"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.263},{"id":278118374,"title":"Protests in South Korea amid political turmoil","text":"Advertisement\n\n x close window\n\n IN PICTURES \n Protests in South Korea amid political turmoil \n\n © 2025 All rights reserved.\n\n Share this gallery:\n\n Advertisement\n\n Protests in South Korea amid political turmoil \n\n A political crisis has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.\n\n Most famous stolen artworks from around the world\n\n Some of the most renowned and valuable paintings that have been stolen from across the world since the 20th century.\n\n 15 famous shipwrecks in Canada \n\n Thousands of ships lay submerged in Canadian waters, some found after decades and even centuries, while others have yet to be discovered.

She earned an Emmy nomination for her latest special, “Someday You’ll Die” for HBO, which dealt with everything from offering to pay for her friends’ abortions to her darkest porn habits.\n\n\r\n Glaser cited Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Ricky Gervais as inspirations. She’ll follow last year’s host Jo Koy, who was slammed by critics for a fumbled opening monologue and a rushed pace throughout.\n\n\r\n Glaser began her roasting at the red carpet rollout on Thursday, taking aim at the Globes’ broadcaster: “We’re on CBS, which has a show called ’60 Minutes,′ because that’s the remaining lifespan of many of its viewers.”\n\n\r\n But she said that while she’d “push the boundaries a little bit,” she didn’t aim to offend: “I don’t want to ruin anyone’s evening — at home or in the audience.”\n\n\r\n Who's nominated for Golden Globes this year?\n\n\r\n Jacques Audiard’s audacious musical “Emilia Pérez,” about a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, leads all nominees with ten.\n\n\r\n That put it ahead of other contenders like the musical smash “Wicked,” the papal thriller “Conclave” and the postwar epic “The Brutalist.”\n\n\r\n “The Apprentice,” about Donald Trump as a young man, also landed nominations for its two central performances, by Sebastian Stan as Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn.\n\n\r\n “The Bear” leads all television nominees with five.\n\n\r\n With his 11th nomination, Denzel Washington is the most-nominated Black performer at the Globes.\n\n\r\n Steve Martin is nominated for the four straight year in the best television actor in a musical or comedy series category for “Only Murders in the Building.” The nomination marks his ninth overall and could be his first-ever Globes win.\n\n\r\n There are 26 first-time nominees including Grande, Dakota Fanning, Glaser, Seth Meyers, Zoe Saldaña and Pamela Anderson — who surprisingly earned a nod for “The Last Showgirl.\"\n\n\r\n The embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval.\n\n\r\n Who is presenting?\n\n\r\n A ton of starry people: Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Anthony Ramos, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Aubrey Plaza, Auliʻi Cravalho, Awkwafina, Brandi Carlile, Catherine O’Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Dwayne Johnson, Édgar Ramírez, Elton John, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kaley Cuoco, Kate Hudson, Kathy Bates, Ke Huy Quan, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Keaton, Michelle Yeoh, Miles Teller, Mindy Kaling, Morris Chestnut, Nate Bargatze, Nicolas Cage, Rachel Brosnahan, Rob McElhenney, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sarah Paulson, Seth Rogen, Sharon Stone, Vin Diesel, Viola Davis and Zoë Kravitz.\n\n\r\n What are the Golden Globes?\n\n\r\n The Globes are the first major ceremony of the awards season. They’re not exactly an Oscar bellwether, but they’re known for a few things: being a boozy, sometimes irreverent party and a glamourous gathering of the biggest television and film stars.\n\n\r\n A Globes win can help build momentum for a movie or actor’s Oscar campaign. As the first televised awards show of the year, they get ahead of similar ceremonies like the Screen Actors Guild and Critics Choice Awards and are nearly two months before the Oscars, which this year will be held on March 2.\n\n\r\n Double nominees please\n\n\r\n Stan, Kate Winslet and Selena Gomez are all double nominees.\n\n\r\n Gomez is up for both best performance by a female actor in a supporting role for “Emilia Pérez\" and best performance by a female actor in a television musical or comedy series for “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\n\r\n Winslet is nominated for both best performance by a female actor in a drama for “Lee” and best performance by a female actor in a limited anthology series for television for “The Regime.”\n\n\r\n Stan earned a nod for both best performance by a male actor in a drama for “The Apprentice” and best performance by a male actor in a musical or comedy for “A Different Man.”\n\n\r\n Who will receive the Golden Globes' Cecil B. DeMille award?\n\n\r\n Viola Davis will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her decorated career, starring in an array of powerful roles from “ Fences ” to “ The Woman King.”\n\n\r\n The actor has won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as “The Help,” “ Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom ” and “Doubt,” while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama “How to Get Away with Murder.”\n\n\r\n The DeMille Award has been bestowed to 69 of Hollywood’s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Meryl Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.\n\n\r\n Who's the next Carol Burnett award honoree?\n\n\r\n The Golden Globes are raising a glass to former “Cheers” star Ted Danson by naming him the Carol Burnett Award honoree.\n\n\r\n Danson, a three-time Globes winner, has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC’s comedy “Cheers.” His other credits include “The Good Place,” “Mr. Mayor,” “Fargo,” “CSI” and “CSI: Cyber,” “Damages” and “Becker.”\n\n\r\n Danson currently stars in Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside,” which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.\n\n\r\n The Carol Burnett Award was inaugurated in 2019 and is presented to an honoree who has “made outstanding contributions to television on or off screen.”\n\n\r\n Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.\n\n\r\n Danson and Viola Davis will be praised at a gala dinner Friday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. For the first time, the Globes will host a separate event dedicated to both awards.\n\n\r\n What will stars eat at the Globes?\n\n\r\n The Golden Globes, known as the “party of the year,” will bring back the celeb-beloved Nobu Restaurants group.\n\n\r\n Chef Nobu Matsuhisa returns with several signature dishes, highlighted by The Gold Standard Roll — sushi that includes king crab inside, topped with salmon, gold flakes and caviar, and yuzu sauce on the side. The dish is served in the restaurant for US$77.\n\n\r\n Other dishes from Matsuhisa include seaweed tacos, yellowtail jalapenos, sashimi salad, black cod and three pieces of tuna, white fish and salmon sushi.\n\n\r\n “This is kind of like harmony with the caviars and, jalapenos,\" said Matsuhisa, who served signature Japanese food at the ceremony last year.\n\n\r\n\n\r\n Associated Press Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/golden-globes-2025-who-s-nominated-hosting-presenting-the-honorees-what-they-ll-eat-and-more-1.7164178","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2025/1/3/morris-chestnut-and-mindy-kaling-1-7164189-1735933255767.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:19:25","author":"Jonathan Landrum Jr,The Associated Press","authors":["Jonathan Landrum Jr","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.311},{"id":278118372,"title":"Biden blocks $14B acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel","text":"WASHINGTON - \n\n\r\n President Joe Biden has blocked the nearly US$15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel — affirming his earlier vow on the presidential campaign trail to prevent the acquisition of Steeltown USA’s most storied steel company.\n\n\r\n The proposed deal kicked up an election year political maelstrom across America’s industrial heartland and blocking it drew a threat of litigation from Nippon Steel.\n\n\r\n\r\n Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories\r\n\n\r\n “We need major U.S. companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America’s national interests,” Biden said in a Friday morning statement.\n\n\r\n Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel blasted the decision, saying in a joint statement that Biden's blocking the deal “reflects a clear violation of due process and the law” in a process it said was “manipulated” to advance Biden’s political agenda.\n\n\r\n It also insisted that Biden cited no credible evidence of the deal presenting a national security problem and suggested it will sue, saying “we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.”\n\n\r\n Biden's decision comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.\n\n\r\n The committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and made up of other Cabinet members, can recommend that the president block a transaction, and federal law gives the president that power.\n\n\r\n A U.S. official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press last month that some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.\n\n\r\n The decision comes just weeks before the Democratic president is set to leave office and could damage relations between the U.S. and Japan, which is America’s biggest ally in Asia and its largest foreign holder of U.S. debt.\n\n\r\n\r\n Top business headlines, all in one place\r\n\n\r\n In their statement, the two steel companies said it's “shocking — and deeply troubling” that the U.S. would reject a transaction that advances U.S. interests and “treat an ally like Japan in this way.”\n\n\r\n “Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States,” the companies said.\n\n\r\n Biden previously came out against the deal during the presidential campaign — and was backed by the United Steelworkers, concerned over whether the company would honor existing labor agreements or slash jobs, as well as over the firm’s financial transparency.\n\n\r\n “It is important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers,” Biden said in a March statement, while he was still seeking reelection to the presidency before dropping out of the race. “U.S. Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century, and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.”\n\n\r\n President-elect Donald Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed in December on his Truth Social platform to block the deal and to use tax incentives and tariffs to boost U.S. Steel's fortunes.\n\n\r\n On Friday, Steelworkers President David McCall said the union is grateful for Biden's move to block the sale and, in a video news conference, called it the “right move for our members and for America's national security.”\n\n\r\n McCall had long questioned Nippon Steel's status as an honest broker for U.S. national trade interests and reiterated that Friday, calling Nippon Steel a “serial trade cheater” that would degrade U.S. steelmaking and had, for decades, undermined the domestic steel industry by dumping its products into U.S. markets.\n\n\r\n “Allowing it to purchase U.S. Steel would have offered it the opportunity to further destabilize our trade system from within and in the process, compromise our ability to meet our own national security and critical infrastructure needs,” McCall said.\n\n\r\n McCall insisted that U.S. Steel — which is profitable and reported $1.8 billion on its balance sheet — has the financial wherewithal to make the company strong. Nippon Steel's offer was a “huge windfall” for executives and investors, but not for America or workers, McCall said.\n\n\r\n However, U.S. Steel has warned that, without Nippon Steel's cash, it will shift production away from its aging blast furnaces to cheaper non-union electric arc furnaces and move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.\n\n\r\n For its part, Nippon Steel had said it is best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese and to invest billions in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including the company's aging blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.\n\n\r\n It pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.\n\n\r\n Nippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters. Despite that, its proposal raised concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and U.S. national security.\n\n\r\n The announcement came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America’s manufacturing sector and followed a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say have helped reinvigorate domestic steel.\n\n\r\n Nippon Steel waged a public relations campaign to consolidate support, even offering $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.\n\n\r\n A number of conservatives and business groups like the U.S. Chamber had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some Steelworkers union members and mayors in areas near its blast furnaces.\n\n\r\n Nippon Steel was the world’s fourth largest steelmaker in 2023, according to World Steel Association figures. U.S. Steel was 24th.\n\n\r\n\n\r\n Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/biden-blocks-14b-acquisition-of-u-s-steel-by-japan-s-nippon-steel-1.7163788","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2025/1/3/u-s--president-joe-biden-1-7163789-1735911684687.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:19:25","author":"Fatima Hussein And Josh Boak,The Associated Press","authors":["Fatima Hussein And Josh Boak","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":278119334,"title":"Trump must be sentenced in hush money case, judge signals no jail","text":"NEW YORK: US President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced on Jan 10 in the criminal case in which he was convicted on charges involving hush money paid to a porn star, but is unlikely to face jail time, a judge said on Friday (Dec 3).\n\nJustice Juan Merchan's ruling means Trump will be required to appear at a court hearing just 10 days before his Jan 20 inauguration - an unprecedented scenario in US history.\n\nBefore Trump, no US president - former or sitting - had been charged with or convicted of a crime.\n\nThe judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually.\n\nHe wrote that he was not inclined to sentence Trump to jail, and that a sentence of \"unconditional discharge\" - meaning no custody, monetary fine, or probation - would be \"the most viable solution\".\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said there should be no sentencing in the case.\n\n\"This lawless case should have never been brought, and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said.\n\nMerchan announced his plan for the sentencing in denying Trump's motion to dismiss the case due to his presidential election victory. Trump's defence lawyers had argued that having the case hang over him during his presidency would impede his ability to govern.\n\nMerchan rejected that argument, writing that setting aside the jury's verdict would \"undermine the rule of law in immeasurable ways.\"\n\n\"Defendant's status as president-elect does not require the drastic and 'rare' application of (the court's) authority to grant the (dismissal) motion,\" Merchan wrote in the decision.\n\nMerchan also rejected Trump's argument in a Dec 3 court filing that dismissal was warranted because his \"civic and financial contributions to this city and the nation are too numerous to count\".\n\nWhile acknowledging Trump's service as president, the judge said Trump's public statements excoriating the justice system were also a factor for him in determining how Trump's character would factor into the decision.\n\nMerchan criticised what he called Trump's \"unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks\" against the integrity of the criminal proceeding, and noted that he had found him guilty of 10 counts of contempt during the trial for repeatedly violating an order restricting out-of-court statements about witnesses and others.\n\n\"Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole,\" Merchan wrote.\n\n\"Defendant's character and history vis-a-vis the rule of law and the third branch of government must be analysed,\" the judge said, referring to the judiciary. \"In that vein, it does not weigh in his favour.\"","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-must-be-sentenced-hush-money-case-judge-signals-no-jail-4837761","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--IuXIj7Nm--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/trump_hush_money_99390.jpg?itok=YnxmAdCN","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:18:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":278118210,"title":"Trump-backed Republican Johnson elected speaker of US House","text":"Republican Mike Johnson was returned as speaker of the US House of Representatives on Friday with the crucial backing of incoming president Donald Trump, ending a bitter standoff that threatened to see the 2025 session opening in chaos.\n\nJohnson had angered backbenchers by working with Democrats to pass legislation, and his victory was secured only after tense backroom negotiations that saw more than a dozen rank-and-file Republicans voice doubts over his leadership.\n\nA chaotic 2023-25 session was marked by conservative anger in particular over the Louisiana lawmaker’s handling of spending negotiations, as fiscal hawks lined up to accuse him of being soft on the deficit.\n\nIn the end there were only three Republican holdouts as voting began — with all 215 Democrats backing their leader Hakeem Jeffries. Johnson was able to keep his speakership ambitions alive by persuading two to change tack.\n\nWith the exception of Kentucky conservative hardliner Thomas Massie, the opposition to Johnson always looked superficial, and he had spent much of the week working the phones and holding meetings with the conservatives who had opposed his candidacy.\n\nHe appeared to assuage some lingering doubts in the hours before the vote by pledging to “reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, and move the United States to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory.”\n\nAnd Trump weighed in early Friday with a social media post wishing Johnson “Good luck” and declaring him “very close to having 100% support.”\n\nWith the vote looking set to go down to the wire, former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is 84 and recently suffered a fractured hip, turned up to cast her ballot, wearing flat heels for possibly the first time in her career.\n\nDefeat for Johnson would have marked another embarrassment for Trump, who was shown the limits of his sway over House Republicans after they rebuffed his demands for a suspension of the country’s borrowing limit in December.\n\n– High stakes –\n\nTrump’s looming presidential inauguration had also raised the stakes of the speakership fight, since the House would not have been able to certify the 78-year-old Republican’s victory, set for Monday.\n\nJohnson would also have risked losing Trump’s support if the battle dragged out further, with moderate Republicans beginning to cast around for other options.\n\nThe speaker wields key influence in Washington by presiding over House business and is second in line to the presidency, after the vice president.\n\nBut Johnson has been weakened by the standoff with his party’s hardliners, who demonstrated the leverage they hold given the Republicans’ wafer-thin majority in the lower house of Congress.\n\n“Mike Johnson brings people together to achieve a shared goal. He is deeply committed to conservative values and advancing a pro-America agenda. He is making Louisiana proud,” said Bill Cassidy, who represents Johnson’s home state in the Senate.\n\n“Americans trust Mike to lead the House effectively and with integrity this Congress. I do too!”\n\nHouse Republicans are scheduled to gather for a retreat in Washington on Saturday to talk about their plans for 2025, and the leadership meets again on Sunday in Baltimore.\n\nBut the first order of business will be to consider a controversial proposed change to its rules package — which governs daily operations — that would allow only Republicans to force a vote on removing the speaker.\n\nDemocrats argue that the reform would leave Johnson answerable only to his own side rather than whole chamber. In the last Congress, any single House member could introduce a “motion to vacate” the speaker’s chair.\n\nThe 36-page rules package for the 119th Congress raises the threshold to nine co-sponsors from the majority party.\n\n© Agence France-Presse","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/01/trump-backed-republican-johnson-elected-speaker-of-us-house/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AFP__20250103__36RZ4TP__v1__Preview__UsPoliticsCongressSpeaker.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:18:12","author":"Ayobami","authors":["Ayobami"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":278118212,"title":"US House rejects Trump-backed speaker in first ballot","text":"The new US Congress was thrown into chaos on its first day Friday as rebel right-wing Republicans defied incoming president Donald Trump to block Mike Johnson from returning as speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Louisiana congressman — who was boosted by several messages of support from Trump — needed a simple majority to be elected as Washington’s top legislator, who presides over House business and is second in line to the presidency.\n\nBut divided Republicans failed to elect a speaker in the first round of voting — raising fears of a repeat of the chaos of the last two years of their House rule — after a nail-biting ballot that earned blanket coverage across US television networks.\n\nThe vote marked another embarrassment for Trump, who was shown the limits of his sway over House Republicans for a second time after they rebuffed his demands for a suspension of the country’s borrowing limit in December.\n\nTrump’s looming presidential inauguration raises the stakes of the speakership fight, since the House can do nothing until its leader is decided — including completing the certification of the 78-year-old Republican’s victory, set for Monday.\n\nThe contest now goes to a second round, but Johnson risks losing Trump’s support if that battle drags out, which would likely prompt moderate Republicans to start casting around for other options.\n\nJohnson needed 218 votes in the lower chamber, where the Republican majority narrowed to 219-215 as Trump was sent back to the White House in last year’s historic presidential election.\n\n– No one’s first choice –\n\nTrump threw his full weight behind his man early Friday with a social media post wishing him “Good luck” and “very close to having 100% support.”\n\nJohnson sought to appease conservatives in the hours before the vote by pledging to “reduce the size and scope of the federal government, hold the bureaucracy accountable, and move the United States to a more sustainable fiscal trajectory.”\n\nBut the 52-year-old attorney fell short — having failed to bring party rebels, who include several high-profile Trump allies, into line.\n\nJohnson’s habit of crossing the aisle to cut deals with the Democrats angered conservatives in the 2023-25 session, while fiscal hawks lined up to attack him for what they saw as weakness on the deficit.\n\nJohnson actually won the vote by 216 to Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries’ 215 — and there is very little doubt a Republican will ultimately claim the speaker’s gavel — but he fell short of a majority after three of his members decided not to back him.\n\nJohnson was a virtual unknown to the wider public before becoming speaker but came to Trump’s attention when he spearheaded efforts in Congress to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nFar from his party’s first choice, the attorney and religious rights campaigner won the gavel in 2023 largely because he lacked the enemies on his own side that prompted the downfall of other Republicans.\n\nHe already had one Republican “no” on the scoreboard going into Friday’s vote, from Kentucky’s Thomas Massie, while a handful of other conservative hard-liners had publicly declared themselves open to a change at the top.\n\n– ‘Tired of voting’ –\n\nJohnson “was only electable the first time because he hadn’t held any type of leadership position, nor had he ever fought for anything, so no one disliked him and everyone was tired of voting,” Massie posted on X.\n\n“He won by being the least objectionable candidate, and he no longer possesses that title.”\n\nThe last time it took more than one round of voting to pick a speaker at the start of a new Congress was the very last time the body opened for a new session, in January 2023. Before that it last happened a century ago, in 1923.\n\nFailure in subsequent rounds would open the path for a potential rearguard action from anti-Johnson conservatives, and cloak-and-dagger talks between the two parties that could see the emergence of a consensus Republican backed by Democrats.\n\nNo credible Republican alternative for round two had yet been floated publicly.\n\nThe most obvious would be House Whip Steve Scalise, a loyal Trumpist who has been clear in the past that he has ambitions of his own, although he has suffered health issues.\n\nThe party’s right fringe is likely to see Scalise as more of the same, however, and rejected him along with whip Tom Emmer when Kevin McCarthy eventually prevailed in 2023. Their candidate would likely be Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/01/us-house-rejects-trump-backed-speaker-in-first-ballot/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AFP__20241222__36RB3AL__v1__Preview__UsPoliticsTrump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:18:12","author":"Ayobami","authors":["Ayobami"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.128},{"id":278119128,"title":"Excerpts from the judge’s ruling to go ahead with Trump sentencing","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — The judge overseeing Donald Trump’s hush money case in New York dealt with a host of weighty, unprecedented questions before deciding Friday that the president-elect should be sentenced later this month for the crime of falsifying business records.\n\n“Indeed, the sanctity of a jury verdict and the deference that must be accorded to it, is a bedrock principle in our Nation’s jurisprudence,” Merchan wrote.\n\nBut the judge also signaled that he intended to impose a sentence of “unconditional discharge,” which means Trump would not face any punishment beyond having the conviction on his legal record.\n\nTrump’s spokesperson said after Merchan’s ruling that the president-elect would continue to fight against the case, which he called a hoax.\n\nHere are some key excerpts from the judge’s decision:\n\nA president-elect is not immune from prosecution\n\n“The Constitution dictates that only a President, after taking the oath of office, has the authority of the Chief Executive, a President-elect does not. Accordingly, a President-elect is not permitted to avail himself of the protections afforded to the individual occupying that Office. … Binding precedent does not provide that an individual, upon becoming President, can retroactively dismiss or vacate prior criminal acts nor does it grant blanket Presidential-elect immunity.”\n\nTrump’s election win doesn’t mean he can’t be sentenced\n\n“Any claim Defendant may have that circumstances have changed as a result of Defendant’s victory in the Presidential election, while convenient, is disingenuous. Defendant has always pronounced, since the inception of this case, confidence and indeed the expectation that he would prevail in the 2024 Election — confidence that has proven well-founded. That he would become the ‘President-elect’ and be required to assume all the responsibilities that come with the transition were entirely anticipated. Thus, it was fair for this Court to trust that his request to adjourn sentencing until after the election carried with it the implied consent that he would face sentence during the window between the election and the taking of the oath of office.”\n\nThe conviction should not be dismissed ‘in the interests of justice’\n\n“Here, 12 jurors unanimously found Defendant guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud, which included an intent to commit or conceal a conspiracy to promote a presidential election by unlawful means. It was the premediated and continuous deception by the leader of the free world that is the gravamen of this offense. To vacate this verdict on the grounds that the charges are insufficiently serious given the position Defendant once held, and is about to assume again, would constitute a disproportionate result and cause immeasurable damage to the citizenry’s confidence in the Rule of Law.”\n\nTrump has engaged in ‘unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks’ on the legal system\n\n“Defendant’s disdain for the Third Branch of government, whether state or federal, in New York or elsewhere, is a matter of public record. Indeed, Defendant has gone to great lengths to broadcast on social media and other forums his lack of respect for judges, juries, grand juries and the justice system as a whole.”\n\nThe jury’s verdict should not be disregarded\n\n“This Court recognizes the importance of considering and balancing the seemingly competing factors before it: ensuring that the Executive Branch is free to fully dispense the duties of the President and safeguard the interests of the Nation, unencumbered by pending criminal proceedings; to ensure that the Supreme Court’s ruling and the citizenry’s expectation be honored that all are equal and no one is above the Iaw; and the importance of protecting the sanctity of a jury verdict. This Court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding, either on its own or in conjunction with the other … factors.”\n\n“To dismiss the indictment and set aside the jury verdict would not serve the concerns set forth by the Supreme Court in its handful of cases addressing Presidential immunity nor would it serve the Rule of Law. On the contrary, such decision would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways.”\n\nTrump likely won’t go to jail\n\n“While this Court as a matter of law must not make any determination on sentencing prior to giving the parties and Defendant opportunity to be heard, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the Court’s inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the People concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation. As such, in balancing the aforementioned considerations in conjunction with the underlying concerns of the Presidential immunity doctrine, a sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options.”","summary":"In an 18-page legal opinion, Judge Juan Merchan laid out his reasoning for the ruling. His most important finding was that Trump’s conviction should not be thrown out simply because he was elected president.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/01/03/judge-ruling-excerpts-trump-sentencing/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trump_Hush_Money_98170_57aa68.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:17:47","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":278118216,"title":"Retired Army Officer Says Matthew Livelsberger Emailed Him About Car Bomb","text":"Matthew Livelsberger, driver in the New Year's Day Tesla Cybertruck explosion in Las Vegas, wrote in an email sent less than 24 hours before the attack that he had a car bomb, according to a retired U.S. Army officer.Why It MattersThe former officer, Sam Shoemate, on Friday shared his account in an interview on The Shawn Ryan Show, a popular podcast whose host has over 1 million followers on Instagram, including Joe Rogan and Ivanka Trump. He also has 3.58 million subscribers on YouTube.Shoemate said he passed along the email to the FBI, which Newsweek contacted via email for comment on Friday.What To KnowShoemate said during his interview that the email sender identified themselves as Livelsberger, adding that the message was sent at 10:42 a.m. ET Tuesday with a \"manifesto\" claiming he was being tracked by federal agents.The writer said the feds wouldn't \"move on me\" because he was armed with a \"massive VBIED,\" an acronym for vehicle borne improvised explosive device.\"In layman's terms, a car bomb,\" Shoemate said, which was \"what we saw\" in Las Vegas, when the Cybertruck exploded in front of Trump International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others.\"So ... he says, 'I am armed and I have a massive VBIED. I've been trying to maintain a very visible profile and have kept my phone and they are definitely digitally tracking me,'\" Shoemate said, reading from the email.The person who wrote the email also made a number of other claims, including that China was going to attack the U.S. and that World War III was coming.Ryan posted a screenshot of the email to X on Friday.Shoemate said the individual initially reached out to him via Instagram direct message and first emailed him on Sunday, three days before the explosion.He described the Tuesday email—in which he said he had a VBIED—as a \"manifesto.\"\"When I started reading this, my initial take was, OK, this is off the deep end,\" Shoemate told Ryan. \"It's bonkers. I can't validate or verify any of the stuff in this manifesto.\"Shoemate said he conveyed that to the sender and that they responded by asking to be put in touch with Ryan, Fox News and Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary.Shoemate said the last time he was in contact with the email sender was on Tuesday, when Shoemate told the sender that he couldn't connect them with the people to whom he wanted to speak.Shortly afterward, Shoemate referenced the email in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that was intended to be in jest.\"My inbox was especially eventful today,\" he wrote on Tuesday afternoon. \"Allegations of war crimes, government anti gravity technology, and fears about being tracked and watched by the feds. It's always 'the world is ending and I have this information that needs to get to the media' and never 'how you doing, brother? Everything alright?'\"The day after the explosion, Shoemate said, he heard from a friend in a military-related group chat who asked him if he knew anything about the driver, who was an Army veteran.\"I'm f***ing shaking, bro,\" Shoemate responded via voice note. \"You don't understand. This guy emailed me and told me he was being watched by the FBI and Homeland Security, but they weren't gonna do anything to him because he had a VBIED. I'm not f***ing playing, dude. I have the email. I'm shaking, man, this is, this is nuts.\"What People Are SayingShoemate explained his decision to publicize the email, writing on X: \"I knew taking this public would insert me into the 'glowy boi' conspiracy cycle, especially since I'm an intelligence officer. I had no choice. Dude dumped it in my inbox. When I saw his name in the news, I had little choice but to hand it over to the feds. I knew the FBI wouldn't release it, or at least without an agenda attached, so I took it to @ShawnRyan762 because he has the platform to handle the magnitude of this information and will do so as objectively as possible.\"Ryan said shortly before the episode was released that he and his family will be \"disappearing\" for a few days: \"My account will be active but it will not be me behind the wheel. What we are about to release is mind boggling and will raise a lot of questions.\"What Comes NextThe FBI is still investigating details surrounding the explosion, including Livelsberger's possible motives and any warning signs that officials may have missed.","summary":"Sam Shoemate, former Army officer, said someone claiming to be Matthew Livelsberger emailed him a day before the Tesla Cybertruck explosion.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/matthew-livelsberger-email-car-bomb-sam-shoemate-2009628","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2556318/matthew-livelsberger.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:17:03","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":278118040,"title":"Hyundai and Kia seeking uptick in 2025 global sales","text":"Business Live \n\nBusiness Live \n\nSubscribeSign In\n\n SubscribeSign In \n\nMarkets Data\n\n Columnists \n Editorials \n\n Education \n\n Science & Environment \n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services \n Healthcare \n Industrials \n Innovation \n Land & Agriculture \n Management \n\n Retail & Consumer \n Telecoms & Technology \n Trade & Industry \n Transport & Tourism \nMarkets Data\n\nLegal Notices\n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport \n\n Arts & Entertainment \n\n Gadgets & Gear \nWanted Online\nBusinessDay TV \n\nOur Network \n\n Markets Data\n\nMARKET WRAP: JSE ends the first week of the new year firmer \nWhile the rand firmed for a second day running analysts have warned of volatility ahead \n\nJSE muted as markets await fresh catalysts \n\n14 hours ago\n\nOil extends gains on optimism over policy support for growth \n\n17 hours ago \n\nGold set for weekly rise as market awaits Trump’s policy moves \n\n18 hours ago \n\n Columnists \n Editorials \n\nKAVISHA PILLAY: Subverting truth for power \nWe must confront the reality that the digital age has outpaced democracy’s defences \n\nKENNETH MOKGATLHE WA KGWADI: Renaming Sandton Drive would undermine Joburg’s rich diversity \n\n1 week ago \n\nTHANDO NGOZO: SA has a window to build a resilient future \n\n1 week ago \n\nSYDNEY MHLARHI: Barloworld acquisition offers value for shareholders \n\n1 week ago \n\n Education \n\n Science & Environment\n\nJoburg VIP protection declared unconstitutional \nGauteng judge says office bearers ‘are not entitled to exist in a security bubble’ \n\nGovernment contracts with no money to pay for them are unlawful, court rules \n\nMashatile calls ministers to order for unanswered questions in parliament \n\nTransnet’s losses widen in its first half \n\nMK suspends three members in KZN legislature \nChief whip among three who face disciplinary charges, with party citing ‘irregularities’ \n\nG20, politics to take centre stage in 2025 \n\n2 days ago \n\nANC regains seat lost to IFP in KwaZulu-Natal by-election \n\n2 weeks ago \n\nEFF willing to be in GNU — on condition that DA is excluded, Malema says \n\n2 weeks ago \n\n Financial Services \n Healthcare \n Industrials \n Innovation \n Land & Agriculture \n Management \n\n Retail & Consumer \n Telecoms & Technology \n Trade & Industry \n Transport & Tourism \n Markets Data\n\nMTN and Nigeria telco’s call for 100% tariff increase \nRequest is part of efforts to rightsize an industry devastated by inflation and a historic currency devaluation \n\nHyundai and Kia seeking uptick in 2025 global sales \n\n12 hours ago \n\nTesla’s China sales rise to record high in 2024, bucking global decline \n\n15 hours ago \n\nNvidia the biggest winner in 2024 with $2-trillion rally \n\nTrade surplus picks up well in November \nSurplus for the first 11 months of 2024 tops R180bn, far exceeding the R111bn surplus, month-on-month, of 2023 \n\nBotswana lifts bans on SA vegetables \n\n2 weeks ago\n\nUS stocks fall after Fed cuts rates 25 basis points as expected \n\n2 weeks ago\n\nSA’s reputation will benefit as it shows it can mediate global issues in G20, says Treasury \n\n3 weeks ago\n\n Legal Notices\n\nState announces winning bidders in seventh window \nNot a single wind project was awarded preferred bidder status though \n\nSYDNEY MHLARHI: Barloworld acquisition offers value for shareholders \n\n1 week ago \n\nGovernment extends the registration of spaza shops \n\n2 weeks ago\n\nPODCAST | Could ‘spam’ marketing be a thing of the past in 2025?

Nippon offered to move its US headquarters to Pittsburgh, where the US steelmaker is based, and promised to honour all agreements in place between US Steel and USW.\nThis week, a source familiar with the matter said Nippon Steel had also proposed giving the US government veto power over any potential cuts to US Steel’s production capacity, as part of its efforts to secure Biden’s approval.\n“It is difficult to fully understand the risks involved in Nippon Steel’s potential acquisition of US Steel,” said a Japanese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as did the other sources.\n“Nippon Steel has done everything to eliminate risks related to economic securities, including committing not to reduce production.”\nMETI, Japan’s industry ministry, and a spokesperson for Ishiba could not be reached to seek comment on Friday, a public holiday in Japan.\nJapan’s stock market was also closed for the holiday. US Steel shares closed down 4.1% on Thursday.\n\nNext Article \n\nSupport our award-winning journalism.The Premium package (digital only) is R30 for the first month and thereafter you pay R129 p/m now ad-free for all subscribers.\nSubscribe now \n\nWould you like to comment on this article?\n Sign up (it's quick and free) or sign in now.\n\nPlease read our Comment Policy before commenting.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nRampaging gunman kills 12 in Montenegro \nWorld /Europe\n\nTexas man who backed Isis acted alone in New ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon vows to ‘fight till ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nPro-Isis driver in deadly New Orleans truck ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nWhite House mum on Biden blocking US Steel sale ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nJimmy Carter, former US president and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, dead at 100\n World /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign policy with threats to Panama, ...\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Subscribe now for an ad-free experience.Support independent journalism.\nSubscribe now \n\nRampaging gunman kills 12 in Montenegro \nWorld /Europe\n\nTexas man who backed Isis acted alone in New ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon vows to ‘fight till ... \nWorld /Asia\n\nPro-Isis driver in deadly New Orleans truck ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nWhite House mum on Biden blocking US Steel sale ... \nWorld /Americas\n\nRelated Articles \n\nJimmy Carter, former US president and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, dead at 100\n World /Americas\n\nNEWS ANALYSIS: Trump previews combative foreign policy with threats to Panama, ...\n World /Americas\n\n Published by Arena Holdings and distributed with the Financial Mail on the last Thursday of every month except December and January.\n\n Science & Environment \n\n Middle East \n\n Other Sport\n\n Companies \n\n Financial Services\n Healthcare\n Industrials\n Innovation\n\n Land & Agriculture\n Management\n\n Retail & Consumer\n Telecoms & Technology\n Trade & Industry\n Transport & Tourism\n Markets Data\n\n Markets Data \n\n Legal Notices \n\n Columnists\n Editorials\n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n Careers and Tenders \n\n Contact us \n Subscribe \n\n Terms & Conditions \n Privacy policy \n\n © 2025 Arena Holdings.

Picture: REUTERS\n\nTesla reported its first fall in yearly sales on Thursday as lucrative year-end incentives for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker’s ageing line-up and the new Cybertruck pickup failed to lure customers wary of high borrowing costs.\nMusk had earlier predicted “slight growth” in 2024 deliveries and offered a range of promotions including interest-free financing and free fast-charging to boost sales.\nBut reduced European subsidies, a shift in the US towards lower-priced hybrid vehicles and tougher competition especially from China’s BYD hurt Tesla.\nThe US EV maker’s shares closed about 6% lower.\n“Lower deliveries reduces Tesla’s growth and lowers the total addressable market for the company’s ancillary services, including autonomous driving software, charging, and insurance,” Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein said in a note.\n“The slight decline highlights that the current vehicle line-up is nearing market saturation,” he added.\nAs demand for EVs slows, Musk has pivoted his focus on building a self-driving taxi business that is expected to boost Tesla’s value.\nHe also backed president-elect Donald Trump with millions of dollars in campaign donations and analysts expect easier regulations from the new administration to help Tesla in the long run.\nBut with self-driving technology still under development and years away from commercialisation, analysts have said Tesla would have to rely on its promised cheaper versions of current cars and the success of Cybertruck to achieve Musk’s target of 20% to 30% sales growth in 2025.\nThe pickup, known for its futuristic design, has been showing signs of weakness in demand.\nTesla is yet to disclose the delivery numbers for its Cybertruck. The company said on Thursday it handed over 471,930 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 23,640 units of other models, including the Model S sedan, Cybertruck and Model X premium SUV.\nOverall, Tesla delivered 495,570 vehicles in the three months to December 31, missing estimates of 503,269 units, according to 15 analysts polled by LSEG.

Judge Juan M Merchan indicated Trump would likely receive an unconditional discharge, meaning no jail time, fine, or probation.The sentencing date comes shortly before Trump's planned return to the White House on January 20. Trump can attend the sentencing virtually.The judge rejected Trump's arguments for dismissal based on presidential immunity and his upcoming second term. Merchan said concluding the case served the interests of justice, balancing Trump's ability to govern with the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, public expectations of equal application of the law, and respect for the jury's verdict. \"This court is simply not persuaded that the first factor outweighs the others at this stage of the proceeding,\" Merchan wrote.Trump's lawyers argued the case would disrupt his presidency, while prosecutors suggested options like freezing the case or a guaranteed no-jail sentence. The judge ruled Trump's status as president-elect doesn't grant him the same immunity as a sitting president, and dismissing the case would undermine the rule of law.— MarioNawfal (@MarioNawfal) Trump faces a maximum potential sentence of four years in prison, though that outcome is unlikely given the judge's indication. The sentencing was initially scheduled for July but has been postponed twice.'Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes'Steven Cheung, Trump's communications director, said that the order issued by Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA's case, which he described as a \"witch hunt,\" was a direct violation of the Supreme Court's immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. He added that the case should be dismissed.\"Today's order by the deeply conflicted, Acting Justice Merchan in the Manhattan DA Witch Hunt is a direct violation of the Supreme Court's Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said in his statement on social media platform X.Cheung stressed that Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and that there should be no sentencing.\"President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the Witch Hunts. There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,\" Cheung added.— TrumpWarRoom (@TrumpWarRoom) The hush-money caseTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump denies Daniels' allegations and maintains his innocence.This conviction makes Trump the first former president convicted of a crime and the first convicted individual elected president.The case revolves around how Trump reimbursed his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the payment to Daniels. Cohen called the judge’s decision “judicious and appropriate.”Trump’s legal team previously attempted to overturn the conviction based on a Supreme Court immunity decision and sought to move the case to federal court, but both efforts were unsuccessful.Trump's other federal casesThis case is the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to reach trial. Two federal cases, one related to the 2020 election and the other to classified documents, have been dismissed by special counsel Jack Smith. A state election interference case in Georgia is currently on hold. Trump's lawyers argued the dismissal of the federal cases warranted dismissal of the New York hush-money case, but Judge Merchan disagreed, saying that the hush-money case was in a “vastly” different stage.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is set to be sentenced on January 10 in his hush money case, days before his return to the White House. Despite a felony conviction, Judge Merchan indicated Trump would not face jail time, balancing justice with Trump's ability to govern.

He’s very supportive of me. He’s very supportive of the party.\n\n“He sees Robinson as one of these people that fought against the grooming gangs. But of course the truth is Tommy Robinson’s in prison not for that, but for contempt of court.”\n\nOn whether Reform UK would accept support from Robinson – whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – in the future, Mr Farage replied: “We’re a political party aiming to win the next general election. He’s not what we need.”\n\nThe MP for Clacton in Essex added that Mr Musk, who backed Donald Trump’s winning campaign in last year’s US presidential election, “is helping us all right”.\n\nHe will help us enormously because he’s a hero figure, especially for the youth who really do admire this man and if it comes to him helping us financially, that’s fantasticNigel Farage on Elon Musk\n\nMr Farage said: “It’s a mixture of things as to how he fought that ground campaign for the Republicans in the key states, seven key states, and that was the task that he picked up, so we’ve learned a lot from that.\n\n“He will help us enormously because he’s a hero figure, especially for the youth who really do admire this man and if it comes to him helping us financially, that’s fantastic.”\n\nOn calls for a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham, Mr Farage said he wanted a “full public inquiry with the glare of publicity”.\n\nHome Office minister Jess Phillips previously denied requests from Oldham Council to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in the borough.\n\nIn a letter to the authority in Greater Manchester, Ms Phillips said she believes it is “for Oldham Council alone to decide to commission an inquiry into child sexual exploitation locally, rather than for the Government to intervene”.\n\nAn Oldham Council spokesman previously said: “Survivors sit at the heart of our work to end child sexual exploitation. Whatever happens in terms of future inquiries, we have promised them that their wishes will be paramount, and we will not renege on that pledge.”","url":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/news/national/tommy-robinson-not-what-we-need-says-reform-uk-leader-nigel-farage-124428/","image":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/_media/img/CKNK2C7MOI21QX0HUGXB.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:07:17","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":278118128,"title":"AI will be 'big disruptor' in world of weather forecasting, says head of Met Éireann","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

GenCast only needs eight minutes to produce a 15-day forecast, a process that ordinarily can take hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Instead of running traditional models on supercomputers, you can have more forecasts – what we call an ensemble of forecasts,” Sherlock said.\n\n“The more times you run a model, the more confidence you can have in the output. Let’s say you run it 100 times and 90 of the models are saying there’s going to be a Red-warning level wind event in Cork – then you’ve more confidence, there’s less uncertainty. That’s something that machine learning and AI will do.”\n\nClimate change\n\nProfessor Andrew Parnell of University College Dublin, who is leading a new research programme at Met Éireann aimed at developing weather and climate services for Ireland using AI and data science, has said that AI can “play a vital role in understanding the impacts of our emissions and providing predictions of future extreme weather events”.\n\nIt poses problems too, though. Training and using artificial intelligence takes massive amounts of energy, often powered by fossil fuels that release harmful greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nThe escalation of climate change means that Ireland is likely to experience more extreme weather events, such as storms, more frequently and with more intensity.\n\nThe first four months of the 2024/2025 storm season, which began in September, brought four storms to Ireland: Aisling, Bert, Connall and Darragh.\n\nStorm Darragh felled trees, brought strong gusts of wind, and knocked off power to thousands of properties just weeks before Christmas.\n\n“Storm Darragh was dragged along by a jet stream at 200 knots per hour and that’s why it was so energetic and such strong winds,” Eoin Sherlock explained, speaking to The Journal as part of a wide-ranging interview.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nGet The Journal's monthly climate newsletter delivered to your inbox\n\nAs he looked back on some of the main weather events of the year, Sherlock said: “Darragh was really impactful. The winds came from the northwest direction and that’s unusual, because usually the predominant flow for us is southwesterly, so you had trees that had survived a long period of time and then all of a sudden, a wind that they’ve never seen before comes down.”\n\nMet Éireann is setting up a research proposal on future storms to look at how certain levels of climate change would impact different types of storms.\n\n“Global average temperatures have increased by 1.1 degree since 1900. For every degree of temperature rise, there’s 7% more moisture in the atmosphere, and that moisture in the atmosphere falls down as rain,” Sherlock said.\n\n“We know from our colleagues in climate modelling that we can expect some more severe storms and we’re seeing that,” he said. “Those storms, over a big fetch across the Atlantic, can bring high waves, and as sea levels increase, there’s also more chance of coastal inundation.”\n\nMet Éireann has started to transition to focusing its weather warnings on not just the type of weather on the way but also, importantly, the impacts that it threatens.\n\n“We’ll say what impacts there could be, like flooding, coastal inundation, or trees down due to wind,” Sherlock explained.\n\n“The plan is to move from what the weather will be to what the weather will do. We tried to do that for Storm Bert where we were warning about west Cork and west Galway – there were landslides in Galway and very heavy rain in Cork. We’re trying to give people a steer about where we think the significant impacts will be.”\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nThe Journal's climate change newsletter\nFollow the biggest news story of our times.

Radical change and overhaul of all our public bodies.\n\n“And bring in criminal accountability for all our senior police and public officials who have turned a blind eye.\n\n“Those with vested interests who pop up when this hits the headlines then fade away again when it all dies down will not bring change. They’re in it for themselves I believe.\n\n“Conservatives and Labour are all equally to blame imo (in my opinion), and Keir Starmer as former DPP is perhaps as guilty as anyone I know in where we find ourselves today.\n\n“We all know what’s going on, but I don’t trust a single one of those who to date have been entrusted with keeping our children safe and prosecuting serial rapists. They’ve failed. Repeatedly. Knowingly. Criminally.”\n\nTesla owner Mr Musk, a key member of incoming US President Donald Trump’s inner circle, also suggested that safeguarding minister Jess Phillips “deserves to be in prison” after she denied requests for the Home Office to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham on Thursday.\n\nInstead Ms Phillips said, in a letter to the local council, Oldham must follow in the footsteps of other towns like Rotherham and Telford and commission its own inquiry into historical abuse of children.\n\nWhistleblower Sara Rowbotham, co-ordinator of the Crisis Intervention Team set up to support young people in Rochdale, expressed frustration at Mr Musk’s posts about the scandal on X, which he owns.\n\nShe told The Guardian: “What is (Musk’s) motivation for interfering? It seems very political.\n\n“The person he is trying to go after is Keir Starmer – it is a political swipe that is nothing to do with the women and girls who have been abused time after time.”\n\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse, which published its final report in 2022, described the sexual abuse of children as an “epidemic that leaves tens of thousands of victims in its poisonous wake”.\n\nLed by Professor Alexis Jay, the inquiry looked into abuse by organised groups following multiple convictions of sexual offences against children across the UK between 2010-2014, including in Rotherham, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Rochdale and Bristol.\n\nIn November last year, Professor Jay said she felt “frustrated” that none of the probe’s 20 recommendations had been implemented more than two years after its conclusion.\n\nThe Labour Party and Number 10 have been approached for comment.","summary":"Maggie Oliver criticised previous inquiries into the scandal.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-elon-musk-oldham-prime-minister-conservatives-b1202906.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/04/00/4a411b5e3a4db0b0e25676daa673c305Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM2MDMzODIy-2.78595627.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:04:05","author":"Ted Hennessey","authors":["Ted Hennessey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":278115914,"title":"Republicans re-elect Mike Johnson as US House speaker in nail-biting vote","text":"The United States House of Representatives has re-elected Republican Mike Johnson as its speaker, in a vote seen as a nail-biting test of party unity in advance of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term in the White House.\n\nBut Johnson’s campaign to keep the speaker’s gavel was not without its bumps on Friday.\n\nJohnson emerged victorious after an uncertain first round of voting, as some members of his party initially withheld their votes over issues like his role in the recent bipartisan budget negotiations.\n\nHe ultimately won the speakership with 218 votes out of a total of 435, after two of the holdouts — Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas — changed their votes.\n\nAnother 215 votes, all Democratic, went to minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. Representative Thomas Massie, who had pledged to refuse Johnson, cast his vote for fellow Republican Tom Emmer.\n\nThe tight vote underscored the narrow margin of control Republicans have over the chamber. With only 219 seats in the House, Republicans will need nearly every vote they have to reach a majority in a party-line vote.\n\nThat may give certain far-right members greater sway over legislation, as they exercise their leverage.\n\nFriday’s vote for Johnson also put Trump’s ability to muster Republican votes under the microscope. He had called on the party to back Johnson, as he prepares to pursue an ambitious agenda of tax cuts and mass deportation when he takes office on January 20.\n\nA new Congress for 2025\n\nThe vote for the speakership came on the first day of the 119th Congress, following November’s general election. Republicans hold majorities in both the House and the Senate, after flipping the upper chamber from Democratic control.\n\nThe race for the speakership was expected to be a nail-biter as the House gathered for its first session of the new year.\n\nSeveral Republicans had pledged in the lead-up to the session to reject Johnson, particularly after he led a bipartisan push to pass a temporary budget bill in December.\n\nSome objected to the lack of spending cuts. Others felt frustration that the bill did not address the federal borrowing limit, as President-elect Trump had demanded.\n\nBut on Friday morning, top Republicans appeared to rally around Johnson, including Trump himself.\n\n“Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support,” Trump wrote on social media.\n\n“A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!!”\n\nWhile Trump had previously endorsed Johnson, he had also said the “others are very good, too”.\n\nLater, on the House floor, Representative Lisa McClain, another leading Republican, gave a speech to nominate Johnson. She placed his leadership in the context of broader party priorities.\n\n“We have the opportunity to put America first again. We have an opportunity to do something about crime. We have an opportunity to do something about the border. And we have an opportunity to take care of our veterans,” McClain said.\n\nShe briefly appeared to acknowledge the possibility of party discord over the vote.\n\n“No speaker is perfect. And no one will ever be. However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way. None of us will get exactly what we want,” McClain said.\n\nJohnson himself exuded an air of confidence when he arrived at the Capitol on Friday, having spent the night seeking to win over hardline holdouts.\n\n“We don’t have time for drama,” Johnson said as he walked into the Capitol on Friday.\n\nA tight vote\n\nNevertheless, after the roll-call vote was held, Johnson was initially shy of the 218 votes needed for victory.\n\nThree Republicans initially cast their votes for other candidates. Norman tapped Jim Jordan, Massie backed Emmer and Self put forward Byron Donalds.\n\nSeveral other Republicans — including Chip Roy of Texas, another Johnson critic — offered no vote at all. But when asked after the first vote if they would back a candidate, Roy and others supported Johnson.\n\nA group of Republicans — including several holdouts — briefly left the House floor with Johnson to negotiate. When they returned, Norman and Self changed their vote.\n\nIn a Friday post on the social media platform X, Massie explained why he would remain a holdout, voting “hell no” on Johnson’s leadership. He expressed fear Johnson would not be able to enact Trump’s legislative priorities.\n\n“President Trump’s agenda needs to become law. Speaker Johnson has already demonstrated he is not the man who can get that done,” Massie wrote.\n\nTrump agenda\n\nThe speakership election comes after Republicans also elected John Thune as the Senate’s majority leader, with Chuck Schumer representing the Democratic minority in the chamber.\n\nThune has pledged to shepherd through Trump’s agenda, despite the fact that Republicans hold only 53 seats in the 100-person chamber. That falls short of the 60-vote supermajority needed to overcome the filibuster, a means for the minority to stall or scuttle legislation.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress will be faced with several controversial pieces of legislation this upcoming year, setting the stage for heated battles.\n\nCongress will need to revisit the question of funding the federal government when the current budget bill expires in March. And it will also need to weigh raising the debt ceiling — the amount the federal government is able to borrow — later this year.\n\nThe federal government already has more than $36 trillion in debt, and many congressional Republicans are expected to demand significant spending cuts going forward.\n\nThe election of a House speaker, once considered a ho-hum ceremony, has become increasingly contentious in recent years. In 2023, the chamber went through 15 rounds of voting over four days before electing Kevin McCarthy to the role.\n\nJohnson, a low-profile conservative Christian lawyer from Louisiana, was elevated to speaker after the party ousted McCarthy in the middle of his term.\n\nIn the wake of his re-election, Johnson pledged to “reject business as usual” in the House.\n\n“We’re going to drastically cut back the size and scope of government,” he said in a speech to members.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/republicans-re-elect-mike-johnson-as-us-house-speaker-in-nail-biting-vote/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/01/AP25003635425897-1735926752-N0dj7v.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:03:43","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":0.094},{"id":278115900,"title":"New York judge sets Trump’s sentencing in hush-money case for January 10","text":"United States President-elect Donald Trump is set to face a sentencing hearing for his criminal conviction in New York, mere days before he will be sworn in for a second term in the White House.\n\nOn Friday, Judge Juan Merchan issued a written decision calling for Trump to appear, either in person or virtually, on January 10 to receive his sentence.\n\nMerchan also denied Trump’s bid to dismiss his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to a hush-money payment made during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump had pushed to have the conviction overturned, in light of his successful bid for re-election in November’s presidential race.\n\nMore details to come.","url":"https://stvincenttribune.com/new-york-judge-sets-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-for-january-10/","image":"https://stvincenttribune.com/app/uploads/2025/01/AFP__20250101__36RQ9F3__v1__HighRes__SkoreaPoliticsProbeYoon-1735702169_286589-1735705224-W4q6Ta.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:03:43","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vc","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":278116936,"title":"Trump upset US flags will be half-staff on inauguration","text":"President-elect Donald Trump is complaining that American flags will still be lowered to half-staff in honour of the late President Jimmy Carter during his January 20 inauguration.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ordered flags lowered to half-staff for 30 days from the day of Carter's death on December 29, as is custom when a US president dies.\n\nTrump, who has announced plans to attend Carter's memorial service in Washington on January 9, took issue in a Truth Social post on Friday with the flags remaining in the mourning position during his swearing-in ceremony.\n\n\"The Democrats are all 'giddy' about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at 'half mast' during my Inauguration,\" Trump said, employing a term frequently used for the lowered position when the flag is on a ship.\n\n\"They think it's so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don't love our Country, they only think about themselves,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said that due to Carter's death last week the American flag would \"for the first time ever during an Inauguration of a future President, be at half mast.\"\n\n\"Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it.

The standoff sparked fresh turmoil signaling trouble ahead under unified GOP control of Washington.\n\nIn the end, however, Johnson was able to flip two remaining holdouts who switched to support him, drawing applause from Republicans.\n\nAs the most recent speaker, Johnson's grip on the gavel threatens not only his survival but President-elect Trump's ambitious agenda of tax cuts and mass deportations as Republicans sweep to power.\n\nNewly-elected House lawmakers started casting votes as Johnson's name was put forward for nomination by the GOP Conference Chair Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich.\n\n\"No speaker's perfect,\" she said. But the goal is to make progress toward shared priorities for the country, she said. \"None of us will get exactly what we want.\"\n\nDemocrats put forward their own leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, as the only one with a track record of compromise and achievement in the face of \"chaos and dysfunction\" under the GOP majority.\n\n\"House Democrats are united behind the most powerful legislative leader in this chamber,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., of Jeffries, recounting the many times their votes bailed out Johnson to ensure passage of important legislation.\n\nWith opposition from his own GOP colleagues, Johnson arrived with outward confidence after working into the night to sway hardline holdouts. A flop by Johnson could throw Monday's congressional certification of Trump's 2024 election victory into turmoil without a House speaker. Even backing from Trump himself, usually a sure bet for Republicans, was no guarantee Johnson would stay in power.\n\n\"We don't have time for drama,\" Johnson said as he walked into the Capitol.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican received a renewed nod of support from Trump. \"A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nWhat was once a ceremonial day with newly elected lawmakers arriving to be sworn into office, often with family, friends and children in tow, has evolved into a high-stakes vote for the office of House speaker, among the most powerful elected positions in Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris was swearing in the senators.\n\nWhile the Senate is able to convene on its own and has already elected party leaders -- Sen. John Thune as the Republican majority leader and Sen. Chuck Schumer for the Democratic minority -- the House must first elect its speaker, a role required by the Constitution, second in the line of succession to the president.\n\nCongress has been here before, when it took Republicans nearly a week and 15 rounds of voting to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker in 2023, a spectacle unseen in modern times. McCarthy was then dumped by his party, a historic first, but he was also part of a long list of GOP speakers chased to early exits.\n\nThe stakes are higher this year as Trump prepares to return to the White House with the House and Senate in GOP control and promising to deliver big on a 100-day agenda.\n\nJohnson has been working diligently to prevent defeat, spending New Year's Day at Mar-a-Lago as he positions himself alongside Trump. The speaker often portrays himself as the \"quarterback\" who will be executing the political plays called by the \"coach,\" the president-elect.\n\nBut Johnson also warned that without a House speaker there would be a \"constitutional crisis\" heading into Jan. 6, when Congress by law is required to count the electoral votes for president, weeks before Trump is set to be inaugurated Jan. 20.\n\n\"We don't have any time to waste, and I think that everybody recognizes that,\" he said.\n\nJohnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, having lost seats in the November election. With the sudden resignation of Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the tally dropped to 219-215. That leaves Johnson relying on almost every Republican for support in the face of Democratic opposition, though the typical 218 majority of 435 members needed could shift with absences and others voting only \"present.\"\n\nHeading into Friday he did not have the full support needed.\n\nTexas GOP Rep. Chip Roy was among the most notable holdouts, an unflinching member of the Freedom Caucus who lashed into Republican leadership's handling of the year-end spending bill for failing to cut spending and adhere to House rules.\n\n\"Something MUST change,\" Roy posted on social media. He eventually voted for Johnson.\n\nOne hard no was Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who voted for a different GOP Leader, as did other far-right Republicans, including some who helped topple McCarthy.\n\nWhat's unclear is what other concessions Johnson can make to win support. Two years ago, McCarthy handed out prime favors that appeared to only weaken his hold on power.\n\nAlready, Johnson has clawed back one of those changes, with a new House rule pushed by centrist conservatives that would require at least nine members of the majority party on any resolution to oust the speaker -- raising the threshold McCarthy had lowered to just one.\n\n\"I think the holdouts are going to have to realize that, listen, Trump is right all the time,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, exiting the speaker's office late Thursday. \"Just know that Trump is right all the time, it'll help you make a decision real simple.\"\n\nIn many ways, Johnson has no choice but to endure political hazing by his colleagues, as they remind him who has leverage in their lopsided relationship. He was a last-ditch choice for the office, rising from the back bench once other leaders failed in the aftermath of McCarthy's ouster.\n\nDemocrats under Jeffries are not expected not help save Johnson, as they have in the past with their votes when he faced a threat of removal.\n\nThe speaker's election is set to dominate the opening of the new Congress, which also brings a roster of history-making members, as the Senate expects to quickly begin hearings on Trump's nominees for top Cabinet and administrative positions.\n\nIn the Senate, two Black women -- Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland -- were being sworn in, both wearing suits in white of the suffragettes, the first time in the nation's history two Black women senators will serve at the same time.\n\nSen.-elect Andy Kim of New Jersey also is making history as the first Korean American to join the chamber.\n\nIn the House, Sarah McBride is the first openly transgender person in Congress.\n\nAnd Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who recently suffered a fall overseas and underwent hip replacement surgery, will make her own return to Washington, a reminder of the power she wielded when Democrats last held the majority.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/jan/03/mike-johnson-now-has-enough-votes-to-become-house-speaker/","image":"https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/01/03/AP25003613744662_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:02:15","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":278115678,"title":"Judge sets Trump&#x27;s sentencing in hush money case for Jan. 10, but signals no jail time","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — In an extraordinary turn, a judge Friday set President-elect Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for Jan. 10 — a little over a week before he's due to return to the White House — but promised not to jail him.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump’s trial, signaled in a written decision that he'd sentence the former and future president to what's known as a conditional discharge, in which a case gets dismissed if a defendant avoids rearrest.\n\nThe development marks yet another twist in the singular case.\n\nTrump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong.\n\nAfter Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.\n\nTrump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional “disruptions” to the incoming president’s ability to run the country.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insisted the conviction should stand.\n\nThey suggested various options, such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases.\n\nTrump takes office Jan. 20.","url":"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/jan/03/judge-sets-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-for-jan-10-but-signals-no-jail-time/","image":"https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/01/03/AP24345686164055_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-04 00:02:15","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.666},{"id":278120170,"title":"TikTok knew its live-streams exploit children, Utah lawsuit claims","text":"TikTok has long known its video live-streams encourage sexual conduct and exploit children yet turned a blind eye because it “profited significantly” from them, according to newly unsealed material in a lawsuit by the state of Utah.\nThe accusations were made public on Friday, ahead of a January 19 ban on TikTok in the United States unless its China-based owner, ByteDance, sells the popular social media app.\nUS president-elect Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to put that ban on hold. TikTok, for its part, has said it prioritises safe live-streaming.\nUtah’s original lawsuit accusing TikTok of exploiting children was filed last June by the state’s Division of Consumer Protection, with state Attorney General Sean Reyes saying the TikTok Live streaming feature created a “virtual strip club” by connecting victims to adult predators in real time.\nCiting internal TikTok employee communications and compliance reports, Friday’s largely unredacted complaint said TikTok learned of the threats Live posed through a series of internal reviews into the feature.\nIt said an investigation known as Project Meramec uncovered in early 2022 how hundreds of thousands of 13-to-15-year-olds bypassed Live’s minimum-age restrictions.\nIt said many children were then allegedly “groomed” by adults to perform sexual acts, sometimes involving nudity, in exchange for virtual gifts.\n\nThe complaint also said an investigation launched in 2021, Project Jupiter, found that criminals used Live to launder money, sell drugs and fund terrorism including by Islamic State.\nIn addition, an internal December 2023 study “documented what TikTok admits is ‘the cruelty’ of maintaining Live with its current risks for minors on the app”, the complaint said.\nTikTok had fought the disclosures, citing confidentiality concerns and its interest in “preventing potential bad actors from getting a road map” to misuse the app.\nA Utah state judge, Coral Sanchez, ordered the release of much of the previously redacted material on December 19.\n“This lawsuit ignores the number of proactive measures that TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support community safety and well-being,” a TikTok spokesperson said on Friday.\n“Instead, the complaint cherry-picks misleading quotes and outdated documents and presents them out of context, which distorts our commitment to the safety of our community,” the spokesperson added.\nIn October, a bipartisan group of 13 US states and Washington separately sued TikTok for allegedly exploiting children and addicting them to the app.\n“Social media is too often the tool for exploiting America’s young people,” Reyes said in a statement on Friday.\n“Thanks to Judge Sanchez’s ruling, more of TikTok’s shocking conduct will now be public through this unredacted complaint,” he added. “[The] full extent of its culpability can be demonstrated at trial.”\nUS President Joe Biden signed a law authorising the TikTok ban last April, addressing concern TikTok could gather intelligence on American users and share it with the Chinese government.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether to put the ban on hold on January 10. It is expected to rule quickly.","summary":"Accusations were made public on Friday, ahead of scheduled January 19 ban on TikTok in US unless China-based owner ByteDance sells the app.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3293398/tiktok-knew-its-live-streams-exploit-children-utah-lawsuit-claims","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/04/9cfe6f5d-f84f-468a-a875-d1df412a0140_33ef0981.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-03 23:59:46","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.044}]}
