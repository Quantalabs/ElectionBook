This comes despite the capsule encountering technical issues during its first manned mission in June last year.The culmination of the problems resulted in Williams and Wilmore being 'stranded' at the International Space Station (ISS) for nine months, as opposed to their initial eight-day mission. They only returned to Earth aboard the SpaceX Crew-9 mission to the ISS on March 18, 2025.During a press conference on March 31, they stated their readiness to fly again with Starliner if the opportunity arises. \"Yes, because we will address all the issues we faced,\" said Williams in a video of the press conference reported by Space.She stated that she will address it. She is confident that the mission will be successful. The reason being the full commitment from Boeing and NASA. \"And with that, I will soon step into it,\" she added.Wilmore added that Starliner is an incredible spacecraft with many capabilities that other spacecraft do not have. \"Witnessing its success and being part of the program is an honor for me,\" he said in the same video.Williams and Wilmore conveyed in the press conference that they will continue their involvement in the Starliner program. According to both of them, they will soon meet with Boeing executives to discuss it.Since being in space, Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly refuted comments of being 'abandoned' and 'stuck' at the ISS. They explained that the extended mission has already been part of their work as astronauts. \"We do not feel abandoned, we do not feel stuck, we do not feel restricted,\" Wilmore said in February in response to statements from the President of the United States, Donald Trump.Separately, NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich said that they are carefully mapping out the next steps for Starliner. Stich also referred to the evaluation of the spacecraft's helium system, which experienced leaks during its previous manned mission.\"We have some candidate seals that we will use. We will go through several scheduled tests in the summer with what we call an 'integrated doghouse' at White Sands (a NASA testing facility in New Mexico),\" Stich said as reported by Space on March 20. 'Doghouse' is the term used by NASA and Boeing for thruster pods in the Starliner service module.Boeing Starliner docked at the International Space Station during the Crewed Flight Test in 2024. Photo: NASAThese tests will be a crucial phase of the next Starliner flight plan. Stitch emphasized that NASA needs to ensure there will be no recurrence of the helium leaks. The issues with the thruster service module that affected Starliner's reaction control system--essential for smooth maneuvers like docking at the ISS--must also be resolved.NASA has not decided whether the next Starliner flight--whenever that may be--will be crewed or not. However, even if it is not, NASA wants the capsule to have the capability to carry crew, \"Which means the entire system is working well,\" Stich said.He continued, NASA plans to give operational certification to Starliner once the next flight stage is successfully completed. \"We really need Boeing for the rotation of crewed space missions using the SpaceX Dragon,\" he added.Editor's Choice: NASA Astronaut's 10-Day Mission Becomes a 9-Month Odyssey, Reunites with FamilyClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"The astronauts are not deterred even after stranded at International Space Station (ISS) for 9 months.

That would be made up of the 34 per cent tariffs announced last week, which are set to kick in tomorrow and which came on top of 20 per cent levies already in place.\n\nMr Trump’s threat of an additional 50 per cent would essentially double the price of any Chinese goods imported to the US.\n\nBut it was likely to bring a sharp reaction from tech firms such as Apple who have been cosying up to the White House but rely on China for their products. Mr Trump stepped up his action despite calls from billionaire investor Bill Ackman – a major backer of the President – and JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon to resolve the crisis amid a market meltdown.\n\nMr Ackman warned the US was heading towards an ‘economic nuclear winter’ as the US tariffs increased the chances of a global recession, while Mr Dimon – often dubbed ‘the world’s most powerful banker’ – warned there may soon be no way back. The developments came as: \n\n London’s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks fell 4.38 per cent, continuing days of sell-offs and losses; Volatile Wall Street stocks staged a $4trillion rally, on reports that Mr Trump was mulling a 90-day reprieve on tariffs, before falling back when the White House dismissed the speculation as ‘fake news’;\n\nThe US was in ‘bear market’ territory – a term investors use when stocks have fallen 20 per cent from a recent high;\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index – dubbed Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’ – hit an eight-month high of 60.13;\n\nEuropean stock markets recorded a third day of losses with Germany’s Dax falling 4.26 per cent and France’s CAC 40 down 4.78 per cent;\n\nAsian markets plunged overnight on Sunday with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing 7.83 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng tumbliing 13.22 per cent, its biggest single-day fall since 1997;\n\n Oil prices hit a four-year low of $64.25 per barrel on fears a global recession would dampen demand;\n\nGold, usually a safe haven in uncertain economic times, fell about 2 per cent to $2,985 an ounce as investors retreated into cash.\n\nDespite the bloodbath in global financial markets and damning criticism from both economists and allies, Mr Trump remained defiant. ‘Be strong, courageous, and patient, and greatness will be the result,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.\n\nHe later threatened Beijing, saying: ‘If China does not withdraw its 34 per cent increase above their already long-term trading abuses by April 8, the United States will impose additional tariffs on China of 50 per cent, effective April 9.\n\n‘Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated.’ Mr Trump described tariffs as ‘a beautiful thing to behold’ and added: ‘I don’t want anything to go down but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something’.\n\nIn the Oval Office alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night, Mr Trump again rejected a pause on tariffs.\n\n‘We’re not looking at that,’ he said and added the US ‘has been ripped off by many countries over the years’. Analysts at independent advisers Pantheon Macro said the President’s comments on China had ‘poured gas on the fire’ and upped the risk of a recession.\n\nMr Ackman, boss of US hedge fund Pershing Square and a Democrat who flipped to support Mr Trump, said: ‘The President is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe – this is not what we voted for.\n\n‘The President has an opportunity to call a time-out and have the time to execute on fixing an unfair tariff system. Alternatively, we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down.’\n\nTesla boss Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and head of the US department of government efficiency, has also stated all is not aligned in the Trump administration’s economic policy.\n\nFollowing his call on Sunday for a ‘free-trade zone between Europe and North America’, Mr Musk yesterday shared a video on his X platform of former Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher adviser Milton Friedman extolling the benefits of free markets and complex supply chains.\n\nMr Musk’s SpaceX is one of those firms said to be pushing for exemptions on tariffs from China.\n\nMr Dimon told his shareholders: ‘The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.’\n\nJPMorgan’s economists raised the risk of a US and global recession this year to 60 per cent from 40 per cent after Mr Trump last week unveiled the steepest trade barriers in more than 100 years.","summary":"Stocks plunged for a third day, yet the US President took aim at Beijing, which said it would impose its own 34 per cent levy on imports of American goods as a retaliatory measure to last week's tolls.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14581841/Trump-escalates-battle-China-trillions-wiped-shares-Beijing-tariffs.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/01/97024459-0-image-m-52_1744073683635.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 01:00:09","author":"Editor,Jessica Clark,Patrick Tooher","authors":["Editor","Jessica Clark","Patrick Tooher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":308753814,"title":"Samsung profit up in Q1 but Trump tariffs cloud chips, smartphones","text":"SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics' operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won ($4.5 billion) in the first quarter, up 1.7% from the previous three months, but U.S. President Donald Trump's recent tariffs and threats of more could hurt the South Korean giant's semiconductor and smartphone businesses.\n\nThe company said in its earnings guidance that revenue during the period increased 4.2% to 79 trillion won.

Trump depends on the might of the U.S. economy, while Xi relies on support from the communist regime’s tight control system.\n\nGiven this, Liao said Xi is disadvantaged because he has little policy room to maneuver.\n\n“Washington has many cards. Beijing has few,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nWhile China was at the top of the list, it didn’t receive the highest rate. Other Southeast Asian countries that Chinese companies use for transshipping, including Vietnam and Cambodia, received nearly 50 percent levies.\n\nHowever, Balding said that the administration’s real target was China.\n\n“I think they want to be much more aggressive with China, but they want to do it very quietly,” he said.\n\n“They did it almost, in a way, to shield China,” he added, referring to the administration’s approach of announcing sweeping global tariffs so the levy on Chinese goods didn’t stand out as much.\n\nBalding noted that Trump applies tariffs differently to other countries than he does to China. In the case of the U.S. tariffs on other nations, the rates are set to encourage negotiations. However, Balding remarked that the tariffs imposed on China are so high that negotiations are very hard for Beijing.\n\nThree countries were on the receiving end of the earlier 25-percent fentanyl tariffs: Canada, Mexico, and China.\n\nThe two North American countries were exempted from last week’s reciprocal tariffs. The White House said Canada and Mexico will remain on the fentanyl tariff regime and move to the reciprocal tariff regime after they reach a bilateral agreement with the United States.\n\nBy comparison, China received a reciprocal levy in addition to the fentanyl tariffs. Most Chinese imports are now subjected to a more than 60 percent levy; the amount Trump talked about on the campaign trail.\n\nAccording to Balding, such a steep tariff at the start of the negotiation makes it very difficult for Xi to reach any deal. The Chinese leader, he said, would have to make a lot of concessions to the United States—compromises that Xi isn’t willing to give—for Washington to cut the rate by half. Even if that were to happen, the remaining half would still be too high for China to bear, Balding added.\n\n“What does Trump want? It seems to me he is basically saying, ‘Let’s just decouple everything as much as we can from China,’” the expert said.\n\nSince Trump returned to the White House, many of his foreign policies have been directly and indirectly driven by China.\n\n“Basically [Trump] said, ‘I can’t let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them,'” Lutnick said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama as part of his first official foreign trip. Shortly after, Panama said it would not renew its agreement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a geopolitical platform for the CCP to expand its global influence.\n\nDuring the first administration, Trump took two years to negotiate and sign a “phase one” trade deal with China. Eventually, Beijing did not fulfill its pledge to buy an additional $200 billion in U.S. products over two years.\n\nLiao said the CCP’s strategy is to draw things out. For example, it may take two years to reach an agreement and another year for Washington to discover that Beijing hasn’t made good on its promises.\n\nUnder this cycle, the United States bears the cost of such delays.\n\nThis time around, by imposing the tariffs upfront, Trump has immediately put the cost on Xi, Liao said.\n\nBalding agrees.\n\n“If you want to draw this out for years and years—go ahead,” Balding said, describing Trump’s approach. “We’re going to impose enormous amounts of pain very early on so that if you want to draw it out, you’re drawing out your pain.”\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China was about $300 billion last year. That means the negative impact of a 34 percent tariff will be felt much more sharply in China than in the United States.\n\nThat’s partly why Trump has been pursuing critical minerals in Ukraine, Liao said. Eventually, when the prices of these raw materials for weapons and electronics are no longer kept artificially low due to China’s monopoly, he added, more companies will join the processing businesses.\n\nAccording to U.S.-based economist Davy J. Wong, the United States and China are not in a trade war, but a battle for resetting the international trade protocol and even the world order.\n\nFor Xi, the resilience of the communist political system is the key, according to Liao. Chinese people will become poorer and more dissatisfied. However, if the communist apparatus keeps a lid on the people, Xi could hold out.\n\nTrump’s pain would come from the U.S. economy, Liao said. If the economy can survive the initial shock and voters don’t lose patience with Trump, he can remain focused on standing firm against the CCP.\n\nThe U.S. stock market experienced large drops last week, driven mainly by the uncertainty of the global reciprocal tariffs. With the biggest three-day decline since the summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, more than $6 trillion in value evaporated in the equity market.\n\nThe stock market upheaval has added pressure on the White House and Trump, who has often credited the administration’s work for the rise of the stock market.\n\nBalding said Trump will most likely hold out while the stock market adjusts because the U.S. government is prioritizing national security, which is different to Wall Street’s focus on business profits.\n\nThe president has also tied the U.S.–China trade imbalance to national security, saying that Beijing uses its massive surplus with the United States to fund the military.\n\n“We don’t want that. I don’t want them to take $500 [billion], $600 billion a year and spend it on their military,” Trump said in the Oval Office on April 7.\n\nBoth Balding and Yeh believe that if Trump can negotiate agreements with key countries—such as Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan—to significantly reduce tariffs within the next month, businesses will gain more certainty. This would contribute to stabilizing the stock market.\n\nWashington holds more cards, Liao said.\n\nIn addition to further hiking tariffs, Liao said the United States could apply more pressure to the CCP by uniting with China’s neighbors who don’t like the regime, such as Vietnam and India. The United States could also take a human rights approach and release a report about the origins of COVID-19 or publicize evidence of the forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience and ethnic minorities in China.","summary":"Experts say the tariff standoff is beyond economic conflict; Trump and Xi are contesting U.S. economic might versus communist political control.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/why-us-has-upper-hand-over-beijing-in-tariff-standoff-5838158","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/07/id5838335-Trump-Xi-Tariff-battle-13-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:53:16","author":"Terri Wu","authors":["Terri Wu"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.123},{"id":308755580,"title":"Tariffs will protect the American steel industry, says Pennsylvania steelworker","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air April 07, 2025 05:46 \n\n Tariffs will protect the American steel industry, says Pennsylvania steelworker \n Panelists Brian Pannebecker and Brian Pavlack share how steel and auto workers are largely in support of President Donald Trump’s tariff plan and how it will benefit the industries on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Panelists Brian Pannebecker and Brian Pavlack share how steel and auto workers are largely in support of President Donald Trump’s tariff plan and how it will benefit the industries on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371196347112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/bef09727-1c9e-4652-b91a-34fa996f3ffb/e4f63098-8fcf-4891-abc6-45961eda617e/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:49:58","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":308753034,"title":"World News | Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Index Up 5.5% as World Markets Gyrate Under Tariffs Uncertainty","text":"Bangkok, Apr 8 (AP) Asian markets opened higher on Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 share benchmark up 5.5% after it fell nearly 8% a day earlier.

Asian markets plunged on Monday, with stocks in Hong Kong diving 13.2% for their worst day since 1997, during the Asian financial crisis. The S&P 500 ended down 0.2% on Monday as battered financial markets watched to see what Trump will do next in his trade war. If other countries agree to trade deals, he could lower his tariffs and avoid a possible recession. But if he sticks with tariffs for the long haul, stock prices may fall further. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349 points, or 0.9%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by 0.1%. All three indexes started the day sharply lower, and the Dow plunged as many as 1,700 points following even worse losses elsewhere in the world. But it suddenly surged to a gain of nearly 900 points in the late morning. The S&P 500, meanwhile, went from a loss of 4.7% to a leap of 3.4%, which would have been its biggest jump in years. The sudden rise followed a false rumor that Trump was considering a 90-day pause on his tariffs, one that a White House account on X quickly labeled as “fake news.” That a rumor could move trillions of dollars' worth of investments shows how much investors are hoping to see signs that Trump may let up on tariffs. Stocks quickly turned back down, and shortly afterward, Trump dug in further and said he may raise tariffs more against China after the world's second-largest economy retaliated last week with its own set of tariffs on U.S. products. Trump's tariffs are an attack on the globalization that's remade the world's economy, which helped bring down prices for products on the shelves of U.S. stores but also caused production jobs to leave for other countries. He has given several reasons for his stiff tariffs, including to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, which is a process that could take years. Trump on Sunday said he wanted to bring down the numbers for how much more the United States imports from other countries versus how much it sends to them. Indexes nevertheless did keep swinging between losses and gains Monday after Trump's latest tariff threat, in part because investors are still hoping negotiations may forestall actual implementation of the stiff duties on all imports. All that seemed certain Monday was the financial pain hammering investments around the world for a third day after Trump announced tariffs in his “Liberation Day.” A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude oil dipped below $60 during the morning for the first time since 2021, hurt by worries that a global economy weakened by trade barriers will burn less fuel.

But we do not reach those arguments.'\n\nIn a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of U.S. immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. \n\nThey argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorizes removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act authorizes the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi hailed the court's decision as 'a landmark victory for the rule of law' and criticized Boasberg as an activist judge who exceeded his powers.\n\n'The Department of Justice will continue fighting in court to make America safe again,' Bondi said in a social media post.\n\nOn March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a 'Radical Left Lunatic' and a 'troublemaker and agitator.'\n\nThe D.C. Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that 'Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here.' Ensign responded, 'We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy.'\n\nFamily members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said U.S. officials had wrongly labeled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honor his favorite team, Real Madrid.","summary":"President Donald Trump scored a huge win in his efforts to deport illegal migrants living in the United States illegally, as the Supreme Court ruled in his favor.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14581771/Trump-Supreme-Court-deport-illegal-migrants-Alien-Enemies-Act.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/01/97023769-0-image-a-17_1744071774316.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:44:18","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig,Reuters","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig","Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":308752998,"title":"Trump says U.S. will have ‘direct’ talks with Iran over nuclear program","text":"President Donald Trump said Monday that Iran and the United States have begun direct talks over Tehran’s nuclear program, contradicting Iranian leaders’ rejection of the idea just hours before he spoke.\n\n“We’re having direct talks with Iran, and they’ve started.

Israel, one of the US's major non-NATO allies, faces a 17% tariff.\"We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,\" Netanyahu told reporters in the Oval Office following a private meeting with Trump. \"We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\"\"Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,\" Netanyahu said, adding, \"I'm a free-trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade.\"In 2024, the US exported $14.8 billion worth of goods to Israel and imported $22.2 billion worth of goods from Israel, totaling a $7.4 billion goods trade deficit for the year, an 8.6% increase from 2023, according to US trade data.In 2023, the three main goods that Israel exported to the US were diamonds, integrated circuits (also known as microchips), and broadcasting equipment, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.In turn, the biggest products the US exported to Israel the same year were diamonds, explosive ammunition, and packaged medicaments (essentially retail pharmaceutical products), according to data compiled by OEC.For his part, Trump told reporters during the appearance with Netanyahu that the US will \"maybe not\" reduce its tariffs against Israel.\"Well, we're talking about a whole new trade — maybe not, maybe not. Now, don't forget we help Israel a lot. You know, we give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot,\" Trump said, referring to the military assistance the US sends to Israel.The US and Israel have had a free-trade agreement in place since 1985, and the US is Israel's single largest trading partner.Last week, in what may have been an effort to avoid new tariffs from Trump, Netanyahu wrote in a post on X — just one day before Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement — that he would be eliminating all remaining tariffs on American goods.Netanyahu said after the meeting with Trump that Israel would also work to \"eliminate trade barriers\" between the two countries.","summary":"Netanyahu said he will eliminate Israel's trade deficit with the US, which totaled $7.4 billion in goods in 2024.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/exports-israel-us-netanyahu-trump-meeting-eliminate-trade-deficit-2025-4","image":"https://i.insider.com/67f4552fc6ad288d147d796a?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:35:01","author":"Grace Eliza Goodwin,Kelsey Vlamis","authors":["Grace Eliza Goodwin","Kelsey Vlamis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.156},{"id":308750318,"title":"Asian markets open higher despite Trump's latest China tariffs threat","text":"Sakshi VenkatramanReporting from New York\n\nOn April 2, US President Donald Trump unveiled a slew of aggressive tariffs on imports from nearly every country in the world, sending shockwaves through global markets. \n\nHe targeted all countries with a standard 10% tariff, but for some of America's biggest trading partners, that number went much higher. \n\nChina was hit with a 54% tariff, for example (although this included some earlier tariffs Trump had ordered).\n\nWhat followed was the worst week the global stock market has experienced since the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe three major US indexes slumped, falling more than 5%.

Often, we see one or two bad days then a rebound. We’re now on day three and the sell-off is intensifying, not dying down.”\n\nTraders also reacted to growing fears of a global recession, with Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs raising the chance to a 45 per cent probability.\n\nUS financier Bill Ackman, who has been a Trump cheerleader, warned the tariffs had caused a “self-induced economic nuclear winter” for the US and urged him to consider a 90-day pause.\n\nEconomic nuclear war\n\nThe billionaire warned: “If, on the other hand . . . we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate.”\n\nBut a fellow billionaire, BlackRock chief Larry Fink, played down the long-term threat of the market turmoil, calling the recent sell-offs as a “buying opportunity”.\n\nThe pain carried into Europe with Germany’s DAX index losing 4.13 per cent and France’s CAC shedding 4.78 per cent.\n\nIn London the FTSE 100 fell by 4.38 per cent. It has lost 11 per cent over three days of trading.\n\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity, said: “The scale of the falls either side of the weekend evoke memories of the 1987 crash.\n\n“At the time of writing, futures markets were pricing in a third consecutive day of heavy falls for the US market. If this is what transpires, this will be one of the worst weeks in the market since Black Monday in 1987.”","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/34344502/trumps-tariff-financial-markets-economy-usa-recession/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/u-s-president-donald-trump-985536200_56e4cd.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:26:29","author":"Harry Cole","authors":["Harry Cole"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":308750024,"title":"Trump threatens new 50% tariffs on China","text":"Donald Trump has threatened China with an additional tariff of 50% on goods imported into the US if it does not withdraw a countermeasure, as global markets tumbled for a third day.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on Monday, the US president said that he was not considering a pause on new tariffs to allow for negotiations with other countries.\n\n\"We're not looking at that.

Kennedy also said he's assembling a task force to focus on the issue. Also on Monday, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \"new scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water. The EPA has primary authority to set the maximum level of fluoridation in public water systems. Also Read | Droupadi Murmu in Lisbon: President Murmu Launches Postage Stamps Commemorating 50 Years of India-Portugal Diplomatic Relations (See Pics). Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in Salt Lake City. Kennedy cannot order communities to stop fluoridation, but he can tell the CDC to stop recommending it and work with the EPA to change the allowed amount.

Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their drinking water. Water systems across the state must stop fluoridation by May 7. Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as “the leader in making America healthy again.” He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state's fluoride law. “I'm very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,” he said. Kennedy oversees the CDC, whose recommendations are widely followed but not mandatory. State and local governments decide whether to add fluoride to water and, if so, how much — as long as it doesn't exceed a maximum set by the EPA, which is currently 4 milligrams per liter. Zeldin said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards. “When this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency's future steps,” Zeldin said. “Secretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks, and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.” Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” and said it has been associated with arthritis, bone breaks and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn. In November, just days before the presidential election, Kennedy declared that Donald Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day as president. That didn't happen, but Trump later picked Kennedy to run the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he has been expected to take some kind of action. Meanwhile, some localities have gone ahead and decisions whether to keep fluoridating water. Related to all this: A massive round of staffing cuts last week across federal agencies included elimination of the CDC's 20-person Division of Oral Health. That office managed grants to local agencies to improve dental health and, in come cases, encourage fluoridation. Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century. About one-third of community water systems — 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. — fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water. But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development. A report last year by the federal government's National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter — more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. — was associated with lower IQs in kids. Utah Oral Health Coalition chairperson Lorna Koci said Monday that she hopes other states push back against the removal of fluoride and that Kennedy's visit to celebrate her state's fluoride ban underscores the political motivations of those who support it. She predicted children will have more cavities as a result and said backers of the fluoride ban in Utah spread false information that raised doubts about its effectiveness. Opponents of the law warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water containing fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. \"This seems to be less about fluoride and more about power,\" Koci said.

I just can't afford to take the hit on that coming into place.'\n\nShe added: 'It's horrible. I feel like the world at the moment is taking the p**s in terms of what's been thrown at us.\n\n'I've been in business eight years and first of all we had Brexit, then we had Covid, and then we had the war, which put all of raw materials up by 50 to 100 per cent.\n\n'So we have to increase all the prices of our shoes to stay in business and then the cost of living crisis hit and now this.'\n\nMs Bailey revealed how she has hired more staff thanks to the growth of her business in the US.\n\nBut she warned: 'If that income isn't coming in then it's too big of a proportion of our business to not have a hit on how the business operates or to have an impact on the staff that I employ.'\n\nShe added: 'Last year, the US market took over the revenue that we got from the UK. Our two main markets are the UK and the US.\n\n'We grew fast on social media and got a bit of PR in America and started getting some brand recognition over there.\n\n'Our US sales really started to ramp up because no one does what we do in the US. We're in a niche. We just couldn't afford to take half of our revenue being wiped out in one go.'\n\nMs Bailey said the tariff marks a 'significant blow' for her brand as well as other US fashion giants such as Nike because America only produces around 1 per cent of the footwear they buy and relies heavily on imports.\n\nMs Bailey continued: 'I feel like it's a ridiculous decision to do a blanket tariff without really understanding what America can actually produce. I get that it's a way of suddenly opening negotiation channels with the whole world on trade and it's a shock to get countries to come to the table and negotiate that.\n\n'But in the meantime, it just means American consumers are just going to have to pay more.'\n\nCalla Shoes make premium quality, stylish shoes for women who have problems with their feet.\n\nThe shoes can cost around $300 and Ms Bailey fears it would be difficult to maintain consumers if they have to hike their costs by 20 per cent to $360 to cover the import hike.\n\nShe fears that the import trade tariff will have a similar impact to Brexit, where she had to stop selling in the US because it became too expensive with importing parcels.\n\n'I'm still a small business at the end of the day, and we just couldn't deal with this.\n\n'The margins are smaller than fashion and footwear. People don't think people really appreciate that. It's not like I'm rolling in piles of cash. I'm not.'\n\nPaulomi Debnath - Handmade by Tinni\n\nTextile jewellery designer Paulomi Debnath is expecting her revenues at her company Handmade by Tinni to plummet by 50 per cent. \n\nWhile she said her customs and shipping costs could rise by as much as 25 per cent.\n\n'The struggle is real,' she told MailOnline. \n\n'As the sole founder and maker behind Handmade by Tinni — a bold and sustainable textile jewellery brand — the impact of new US tariffs could be deeply personal and financially challenging.\n\n'I regularly ship to the United States and collaborate with independent boutiques who stock my handmade pieces. The US has been a growing and exciting market for me, and one that's important for my business' future. \n\n'If new tariffs are introduced on UK imports, it would directly increase shipping and customs costs, making my products more expensive and less accessible for US customers and stockists.'\n\nShe says any added costs could force her to increase her prices 'which risks pushing away customers who already face high international shipping fees'. \n\nMs Debnath said she is unable to absorb any 'unexpected' costs and 'every lost sale or cancelled order makes it harder to reinvest in my business, create new designs, or expand my reach'. \n\nShe added: 'What's worrying is that these tariffs don't just hit big exporters — they directly affect solo creatives like me who are trying to grow their businesses through honest, handmade work. \n\n'The added pressure of tariffs could make trading internationally feel out of reach for many small makers.\n\n'At a time when we're all trying to stay resilient and connected globally, extra barriers like these can be disheartening.'\n\nMartha Keith - Martha Brook \n\nMartha Keith is the owner of London-based stationery firm Martha Brook. Around 15 percent of her sales go through the US and says the country is 'one of the biggest growth areas of our business'.\n\n'One thing that's currently unclear is how much this will affect direct to consumer orders as well as exports,' she said. \n\n'At the moment there is a 'di minimis' threshold of $800, under which businesses don't need to pay any tariffs. \n\n'Trump is removing this for China as a trial and the concern is that he'll expand this wider once he's worked out how to implement it through the US postal system. \n\n'Even if he doesn't, the confusion around this could well affect consumer confidence of Americans ordering from overseas. \n\n'In Etsy, for example, 40 percent of our sales are from the US, so it's a hugely important area of our business.\n\n'In general, this comes at the worst possible time for small businesses with rising costs across the board and US having become an increasingly important market to export to with the increased challenges of sending to the EU post Brexit. \n\n'I'm glad the 10 percent isn't higher but the uncertainty of the impact this will have is another challenge we don't need right now.'\n\nMeanwhile, experts have also warned that Trump's tariffs could not have come at a worse time for the slumping UK economy.\n\nRiz Malik, Independent Financial Adviser at R3 Wealth, said: 'The threat of US tariffs is a major blow to UK exporters, especially the car industry, with Jaguar already halting shipments. \n\n'While Trump is known for sudden U-turns, uncertainty alone is damaging. For a UK economy already under strain, this latest jolt could not come at a worse time.'\n\nHarry Goodliffe, director at HTG Mortgages, said: 'Trump's tariffs, combined with National Insurance hikes and a minimum wage increase, are stacking up the pressure on UK businesses. With costs rising across the board, many will have no choice but to pass them onto consumers, or worse, make tough decisions on jobs. \n\n'It's a perfect storm of increased costs, reduced sales, and a tightening labour market. No business will be immune, and the next few months will be make or break for many. Adapt fast or risk getting left behind.","summary":"Firms have told MailOnline the world is in 'turmoil' and labelled the US President's decision to impose the widespread tariffs as 'ridiculous'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14577075/British-businesses-warn-face-fight-survive-Donald-Trumps-tariffs.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/07/15/97006545-0-image-m-12_1744035936889.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/07/4579445803522505629/1024x576_MP4_4579445803522505629.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:17:17","author":"Arthur Parashar,Editor,Matt Strudwick","authors":["Arthur Parashar","Editor","Matt Strudwick"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":308751336,"title":"U.S. Supreme Court allows deportation of rapid deportations to resume","text":"April 7 (UPI) -- The U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision Monday allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Araragua gang to El Salvador based on the 1798 Allies Enemies Act.\n\nBut the justices ruled that the government must give deportees \"reasonable time\" to challenge their removal in court in the United States before being deported.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on March 28 to lift a lower court order.\n\nThe 25-page opinion vacated a decision by the U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of the District of Columbia on March 24 that blocked use the wartime law with little or no due process. It was a temporary restraining order by the judge appointed by George H.W. Bush. On March 26, the District Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in favor of Boasberg restraining order.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority was Chief Justice John Roberts, and Associate Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Conservative Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined liberals Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nWriting a concurring opinion was Cavanaugh with dissenting opinions by Sotomayor and Jackson.\n\nBarrett, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch were nominated by Donald Trump during his first term as president.\n\nThe five plaintiffs are suspected gang members but were not on the deportation flights. They remain in custody in Texas and appeared before a judge.\n\n\"Regardless of whether the detainees formally request release from confinement, because their claims for relief ''necessarily imply the invalidity' of their confinement and removal under the AEA, their claims fall within the \"core\" of the writ of habeas corpus and thus must be brought in habeas,\" the high court ruled.\n\nThe opinion added: \"the order and percuriam confirm that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, that venue lies in the district of confinement.\"\n\nA three-member appeals court heard arguments for one hour on the same day as Brosbger issued his order to halt flights. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush and Judge Patricia Millett, an appointee of President Barack Obama, ruled in favor of continuing Boasberg's restraining order while Justin Walker, appointed by Donald Trump in his first term, dissented.\n\nBoasberg said use of the Alien Enemies Act \"implicates a host of complicated legal issues\" but didn't decide whether the law was properly invoked.\n\n\"Federal courts are equipped to adjudicate that question when individuals threatened with detention and removal challenge their designation as such,\" he ruled. \"Because the named Plaintiffs dispute that they are members of Tren de Aragua, they may not be deported until a court has been able to decide the merits of their challenge.\"\n\nUnder the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, the Justice Administration believes it has the authority because they are a \"hybrid criminal state\" invading the United States though it has been only invoked in times of declared war against other countries. They were described as the \"worst of the worst.\"\n\nThere were 228 deportations on two flights to El Salvador on March 15, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele announced on social media.\n\nBoasberg ordered the government to turn the planes around in flight but lawyers contend he had no authority to do that.\n\nVenezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello none of the several hundred deported to El Savador's maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center belong to the gang.\n\nU.S. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texa, last week filed impeachment articles against Boasberg. According to the U.S. Constitution, removal is for \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\n\nDespite the judge's order, the Justice Department announced plans to deport three other alleged Tren de Aragua gang members to Chile under the 1798 act. DOJ described Gamez Finol, Miguel Oyola Jimenez and Edgar Javier Benitez Rubio as \"alien enemies\" and the \"illegally entered the United States after allegedy committing horrific crimes in Chile.\"","summary":"The U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision Monday allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Araragua gang to El Salvador based on the 1798 Allies Enemies Act.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/04/07/Supreme-Court-allows-deportations-El-Salvador-reume/3951744068262/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3951744068262/2025/upi/557ba1754932615c852fa6f5f7689006/v1.2/US-Supreme-Court-allows-deportation-of-rapid-deportations-to-resume.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:14:05","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":308755582,"title":"Dems have 'no message' against Trump's tariffs, argues business analyst","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics April 07, 2025 06:51 \n\n Dems have 'no message' against Trump's tariffs, argues business analyst \n Fox News contributors Liz Peek and Deroy Murdock weigh in on Democrats' messaging against President Donald Trump's tariffs and anti-Tesla violence on 'The Bottom Line.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags POLITICSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOS","summary":"Fox News contributors Liz Peek and Deroy Murdock weigh in on Democrats&apos; messaging against President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs and anti-Tesla violence on &apos;The Bottom Line.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371197991112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/c5bc4370-c656-45a8-b202-e915d43c16b2/04368e84-23e0-4ec8-a118-bfdef0344964/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:13:26","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":308749624,"title":"ASX market updates: Investors make cautious return after Monday’s tariff-induced horror show","text":"The Australian stock market is staging a cautious rebound after Monday’s horror show handed local investors the worst drop on the S&P-ASX200 since the early days of the pandemic in May 2020.\n\nThe index opened up 1.1 per cent in the first few minutes of trade to 7426.8 points at 8.20am.\n\nIt closed down 4.23 per cent on Monday as US President Donald Trump showed no sign of rolling back his sweeping global tariffs agenda.\n\nAt the close, the S&P-ASX200 had given up 8 per cent in its past five trading days and was off 10 per cent for 2025 so far.\n\nThe tentative return to positive territory for local stocks followed a wild ride for US markets overnight as Mr Trump dug in his heels on tariffs, warning he could further increase levies on China.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow closed lower after a roller coaster session, with investors worried about an economic slowdown and rising inflation.\n\nTrading volume broke US records for the second session in a row.

Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force. Also Read | Droupadi Murmu in Lisbon: President Murmu Launches Postage Stamps Commemorating 50 Years of India-Portugal Diplomatic Relations (See Pics). According to the officials, Chatfield got a call from Adm Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was told the administration wanted to go in a different direction with the job. The officials said they believe the decision was made last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but it was unclear whether he received any direction from President Donald Trump. Three US officials spoke about the firing on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. Also Read | US Top Court Rejects Extradition Stay Plea of 26/11 Mumbai Terror Attack Accused Tahawwur Rana. Chatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office. Hegseth announced in February that he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti. And Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan just a day after he was sworn in. Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content. Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which sent a letter to Hegseth saying that “purging the woke from the military is imperative.” Chatfield, a Navy helicopter pilot who also commanded a joint reconstruction team in Afghanistan, had been serving as one of the 32 representatives on NATO's military committee. The panel is the primary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council and NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, according to NATO. It serves as the link between the political decision-makers and NATO's military structure.. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing. “Trump's relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world,\" Warner said in a post on X. The campaign to erase DEI programs and online content has been met with questions from lawmakers, local leaders and citizens angered by the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages. The accountability foundation complained in the letter to Hegseth that those responsible for DEI policies \"must be dismissed,” adding that military leaders should be focused on cultivating lethality, not on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The letter said Chatfield posted supportive comments on LinkedIn about a diversity summit and gave a speech in 2015 at Women's Equality Day. The group quoted her as saying that investing in empowering women can unlock human potential. And they also said she was quoted as saying, “our diversity is our strength” — a phrase that Hegseth has repeatedly condemned. A native of Garden Grove, California, Chatfield graduated from Boston University and received her master's degree from Harvard University and a doctorate from the University of San Diego. She deployed to the Pacific and the Persian Gulf as a pilot. She later served as the senior military assistant to the supreme allied commander Europe. She was awarded a Bronze Star.

He warned that this foundation is now under threat from Trump's trade policies and broader \"America First\" foreign policy approach.

He cautioned that fragmentation of Western alliances--both military and economic--could eventually weaken the US itself.\nFurther stressing the interconnected nature of trade and security, Dimon added: \"It is extremely important to recognise that security and economics are interconnected - 'economic' warfare has caused military warfare in the past.\" His remarks suggested that economic isolationism could not be viewed separately from geopolitical consequences, reported CNN.\nThough Dimon has previously warned about global instability--particularly related to the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East--this year's letter marked a notable shift in tone towards US domestic policy. Until now, he had largely avoided direct criticism of Trump's tariffs, suggesting in January that if they helped manufacturing and led to minor inflation, people should \"get over it.\" But with Trump's trade measures expanding significantly, Dimon's stance appears to have hardened.\nEven amid recent market volatility, Dimon warned that a deeper correction could still lie ahead. \"Even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high,\" he wrote.

David Butler, an Army spokesman, said that “it’s too early to say yet whether or not we’re having a parade but we’re working with the White House as well as several government agencies to make the celebration a national level event.”\n\nTrump in his first term proposed having a grand military parade in the U.S. after watching one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Elysees that he wanted a grander one in Washington on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nBut the event never happened due to expected high costs, with one estimate of a $92 million price tag, and logistical hangups.\n\nTrump in 2018 said in a post on the social media site then known as Twitter that he was canceling the event over costs and accused local politicians of price gouging.\n\n“When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it,” he said in his post.\n\nBowser, speaking at a news conference Monday, said she didn't know if the event was being “characterized as a military parade\" but said military tanks rolling through the city's streets “would not be good.”\n\n“If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads,\" she said.\n\nTakis Karantonis, the chair of the Arlington County Board, said in a statement that Secret Service contacted the county on Friday “regarding the possibility of a military parade to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, but no further details were offered.”\n\nKarantonis said it was not clear what the scope of the parade would be but said, “I would hope the Federal Government remains sensitive to the pain and concerns of numerous active military and veteran residents, who have lost or might lose their jobs in recent federal decisions, as they reflect on how best to celebrate the Army’s anniversary.”\n\nThough Bowser was more matter-of-fact in her remarks Monday, the District of Columbia had publicly mocked the idea of a military parade during Trump's first term.\n\nThe D.C.

The court stressed that people deported going forward should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed.\n\nThe court’s three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court’s conservative wing, partially dissented.\n\nTrump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg’s order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected — in other words, anyone else. By granting the president’s request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg’s orders.\n\nCritically, the court made clear in its unsigned order that officials must give migrants subject to Trump’s Alien Enemies Act proclamation adequate notice that they are being removed pursuant to the wartime authority so that they have time to bring habeas complaints.\n\nA key concern among attorneys representing the migrants has been that the government’s rush to remove migrants under the act leaves them with little to no time to file such legal claims.\n\n“The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the justices wrote, adding: “The detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\n window.addEventListener(‘load’, function() { (function(c, id, p, d, w){ var i = d.createElement(‘iframe’); i.height = ‘0’; i.width = ‘0’; i.style = { display: ‘none’, position: ‘absolute’, visibility: ‘hidden’ }; i.src = “https://newsource-embed-prd.ns.cnn.com/articles/cnnvan-stats.html?article_id=”+id+”&category=”+c+”&publisher=”+p+”&url=” + encodeURI(w.location); d.body.appendChild(i); })(“US%20Politics”, “L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtOTdueWF5YjAwMXMyYnBmNnQzcmIxbms%3D”, “21905”, document, window)})\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO’s military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration, U.S. officials said Monday.\n\nAlthough no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force.\n\nAccording to the officials, Chatfield got a call from Adm. Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was told the administration wanted to go in a different direction with the job.\n\nThe officials said they believe the decision was made last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but it was unclear whether he received any direction from President Donald Trump. Three U.S. officials spoke about the firing on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.\n\nChatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office. Hegseth announced in February that he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti. And Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan just a day after he was sworn in.\n\nTrump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content.\n\nChatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which sent a letter to Hegseth saying that “purging the woke from the military is imperative.”\n\nChatfield, a Navy helicopter pilot who also commanded a joint reconstruction team in Afghanistan, had been serving as one of the 32 representatives on NATO’s military committee. The panel is the primary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council and NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group, according to NATO. It serves as the link between the political decision-makers and NATO’s military structure..\n\nSen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing.\n\n“Trump’s relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world,” Warner said in a post on X.\n\nThe campaign to erase DEI programs and online content has been met with questions from lawmakers, local leaders and citizens angered by the removal of military heroes and historic mentions from Defense Department websites and social media pages.\n\nThe accountability foundation complained in the letter to Hegseth that those responsible for DEI policies “must be dismissed,” adding that military leaders should be focused on cultivating lethality, not on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks.\n\nThe letter said Chatfield posted supportive comments on LinkedIn about a diversity summit and gave a speech in 2015 at Women’s Equality Day. The group quoted her as saying that investing in empowering women can unlock human potential.\n\nAnd they also said she was quoted as saying, “our diversity is our strength” — a phrase that Hegseth has repeatedly condemned.\n\nA native of Garden Grove, California, Chatfield graduated from Boston University and received her master’s degree from Harvard University and a doctorate from the University of San Diego.\n\nShe deployed to the Pacific and the Persian Gulf as a pilot. She later served as the senior military assistant to the supreme allied commander Europe. She was awarded a Bronze Star.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – U.S. Navy Vice Adm.

The plan entails spinning off a US entity for TikTok and diluting Chinese ownership, sources have told Reuters.\n“Any qualified divestiture must ensure a clean operational break from ByteDance and TikTok USA, including by preventing either company from continuing to develop, influence, or access personal data or source code,” Warner wrote.\nWarner said the “deal being discussed undermines confidence that the divested app can be trusted to protect national security and ensure compliance with the law”.\n\nTrump has said his administration was in touch with four different groups about a prospective TikTok deal.\nA major stumbling block to any deal for TikTok’s US business is Chinese government approval. China has not publicly agreed to support a sale and Trump’s comments on Friday suggested renewed Chinese opposition.\nSome lawmakers have said Trump must enforce the law, which had required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 unless ByteDance had completed a divestiture of the app’s US assets. Trump began his second term as president on January 20 and opted not to enforce it.\nThe Justice Department in January told Apple and Google that it would not enforce the law, which led them to restore the app for new downloads.","summary":"Trump on Friday said he extended by 75 days a deadline for ByteDance to sell US assets of TikTok to a non-Chinese buyer, or face a ban.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3305587/senator-mark-warner-says-new-trump-tiktok-extension-may-violate-law","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/08/408133b0-ae2d-4eed-a372-f11f33b88bea_c87f301b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:02:15","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":308751960,"title":"Alan Carr leads horrified reactions as host AJ Odudu is forced to tell Mickey Rourke 'stop looking at me!' as he enters Celebrity Big Brother","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Apr 8th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer sacrifice was the most selfless thing I've ever known: Couple who have a baby daughter after womb transplant from sister tearfully tell how their dream was fulfilled after 17 years\n\nTrump says there will be NO pause on tariffs as he tears into countries 'ripping off' America: Live updates\n\nPrince Andrew's ex, Lady Victoria Hervey, doubles down against Virginia Giuffre with fresh attack against Epstein victim - as she weighs in on 'destroyed' credibility\n\nJoe Rogan fled 'violent' father for San Francisco's gay scene... now his estranged sister breaks her silence to tell a very different story about his path to $200m superstardom\n\nThe top 21 places to live revealed - and third place features houses for just £150,000: How does YOUR home rank among 1,500 cities, towns and villages in England and Wales?\n\nRobbie Williams reveals he suffered debilitating bout of depression at start of this year - a decade after last episode as he admits: 'I thought I was at the other end of the arc'\n\nAlan Carr leads horrified reactions as host AJ Odudu is forced to tell Mickey Rourke 'stop looking at me!' as he enters Celebrity Big Brother\n\nI've been to all 92 Football League grounds - this is the definitive list from worst to best and where YOUR club ranks, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nNUTRITIONIST KIM PEARSON: Cheaper than Ozempic, here's my guide to the old school diets that still work and FAST... how to do them safely, and lose weight in just one week\n\nThe dark true story behind Disney+ series Good American Family: Couple adopted a Ukrainian orphan - before accusing her of being a 'sociopath'\n\nInside Kim Kardashian's desperate plans to protect Bianca Censori from Kanye West\n\nHow a revolutionary new injection grew back my hair after I'd tried every hair-loss treatment and was even considering a transplant\n\nProof red wine ISN'T so healthy after all: Research into its link with cancer has thrown up a very surprising result - and it's bad news for heart disease too\n\nGemma Owen 'is dating son of a multi-millionaire': Love Island star shows off new beau as he joins her footballer father Michael on family trip to Dubai\n\nBritish businesses warn they face fight to survive amid fears their revenue will be HALVED after world was plunged into 'turmoil' by Donald Trump's 'ridiculous' tariffs\n\nShiloh Jolie looks more like her actress mom Angelina than ever as she hangs out with friends at dance studio\n\nScientists perform world's first de-extinction to revive the dire wolf that vanished 12,000 years ago\n\nWhat you MUST do to protect your pension from Trump's tariffs fallout: JEFF PRESTRIDGE\n\nTherapist reveals the surprising number of friends you should REALLY have in adulthood\n\nI was born with two vaginas… here's how men react when they find out my secret\n\n80s heartthrob clears up shocking rumor he 'stuffed' his speedo in iconic Dallas series\n\nGap's back!

His tongue was hanging out.'\n\nAlan Carr has lead the horrified reactions after Celebrity Big Brother host AJ Odudu was forced to tell Mickey Rourke to 'stop looking at me' during the launch episode\n\nMentioning the inappropriate moment on Late and Live, comedian Alan said to AJ: 'Can we talk about Mickey Rourke looking at you?'\nAJ quipped back: 'It literally was. I was like \"You can't afford these feathers Mickey, no!\"'\nViewers were equally horrified by the display, as they took to X, formerly Twitter, to say: 'Scared for all the women in that house now with how Mickey was with AJ on live television mind you,';\n'I needed a scandal this season and i believe mickey rourke will provide it,'; 'Oh dear. Not a fan of Mickey already after that entrance,';\n'Everyone's joking about Mickey Rouke and I get why, but I want to be serious for a second. No female TV presenter should be made to feel like AJ just did. He shouldn't have been allowed on this show if he can't control himself around women. I hated that ngl,';\n'There's surely no way Mickey Rourke doesn't either walk or get booted out for being inappropriate,';\n'That's right AJ run away from Mickey as fast as you can,'; 'Someone get some security for AJ from Mickey Rourke because what the hell was that????';\n'I put money on mickey rourke getting kicked out within the next few days. How he treated AJ was totally unacceptable,';\n'I don't care if bosses are paying him £500,000, nor do I care that he's an Oscar-winning Hollywood star. Reprimand Mickey Rourke for his slimy, inappropriate touching of AJ Odudu and remove him from the #CBBUK house immediately,';\n\nMickey's behaviour towards AJ sparked outrage, after he grabbed onto her before staring her up and down intensely, prompting the host to shout: 'Stop looking at me'\n\nAlan said: 'Find someone who looks at you the way Mickey looks at you [AJ]. His tongue was hanging out'\n\nAJ quipped back: 'It literally was. I was like \"You can't afford these feathers Mickey, no!\"'\n'And every woman just cringed in horror at Mickey Rourke ogling AJ like that,'; 'Watching Mickey Rourke basically harass AJ is the most uncomfortable thing I've seen.'\nMickey was the final housemate to enter on Monday, and he admitted he doesn't take orders well in his VT.\nHe then joined a conga line with the other housemates after taking a while to actually enter the house before AJ guided him to the door in chaotic scenes.\nMickey was first to head into the prize room and viewers will have to wait and see what happens next on Tuesday's show. \nAhead of she show's return, AJ and Will had pledged to get into shape for the latest series.\n\nViewers were equally horrified, as they took to X, formerly Twitter, to say: 'Scared for all the women in that house now with how Mickey was with AJ on live television mind you'\nAJ told The Sun: 'It's so funny because me and Will were like, \"We're going to be so fit for Celebrity Big Brother. Let's do a Big Brother workout program\".\n'We're going five times a day. We're doing weights. We're doing Pilates. We're doing meal preps. \n'We've got catsuits to get into — it's shred time.'\nWill added: 'We've not started. We were together last week and the evening started with that chat and ended with beers.'\nCelebrity Big BrotherITVAlan CarrAJ Odudu\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAlan Carr leads horrified reactions as host AJ Odudu is forced to tell Mickey Rourke 'stop looking at me!' as he enters Celebrity Big Brother\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Just last week, he rolled out so-called reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 countries on what he called “Liberation Day.” And now that China has matched the United States with a 34% tariff of its own, Trump has doubled down.\n\nIn his Truth Social rant, Trump said that China retaliated “despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs.”\n\nIf Trump goes through with this, we’ll be in a full-blown trade war. \n\nA senior White House official told ABC News that Trump’s new threat wouldn’t just be on top of the 34% tariff announced last week, but also on the existing 20%, bringing the total tariff on some Chinese goods to a jaw-dropping 104%.\n\nThat’s not just a number. It means that iPhones, TVs, clothing, furniture—basically anything made in China—could soon cost U.S. consumers a whole lot more. And with Trump’s timeline, that price spike could hit shelves as early as this week.\n\nBut as Americans brace for these higher costs, Trump spent the weekend golfing. \n\nNow, under pressure, he’s pretending to play diplomat. In his Truth Social post on Monday, he floated the idea of “negotiations” with other nations, likely because his reckless trade war is triggering global panic and even giving some of his MAGA loyalists pause.\n\n“Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately,” he wrote. \n\nAt least 50 countries have already requested negotiations with the Trump administration, hoping to avoid getting further embroiled in economic crossfire. But whether those talks will be productive is another question. The administration has already made clear that it’s not playing fair. Even countries offering to eliminate their tariffs may still get punished. \n\n“Let’s take Vietnam. When they come to us and say ‘we’ll go to zero tariffs,’ that means nothing to us because it’s the nontariff cheating that matters,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Monday.\n\nBut Navarro later tried to walk back his statement, saying that zero tariffs is a “small first start.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump remains defiantly proud of his protectionist crusade—once calling “tariff” the most beautiful word in the English language. But Tariffs don’t punish foreign governments; they punish consumers. And as Trump doubles down, the stock market is spiraling and recession fears are rising.\n\nStill, Trump doesn’t seem to care. His plan to impose even more tariffs on countries that lower theirs is the same old game he always plays: All chaos, all of the time.","summary":"President Donald Trump lived up to his title as the world’s pettiest world leader once again on Monday by threatening to slap China with an additional 50% tariff unless it removes its 34% retaliatory tax on U.S. goods.\n\n\n\n“If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\n\nThis latest threat marks another escalation in Trump’s tit-for-tat trade war.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:58 BST, 8 April 2025 |Updated:01:00 BST, 8 April 2025 \n\nRobbie Williams has revealed that he suffered a debilitating bout of depression at the start of this year - a decade after his last bad mental health episode. \nThe singer, 51, was first diagnosed with depression in his twenties and has battled addiction struggles amid life in the spotlight.\nAnd as 2025 began he was left feeling 'confused' that his mental health issues returned as he 'thought he was at the other end of the arc.'\nHe told The Mirror: 'The year started with some ill mental health, which I haven't had for a very, very long time. I was sad, I was anxious, I was depressed.\n'It's been about ten years...I thought I was at the other end of the arc.\n'I thought this was the end of my story, and that I would just go walking into this marvellous wonderland. So for it to return was just confusing.' \n\nRobbie Williams has revealed that he suffered a debilitating bout of depression at the start of this year - a decade after his last bad mental health episode\n\nThe singer, 51, was first diagnosed with depression in his twenties and has battled addiction struggles amid life in the spotlight\nIt comes after at the end of last year Robbie candidly confessed that he was not dealing with his parents' devastating ill health 'as he should'.\nHe revealed earlier in 2024 that his mother Janet had been diagnosed with dementia, four-years after father Pete was diagnosed with Parkinson's. \nIn rare comment about his parents Robbie said he 'didn't know' how to cope with the 'incredibly complicated' situation. \n'The truth is that I'm very busy and I'm not dealing with the situation as I should. I don't really know how to do it, it's an incredibly complicated thing'.\nHe continued: 'But I prefer not to go into details, You know, if I say something, they might read it, and then I would have to answer a lot of questions'. \n'Let's put it this way: we are all human beings, with our difficulties, and I am trying to deal with mine'.\nRobbie first spoke about his mother's diagnosis after revealing how his biopic Better Man depicts his loving relationship with his late grandmother who has dementia in the film.\nWhen asked about his parents thoughts on the film, Robbie told HELLO! 'My mum's currently got dementia - like my nan in the film - and my dad's got Parkinson's and can't get out of bed. So I'm in a different part of my life right now.'\n\nIt comes after at the end of last year Robbie candidly confessed that he was not dealing with his parents' devastating ill health 'as he should' \n\nAs 2025 began he was left feeling 'confused' that his mental health issues returned as he 'thought he was at the other end of the arc'\nBack in 2020 Robbie revealed his father Pete had been diagnosed with Parkinson's, admitting at the time that he was fighting 'fear and panic' over his father's diagnosis.\nHe said at the time that receiving the diagnosis during Covid made things extra difficult as he and his wife Ayda and their children were self-isolating thousands of miles away from his parents in Los Angeles.\nThe former Take That star has been joined by his father Pete, who is also a singer, many times on stage.\n\n Robbie Williams heartbreakingly admits he's not dealing with his parents' devastating ill health 'as he should' and confesses 'not knowing' how to cope \nRobbie's parents split in 1977. The pair also share daughter Sally, who is 11 years Robbie's senior.\nThe pop star previously shared his worry for both of his parents during an interview with The Sun, sharing: 'They’re of that age that is very vulnerable to what is going on, so I am speaking to them on the phone daily.'\nRobbie and his wife Ayda, 45, have a lot to contend with as Ayda also recently revealed that her mother Gwen's cervical cancer has returned, after previous battles with breast cancer and a Parkinson's and Lupus diagnosis.\nDuring his most recent interview with The Mirror Robbie also spoke about taking an appetite-suppressant drug to lose weight and wondered if that had contributed to his mental health struggles.\nHe opened up about his body dysmorphia after previously accredited his two stone weight loss to 'something like Ozempic' as he opened up about his health in October 2023. \nThe star, who is 1.85m / 5ft 11ins tall, admitted he went from weighing 13st 13lb down to 12st 1lb while using an appetite suppressant.\nRobbie - also joked that he requires the drug because he has been diagnosed 'with type 2 self-loathing.'\n\nRobbie and his wife Ayda share Theodora, affectionately known as Teddy, 12, Charlie, nine, five-year-old Coco, and Beau, 19 months\nDelving beyond the humour, Robbie explained that being overweight is 'shockingly catastrophic' for his mental health. \nThe popstar, who was once dubbed 'Blobby Williams,' described how mean his inner voice can be when he isn't slim.\nRobbie told The Times: 'Babe, I'm on Ozempic...Well, something like Ozempic. It's like a Christmas miracle. I've gone from 13st 13lb to 12st 1lb.\n'And I need it, medically. I've been diagnosed with type 2 self-loathing. It's shockingly catastrophic to my mental health to be bigger. My inner voice talks to me like Katie Hopkins talks about fat people. It's maddening.'\nRobbie Williams\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRobbie Williams reveals he suffered debilitating bout of depression at start of this year - a decade after last episode as he admits: 'I thought I was at the other end of the arc'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

No major economy in modern history has tried such a daring move. But despite the name, the US tariffs offer no liberation and are not reciprocal. However, they should not have come as a surprise.\nMost politicians are condemned for not fulfilling their election promises, but Trump has got it the other way around – explicitly telling the world during his presidential election campaign that he would do this.\nFor example, Trump said during the campaign that tariffs on China would be around 60 per cent. And yet, the 54 per cent new tariffs he imposed during his second term caught financial markets off guard because they did not believe the president would have the audacity to follow through.\nFrom Trump’s perspective, these actions are necessary to pull the US back from the precipice of decline.\nNational debt has surged to US$36.22 trillion, with interest payments projected to exceed US$952 billion in 2025 and to possibly reach US$1 trillion the following year. Without intervention, this could lead to US$13.8 trillion in net interest payments over a decade – equivalent to the combined economies of Germany, Japan, India and Britain.\nAt the same time, US industry has been eroded, as illustrated by the shipbuilding sector where China now dominates more than half of the global market. In contrast, the US share has fallen to less than 1 per cent.\n\nThe economy and industry are the sinews and bones of a nation’s war capacity – the ultimate benchmark of hard power. To adherents of realpolitik like Trump, these are unmistakable and undeniable signs of weakness.\nYet, going by conventional routes, both issues would need time to fix. And despite Trump’s dominance over Congress and the judiciary, and with no meaningful opposition from Democrats, time is a luxury he cannot afford.\nWithout significant progress, his political advantage – strong now – could vanish like cherry blossom. With the midterm elections looming in November 2026, Trump needs his lightning strike to yield a quick result.\nTrump’s promises to end the Ukraine war on “day one” and broker a long-lasting Middle East peace appear increasingly unrealistic. He is also yet to claim victory in his controversial attempts to reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy.\nThat is where the global trade war launched on April 2 comes in. Trump aims to produce quick outcomes. Like all lightning strikes, his opening attack relies on the psychological effects to overwhelm adversaries into compliance. Rapid victories are crucial to maintaining momentum and leveraging further negotiations.\nThe global tariff war is meant as an opening gambit for intense negotiations rather than a prolonged conflict.\nThe hope is that smaller economies that are dependent on the US market would capitulate quickly, bolstering Trump’s domestic standing and strengthening his negotiating position against major powers like China.\nWhen the US has sufficiently strengthened its hand, it will be ready for the “grand bargain” with Beijing. If Trump can force small and middle powers to accept his terms, he would be entering negotiations from a position of strength.\n\nChina, foreseeing the US tariffs, reacted promptly with equivalent measures on US imports and the addition of a number of American companies to its punitive lists. Beijing’s swift response shows that it has fully prepared for the struggle.\nBesides inflicting calculated political pain on Trump’s base, the Chinese retaliation serves two other purposes.\nFirst, as the world’s second-largest economy, Beijing is taking the lead in demonstrating its refusal to tolerate economic coercion from the US. Smaller economies may have wavered if China had showed any sign of hesitation.\nMore importantly, it served as a warning to other nations that may be considering alliances with Washington. Anyone who wishes to gang up with the US on China should expect a fierce fightback from Beijing.\nHistorically, wars are either battles of annihilation or attrition. Those needing swift resolutions seek decisive action, while opponents with time and resilience prolong conflicts.\nAlthough it is uncertain who will prevail in this struggle to reset the global economic order, China appears to be prepared to dig in.\nSince Trump’s first term, China’s export dependence on the US has decreased. At the same time, China has diversified its import sources away from the US, with countries like Brazil and Russia filling any gaps.\nMoreover, China’s position in the global supply chain has strengthened. US consumers and companies may find it challenging to replace Chinese imports, at least in the near future. They may have to absorb the tariff costs.\nTrump’s hope of winning depends on how many countries will quickly be overwhelmed and capitulate. If he cannot use his victory to bring victories, domestic frustration will quickly build up.\nIn this contest of speed versus resilience, time remains Trump’s most formidable adversary.","summary":"Beijing’s swift response to Liberation Day tariffs signals it is ready for a long fight, while the US president needs a quick win.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3305469/picking-trade-war-china-donald-trump-may-find-time-not-his-side","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/07/b95ccff9-1210-4769-9ab2-8e36ff5b38ee_64a73187.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:00:13","author":"Chow Chung-yan","authors":["Chow Chung-yan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.004},{"id":308756192,"title":"Elon Musk's Brother Destroys Trump After Wealthy Sibling Loses $30Billion — As New Tariffs Rocks Stock Markets and Nation","text":"Elon Musk's younger brother Kimbal is making it clear he despises Donald Trump's new tariffs, calling them a \"permanent tax.\"\n\nThe lashing comes as the Tesla founder is believed to have lost over $30billion thanks to the controversial tariffs, RadarOnline.com can reveal.Kimbal took to X on Monday, April 7, to give the president his thoughts as he raged: \"Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations.\n\n\"Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old then added: “Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things.\"\"A tax on consumption also means less consumption. Which means less jobs. Which in turn leads to less consumption. And then even less jobs,\" Kimbal said.\n\nKimbal – a board member at his brother's company Tesla – also owns a restaurant chain called The Kitchen, and is a former director at SpaceX and Chipotle.Elon, 53, has already felt the pain from Trump's tariffs, after the controversial politician announced a baseline 10% tariff for imported goods from all countries, as well as “individualized” tariffs as high as 50% on a series of specific countries and regions. \n\nTrump's plans hit the stock markets hard, with The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite falling by more than 5%, as Musk saw his net worth cut down by $30.9billion.\n\nHowever, he wasn't the only one to lose money as Amazon boss Jeff Bezos also had his net worth drop down by $27billion.It has been a rough couple of months for Musk as he witnessed Tesla wrap up its worst quarter since 2022, with shares of the company dropping 36% in the first three months of the year.\n\nDuring a rally on March 30 in support of a right-wing judge, the businessman told the crowd: “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half... This is a very expensive job is what I’m saying.”\n\nTesla dealerships have has also been hit with vandalism.It gets worse for Musk as he is reportedly out at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Politico reported Trump told his inner circle that Musk is planning to step back from his advisory role.\n\nAccording to the site: \"The president remains pleased with Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency initiative, but both men have decided in recent days that it will soon be time for Musk to return to his businesses and take on a supporting role.\"\n\nHowever, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was quick to defend Musk, calling the report \"garbage,\" and adding that Musk would only exit when his \"incredible work at DOGE is complete.\"However, on Monday, April 7, Trump said Musk has \"been amazing,\" but \"I also think he's got a big company to run.\"\n\nTrump added: \"At some point, he's going to be going back. He wants to.\"","summary":"Elon Musk's brother Kimbal is not happy when it comes to the new tariffs, after watching his older sibling lose billions from his net worth.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/elon-musk-brother-kimbal-trump-after-billions-tariffs-stock-markets/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/Lrlw8YQmE/0x0/musk-trump-tariff-1744060822602.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:00:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":308748494,"title":"Taoiseach shares his 'count to 10' rule when 'something gets said from the Oval Office'","text":"In Changing Times — The Allenwood Conversations, he recounted his meeting with US president Donald Trump and explained the \"count to 10\" rule.\n\n “He was gracious … and, in a nice way, made it very clear he had issues with us on pharmaceuticals. ‘We love very smart people who took all our pharmaceuticals', he said.\n\n“I think Europe and all of us just need to count to 10 every time something gets said from the Oval Office… \n\n It’s very important that we try and discern a pattern of behaviour\n\nMr Martin described the modern Oval Office media strategy as “a new form of political messaging”, tailored not for policy but “for the base”. He also stressed the ongoing strategic importance of Irish America, describing the constituency as “still very potent” in both cultural and electoral terms.\n\n “No other nation gets that kind of access on St Patrick’s Day — 600 people in one room with the president and vice president. It’s a reminder of the unique footprint we still hold,” Mr Martin said.\n\n'A difficult journey'\n\nThe Taoiseach also said the presidency is not on the horizon for him.\n\n “If I wanted to be president, I would not have run for the Dáil or become Taoiseach.” \n\nAnd when it comes to reports Conor McGregor would potentially run for president, Mr Martin said he is not sure “what the agenda is”.\n\n “It’s a difficult journey. You need four county councils or 20 TDs. I’m not so sure what the agenda is — whether he really is or isn’t interested.” \n\nThe conversation also delved into Mr Martin’s personal life, including the deaths of two of his children – Ruairí and Léana.\n\n “You don’t ever get over that. Ever,” he said.\n\nThe Taoiseach revealed that he considered leaving politics entirely at the time, adding: “Mary said to me later: ‘You do realise you were thinking of packing it in?’ And I probably was. But you keep going — for the living.

The U.S. president, speaking from the White House, chastised China for ignoring his previous warning not to retaliate against U.S. tariffs.“I have great respect for China but they cannot do this,” Trump said, adding that the United States would impose further tariffs unless China backed down. “We are going to have one shot at this… It is an honor to do it,” he declared.The threat of an additional 50 percent tariff, coupled with China’s 34 percent duties, could see total tariffs on Chinese goods rise to 104 percent this year, according to White House officials.Global markets tumbleTrump’s aggressive trade policies continued to roil global markets, with Wall Street stocks finishing lower after a volatile trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both closed down as investors reacted to the worsening trade tensions.Hong Kong’s stock market experienced its worst day in nearly 30 years, collapsing by 13.2 percent. Tokyo also suffered significant losses, closing down nearly 8 percent, while Frankfurt fell as much as 10 percent before paring back some of its losses. Trillions of dollars in market value have been wiped out amid fears of a global recession.China’s retaliationBeijing responded to Trump’s comments, stating through its U.S. embassy that “pressuring or threatening China is not the right way to engage.”As the trade war intensifies, the global economy remains on edge. Trump has repeatedly insisted that his tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing by forcing foreign companies to relocate production to the United States. However, many economists remain skeptical, with some warning that the tariffs could lead to rising inflation and slowed economic growth.No pause, no talksTrump ruled out any pause in his tariff implementation, stating that he was \"not looking\" to delay the tariffs. Additionally, he announced the cancellation of any planned meetings with China to discuss the trade dispute, though he reiterated that the U.S. was open to negotiations with other countries.“There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,” Trump said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.EU’s countermeasuresThe European Union is also gearing up for a response. EU trade ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss their strategy, with France and Germany pushing for the imposition of a tax on U.S. tech giants. French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said that the bloc’s response should remain open to all options, including aggressive measures against U.S. companies.However, divisions within the EU were evident, as Ireland’s trade minister, Simon Harris, warned that targeting services would be a dangerous escalation, particularly given Ireland’s reliance on U.S. tech and pharmaceutical firms attracted by its low corporate tax rates.Inflation, recession, and political falloutThe fallout from Trump’s trade policies continues to raise concerns about inflation and a potential recession. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned that the tariffs could slow U.S. economic growth, while also adding pressure on consumer prices.Trump’s supporters, including U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, have expressed concern that the economic effects of the tariffs could have a significant impact on American voters, particularly in swing states. Cruz warned that a recession could result in a \"bloodbath\" for Republicans in the upcoming mid-term elections.As global markets remain volatile and tensions with China show no signs of easing, the economic consequences of Trump’s trade war are only beginning to unfold.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/07/trump-vows-massive-new-china-tariffs-as-markets-plunge","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-02-04/0jqv60fc/00036UC3YG.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 23:58:06","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":308750356,"title":"Supreme Court rules against Boasberg, allowing Trump to deport migrants under Alien Enemies Act of 1798","text":"The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday that President Donald Trump can temporarily resume deporting illegal aliens under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. \n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked summary deportations by the Trump administration invoking the 1798 act against members of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang.

They had plenty of donors and political allies in common. Where was Obama?’\n\nProbably in disbelief that his word was no longer scripture and verse. And confused that all of his greatness led not only to President Trump but to this cackling moron getting the nod.\n\nThe once-transformational figure that was Barack Obama, now told to be a good soldier — a mere footman! — and get in line.\n\nIt took five full days after Biden dropped out for Obama and his wife Michelle to call Harris — a staged act captured on camera and meant to look, the book says, spontaneous.\n\n‘It took days of intense negotiations to strike a deal on the simplest act in politics,’ the book reports. ‘The whole frame, including the script, was designed to elevate the Obamas by making it look like she was begging for their blessing. This was typical bulls**t. [Harris] had to fake surprise and enthusiasm.’\n\nBut she did get her revenge — remember that moment of ‘surprise’ when Harris remarked on the fact that Michelle and Barack were calling ‘together’?\n\nIt seems those ‘separate bedrooms’ rumors have been circulating in DC longer than we knew.\n\nYes, the fall from grace, profitability and cultural relevance is steep.\n\nTurns out no one really wants to hear former First Lady Michelle gripe about her life, her fame, her wealth or her husband, because her new podcast ‘IMO’ — co-hosted with her charisma-free brother Craig — is now ranked a dismal #34 on Spotify.\n\nComparatively, Amy Poehler, who just launched her own podcast, hit #3 with a bullet.\n\nCould this be why Michelle keeps playing up rumors by talking ad nauseum about her marriage?\n\nOr why she’s using her podcast to execute the longest ongoing humiliation of her husband possible? Or why she seems to be enduring one of the strangest female midlife crises in recent memory, taking to the airwaves with her hair in pom-poms atop her head?\n\nThis is the 61-year-old former First Lady of the United States acting, looking and sounding, frankly, like a teenager.\n\nWhen asked on her latest, irrelevant podcast episode if women are smart to marry men who aren’t financially stable, she said: ‘Uh, I married one.’\n\nWow. Here, again, is the root of Michelle’s rage: The former first couple are multimillionaires with four estates around the country because of Barack — not her.\n\nShe is the grinder and he is the star — or, should we say, was the star.\n\nNow he cuts a maudlin, lonely figure: At Jimmy Carter’s funeral, at the Inauguration and, just a few days ago, strolling through DC, caught ‘photobombing’ a young family out looking at the cherry blossoms.\n\nIt seems both Obamas are using this much-rumored marital trouble as clickbait. Nothing else seems to be working.\n\nThe formerly dignified Barack is playing along, making the very strange admission last week that he has been in a ‘deep deficit’ with Michelle for dragging her to the White House.\n\nWe know. We all, regrettably, know too much about this seemingly miserable marriage. \n\nEven Ted Sarandos, the head of Netflix who signed the former First Couple in a splashy deal in 2018, recently hinted that the Obamas’ productions don’t deliver eyeballs or views.\n\n‘They’re not big commercial projects, typically,’ Sarandos told the Semafor news site. ‘It’s not what they were trying to do.’\n\nOh — you mean Netflix cut the Obamas a reported eight-figure deal but in return expected nothing to actually succeed?\n\n‘There’s an element of prestige television that they brought to us,’ Sarandos added. Is he kidding? \n\nOtherwise, how does he explain the ‘prestige’ of Michelle’s little-hyped reality Netflix show The Later Daters, about older singles looking for love?\n\nUnless, perhaps, Michelle sees a bit of herself in those older singles. Maybe she’s preparing to go back on the market.\n\nAfter all, she did just tell her brother Craig on their podcast that ‘women are open to many different kinds of men and lifestyles.’\n\nWhat could she be implying?\n\nAbandoned by the Dems and DC, it now seems even Hollywood has had enough of the Obamas.\n\nReally, the biggest star Michelle could book for episode two was Issa Rae?\n\nEven George Clooney, according to another new political book – Uncharted by Chris Whipple – raged at an MSNBC producer after host Mika Brzezinski made the actor sound like Obama’s puppet.\n\nA mere eight years ago, Clooney would have bragged that Obama was a close friend. Now, it seems, Barack — and Michelle — are liabilities.\n\nAgain: Just look to Sarandos, who, in another recent interview, was asked directly if he plans to renew the Obamas’ deal.\n\n‘I don’t want to comment on anyone’s renewals,’ Sarandos said.\n\nIs there a better metaphor than that?","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Obamas may be over in more ways than one.

Council’s official account on X said in a January 2019 post about winter weather that schools and government offices would still open on time, but then added: “The Giant Tank Parade: Still cancelled.”\n\nMonths later, in June 2019, the account posted a Defense Department memo to show that the military opposed using tanks on city streets.\n\nThe latest parade plans were first reported by Washington City Paper on Sunday.\n\nAssociated Press writer Ashraf Khalil contributed to this report.","summary":"June 14 is also Trump’s 79th birthday.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/07/trump-military-parade/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/US_Israel_34730.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 23:52:29","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.354}]}
