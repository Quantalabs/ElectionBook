The tariffs cover hundreds of goods from multiple countries. They were justified as protecting U.S. industries and jobs. Experts say this could affect billions of dollars in trade.Lower courts ruled the tariffs might be illegal. One called them “ultra vires,” beyond the president’s authority. Another appeals court agreed, saying the law used, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), doesn’t explicitly allow tariffs. Still, the tariffs remain in effect. Companies keep paying duties, and costs are passed to consumers.The Supreme Court now decides if the president overstepped legal limits. Justices are focused on the “major questions doctrine.” This means policies with huge economic impact need clear congressional approval. Some justices also pointed out tariffs act like hidden taxes on Americans, which only Congress can authorize.If the court strikes down the tariffs, the government could owe billions in refunds. Importers, exporters, and industries will watch closely. A loss could also limit presidential power on emergency economic measures. On the flip side, a ruling in favor could expand executive authority and allow future presidents to act unilaterally on trade issues.Markets are watching closely. Tariffs affect prices, supply chains, and trade relationships worldwide. Investors fear uncertainty. Businesses worry about planning for refunds or continued duties. Consumers could see higher costs on imported goods.Live EventsThe case also highlights Congress’s role. Lawmakers may face pressure to clarify trade and emergency powers. Future legislation could limit presidential discretion or confirm authority for similar actions.Oral arguments in the Supreme Court were intense. Both liberal and conservative justices questioned the administration’s interpretation. Some argued the tariffs resemble taxation. Others warned of setting a dangerous precedent if presidential power is unchecked.The final ruling could take months. It will set a major precedent for U.S. trade policy and executive authority. Businesses, investors, and consumers all have a stake. Global trade partners are watching too. The outcome could affect not just tariffs, but future economic and emergency decisions by any administration.The Supreme Court tariff case is now a defining moment. It tests the balance between presidential power and congressional oversight. It could reshape U.S. trade policy for years. Every import, every business, every consumer may feel the impact.What is the supreme court tariff case all about?The Supreme Court tariff case has captured headlines because it questions the limits of presidential power. At the center is the use of broad import tariffs by former President Donald Trump, which were justified as necessary to protect the U.S. economy. These tariffs applied to multiple countries and were argued as a response to trade deficits, unfair trade practices, and other economic concerns.Several courts before the Supreme Court have expressed concerns that the president may have overstepped legal boundaries. The law in question, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, was originally designed to allow presidents to respond to national emergencies, but it doesn’t explicitly give the president the power to impose sweeping tariffs. Critics argue that using this law for tariffs might stretch its intent too far, making it a matter for the courts to decide.Supporters of the tariffs say they are necessary to protect American industries and jobs. They argue that the president has a responsibility to safeguard the economy in emergencies, and tariffs are a legitimate tool. Opponents counter that the president is essentially acting as a legislator, bypassing Congress, which traditionally has authority over taxes and trade laws. This clash is what the Supreme Court is now being asked to resolve.Why is this case legally significant?This case raises important questions about the separation of powers in the U.S. government. One of the main issues is whether Congress has given the president clear authority to impose tariffs in this way. The “major questions doctrine” comes into play here, which basically says that if a policy has big economic or political consequences, Congress must clearly authorize it.The justices are also examining whether these tariffs are similar to taxes on American consumers. Since importers often pass the cost of tariffs onto buyers, some argue this is effectively a tax. And according to the Constitution, only Congress has the power to levy taxes. This debate over who can make major economic decisions is central to the case.Another key issue is precedent. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the tariffs, it could give future presidents more flexibility to impose similar measures without explicit congressional approval. On the other hand, a ruling against the administration could limit presidential power and require more careful checks before major trade actions are taken.What happened in the lower courts?Before reaching the Supreme Court, this case went through several lower courts. One court concluded that the tariffs were ultra vires, meaning they were beyond the president’s legal authority. Another appeals court affirmed this position, agreeing that the IEEPA does not clearly authorize such sweeping tariff powers.Despite these rulings, the tariffs remain in place while the case works its way through the courts. This means that businesses and importers are still paying these duties, creating uncertainty and potential financial strain. Many companies are watching closely, since the decision could affect pricing, supply chains, and international trade agreements.The lower courts’ decisions highlighted a broader concern: the need for clear guidance on how far presidential powers extend in economic emergencies. This is why the Supreme Court’s ruling could set a precedent that affects not just tariffs but other emergency economic measures in the future.How could the supreme court decision impact the economy?If the Supreme Court rules against the tariffs, the U.S. government could be forced to refund billions in duties collected from importers. This would be a huge financial impact and could also affect trade relationships with other countries, who may see the reversal as a sign of policy uncertainty.On the other hand, upholding the tariffs could give the government more flexibility to use similar measures in the future. It might also provide a short-term boost to domestic industries by keeping foreign competition in check. However, critics warn that this could lead to retaliatory measures from other countries, sparking trade tensions.The decision will also influence investors and markets. Traders are watching closely because a clear ruling either way could stabilize or shake financial markets, depending on how companies react to the tariff outcome. Overall, the economic stakes are high, which is why the case is being followed so closely by businesses, policymakers, and consumers alike.What are the broader implications for presidential power?Beyond economics, this case has major political and legal implications. A ruling against the tariffs would signal that presidents cannot assume broad powers without explicit authorization from Congress. It would be a reminder that even in emergencies, there are limits to executive authority.Conversely, a ruling in favor of the tariffs could expand presidential powers in ways that future administrations might use to unilaterally influence the economy. This could change the balance of power in Washington, affecting not only trade policies but also regulations, taxes, and national emergency measures.This case also sends a message to Congress. Lawmakers may feel pressure to clarify the limits of presidential powers in trade, emergency spending, and other areas. It’s likely that after the Supreme Court decision, Congress could pass legislation to define its role more clearly, preventing similar disputes in the future.What should businesses and consumers watch next?For now, the tariffs remain in effect, and businesses are navigating uncertainty. Companies that import goods from affected countries need to plan for potential refunds or continued duties, which could affect pricing and supply chain decisions. Consumers may also see higher prices if importers continue to pass on costs.The Supreme Court is expected to take several months before issuing a final decision. Once announced, it will set a clear precedent on the limits of presidential authority and the role of Congress in trade matters. International traders, domestic businesses, and even average consumers will need to adjust based on the outcome, making this a case with widespread implications.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onSupreme Court Trump tariff case presidential power limitsSupreme Court Trump tariff powers showdownsupreme court tariff casetrump tariffsimport dutiespresidential poweru.s. trade policytrade legalityexecutive authorityglobal trade impact\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

I'll be outside,' the congressman wrote on Tuesday evening.\n\nIn a follow-up post less than 20 minutes later, he added: 'Launch the nuke.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Collins returned to X with a video urging Republicans to 'get smart' and 'go on offense, not defense.' \n\n'It's time to unite. Don't let them Mamdani our Georgia,' the caption read. \n\nIn the more than two-minute video, the congressman told Republicans to wake up and take the midterms seriously, while offering a glimmer of hope: 'Georgia isn't as far gone as Virginia or New Jersey.' \n\n'When President Trump's voters don't show up, Republicans can't win,' Collins said. 'And midterms, it's all about turnout. We got to turn out the voters that voted for an America first agenda, and actually, demand that that agenda get implemented.'\n\n'That's the winning coalition y'all,' he added. 'The voters.'\n\n'We want a healthy America who want things to be affordable, who don't want an overreaching government controlling every aspect of our lives, who don't want mass immigration, who only want American citizens voting in our elections.'\n\nBut Collins' outburst only mirrored other outraged Republican leaders calling for the party to hit back hard politically and reclaim control of the narrative.\n\nThe congressman reiterated in the video that Republicans must stay on 'offense,' pointing to Georgia as the number-one Senate pickup opportunity in the country.\n\n'I'm lapping the field,' he proclaimed, insisting it is no 'accident' he tops polls, fundraising and grassroots support. He also boasted that he alone has 'organized all 159 counties' with almost 100 'legislative and local endorsements.' \n\n'It's because Republicans understand the importance of having a fighter at the top of the ticket,' he explained. 'Someone who can drive turnout, energize the base and has a record of bipartisan legislative success.'\n\n'I'm working hard everyday out here to unite Republicans in Georgia. But y'all, I need your help. I need you to join our campaign. Let's start focusing on winning next November.' \n\nMamdani's monumental win has set him on a direct collision course with Trump, as his allies and the GOP reel from nationwide losses in the first major test of the president's second term. \n\nThe president had weighed into the race before polls closed, branding Mamdani a 'communist' and threatening to restrict federal funds if he won. He endorsed Cuomo on the eve of the vote.\n\nHe wrote on Truth Social: 'If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.'\n\nHe added: 'I don't want to send, as President, good money after bad.' \n\nNow, with the results in, Republicans spun a dramatic explanation: the energized Democrats, not Trump, were to blame for the crushing disappointment. \n\nMany allies of the president - including the president himself - have chalked up the significant losses to the fact that he wasn't on the ballot. \n\n'TRUMP WASN'T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT, according to Pollsters,' Trump wrote in a heated post on Truth Social. \n\nOne anonymous White House ally echoed the sentiment, telling Politico that many of the president's supporters skip elections entirely when his name isn't on the ballot. \n\n'It's not doomsday but not a good tea leaf. Not a great night if you're in the president's party. But it's also an off-year,' the ally told the outlet.\n\n'Part of this is the struggle that has always been: how do you transfer his voters into other elections? There are people who only turn out when he's on the ballot,' they added.\n\nIn his Tuesday night acceptance speech, Mamdani didn't hold back, addressing Trump directly: 'Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I've got four words for you: turn the volume up.' \n\nThe mayor-elect also added: 'To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.' \n\nOn Truth Social, Trump fired back at Mamdani with a terse, three-word post: '...AND SO IT BEGINS.' \n\nThe Board of Elections determined that a record-breaking 2 million votes had been cast in the New York City mayoral race, shattering all turnout records since 1969.","summary":"Republican Rep.

That includes the Jewish New Yorkers that voted for our campaign and those that didn't”.\n\nHe made no mention of Hindus, having participated in a Khalistani rally where abuses were hurled at members of the religion.\n\nMamdani’s central campaign promise was to make the city affordable, a message that resonated with New Yorkers’ economic concerns and propelled him to the mayoralty.\n\nAmong them were freezing rents on some homes, adding more housinng to the city plagued by shortages, free city buses, city-owned shops, and childcare for all, and these were to be financed by increasing taxes on the rich.\n\n“When we enter City Hall in 58 days, expectations will be high [and] we will meet them”, he said.\n\nBut when the Democratic Socialist takes over the city administration with a $116 billion budget and 300,000 employees, he will face an uphill task.\n\nMost of them will require the approval of state legislatures or officials and he will have to find the funds for it.\n\nTrump has said that he will cut off funds to the city if Mamdani is elected.\n\nMoreover, improving the economic standing of New Yorkers is beyond the city’s capabilities – and even at the national level it is a difficult task.\n\nTrump posted his own reply this morning, “Our Economy is BOOMING, and Costs are coming way down. Affordability is our goal”.\n\nPrices have continued to creep up, though at a slower pace, in part due to Trump's tariffs, boosting Mamdani's campaign.\n\nMamdani said that he would like to meet with Trump to see how they could work together for the city.\n\nHe added that he would also like to meet the city’s business titans like JPMorgan Chase CEO.\n\nDimon said in an interview to Fortune, “If he becomes mayor, I will call him and offer my help”.\n\nThat was a different stance from that of other business leaders who voiced their reservations about him and their future in the city.\n\nTrump has called him a communist, and Dimon said he was more a Marxist than a socialist, given his earlier statements about nationalising means of production.\n\nWhere Trump and Mamdani could clash is on immigration enforcement – the city has so far been spared the most aggressive implementation that has hit other big Democrat-run cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nMamdani said last night that to get the illegal migrants, the Trump administration “will have to get through all of us”.\n\nHe taunted Trump, telling him to raise the volume on his TV to hear him.\n\nTrump responded with an ominous four-word Truth Social post, “…AND SO IT BEGINS”!\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"New York, Nov 6 (SocialNews.XYZ) Zohair Mamdani, newly elected as the city's mayor, expressed excitement at being the first immigrant in generations to lead a city built by immigrants, emphasising his core priority, fulfilling his...\n\n\nThe post Mamdani ‘excited’ to be immigrant mayor, but on tough road to afforability goal appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/11/05/mamdani-excited-to-be-immigrant-mayor-but-on-tough-road-to-afforability-goal/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/06/202511063565723.jpg?fit=320%2C320&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1762391407","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:41:54","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":376183536,"title":"Longest U.S. government shutdown in history could hit Canadians’ travel plans: Expert","text":"CNN reported that last weekend saw the worst air traffic controller shortages since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.\n\nPictures shared on social media show massive lines at airports.

Would you say that Mamdani is the future of the Democratic Party?\" a reporter asked Jeffries during Wednesday's press conference on Capitol Hill. \"Well, what Democrats have done all across the country is lean into the issue of affordability because of the fact that America's too expensive costs are too high, and Donald Trump and Republicans, not only have they not done anything about it, they've made it worse as a result of the Trump tariffs as a result of them detonating the clean energy economy,\" Jeffries responded. \"That's why electricity bills are skyrocketing. And now, of course, they're forcing these dramatically increased health care premiums to be visited upon the American people,\" he added.

In response, Jeffries simply answered that Mamdani \"is the mayor-elect of the City of New York,\" saying, \"It's incumbent upon everyone to make sure that he’s successful.\" Although Mamdani was quickly endorsed by some of the country’s most progressive leaders, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., the Democratic Party’s top leadership was slower to give their blessing. Jeffries himself did not answer whether he would be endorsing Mamdani until just before early voting began on Oct. 24. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., never issued an endorsement of Mamdani.

He called the election results \"a decisive repudiation of Donald Trump and failed Republican policies.\" This comes as the government shutdown over expiring Obamacare subsidies and healthcare benefits enters day 36, becoming the longest closure in U.S. history. Senate Democrats have voted 14 times to reject a House-passed continuing resolution budget bill that would reopen the government. Despite this, Jeffries indicated that he believes the Tuesday election showed the country is blaming President Donald Trump and Republicans for the shutdown and that more Democratic victories are in store in 2026.

First came June’s Democratic primary, then Tuesday’s general election, where Cuomo, clinging to political relevance, ran as an independent and was trounced again.\n\nFor a man who had previously won four statewide races—one for New York attorney general and three for governor—the collapse is staggering. New Yorkers turned out in record numbers to reject him, delivering a clear verdict on more than just one campaign. \n\nAnd they had reason.\n\nCuomo’s unraveling didn’t begin with the #MeToo movement or the COVID-19 pandemic, but far earlier, during his first term as governor. In 2010, he cast himself as a reformer, promising to take on Albany’s entrenched interests and vowing to establish an independent redistricting process. By 2012, those promises were gone. Cuomo cut a deal with Republican state Senate leader Dean Skelos, allowing the GOP to draw its own maps and preserve control—betraying those who had helped elect him.\n\nIn return, lawmakers gave Cuomo what he wanted: a new pension plan that raised the retirement age for some employees, and a vast expansion of the state’s DNA database to include misdemeanor convictions. \n\nThe new map lines led to years of GOP dominance in the state Senate—sustained by districts drawn by a man who later went to prison for corruption. Cuomo let it happen. \n\nFor him, being feared was always better than being loved. During his nearly 11 years as governor, he ruled through intimidation, using the state government as a weapon to punish rivals and reward loyalty. He seemed untouchable—until he wasn’t.\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit, Cuomo’s image crumbled under the weight of scandal. His administration reportedly undercounted deaths at nursing homes, then allegedly attempted to cover it up. Around the same time, he released a self-congratulatory book titled “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic.” And less than a year later, a state report accused him of sexually harassing at least 11 women, which he has denied. \n\nFinally, in August 2021, Cuomo resigned.\n\nBut the real humiliation came this week. \n\nIt began with a surreal twist: On Monday, President Donald Trump endorsed him for mayor.\n\nFive years ago, Cuomo was seen as a leading anti-Trump figure in Democratic politics. His daily COVID-19 briefings were treated as the sane counterpoint to Trump’s chaos, in which the president suggested treating the virus by injecting disinfectant, among a litany of other scientifically unfounded claims.\n\nThroughout the mayor’s race, Cuomo benefited from the very right-wing media apparatus that he was once purportedly against. Trump and Cuomo both called Mamdani extreme, with Trump even falsely labeling him a “communist.” Fox News suggested Mamdani should be deported.\n\nAfter initially denying Trump’s endorsement, Cuomo admitted on Election Day that the president’s support could be “very helpful” to him.\n\nMAGA politics don’t play in New York City, and voters recoiled at the sight of a disgraced Democrat embracing the same president who terrorized their communities and threatened to cut off federal funds if Mamdani won the race.\n\nCuomo’s comeback bid had always felt like a fever dream. He entered the race convinced that outgoing Mayor Eric Adams’ corruption scandals had created a vacuum only he could fill. For a time, the numbers backed him up: Early polls of the Democratic primary showed him leading, and nostalgia for his pandemic-era briefings lingered. But that goodwill evaporated after he lost the primary, didn’t take “no” for an answer, and forced himself on voters as an independent.\n\nThe mayor’s race was supposed to be his comeback—the fallen governor clawing his way back to power at City Hall. Instead, it is his curtain call. Nearing 70, Cuomo is out of tricks. To beat Mamdani, he needed to keep his base and win over Republicans and independents. He did neither. Voters were done with him.\n\nMamdani, for his part, said Wednesday on NY1 that neither Cuomo nor Adams called to congratulate him on his victory. He did, however, get a call from Sliwa—proof that in New York politics, strange bedfellows abound.\n\nOn Tuesday, New Yorkers saw something fresh and exciting in Mamdani. And in Cuomo, they saw only the weary shadow of an urban boss long past his prime.\n\nAndrew Mangan contributed reporting.","summary":"Pity the Cuomosexual, for their hero has fallen so far.\n\n\n\nAndrew Cuomo, once the swaggering face of Democratic power in New York, lost twice to Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who is now mayor-elect of New York City.

This is the lowest approval rating the president has received since the pollster began tracking last month, and the highest disapproval rating. Trump’s net approval mark on the government stoppage is now -27.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,671 people from October 31 to November 3 and has a 3.4 percent margin of error. \n\nIn a poll last week, the Trump’s approval rating on the issue was 34 percent versus a 56 percent disapproval rating. In another taken from October 10 to October 13, his approval mark of handling the shutdown was 35 percent versus a 53 percent disapproval rating.\n\nIn the first poll surveying U.S. adults about the president’s handling of the shutdown, Trump received a 33 percent approval rating compared with a 54 percent disapproval score.\n\nThe poll also asked respondents on how both Democrats and Republicans are handling the stoppage. Twenty-eight percent approve of congressional Democrats’ handling of the issue versus 53 percent who disapprove. The Democrats had the same net approval rating last week, and during the week of October 10 to October 13, the party had its lowest net approval rating of -27.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also secured their lowest net approval rating on the issue in the poll out on Tuesday, with a 30 percent approval rating versus a 57 percent disapproval mark.\n\nYouGov’s Public Relations Lead Allen Houston in an email to Newsweek in part on Tuesday said, “Trump, Democrats in Congress, and Republicans in Congress all continue to have net negative approval among Americans for their handling of the shutdown. Net approval of shutdown handling by Trump has fallen in recent weeks, as has net approval of Republicans in Congress, to a lesser extent.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pictured at the America Business Forum on November 5 in Miami. (Photo by Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images for America Business Forum)\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nD. Stephen Voss, political science professor at the University of Kentucky, to Newsweek via email on Wednesday: “When problems drag on — whether that’s a war or a budgetary crisis — voters usually start blaming the chief executive. They tune out all the arguments in one direction or the other and, to parallel a phrase associated with President Truman, the buck stops with the White House. The thumping Republicans took in this week’s elections reflected longer-running anger among constituencies that already leaned Democratic, but the GOP needs to worry that the government shutdown will cause that frustration to spread.”\n\nTrump, on Truth Social Wednesday: “The Radical Left Democrats are causing millions of Americans who depend on food stamps to go without benefits, they’re forcing federal workers to go without paychecks, and they’re stranding thousands of travelers at airports!”\n\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, on X Wednesday: “DONALD TRUMP is depriving hungry Americans of SNAP And treating Americans as political pawns during this shutdown. Democrats, Independents and even Republicans rejected Donald Trump’s policies and rejected hard-right elected officials.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe shutdown continues as lawmakers struggle to reach a compromise to reopen the government. Polling data suggests both Trump and members of Congress face public discontent, but the decline in approval ratings for Trump could carry consequences for the Republican Party’s standing ahead of the 2026 midterms.","summary":"With the shutdown becoming the longest in U.S. history, the resulting disruption has affected millions of Americans.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-net-approval-rating-on-handling-government-shutdown-hits-new-low-11000259","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2245199217.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:29:12","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":376186138,"title":"Hegseth and Rubio share classified details on boat strikes with congressional leaders","text":"By STEPHEN GROVES and MATT BROWN, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Top Trump administration officials briefed a small group of congressional leaders Wednesday on the growing military campaign to destroy alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the waters off South America, providing one of the first high-level glimpses into the legal rationale and strategy behind the strikes.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers who oversee national security issues for roughly an hour in a secure facility in the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans emerged either staying silent or expressing confidence in President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has killed at least 66 people in 16 known strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nDemocrats said Congress needs more information on how the strikes are conducted and the legal justification for actions that critics say violate international and U.S. law by killing alleged drug smugglers on the high seas.\n\n“What we heard isn’t enough.

Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said nothing in the opinion or the briefing convinced him that the strikes are legal.\n\n“They made statements and explanations.

We need a lot more answers. And I am now asking for an all senators briefing on this issue,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said as he left the meeting.\n\nThe briefing occurred the day before senators are expected to vote on a resolution that would require congressional approval for any strikes directly on Venezuela.\n\nThe Trump administration has provided a trickle of information to Congress since it began destroying vessels in the Caribbean two months ago, but outside of a few classified briefings, much of the information has come from informal talks with members of Trump’s Cabinet and other officials. Despite Congress’ constitutional responsibility to authorize the use of war powers, the administration has sidestepped lawmakers and declared that members of drug cartels are unlawful combatants that it can kill as terrorists.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. military is building up its naval force off South America, raising the specter of an invasion of Venezuela and the prospect that Trump is trying to depose President Nicolás Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nWhat lawmakers learned\n\nThe classified briefing was open to the top leaders of both parties in the House and Senate, as well as the Republican chair and ranking Democrat for the committees in both chambers that oversee the military, U.S. intelligence and foreign relations. The Trump administration also made available to senators this week the document in which it explains the legal basis for the campaign.\n\nWhile lawmakers are not allowed to disclose the details of the briefing, they described it in broad terms.\n\nSen. Jim Risch, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “The administration has kept me, other members fully advised. (I’m) fully satisfied with what they’re doing. They’ve got good legal justification for what they’re doing. The president really ought to be congratulated for saving the lives of young American people.”\n\nBut Democrats ripped into the administration last week when it provided a classified briefing only for Republican senators, saying it was dangerous to inject partisanship when national security and the lives of Americans are put at risk. Following Wednesday’s briefing, Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who had leveled the harsh criticism, expressed some sympathy to the idea that the U.S. should be more aggressive toward Maduro.\n\nBut he added that it is a “huge mistake” to carry out the strikes on the boats “without actually interdicting and demonstrating to the American public that these are carrying drugs and full of bad guys.”\n\nRep.

While their normal fate is to be dragged around the election -circuit, -photographed dutifully -clapping their husband’s speeches, Ms Duwaji has not accompanied her spouse on the campaign trail and has refused to give interviews.\n\nHe, of course, is the new mayor of New York, far-Left firebrand Zohran Mamdani – not that you’d know this from Ms Duwaji’s Instagram account, where he barely features.\n\nThe stylish 28-year-old illustrator and ceramicist finally joined Mr Mamdani on stage at his Tuesday night victory rally – where he gushed: ‘There is no one I would rather have by my side in this moment, and in every moment.’\n\nYet despite her unwillingness to bask in the limelight, insiders say the woman Mr Mamdani met four years ago on the Hinge dating app was closely involved in shaping his barn-storming campaign.\n\nBringing her artist’s eye to an election operation that critics insisted was more style than content, the Syrian-American helped work out Mr Mamdani’s ‘brand identity’ as well as the aesthetics of his campaign, right down to the bright colours and font used in his -‘mission statements’ and adverts. \n\nMr Mamdani, for his part, has credited Ms Duwaji with helping him to ‘better use social media’.\n\nShe’s known to be a supportive presence behind the scenes and appears entirely on board with her husband’s political ambitions.\n\nWhen he pulled off a dramatic victory in the Democratic primary in June, she wrote on social media: ‘Couldn’t possibly be prouder.’\n\nIf she wants her own political career, it could be there for the taking. She has an impressive 361,000 followers on Instagram. ‘She’s our modern-day Princess Diana,’ one friend, Hasnain Bhatti, ecstatically told the New York Times.\n\nSo who is the quietly loyal wife now so close to the leadership core of the Big Apple?\n\nLike her husband, a longtime anti-Israel activist, Ms Duwaji is a Muslim with trenchant views on the Middle East. \n\nHer Instagram page is full of her own drawings of hunger and suffering in Gaza, as well as Palestinian flags and references to oppression of anti-Israel protesters. \n\nIn August, after Israeli strikes killed five journalists in Gaza, including Pulitzer Prize-winning Anas Al-Sharif, Ms Duwaji posted an animation on Instagram that included a drawing of the -Palestinian flag with the words: ‘End the genocide.’ \n\nShe said in April: ‘I believe everyone has a responsibility to speak out against injustice, and art has such an ability to spread it.’\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas, to Syrian parents (her father is a computer engineer and her mother a doctor), the family relocated to Dubai when Ms Duwaji was nine. At school, she often got into trouble for doodling in textbooks and notebooks.\n\nShe moved to New York in 2021 after attending university in Virginia and started working as an artist. Her illustrations, often black and white and regularly depicting herself and others of Arab descent, have appeared in The New Yorker and Washington Post. Illustrating a magazine article on Israel’s -‘environmental warfare’ against Palestinian farmers, Ms Duwaji remarked on Instagram: ‘Presidents come and go, but American imperialism never changes. Thinking of the Palestinians, who suffer no matter who’s in office.’\n\nMr Mamdani, meanwhile, was born in Uganda and was seven when his family moved to the US. Ms Duwaji met him in 2021 and the couple got engaged in late 2024. Sources have claimed they decided she should stay out of the spotlight in order to preserve some privacy.\n\nHowever, online conspiracists claimed Mr Mamdani was ‘hiding’ her or she might not even exist, which prompted him to announce in May: ‘Three months ago, I -married the love of my life, Rama, at the City Clerk’s office. Now, Right-wing trolls are trying to make this race – which should be about you – about her.’\n\nHis Instagram post was accompanied by pictures of a modest ceremony in a marriage bureau (the US equivalent of a register office) and showed the pair returning home on a packed subway train back to their rent-stabilised flat in Astoria, Queens.\n\nHowever, for all Mr Mamdani’s attempts to play down his -privileged family background\n\n(his mother Mira Nair is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker and father Mahmood an acclaimed academic) and come across as an ordinary New Yorker, it was later revealed the couple also celebrated their union with far grander parties in Dubai and his native Uganda. Guests were asked not to bring phones.\n\nIf and when she decides to emerge from Mr Mamdani’s shadow, Ms Duwaji will realise that being the mayor’s wife is very time--consuming, Chirlane McCray – estranged wife to ex-mayor Bill de Blasio – has warned.\n\n‘Fortunately, her youth will give her more energy,’ she said this week. ‘Which is helpful because it is the city that never sleeps.’","summary":"Rama Duwaji is far from the usual US politician's spouse.

That level of investment, if it comes to pass, would more than offset the disruption caused by U.S. tariffs.\n\n“Now is not the time to be cautious, because fortune favours the bold. It is a time to get big things done for Canadians, and get them done fast,” he said.\n\nWednesday marked the start of Carney’s campaign to sell Canadians on the first government budget released under his watch.\n\nHe was joined at the event by Nova Scotia MP Chris d’Entremont, who left the Conservative caucus to join the Liberals on Tuesday, moving them within two votes of a majority.\n\nThey’ll need to find those votes — or abstentions — if they are to get the budget passed and survive a confidence vote which could trigger a federal election.\n\nThe budget includes nearly $90 billion in net new spending over five years, after government cost-savings goals are taken into account. The plan has received a lukewarm reception from opposition leaders.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre lambasted the Liberals in question period Wednesday over high levels of spending and maintaining the industrial carbon price, which he argues places undue burden on manufacturers and raises costs for Canadians.\n\nPoilievre said that the $78.3 billion deficit in the budget is the largest in Canadian history outside the pandemic.\n\nLong-time Liberal adviser Tyler Meredith pointed out on social media that, according to the Bank of Canada’s inflation calculator, then-prime minister Stephen Harper’s 2009-10 budgetary deficit of $55.6 billion is larger than the 2025-26 deficit, in today’s dollars.\n\nPoilievre signalled Tuesday that the Conservatives would introduce a budget amendment to cut bureaucracy and kill the industrial carbon price.\n\nTypically the Official Opposition introduces the main amendment to a budget and the third party in the House of Commons introduces a subamendment.\n\nBut in the midst of debate over the budget in the House of Commons Wednesday Poilievre failed to table his amendment, opening the door for the Bloc Québécois to do so instead.\n\nIts amendment calls on parliamentarians to reject the budget in its entirety, primarily for a lack of measures targeting Quebec.\n\nThe Conservative party confirmed to The Canadian Press it would table a subamendment to the Bloc’s amendment Thursday morning. The first budget vote will take place Thursday evening, on the Conservative subamendment, and the second vote will be on the Bloc amendment on Friday.\n\nIt’s not clear at this point if the government will deem the amendment votes to be confidence matters, but the main vote on the budget will be. It won’t take place until the week of Nov. 17, as the House is on a break for Remembrance Day next week.\n\nCarney said there’s “a lot in this budget” that reflects input from other parties. He said there’s alignment across the government and opposition parties on aspects of the budget.\n\nPeter Bethlenfalvy, Ontario’s finance minister, said Wednesday he spoke to his federal counterpart after the budget was released and described the spending plan as lacking “some ambition.”\n\n“It’s less transformational. It’s more tinkering,” he told reporters at Queen’s Park.\n\nBethlenfalvy said the budget falls short on infrastructure support for the provinces and further tariff relief for the auto sector that supports the economies of many southwestern Ontario cities.\n\nCarney was touting a 10-year, $51 billion fund for local infrastructure — bridges, roads, hospitals and transit systems — in Ottawa on Wednesday morning.\n\nTD Economics said in a report that much of the budget’s new investments, such as the local infrastructure fund, are the result of reallocation from other pools of funding rather than net new money.\n\nTD Bank economists said only $9 billion of the funding for local infrastructure over five years in Budget 2025 was new money.\n\nThe federal government is pitching an increase in capital funding from $32.2 billion this year to $59.6 billion by 2029.\n\nIn commentary published online in The Hub, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe pointed out that only $8.3 billion of that increase is actually new, and much of it is spent on transfers to provinces.\n\n“That’s roughly 0.2 per cent of GDP and in line with commitments seen in many previous budgets. So, for all the hype, this budget does little that’s ‘generational,'” Tombe wrote.\n\nCarney pushed back Wednesday against critics and analysts who said the budget does not do enough to encourage investment.\n\nHe argued the budget offers a “sea change” by reducing operational spending growth from eight per cent annually to less than one per cent while ramping up government capital investment.\n\nAdjustments to the tax code allowing businesses to write off their own capital spending in the first year also make the country a more attractive place to invest in the face of protectionist U.S. policies, he said.\n\n“Look, I’ve been around a lot of budgets,” he said. “This is a very different budget.”\n\nThe TD Economics report said the accelerated capital spending expensing measure and enhancements to the existing scientific research and experimental development tax credit “do put Canada on somewhat more even footing” with the United States.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act also included immediate expensing for businesses.\n\nTombe called that measure — dubbed the “productivity super-deduction” in the budget — a “bright spot” that could help spur manufacturing investment in Canada.\n\n“Unfortunately, while a real step to encourage private investment, potentially boosting GDP by 0.2 per cent (the government reckons), it’s a temporary measure, so its long-term impact is muted,” he wrote.","summary":"The Bank of Canada governor told MPs he believes the budget got the diagnosis right on what ails the Canadian economy: flagging productivity and low investment levels.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11513479/federal-budget-2025-investment-impact-execution-macklem/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/e7e63e69f681719ef22837d30b78f492c75e145384f8e3db000880d7349e4097.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:18:11","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Canadian Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":376180576,"title":"Sherrill landslide in New Jersey driven by high turnout, CBS News analysis finds","text":"Turnout surged across New Jersey Tuesday, helping propel Democrat Mikie Sherrill to a landslide win in the race for governor. The Garden State is blowing past its turnout in its last gubernatorial contest in 2021, when Republican Jack Ciattarelli came within a few points of an upset win over Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. In fact, relative to 2021, all 21 of the state's counties were seeing vote increases of at least 10% (according to CBS Elections Data Desk estimates, as of Wednesday afternoon).But it's the places that saw the biggest turnout jumps that tell the story of the Democrat's succcess. The largest turnout increases were concentrated in counties that strongly voted for Sherrill, padding her margin.Take the six counties that saw increases of over 30% in their vote totals. Hudson, Essex, Union — New Jersey's three densest counties — all backed Sherrill by over 30-point margins and saw the largest turnout increases in the state. Within these counties, voters in places like Jersey City, Newark and Union City backed her in large numbers.Some of these areas had high-profile local races that may have contributed to the turnout increases. For example, Jersey City saw high turnout in its competitive mayoral race, in which Councilman James Solomon will take on former Gov. Jim McGreevey in the runoff. As for GOP strength, the only county in Ciattarelli's column that saw a similar vote increase was Ocean County.

However, Ocean's turnout was not enough to overcome even larger turnout spikes in multiple urban counties that strongly backed Sherrill.Given Democrats' success in turning out voters in advance of Election Day, Ciattarelli's only path to victory was to win voters who turned out in person Tuesday.

He and other Republicans stress that the filibuster has benefited their side when Democrats have power.\nTrump has long disagreed. At a breakfast with Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning, he renewed his calls to end the government shutdown by getting rid of the filibuster and lowering the threshold to 51 votes for legislation.\nDemocrats have been using the filibuster as leverage as they demand an extension of expiring healthcare subsidies as part of a bill to fund the government.\n“It’s time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that’s terminate the filibuster,” Trump, who made similar demands in his first term, said.\nReturning to the Capitol immediately after the breakfast, Thune held firm.\n“I know where the math is on this issue in the Senate and it’s not happening,” he said.\nThe GOP pushback suggests Republicans who have been unfailingly loyal to the president are determined to protect the institution of the Senate beyond his time in office, mindful that no party stays in power forever.\nBut Trump has faced little resistance from Congress in the first year of his second term, and continues to push Republicans to act despite their unequivocal rejection of the idea.\nSome Republicans may be concerned about the future, Trump said earlier this week, but “we’re here right now”.\n Senate institutionalists stand strong ====================== Republicans were outspoken about the need to keep the filibuster four years ago, when Democrats had the majority and tried to remove it. In the end, Democrats didn’t have the votes.\nRepublicans, now holding a 53-47 majority, appear even further away from having the votes to end the filibuster.\nThe No. 2 Republican in the Senate, Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, has said he wouldn’t support any changes.\nKentucky Senator Mitch McConnell was the GOP leader in Trump’s first term and resisted his calls to eliminate it then.\nAlaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said that she attended the White House breakfast and Trump did not change her mind. The filibuster “makes us different from these guys at the other end of the hall”, she said, referring to the House.\n“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Senator John Curtis said last week, when Trump first called for Republicans to eliminate it. He said he is a “firm no” if the issue were to come up.\nNorth Carolina Senator Thom Tillis said he could say “with metaphysical certainty this Congress is not going to nuke the filibuster, period, full stop”.\nEven Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has backed Thune, saying on Sunday that Republicans traditionally resisted calling for an end to the filibuster because it protects them from “the worst impulses of the far-left Democrat Party”.\n Small but growing number back idea ====================== Still, a few Republican senators have said they agree with Trump.\n“If we need to bust it, let’s bust it,” Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, a close Trump ally, said after the breakfast with Trump.\n“Let’s knock it down to 51 and let the Senate know that the power needs to go to the president and let him get something done. If we don’t, we’re going to lose our country. It’s over.” Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson said Trump made “a very convincing case” to the senators and that he talked to the president afterward about how they could potentially get it done.\nJohnson said Republicans can’t just sit back and be “schmucks”, letting Democrats do it first if they get power.\n“If you’d asked me a couple of years ago if I would support this, I would have said no,” Johnson said.\n Protecting minority powers ================= Trump has also urged Republicans to get rid of so-called “ blue slips”, a process in the Senate Judiciary Committee that allows the minority party to sign off on lower court judges in their home states.\nBut Thune and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have said the blue slips will stay.\nThune said earlier this year that the process enabled him to work with former president Joe Biden’s administration when there was a judicial vacancy in South Dakota and Democrats held the Senate majority.\n“I don’t sense any rush to change it,” Thune said.\nRepublicans were also cool to another proposal from Trump late last year, when he floated the idea of recess appointments.\nA day before Thune was elected leader by the GOP conference, Trump posted on social media that the next leader “must agree” to allow him to make temporary appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.\nThe Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president’s power to do so.

It would be imprudent of the President's advisors not to prepare for such a situation,\" Leavitt said. \"We are 100% in the President and his team's legal arguments and the merits of the law in this case. We remain optimistic that the Supreme Court is going to do the right thing.\"\nLeavitt further stated that the issue extends beyond Trump's presidency. \"This case is not just about President Trump, it's about the use of the emergency authorisation of tariffs for future Presidents in the administrations to come,\" she said, adding that Trump views economic security as inseparable from national security.\nAhead of the hearing, Trump described the case as critical to the nation's future.\n\"Tomorrow's United States Supreme Court case is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our Country,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\"With a Victory, we have tremendous, but fair, Financial and National Security.

This has worsened staff shortages, caused widespread flight delays and extended lines at airport security screening.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continueReport Ad\n\n\"We had a gut check of what is our job,\" Duffy told reporters, explaining why he made the decision.\n\nReuters earlier reported the plan.\n\nWhile the government did not name the 40 airports affected, the cuts were expected to hit the 30 busiest airports including those serving New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas. This would reduce as many as 1,800 flights and over 268,000 airline seats, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.\n\nThe move is aimed at taking pressure off air traffic controllers.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also warned that it could add more flight restrictions after Friday if further air traffic issues emerge.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nAirlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. carriers such as Delta (DAL.N), opens new tab, United (UAL.O), opens new tab, American, and Southwest (LUV.N), opens new tab, said its members were trying to understand the next steps.\n\n\"We are working with the federal government to understand all details of the new reduction mandate and will strive to mitigate impacts to passengers and shippers,\" it said.\n\nThe FAA was scheduled to hold a call with airlines on Wednesday evening to explain how the cuts will be implemented, according to industry sources.\n\nThe federal government has mostly closed as Republicans and Democrats are locked in a standoff in Congress over a funding bill. Democrats have insisted they would not approve a plan that does not extend health insurance subsidies while Republicans have rejected that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Republicans have been trying to intensify pressure on Democrats by increasing the pain felt by average Americans from the government shutdown.\n\nThe closure, which began October 1, left many low-income Americans without food assistance, closed many government services and led to the furlough of about 750,000 federal employees.\n\nDuffy had warned on Tuesday that if the federal government shutdown continued another week, it could lead to \"mass chaos\" and force him to close some of the national airspace to air traffic.\n\nAirlines have repeatedly urged an end to the shutdown, citing aviation safety risks.\n\nAIRLINE STOCKS DIP\n\nShares of major airlines including United and American were down about 1% in extended trading.\n\nAn airline industry group estimated that over 3.2 million passengers have been affected by flight delays or cancellations due to rising air traffic controller absences during the shutdown.

More than 2,100 flights were delayed on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said that 20% to 40% of controllers at the agency's 30 largest airports were failing to show up for work.\n\nDuffy said the authorities would also limit space launches to certain times of the day.\n\nReporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; editing by Chris Sanders and Cynthia Osterman\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights","summary":"Exclusive: Trump administration orders 10% of flights cut at major US airports due to shutdown  Reuters","url":"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-may-cut-air-traffic-10-by-friday-without-shutdown-deal-sources-say-2025-11-05/","image":"https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L36J3WOXHRMTJGE3VVMDZEXJUY.jpg?auth=197c3bd547e9d4e380c34f573a695f055190ebb2ab0c6269f63eed582b13b303&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true","video":"https://ajo.prod.reuters.tv/v3/playlist/711720/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:04:00","author":"David Shepardson,Rajesh Singh","authors":["David Shepardson","Rajesh Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.608},{"id":376181000,"title":"Supreme Court Reviews Landmark Case on Trump’s Controversial Tariffs","text":"US Supreme Court judges raised doubts on Wednesday over the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs in a case with implications for the global economy that marks a major test of Trump’s powers.\n\nBoth conservative and liberal judges sharply questioned the lawyer representing Trump’s administration about whether the president had intruded on the power of Congress in imposing tariffs under a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies.\n\nBut some of the conservative judges also signalled that they were wrestling with their recognition of the inherent power that presidents have in dealing with foreign countries, suggesting the court could be sharply divided in the outcome of the case.\n\nThe challenge involves three lawsuits brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led.\n\nThe tariffs — taxes on imported goods — could add up to trillions of dollars for the United States over the next decade.\n\nTrump solicitor general John Sauer kicked off the arguments by defending the legal rationale employed by the president, but immediately faced questions raising scepticism over the administration’s arguments about the language and purpose of the statute at issue.\n\nWhile the US Supreme Court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing arguments, the Trump administration has asked it to act swiftly in this case, though the timing of the decision remains clear. Source: AAP / Kent Nishimura / POOL / EPA\n\nIEEPA gives the president power to deal with “an unusual and extraordinary threat” amid a national emergency.\n\nIt had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs.\n\nBut what does the law say?\n\nThe US constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. \n\nThe imposition of taxes on Americans “has always been the core power of Congress,” conservative chief justice John Roberts told Sauer, adding that these tariffs seem to be raising revenue, which the constitution contemplates as a role for Congress.\n\nConservative justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned Sauer about his argument that IEEPA’s language granting presidents emergency power to “regulate importation” encompasses tariffs.\n\nDoes the court have power over Trump?\n\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in the lead-up to the arguments that if the Supreme Court rules against Trump’s use of IEEPA, his tariffs are expected to remain in place because the administration would switch to other legal authorities to underpin them.\n\nIn fact, conservative justice Samuel Alito asked about a different statute that has gotten less attention, known as Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, could provide an alternate basis for Trump’s tariffs.\n\nKagan said the power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce are usually thought of as “quintessential” powers belonging to Congress, not the president.\n\nConservative justice Brett Kavanaugh signalled potential sympathy for Trump, noting that former president Richard Nixon imposed a worldwide tariff under IEEPA’s predecessor statute in the 1970s that contained language similar to “regulate importation”.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUS Supreme Court judges raised doubts on Wednesday over the legality of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supreme Court Reviews Landmark Case on Trump&#8217;s Controversial Tariffs first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/supreme-court-reviews-landmark-case-on-trumps-controversial-tariffs/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/47/01/0ebd05e445dda526750982fa82ee/20250403139068429967-original.jpg?imwidth=1280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:03:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":376182944,"title":"Beijing lifts some tariffs on US farm goods but soybeans stay costly","text":"High tariffs have led China to largely skip US autumn crops this year, costing American farmers billions in exports. (EPA Images pic)\nBEIJING: China will suspend retaliatory tariffs on US imports, including duties on farm goods, after last week's meeting of the two countries' leaders, Beijing confirmed on Wednesday, but imports of US soybeans still face a 13% tariff.\nThe tariff commission of the state council, or cabinet, will scrap duties of up to 15% imposed on some US agricultural goods from Nov 10, while keeping levies of 10% introduced in response to President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" duties.\nInvestors on both sides of the Pacific were relieved when Trump met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, easing fears that the world's two largest economies might abandon talks to resolve a tariff war that has disrupted global supply chains.\nTrump and the White House were quick to issue their take on the meeting, but the Chinese side did not immediately give a detailed summary of what it had agreed.\n\"Broadly, it's a great sign that the two sides are making rapid progress in putting the deal into effect,\" said Even Rogers Pay, a director at Beijing-based Trivium China.\n\"It shows they're aligned and that the agreement is likely to hold up.\"\nUS soybean futures reached their highest level since June 2024 on hopes for Chinese buying.\nHowever, Beijing's decision to leave its 13% tariff on soybeans keeps US shipments to China too expensive for commercial buyers, compared to Brazilian alternatives, analysts said.\n\"We don't expect any demand from China to return to the US market with this change,\" said one trader at an international trading company. \"Brazil is cheaper than the United States and even non-Chinese buyers are taking Brazilian cargoes.\"\nAfter the meeting, the White House said China would purchase at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025 and at least 25 million tonnes in each of the next three years.\nBeijing has yet to confirm those figures, and traders are watching closely for signs of large-scale purchases.\nThe White House and US department of agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\nCheaper Brazilain beans\nChinese importers recently bought 20 cargoes of cheaper Brazilian soybeans as South American prices eased on expectations of a resumption of US sales to the world's largest soybean importer.\nWith China's tariff in place, US soybeans are well over a dollar per bushel more expensive than Brazilian old-crop supplies, said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for commodity firm StoneX.\nUnless Beijing waives the retaliatory duty, China's state grain buyer Sinograin will need to bear the burden of meeting the obligation of purchasing 12 million tonnes of US soybeans by the end of the year, Suderman said. Sinograin is essentially immune to the tariff and makes purchases for China's soybean reserve, he said.\n\"That would be an optimistic outlook for Sinograin to buy that quantity in such a short time,\" he said.\nBrazilian soybeans for December shipment were quoted at a premium of US$2.25 to US$2.30 over the January Chicago contract SF26, compared with US$2.40 a bushel being offered for US beans shipped from the US Gulf Coast, traders said.\nBefore last week's meeting, state trader COFCO made China's first purchases from this year's US harvest, an act analysts saw as a goodwill gesture.\nIn 2024, China bought roughly 20% of its soybeans from the United States, down from 41% in 2016, the year before Trump's first presidential term, customs data showed.\nThis year, China has largely shunned US crops from the autumn harvest due to high tariffs, costing American farmers billions of dollars in lost exports.\nIn a meeting with a US agricultural trade delegation on Tuesday, China's senior trade negotiator Li Chenggang attributed \"fluctuations\" in agricultural trade between the two countries to US tariffs, a summary of the meeting issued by China's commerce ministry showed.\nChina and the United States are \"important agricultural trade partners\", Li said, adding that he hoped Washington could work with Beijing to create favourable conditions for cooperation.\nChina's cabinet said it would also suspend for one year the 24% additional tariffs it imposed on US goods in April.\nChina will also remove or suspend for a year some non-tariff retaliatory measures, including export control measures announced in March and April against some US entities, the commerce ministry said on Wednesday.","summary":"The 13% import tax leaves US

an emerging software development that turns natural language into computer code using artificial intelligence (AI), has been named Collins’ Word of the Year for 2025.\n\nLexicographers at Collins Dictionary monitor the 24 billion-word Collins Corpus, which draws from a range of media sources including social media, to create the annual list of new and notable words that reflect our ever-evolving language.\n\nThey chose vibe coding as Word of the Year after observing a huge increase in usage since its first appearance in February.\n\nThe term was coined by Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and a founding engineer at OpenAI, to describe how AI can enable someone to create a new app while being able to “forget that the code even exists”.\n\nOther words on the list include “biohacking”, defined as the activity of altering the natural processes of one’s body in an attempt to improve health and longevity.\n\nAnother is “clanker”, a derogatory term for computers, robots, or sources of AI, which was popularised by Star Wars: The Clone Wars.\n\nThe word went viral on social media and is often used to express people’s frustrations with, and distrust of, AI chatbots and platforms.\n\nAlso a term of disapproval, the word “glaze” has gained traction this year, meaning to praise or flatter someone excessively or undeservedly.\n\nAnother is “aura farming” – described as the deliberate cultivation of a distinctive and charismatic persona – essentially the art of looking cool.\n\nThe term was previously popular with gamers but reached a much larger audience earlier this year following the widely shared “boat kid” video that started a dance trend popular with celebrities including American football player Travis Kelce.\n\nThe owners of the biggest global technology companies, informally known as tech bros, were dubbed the “broligarchy” after their high-profile attendance at the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, with the word also earning a place on the list.\n\nA rise in the use of the term “HENRY”, an acronym for “high earner, not rich yet” also sees it named by Collins.\n\nAnd “coolcation”, a holiday in a place with a cool climate, along with “taskmasking”, the act of giving a false impression that one is being productive in the workplace, make it on to the list.\n\nMicro-retirement, described as a break between periods of employment in order to pursue personal interests, also features.\n\nAlex Beecroft, managing director of Collins, said: “The selection of vibe coding as Collins’ Word of the Year perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology.\n\n“It signals a major shift in software development, where AI is making coding more accessible.\n\n“The seamless integration of human creativity and machine intelligence demonstrates how natural language is fundamentally changing our interaction with computers.”","summary":"The term vibe coding was coined by Andrej Karpathy, the

Gavin Newsom while speaking with Greek President Konstantinos Tasoulas on Nov. 4, per Daily Mail. Guilfoyle was appointed as ambassador to the nation by President Donald Trump earlier this year, after her engagement to Donald Trump Jr. ended.\n\n When Tasoulas asked Guilfoyle if she's ever visited Greece prior to her ambassadorship, Guilfoyle mentioned her honeymoon with Newsom.\n\n \"I actually covered the Olympic Games in 2004 for ABC News,\" Guilfoyle said, then added with a smile, \"I also had a honeymoon here in 2004. Fabulous honeymoon but…\"\n\n \"Honeymoon was fabulous, but the marriage?\" Tasoulas asked. Guilfoyle replied, \"We'll work on getting a new husband.\"\n\n Guilfoyle and Newsom tied the knot in 2001. At the time, Guilfoyle was working in the San Francisco district attorney's office while Newsom served on the board of supervisors. The San Francisco Chronicle called their union \"a royal wedding.

He and Guilfoyle separated that same year, and two years later, in February 2006, their divorce was finalized.\n\n Guilfoyle's comments to the Greek president come less than a year after her engagement to Don Jr. ended.

Don Jr. proposed on New Year's Eve in 2020.\n\n Towards the end of 2024, following his father's re-election, Don Jr. and Guilfoyle ended their engagement after he was seen repeatedly with Florida socialite Bettina Anderson.\n\n One day after Don Jr. was spotted holding hands with Anderson in public on Dec. 9, Trump appointed Guilfoyle as the U.S. Ambassador to Greece.\n\n Guilfoyle's Nov. 4 meeting with Tasoulas formally established the start of her tenure in the role, per The Associated Press.","summary":"Guilfoyle's comments come less than a year after she and Donald Trump Jr. ended their engagement","url":"https://people.com/kimberly-guilfoyle-jokes-about-her-fabulous-honeymoon-with-ex-gavin-newsom-and-says-she-s-ready-for-a-new-husband-11844300","image":"https://people.com/thmb/7Qv85Q3EJmjBPDzVoHdngx4Ojq0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(748x210:750x212)/kimberly-guilfoyle-gavin-newsom-110525-50e9d7c1180b4459bc833fb889e5ad6f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 00:00:00","author":"Rachel Raposas","authors":["Rachel Raposas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.213},{"id":376183368,"title":"SNAP benefits, albeit partial, could post to cards next week","text":"Federal funding being provided this week would allow the state Department of Health and Human Services, which administers the program, to load electronic benefits transfer cards by next week. The Health Department recommends that recipients check the cards often.\n\n“This follows USDA’s statement it would use $4.65 billion in emergency funds to cover about half of the federal SNAP program for the month of November in response to a lawsuit,” a release says.\n\n“SNAP is more than a benefit – it is a lifeline,” said Health Secretary Dev Sangvai. “It helps children grow, supports working families, and ensures older adults and people with disabilities can put food on the table. While we are encouraged by the decision to require the use of emergency funds, the fact that families will receive only partial benefits is troubling. Food is foundational to health, dignity, and opportunity. We must focus on the people we serve and ensure that programs like SNAP are protected from further disruption.”\n\nMore than 622,000 households are served by SNAP, the Health Department said. Those with balances on the account entering November can use them, though more than 60% had $25 or less, and more than 30% had less than $1.\n\nThe federal government shut down on Oct. 1 for the first time since a 35-day stoppage bridging 2018 and 2019.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., unable to get seven votes to reach the threshold of 60 needed to pass the legislation and unwilling to compromise on the House legislation.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., the deputy whip in the chamber, in a network interview said, “Shutdowns are terrible, and, of course, there will be families who will suffer. We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage points we have.”\n\nTRUMP SAYS NO CONTINGENCY SNAP PAYMENTS — WHITE HOUSE DOES DAMAGE CONTROL\n\nSchumer has asked for closed-door meetings with second-term Republican President Donald Trump, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.

We love you, Catherine!'\nAccording to Cleveland Clinic, an embolism 'is an obstruction or blockage in a blood vessel. Most often, it starts as a blood clot from elsewhere that breaks off and travels through your bloodstream.' \nThe Daily Mail has contacted representatives for Bach for comment but did not immediately hear back.\nFrom 1979 to 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard provided laughs for huge audiences on CBS with viewers eagerly tuning in to see what scrapes the three Dukes would get into next.\nSet in rural Georgia, the family-friendly show follows cousins Luke and Bo Duke (played by Wopat and Schneider, respectively) who are on probation but still look to get into trouble, mainly aiming to foil the corrupt schemes of county commissioner Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg.\n\nView gallery\n\nWopat, who portrayed her cousin Luke Duke on the show, shared this touching image and message in light of her health woes\n\nView gallery\n\nFrom 1979 to 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard provided laughs for huge audiences on CBS with viewers eagerly tuning in to see what scrapes the three Dukes would get into next; pictured 1997 \n\nCatherine Bach aka Daisy Duke signs fan's General Lee model\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 1:40\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nThroughout the 147 episodes, they are helped by their cousin Daisy, who became a sex symbol throughout the comedy's run, as well as wise uncle Jesse.\nCatherine was born on March 1, 1954, and hails from Cleveland, Ohio.

I do things that I shouldn’t really do,' she once explained of her decision to get them insured. 'I ski.\n'I had a plane when I started the series, which they made me get rid of… [I do] a lot of things. And I sort of take chances.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump accused \"kamikaze\" Democrats of being prepared to destroy the country as the government shutdown became the longest in history on Wednesday, eclipsing the 35-day record set during the Republican leader's first term.\nFederal agencies have been grinding to a halt since Congress failed to approve funding past Sept 30, and the pain has been mounting as welfare programmes - including aid that helps millions of Americans afford groceries - hang in the balance.\nSome 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, remain on enforced leave or are working without pay. Some courts are using emergency funds to stay open, warning that operations could slow if the shutdown drags on.\n\"I just got back from Japan,\" the 79-year-old president told a breakfast meeting with Republican senators at the White House as the shutdown entered its sixth week.\n\"I talked about the kamikaze pilots. I think these guys are kamikaze,\" he said, referencing Democrats. \"They'll take down the country if they have to.\"\nBefore the shutdown record toppled at midnight, the Trump administration sounded the alarm over turmoil at airports nationwide if the crisis drags further into November, with worsening staff shortages snarling flights and closing down sections of airspace.\nTransportation secretary Sean Duffy told a news conference Wednesday that the scheduled capacity for flights was being cut by 10% starting Friday in 40 busy air traffic areas.\nThe American Automobile Association (AAA) says 5.3 million passengers flew domestically over the Thanksgiving weekend in 2023, and gave a projected figure of 5.7 million for last year's holiday, which it is due to update later this month.\nMore than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers are working without pay, and the White House has warned that increased absenteeism could mean chaos at check-in lines.\nAirport workers calling in sick rather than working without pay - leading to significant delays - was a major factor in Trump bringing an end to the 2019 shutdown.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans remain unwavering, however, over the main sticking point in the current stoppage - health care spending.\n\nDemocrats say they will only provide votes to end the funding lapse after a deal has been struck to extend expiring insurance subsidies that make health care affordable for millions of Americans.\nBut Republicans insist they will only address health care once Democrats have voted to switch the lights back on in Washington.\nWhile both sides' leadership have shown little appetite for compromise, there have been signs of life on the back benches, with a handful of moderate Democrats working to find an escape hatch.\nA separate bipartisan group of four centrist House members unveiled a compromise framework Monday for lowering health insurance costs.\nDemocrats believe that millions of Americans seeing skyrocketing premiums as they enroll in health insurance programmes for next year will pressure Republicans into seeking compromise.\nBut Trump has held firm on refusing to negotiate, telling CBS News in an interview broadcast Sunday that he would \"not be extorted.\"\nThe president has sought to apply his own pressure to force Democrats to cave by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and using the shutdown to target progressive priorities.\nTrump on Tuesday repeated his administration's threat to cut off a vital aid programme that helps 42 million Americans pay for groceries for the first time in its more than 60-year history, even though the move was blocked by two courts.\nThe White House later clarified, however, that it was \"fully complying\" with its legal obligations and was working to get partial SNAP payments \"out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can.\"","summary":"The US leader accuses 'kamikaze' opposition of being willing to wreck the nation as federal agencies grind to a halt.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/11/06/trump-blasts-democrats-as-govt-shutdown-becomes-longest-ever-2","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9af9b31a-us-shutdown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:51:37","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":376183712,"title":"If you think your job sucks, imagine working for a Nazi that compels you to give up your own biometric data to power his anime sexbot [Creepy]","text":"Skip to content\n\nDo you have adblock enabled?\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

But without the funding stream, the county feared it would have to shut down critical health care services entirely as it expects to lose $223 million in federal money this year as a result of changes to Medicaid — more than 50% of the Santa Clara Valley Healthcare system’s revenues come from Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program for low-income and disabled residents.\n\n“We are delighted that this really critical piece has fallen into place,” County Executive James Williams told The Mercury News. “It is going to make an extraordinary difference, but we also still are facing hundreds of millions of dollars in impacts.”\n\nThe county has already stated its plans to seek support from the state for its health care system, which operates four hospitals and 15 clinics, and cost savings efforts are already underway with officials planning to bring forward $200 million in spending reductions to the health care system in February.\n\nThe impacts of Trump’s big tax and spending bill that he signed into law on July 4 were immediately felt by the county. Work requirements to determine Medicaid eligibility won’t take effect until next year, but the bill has already frozen or cut other critical payments. Many of these revenues helped bridge the gap between the actual cost of providing health care services and Medicaid reimbursements rates. They’re also crucial for public hospital systems like the one in Santa Clara County that disproportionately serves a large percentage of Medi-Cal enrollees.\n\nThe tax increase, which will go into effect on April 1, 2026, will help soften some of the financial blow of an expected total deficit of $228 million after cuts to those types of supplemental payment programs.\n\nCounty officials are projecting the tax will generate $83 million dollars from when it goes into effect to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2026, reducing the funding gap they have to close to $145 million.\n\nThe following fiscal year, the county is expecting an $800 million deficit — with $513 million of that a result of Trump’s landmark legislation. The sales tax is forecasted to raise $330 million in a full fiscal year, leaving the county with a $470 million funding gap to bridge in 2026-27.\n\nWilliams reasserted this week that the money raised from the tax will go toward supporting the Santa Clara Valley Healthcare system, while emphasizing that all of the county’s services are interdependent — the inability to backfill lost Medicaid revenues could mean cuts to other critical operations.\n\nBut opponents of Measure A are not convinced county officials will spend the funds the way they say they will.\n\nCritics of the ballot initiative have said that taxes are already too high — the local sales tax rate is currently currently 9.125% countywide, though higher in some cities, and the increase would put Campbell, Milpitas and San Jose at a 10% sales tax rate or higher. Opponents also condemned the county’s decision to make it a general sales tax that doesn’t restrict the revenue for specific purposes. Williams, for his part, said there will be independent auditing and oversight of all of the dollars generated from the tax.\n\nPat Waite, the treasurer of the Silicon Valley Business Alliance, said in an email that it’s “unfortunate, but not surprising that Measure A passed.”\n\n“While I remain skeptical,” he said. “I truly hope that the county devotes these funds to supporting the health system, as that is what they promised voters.”\n\nSanta Clara County officials said Tuesday night that the special election was on track to have a 50 to 60% voter turnout, which Registrar of Voters Matt Moreles said is “high for a special election and may even exceed some regularly-scheduled statewide elections.”\n\nThe turnout was likely boosted by Proposition 50 — California’s partisan redistricting measure — at the top of the ticket. Initial election results indicate that more Santa Clara County voters cast ballots in the Prop. 50 contest, which quickly sailed to victory, than they did for Measure A. Even fewer participated in the assessor’s election that was triggered by Larry Stone’s decision to step down earlier this year.","summary":"The revenue from Measure A is projected to fill one-third of the funding gap as a result of cuts to the federal Medicaid program.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/05/as-santa-clara-countys-measure-a-looks-like-it-will-prevail-county-officials-are-still-bracing-for-health-care-cuts/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-SCCOPIOID-2.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:48:55","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.489},{"id":376178862,"title":"Democrats are hopeful again. But unresolved questions remain about party’s path forward","text":"By STEVE PEOPLES, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — For a day, at least, beleaguered Democrats are hopeful again. But just beneath the party’s relief at securing its first big electoral wins since last November’s drubbing lay unresolved questions about its direction heading into next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe Election Day romp of Republicans stretched from deep-blue New York and California to swing states Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. There were signs that key voting groups, including young people, Black voters and Hispanics who shifted toward President Donald Trump’s Republican Party just a year ago, may be shifting back. And Democratic leaders across the political spectrum coalesced behind a simple message focused on Trump’s failure to address rising costs and everyday kitchen table issues.\n\nThe dominant performance sparked a new round of debate among the party’s establishment-minded pragmatists and fiery progressives over which approach led to Tuesday’s victories, and which path to take into the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections and beyond. The lessons Democrats learn from the victories will help determine the party’s leading message and messengers next year — when elections will decide the balance of power in Congress for the second half of Trump’s term — and potentially in the 2028 presidential race, which has already entered its earliest stages.\n\n“Of course, there’s a division within the Democratic Party. There’s no secret,” Sen. Bernie Sanders told reporters at a Capitol Hill press conference about the election results.\n\nSanders and his chief political strategist pointed to the success of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as a model for Democrats across the country. But Rep. Suzan Del Bene, who leads the House Democrats’ midterm campaign strategy, avoided saying Mamdani’s name when asked about his success.\n\nDel Bene instead cheered the moderate approach adopted by Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in successful races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey as a more viable track for candidates outside of a Democratic stronghold like New York City.\n\n“New York is bright blue … and the path to the majority in the House is going to be through purple districts,” she told The Associated Press. “The people of Arizona, Iowa and Nebraska aren’t focused on the mayor of New York.”\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a likely Democratic presidential prospect who campaigned alongside Democrats in several states leading up to Tuesday’s elections, noted the candidates hit on a common issue that resonated with voters, regardless of location.\n\n“All of these candidates who won in these different states were focused on peoples’ everyday needs,” Shapiro said. “And you saw voters in every one of those states and cities showing up to send a clear message to Donald Trump that they’re rejecting his chaos.”\n\nIntraparty criticism\n\nAmid Democrats’ celebratory phone calls and news conferences, members of the party’s different wings had some sharp critiques for each other.\n\nWhile Shapiro cheered the party’s success during a Wednesday interview, he also acknowledged concerns about Mamdani in New York.\n\nShapiro, one of the nation’s most prominent Jewish elected leaders, said he’s not comfortable with some of Mamdani’s comments on Israel. The New York mayor-elect, a Muslim, has described Israel’s response to the Oct. 7 attacks as “genocide” against the Palestinian people and has been slow to condemn rhetoric linked to anti-Semitism.\n\n“I’ve expressed that to him personally. We’ve had good private communications,” Shapiro said of his concerns. “And I hope, as he did last night in his victory speech, that he’ll be a mayor that protects all New Yorkers and tries to bring people together.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders’ political strategist, Faiz Shakir, warned Democrats against embracing “cookie cutter campaigns that say nothing and do nothing” — a reference to centrist Democrats Spanberger and Sherrill.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat who defeated democratic socialist Omar Fateh to win a third term, said at a news conference Wednesday that “we have to love our city more than our ideology.”\n\n“We need to be doing everything possible to push back on authoritarianism and what Donald Trump is doing,” Frey said. “And at the same time, the opposite of Donald Trump extremism is not the opposite extreme.”\n\nDemocrats win everywhere\n\nDespite potential cracks in the Democratic coalition, it’s hard to understate the extent of the party’s electoral success.\n\nIn Georgia, two Democrats cruised to wins over Republican incumbents in elections to the state Public Service Commission, delivering the largest statewide margins of victory by Democrats in more than 20 years.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Democrats swept not only three state Supreme Court races, but every county seat in presidential swing counties like Bucks and Erie Counties, including sheriffs. Bucks County elected its first Democratic district attorney as Democrats there also won key school board races and county judgeships.\n\nMaine voters defeated a Republican-backed measure that would have mandated showing an ID at the polls. Colorado approved raising taxes on people earning more than $300,000 annually to fund school meal programs and food assistance for low-income state residents. And California voters overwhelmingly backed a charge led by Gov. Gavin Newsom to redraw its congressional map to give Democrats as many as five more House seats in upcoming elections.\n\nKey groups coming back to Democrats\n\nTrump made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in 2024. But this week, Democrats scored strong performances with non-white voters in New Jersey and Virginia that offered promise.\n\nAbout 7 in 10 voters in New Jersey were white, according to the AP Voter Poll. And Sherrill won about half that group. But she made up for her relative weakness with whites with a strong showing among Black, Hispanic and Asian voters.\n\nThe vast majority — about 9 in 10 — of Black voters supported Sherrill, as did about 8 in 10 Asian voters.\n\nHispanic voters in New Jersey were more divided, but about two-thirds supported Sherrill; only about 3 in 10 voted for the Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli.\n\nThe pattern was similar in Virginia, where Spanberger performed well among Black voters, Hispanic voters and Asian voters, even though she didn’t win a majority of white voters.\n\nDemocrats will soon face a choice\n\nThe debate over the party’s future is already starting to play out in key midterm elections where Democrats have just begun intra-party primary contests.\n\nThe choice is stark in Maine’s high-stakes Senate race, where Democrats will pick from a field that features establishment favorite, Gov. Jan Mills, and Sanders-endorsed populist Graham Platner. A similar dynamic could play out in key contests across Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Michigan.\n\nMichigan Democratic Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who is aligned with the progressive wing of the party, said the people he speaks to are demanding bold action to address their economic concerns.\n\n“Folks are so frustrated by how hard its become to afford a dignified life here in Michigan and across the country,” he said.\n\n“I’m sure the corporate donors don’t want us to push too hard,” El-Sayed continued. “My worry is the very same people who told us we were just fine in 2024 will miss the mandate.”\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mike Catalini in Newark and Joey Cappelletti in Washington contributed.","summary":"The debate over the party’s future is already starting to play out in key midterm elections.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/11/05/democrats-party-path-forward/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25309087909164_937e81.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:48:38","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":376182884,"title":"Democrats are hopeful again.

(EPA Images pic)\nWASHINGTON: US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Wednesday that he would order 10% of flights at 40 major US airports to be cut starting Friday unless a deal to end the federal government shutdown is reached.\nThe shutdown, now in its 36th day and the longest in US history, has forced 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration agents to work without pay. This has worsened staff shortages, caused widespread flight delays and extended lines at airport security screening.\n\"We had a gut check of what is our job,\" Duffy told reporters, explaining why he made the decision.\nReuters earlier reported the plan.\nWhile the government did not name the 40 airports affected, the cuts were expected to hit the 30 busiest airports including those serving New York City, Washington, DC, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Dallas. This would reduce as many as 1,800 flights and over 268,000 airline seats, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.\nThe move is aimed at taking pressure off air traffic controllers.\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration also warned that it could add more flight restrictions after Friday if further air traffic issues emerge.\nAirlines for America, a trade group representing major US carriers such as Delta, United, American, and Southwest, said its members were trying to understand the next steps.\n\"We are working with the federal government to understand all details of the new reduction mandate and will strive to mitigate impacts to passengers and shippers,\" it said.\nThe FAA was scheduled to hold a call with airlines on Wednesday evening to explain how the cuts will be implemented, according to industry sources.\nThe federal government has mostly closed as Republicans and Democrats are locked in a standoff in Congress over a funding bill. Democrats have insisted they would not approve a plan that does not extend health insurance subsidies while Republicans have rejected that.\nPresident Donald Trump and Republicans have been trying to intensify pressure on Democrats by increasing the pain felt by average Americans from the government shutdown.\nThe closure, which began Oct 1, left many low-income Americans without food assistance, closed many government services and led to the furlough of about 750,000 federal employees.\nDuffy had warned on Tuesday that if the federal government shutdown continued another week, it could lead to \"mass chaos\" and force him to close some of the national airspace to air traffic.\nAirlines have repeatedly urged an end to the shutdown, citing aviation safety risks.\nAirline stocks dip\nShares of major airlines including United and American were down about 1% in extended trading.\nAn airline industry group estimated that over 3.2 million passengers have been affected by flight delays or cancellations due to rising air traffic controller absences during the shutdown. Airlines have been raising concerns with lawmakers about the impact on operations.\nAirlines said the shutdown has not significantly affected their business but have warned bookings could drop if it drags on. More than 2,100 flights were delayed on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said that 20% to 40% of controllers at the agency's 30 largest airports were failing to show up for work.\nDuffy said the authorities would also limit space launches to certain times of the day.","summary":"The US government shutdown has worsened staff shortages, caused widespread flight delays and extended lines at airport security screening.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/11/06/us-orders-10-flight-cut-at-major-airports-due-to-shutdown","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/47f22207-13244814.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:47:16","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.525},{"id":376185066,"title":"Democratic Maine Rep. Jared Golden won’t seek reelection in competitive US House district","text":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who represents one of the most competitive U.S. House districts in the country, said Wednesday he will not seek reelection.\n\nGolden was first elected to Congress in 2018 and has carved out a space as a Democrat who is willing to work with President Donald Trump’s administration. He announced his decision not to seek a new term in an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Bangor Daily News in his home state.\n\nGolden wrote that he has “grown tired of the increasing incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community.” He also said he was motivated to step down by the number of incidents of political violence in the country, including those against Trump and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nGolden, a Marine veteran, said he has also received threats against himself and his family.\n\n“These have made me reconsider the experiences of my own family, including all of us sitting in a hotel room on Thanksgiving last year after yet another threat against our home. There have been enough of those over the years to demand my attention,” Golden wrote.\n\nDemocratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries said Golden “is a good man, a patriot” and will be missed. He predicted Democrats would hold the seat and win the House majority.\n\nGolden’s decision to step down sets up a possible matchup between old political rivals in the state to fill one of the most watched House districts in the country. The leading Republican candidate is former Gov. Paul LePage, who led the state from 2011 to 2019. Former Democratic Secretary of State Matt Dunlap launched a primary challenge against Golden last month and is poised to become the leading Democrat.\n\nLePage and Dunlap served at the same time and sparred occasionally over issues such as election integrity and the wording of ballot questions.\n\nLePage said in a statement that the race “has always been about fighting for rural Maine.” Brent Littlefield, a spokesperson for LePage, attributed Golden’s departure to weak numbers in recent opinion polls.\n\n“I am running for Congress to make sure that working Maine families have a voice in Washington, D.C. This fight is just beginning,” LePage said.\n\nDunlap thanked Golden for his service in a statement.\n\n“In the days and months ahead, I intend to vigorously campaign for Congress in Maine’s second congressional district – and I intend to win,” Dunlap said.\n\nGolden was first elected to Congress using the state’s ranked choice voting system. He was reelected by wider margins in 2020 and 2022, but had to beat back a tough challenge from Republican Austin Theriault in 2024. Golden edged Theriault after a ranked recount.\n\nGolden represents the 2nd Congressional District, which is largely rural and geographically much larger than the 1st Congressional District, which is based around Portland. Golden’s district is also politically mixed, and Trump has won support there in three consecutive presidential elections.\n\nGolden has prioritized bipartisanship and the protection of traditional industries such as lobster fishing during his time in Congress. He also voted against one of the articles of impeachment against Trump in 2019 in a move that bucked party orthodoxy.","summary":"Golden wrote that he has “grown tired of the increasing incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community.” \n\n\nThe post Democratic Maine Rep.

The economy unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, defying US president Donald Trump’s tariffs, while the government revised lower its forecast for annual inflation this year. The ringgit is Asia’s top performer this year.\nIn other parts of Southeast Asia, Bank Indonesia governor Perry Warjiyo said last month he still sees room for additional interest rate cuts, while the Philippine central bank signalled it may ease further after unexpectedly lowering borrowing costs in October.\nThe Thai central bank too will likely keep monetary policy loose through next year after an easing cycle that has delivered 100 basis points of cuts since October 2024.\n\"When many regional central banks still sound dovish and plan to use more rate cuts to prompt growth, BNM remains an exception with its steady position, given Malaysia’s better growth prospects,\" said Yun Liu, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. She expects the central bank to hold its policy rate on Thursday and through 2026.\nHere’s what to watch for in the statement due to be released at 3pm local time:\nGrowth outlook\nMalaysia’s growth prospects have improved since the last central bank decision in September. Two of its biggest trading partners, the US and China, reached a truce that could reduce global trade tensions over the next one year. Malaysia also finalised a deal with the US that exempts about 12% of its exports – worth US$5.2 billion – from American tariffs.\nStill, the outlook faces downside risks as Washington mulls levies as high as 300% on semiconductor imports. The US is Malaysia’s third-largest export market for chips.\n\"We expect Malaysia’s economic growth will be sustained, backed by growing domestic spending and business activities, on the back of a healthy labour market, mild inflation and increased arrivals of foreign tourists,\" analysts at MBSB Research wrote in a note Monday.\nInflation expectations\nBNM may reaffirm the government’s revised inflation forecast for the year. The finance ministry last month said consumer price increases would average 1% to 2% in 2025, lower than the central bank’s projection of 1.5% to 2.3%.\nMalaysia’s inflation has remained broadly contained this year, averaging 1.4% in the first nine months of 2025. The expansion of Malaysia’s sales and service tax, revisions in petrol subsidies and fluctuations in global commodity prices are among factors expected to continue driving price pressures through the remainder of the year, RHB Bank economist Chin Yee Sian wrote in a note.\nRinggit performance\nThe ringgit has gained more than 6% against the dollar this year, putting it on track for its biggest annual gain versus the greenback since 2017.\nThe central bank’s monetary policy committee \"considers exchange rate developments only to the extent that they influence the outlook for domestic inflation and growth\", BNM said last week.","summary":"Economists cite the country's stable growth, benign inflation and strengthening ringgit.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/11/06/malaysia-set-to-defy-regional-easing-as-economy-holds-up","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/772378ae-kl-skyline-envatoelements-101025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:39:17","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.069},{"id":376179910,"title":"Trump faces ‘greatest test’ in delivering on affordability before 2026 midterms","text":"WASHINGTON — President Trump spent Wednesday touting his economic agenda — a day after Republicans suffered a blistering defeat in several key races across the nation, as the GOP looks to refocus on affordability issues to win back voters.\n\n“Day by day, we’re making America affordable again. It’s going to be affordable again at a really record pace,” Trump said at a business forum in Miami. \n\nBut at a breakfast with Republican senators earlier in the day, he was more reflective of the blue sweep, including by New York City Mayor-elect and socialist Zohran Mamdani as well as Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger winning the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races.\n\n“If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” Trump told the crowd. “Last night, it was not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas. I don’t think it was good for Republicans. I don’t think it was good for anybody. We had an interesting evening and learned a lot.”\n\nParty insiders say Tuesday’s results were a wake-up call for the GOP to recalibrate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections and win back voters who are worried about grocery costs, energy bills, and rising housing costs.\n\n“Republicans have to recognize that they got beat yesterday and the president’s comment that he wasn’t on the ballot does not help because he’s not going to be on the ballot in 2026,” former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told The Post.\n\n“I suggest trying to develop a Republican legislative scorecard and I specifically suggest that they think of this as the 21st Century Affordability Act,” said Gingrich (R-Ga.).\n\n“This is the greatest test of Trump, MAGA and Republicanism: Can they in fact offer a better life for the average American?”\n\nThe 2025 exit polls in the major contests found voters broke for Democratic candidates based on economic concerns, which is a turnaround from a year ago, when Republicans had the public’s confidence on the economy. \n\nTrump won back the White House in 2024 on an economic message of “slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” “cutting the cost of a new home in half,” imposing “a temporary cap on credit card interest rates,” and “getting gasoline below $2 a gallon [and] bring[ing] down the price of everything from electricity rates to groceries, airfares, and housing.”\n\nNearly 10 months into his second term, residential electricity costs are up 5.8% from last year, according to the latest monthly data from August, median home prices notched a new record high in the third quarter of 2025, a cap has not been imposed on credit card interest, gasoline averages $3.08 versus $3.10 on the same date last year, food-at-home costs are up 2.7% and airfare has gone up 3.2% over 12 months.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) crowed about the success of Democratic messaging, gloating Wednesday that voters gave a “decisive repudiation of Donald Trump” because of the fact that “Donald Trump and Republicans promised that they would lower costs on day one. Costs aren’t going down. They are going up.”\n\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) told The Post that “this is a warning sign” ahead of the midterms, which will dictate whether Trump’s final two years in office are consumed by Democrat-led investigations and obstruction of his legislative agenda.\n\n“One thing Republicans better be thinking about right now is, what are we not doing politically?” Lott said. “You’ve got to show an interest and suggest that certain things should be done. And I don’t see that occurring right now.”\n\nLott urged Republicans to immediately broker a deal with Senate Democrats to end the 36-day partial government shutdown, which has left more than 2 million federal civilian workers without pay.\n\nGingrich suggested doing so with reforms adding work requirements, anti-fraud measures and restrictions on migrants getting those benefits.\n\nThe election results were a heavy blow, though not entirely unexpected, as the GOP faced its biggest test on the party’s messaging ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nTrump said the record-breaking government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot hurt Republicans. \n\n“We had an interesting evening, and we learned a lot, and we’re going to talk about that,” Trump told senators.\n\nForty-nine percent of Virginia voters said the economy was their top issue, according to exit polls conducted by SSRS on Nov. 5, with nearly two-thirds of those voters choosing the Democrat.\n\nIn New Jersey, 32% said the same, with an even greater share of those respondents voting blue. Another 36% took aim at the Garden State’s tax-heavy policies.\n\nIn both states, electricity prices are soaring as a result of increased demand for power by artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Big Apple voters (56%) also described the cost of living as the most important issue facing the city, according to the exit surveys.\n\n‘Our asses handed to us’\n\n“We got our asses handed to us in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Democrats swept all three,” Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said in a blunt analysis of the results.\n\n“Our side needs to focus on affordability: Make the American dream affordable, bring down costs — electric costs, grocery costs, health care costs and housing costs, and lay out how we’re going to do it,” Ramaswamy offered as part of a two-part solution in tandem with eliminating “identity politics.”\n\nHousehold debt from credit cards, student loans, car loans and mortgages are at a record high, according to new statistics out Wednesday from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, though some categories declined slightly in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe president, clearly aware of the vulnerability, said in the economics-focused speech in Miami Wednesday afternoon that he’s committed to “making America affordable again” — arguing that he’s already making progress despite the Democratic wins.\n\nTrump pointed that inflation — currently at an annual rate of 3% — has eased up since its 9.1% peak during the Biden administration and that inflation-adjusted take-home pay has increased on his watch.\n\n“We’re going to have a bigger, better, stronger economy than the first four years,” Trump said, before touting what his administration has championed as a historic real-wage increase for blue-collar workers.\n\n“Since I took office,” he added, “wages for the typical factory worker are up $1,300, construction workers’ pay is up $2,200, and miners are up nearly $5,000 this year alone.”\n\n“Gasoline prices have plummeted to the lowest in two decades, and we’re going to soon see $2 gasoline,” Trump went on. “Grocery prices are way down and Walmart just announced that the cost of their standard Thanksgiving meal.. is 25% lower than one year ago. Isn’t that great?”\n\n“The cost of the typical new mortgage is down by nearly $3,000 a year. … Day by day, we’re making America affordable again. It’s going to be affordable again at a really record pace.”\n\nBlue-collar workers have seen real wage growth of at least 1.7% since Trump returned to the White House, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously told Post columnist Miranda Devine on “Pod Force One” — the highest level of any administration since former President Richard Nixon.\n\n‘Decisive moment in the future of Trumpism’\n\nGingrich, who engineered the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 by drafting and aggressively promoting his “Contract with America,” said that he’s confident conservatives can reverse the tide.\n\n“This is a very decisive moment in the future of Trumpism and MAGA and what kind of Republican Party we’re going to be,” Gingrich said.\n\n“It requires learning some lessons from yesterday and also being much more focused and disciplined about what we’re going to try to achieve and how we’re going to explain it.”\n\nMamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger had “almost identical language about affordability” that resonated with voters, he noted, touching on the cost of housing, healthcare and electricity.\n\n“In the short term, focusing on affordability and proving to the American people you’re listening to them are enormous steps. And then developing message discipline, which Republicans historically have never done,” the former House speaker contended.\n\nOne option for legislation would be Republicans mandating healthcare cost transparency to drive down costs — in an answer to the demands of Democrats to extend pandemic-era insurance subsidies, which has triggered the federal funding impasse.\n\n“Healthcare is now the single largest cost — it’s 18% of the American economy,” Gingrich said, pointing to research that transparency could reduce the burden by 4 percentage points by encouraging comparison-shopping and competition.\n\nLott, who led Senate Republicans in retaining their 55-seat majority in the 1998 midterm election, said he believes the GOP is positioned to hold the Senate next year but is at particular risk of losing the House, including because of California’s ballot measure passed Tuesday allowing for partisan redistricting.\n\n“The first thing to do is acknowledge you have an issue or a problem and assure the people that you’re going to meet with whomever you need to, the experts… and see if there’s anything Congress can do,” Lott said.\n\n‘First you win the debate’\n\nGingrich noted that it’s possible that Americans will begin feeling positive economic momentum next summer as a result of Trump’s aggressive pursuit of foreign investment and his use of tariffs and expensing incentives for manufactures — negating the liability.\n\n“As late as ’83 [Walter] Mondale was beating [then-President Ronald] Reagan in most polls,” he said, “There was an enormous recovery in the economy in the sense that Reagan was getting the job done. So if that happens here, we’ll be in another world.”\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans should avoid talking about “everything else” except the economy. Gingrich added — pointing to Mamdani’s refusal in a recent Fox News interview to discuss Israel-related topics as an example for Republicans.\n\n“He looked at them and said, ‘I’m focused on affordability and the housing crisis.’ That’s good message discipline,” the former House speaker raved.","summary":"\"I don't think it was good for Republicans.

But Virginia’s current governor is Republican, many of us believed New Jersey was winnable, and New York City didn’t just elect any old ordinary Democrat but a self-proclaimed socialist.No excuses. We just need to own it.But a kick in the rear end isn’t always bad, if we’re willing to reflect and learn.\n\nThere are two key lessons from last night’s losses — one related to economics, another to the culture wars.First, Republicans need to focus on the issue of affordability.\n\nToo many Americans feel like they can’t afford a decent life, when costs have risen faster than wages over the last half-decade. We can’t hide from the problem because it isn’t going away.Here’s what I hear across Ohio: Electric bills are rising, healthcare costs are nonsensical, home ownership is a struggle for young and elder Americans alike, and ordinary groceries are priced like luxury goods.\n\nThe problem isn’t limited to my home state, either; it’s a national phenomenon.We know how to fix it. The root cause of inflation is government overspending, and we need to curb it at every level.\n\nSupply-side constraints matter too, and we need to cut bureaucracy that gets in the way of production — including at the state and local levels.\n\nSpeed up permitting to build power plants and natural gas pipelines to reduce electric costs.\n\nGet rid of red tape and land use restrictions that limit new home construction.\n\nSlash property taxes to make ongoing home ownership more affordable.I’ve been one of the most vocal critics of Zohran Mamdani’s asinine policy proposals. “Freezing the rent” or government control of grocery stores will eventually harm the very people he purports to help.\n\nBut give respect where it’s due: He was right to at least focus on the issue of affordability at all, while his opponents all but ignored it.This is an irony because conservatives have the right answers to address the affordability challenge: relieve supply constraints, tame government waste, and deliver tax relief to working families.\n\nBut we now need to emphasize these solutions and move them to the top of our agenda, instead of getting lost in distractions.And that’s the second lesson: It’s time for the GOP to officially reject identity politics, once and for all.I wrote my first book, “Woke, Inc.,” in 2021 to criticize left-wing identity politics in corporate America.\n\nI wrote my second book, “Nation of Victims,” in 2022 to criticize left-wing identity politics in American culture.\n\nI wrote my fourth book, “Truths,” last year to re-emphasize both points ahead of the election.\n\nI traveled the country to help re-elect President Donald Trump, who stands for merit over group quotas. I’m proud to have supported him.So take it from me when I say that racial grievance politics is now emerging as a real problem — not just on the left, but in an ascendant online fringe of the American right.Until recently, this was mostly reserved for dusty corners of the internet (just take a look at replies to my own X feed, if you want a taste for some of the fringe right’s toxicity against Hindus and Indian-Americans — “pajeet,” “street s—ter,” etc.).\n\nBut there’s reason to believe that these online currents are now affecting voter behavior in the real world too.Sherrill was called “horse faced” and attacked with misogynistic slurs I won’t repeat here. Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger faced much of the same.\n\nIn New York, Mamdani — a Muslim American — was labeled a “terrorist,” “raghead” and worse.As conservatives, we should be able to say that this is disgusting and morally wrong. And we should be able to say it without stuttering.\n\nYet many Republicans can’t, because they’re afraid of online backlash from what was once just an irrelevant fringe of actual bigots who don’t actually represent our party in the real world.But these kinds of attacks helped Democrats defeat Republicans last night.\n\nWhen independent voters see toxic voices on the new right acting like the identitarian left — obsessing over someone’s race, religion, or gender instead of their ideas — they reject it.\n\nWe’re supposed to be the party of merit, hard work, and the American Dream — the idea that anyone, from any racial background, can succeed based on hard work and talent.\n\nWhen we traffic in the woke left’s identity-based obsession, we betray our own values.The online fringes want to drag us into rabbit holes about genetic identity, religious litmus tests, and ethnic grievances.\n\nIt’s a trap.\n\nMost Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Latinos and Asian Americans are naturally conservative. They value faith, family, hard work and entrepreneurship.\n\nMany fled socialist countries or religious persecution to seek freedom. They want school choice, safe streets, and economic opportunity.\n\nThey should be Republican voters. We should embrace them, not chase them away.\n\nTuesday’s losses stung. But hardship isn’t victimhood.\n\nIf we focus on affordability and reject toxic identity politics, we’ll win in 2026 with the same coalition that elected President Trump last year.\n\nIt’s time to remember who we are as Republicans and what we actually stand for — and to act boldly in the face of idiocy and bigotry without apology.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is a candidate for Governor of Ohio.","summary":"There are two key lessons from last night’s losses — one related to economics, another to the culture wars.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/05/opinion/tuesdays-elections-were-a-gop-wake-up-call-for-these-two-reasons/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-ggcugzxi7-1762383948870.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762366097&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-05 23:36:06","author":"Vivek Ramaswamy","authors":["Vivek Ramaswamy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.141}]}
