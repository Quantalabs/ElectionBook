So catchy, in fact, that the remix amassed 3.1 million views on TikTok. It also elicited a number of entertaining dance numbers across the app, including an “official” dance routine choreographed by Leigha VandenToorn At the time of writing, the sound has been used in 6,235 TikToks. @leighachrstine this is the official dance ♬ Never Trump Guy JD Vance House of Evo Remix – CasaDi Where’s it from? The woman from the start of the track is from a KamalaHQ TikTok from July 18. Team Kamala might not be responsible for the remix, and it’s not the offical Harris TikTok. But it’s fair to say the song wouldn’t have existed without the group. The TikTok then cuts to Vance during that infamous Charlie Ross interview, where he says:”I’m a never Trump guy. I never liked him.” “And I—but I noticed this willingness from people who think a lot like I do that, look, we told you so,” he added. “To all these white working-class voters, we told you so,” This TikTok and all its quips were mixed together by Carl “Casa Di” Dixon, a music producer from the House of Evo in Los Angeles. You might recognise the team as being of “One Margarita” fame. So this isn’t their first brush with virility—and we doubt it’ll be the last. @amandala11 Drop the beat! ? #dance #foryou #foryoupage #dancechallenge ♬ Never Trump Guy JD Vance House of Evo Remix – CasaDi Sound off In an interview with Newsweek, Dixon said: “The catchiness of the vocal by JD Vance caught our attention.” “We knew that the contradicting nature of Vance talking about Trump, especially as his VP candidate would get a lot of reactions. We also like to highlight the weird and crazy nature of Trump’s campaign.” And the rest, as they say, is history. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

The officer gets a boost from another officer to get on the building, but quickly drops. He then runs to alert other officers that he saw the gunman and heads to his patrol car to retrieve his gun. Thirty-nine seconds later, Crooks opened fire. Shots grazed the ear of the former president, killed volunteer firefighter and father of two Corey Comperatore, and injured two more rally-goers. \"He turned around on me,\" the officer who tried to climb on the roof yells to another officer after getting his weapon and struggling to catch his breath. \"Who's got eyes on him? He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on the left side.\"Within seconds, more law enforcement officers from different units are seen approaching the building.\"He is laying down,\" the officer says as a tactical unit prepares to climb on the roof. \"He's got glasses, long hair.\"The officer warns the team the gunman has a book bag and an AR-style gun. \"Watch out!\" he yells. A Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks within seconds of him opening fire, but the officers in the video seem to not know this yet. \"This building, this building, the left one,\" the officer who spotted the gunman cries out. Seconds later an officer can be heard in the background of the video yelling, \"Let me see your hands, let me see your hands!\"The bodycam video shows the officer climbing back onto the building and walking up to the body of the gunman, which is surrounded by three armed officers. The video shows blood running down the roof from the body. The officer who first tried to get on the roof had been handling traffic and was part of a group that was called by a local tactical team stationed on the second floor of the building complex after they had grown concerned about a suspicious person. One of the snipers took a picture of the gunman and saw him looking through a rangefinder minutes before the shooting.In another bodycam video from the scene, a Butler police officer tells another local officer, \"I f---ing told the Secret Service post a f---ing guy over here. I told them at the f---ing meeting.\"The bodycam video also shows the officer who tried to get on the roof and the others cursing and visibly frustrated. \"I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself,\" the officer says. \"He turned around, I f---ing dropped.\"\"Dude, I was f---ing calling out, bro, on top of the roof. Were you all on the same frequency?\" the officer asks the others.A few minutes later, the officer asks a member of the tactical unit, \"You good, bro?\" \"I'm f---ing pissed,\" the officer responds. \"We were watching him. We f---ing couldn't find him.\"\"I hear you, I hear you,\" the officer who first climbed the roof responds. A CBS News video analysis determined that the gunman fired eight shots in under six seconds before he was fatally struck — a fact later confirmed by the FBI. The Butler rally was the first time Secret Service counter snipers had been deployed to secure a Trump rally this campaign cycle.","summary":"One of the videos released from the Trump rally shows the moment when a Butler Township Police officer is hoisted onto the roof where the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, had taken position. ​","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-rally-shooting-bodycam-video-shows-moment-when-officer-first-sees-gunman-matthew-crooks/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/09/da57f7cf-365f-4d5d-9105-a3c294c2dba6/thumbnail/1200x630/766a3fdc2e9d6db6b18a9a3764dc0238/screen-shot-2024-08-08-at-7-31-35-pm.png?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3108718_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-09 00:11:00","author":"Elias Lopez","authors":["Elias Lopez"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":253710932,"title":"Harris reaffirms commitment to ABC debate with Trump","text":"Harris reaffirms commitment to ABC debate with Trump Former President Donald Trump said Thursday he'll take part in three debates with Vice President Kamala Harris in September, including a matchup he pulled out of less than a week ago.

The charges range from state-level racketeering accusations in Georgia to violations of the Espionage Act related to his handling of classified documents found at his personal estate in Florida.Trump is also accused of attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, and he made history in May by becoming the first former U.S. president to be criminally convicted in the Manhattan hush-money case. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and claims the indictments are an attempt to \"interfere\" with his reelection campaign.In a post to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, Weissmann, a law professor at New York University and a former FBI general counsel, said that Trump's plethora of legal woes were likely adding pressure ahead of November, and warned that the stress would lead to a \"more violent\" version of Trump.\"GIVEN THE DISTINCT PROSPECT OF JAIL, TRUMP IS GOING TO GET UGLIER, MORE RACIST, MORE VIOLENT, MORE CRIMINAL,\" Weissmann wrote, who said he was writing in all caps in order to make his point \"emphatically.\"\"FOR HIM, IT IS NOW 'NO HOLDS BARRED' TIME,\" he added. \"THE MEDIA AND LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED TO BE ON ALERT!\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.It is unclear if Trump will face jail time for any of the charges against him. In his felony conviction in Manhattan, where he was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to a hush money payment to a porn star during the 2016 election, each charge is a class E felony, which under New York law carries as maximum prison sentence of four years. Trump is currently set to face sentencing in the case on September 18.Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek on Thursday that he expects Trump will be sentenced to probation in the hush money case, noting, \"Home confinement is unlikely during a presidential election, and incarceration with Secret Service protection is even less likely and a logistical nightmare.\"Rahamani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, added over email that it was also unlikely for Trump to face jail time for his classified documents case, where presiding Judge Aileen Cannon \"appears to be biased in Trump's favor.\" That case was dismissed by Cannon last month, and special counsel Jack Smith has appealed that decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\"Bottom line is, it's far from certain or even likely that Trump will be jailed,\" Rahmani said.Jailed or not, other legal experts agree with Weissmann that Trump is likely to be on the \"offense\" in response to his pending cases.\"Donald Trump's strategy for his legal troubles—criminal and civil—has been that the best defense is an aggressive offense,\" said Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and elected state attorney. \"That approach has brought some victories, but it also has resulted in felony convictions and hundreds of millions of dollars of civil liability.\"McAuliffe noted over email that Trump wasn't just facing pressure inside the courtroom as well. In recent weeks, Vice President Kamala Harris has held the momentum in the 2024 race and closed the gap that Trump once enjoyed with President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee.\"Layered over all that is a changed presidential campaign,\" McAuliffe said. \"His [Trump's] position is demonstrably weaker than when Biden was the likely nominee. His lack of campaign momentum combine with his legal exposure to create a new kind of chaos—one he can't control.\"\"His history of counter-attack when he is being pushed back is predictable,\" he continued. \"What's changed is that his aggressiveness is starting to be viewed as weakness, not strength. That creates a perverse incentive for Trump to engage in even more extreme conduct to keep the public's attention.\"McAuliffe added that one recent example of Trump attempting to re-engage attention on his campaign was his attacks against Harris' racial background during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week.\"Trump's almost inexplicable attack about Harris's multiracial background is an example of an all words, no thought move,\" McAuliffe said. \"And the country should worry about not just more vitriolic actions by Trump, but similar extremist conduct by his most committed loyalists.\"","summary":"Attorney Andrew Weissmann said that the former president is under pressure from his pending legal battles while also running for reelection.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analyst-warns-donald-trump-violent-1936786","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2446374/legal-analyst-warns-trump-getting-more-violent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:45:08","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":253710024,"title":"Trump denies being concerned about the size of Kamala’s crowds and argues that he attracts crowds similar in size to MLK.","text":"Donald Trump shot back an agitated response when asked if he is concerned about the crowds showing up for Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president said the ‘honeymoon period’ will soon end as he lamented that the media refuses to acknowledge the impressiveness of his audience sizes. ‘Oh, give me a break,’ Trump exhaled during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday before thanking the reporter for giving him a chance to tout how many supporters go to his rallies. He insisted that there are up to 30 times more people at his campaign stops than at those for the vice president and if he garnered her crowds people would say his campaign is ‘over.’ The press conference comes as the Trump team continues to hit Harris for her refusal to speak with the media since entering the presidential race last month. In the 18 days after announcing, Harris has not taken a single question from the media, sat down for a single interview or held a single press conference – leading to questions on how she will perform off script. Meanwhile, Trump thinks media outlets are trying to turn Harris into a media darling and has deployed his vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance to go after her for refusing to speak with reporters. ‘Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey, you didn’t report it. I’m so glad you asked, what does she have in your city? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2000 people, you’d say my campaign is finished,’ ‘It’s dishonest – the press,’ Trump alleged. ‘And here’s a great example. I had in Michigan recently, 25,000 people and 25,000 people we just couldn’t get them in. We had in Harrisburg, 20–25,000 people, and 20,000 people couldn’t get in. We had so many – nobody ever mentions that.’ ‘And when she gets 1,500 people – and I saw it yesterday on ABC, they say, ‘oh the crowd was so big’ – I have 10 times 20 times, 30 times the crowd size,’ Trump said. ‘And they never say the crowd was big. That’s why I’m always saying, turn around the cameras.’ ‘I’m so glad you asked that.’ But Trump says the biggest crowd he ever spoke to was those gathered in Washington, D.C. on January 6 to hear him speak during certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The former president claimed his crowd was as big as those attracted by Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. – but said he was fine if people said the assassinated leader had more than him because he respects him. ‘The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to was that day, and I’ll tell you, it’s very hard to tell. It’s the biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken to and I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody spoke to crowds bigger than to me,’ Trump told reporters at his Florida golf club. ‘When we look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more,’ he said. ‘And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.’ ‘My crowd, we actually had more people,’ he continued. ‘They said I had 25,000 and he had a million people, and I’m okay with it, because I liked Dr. Martin Luther King.’ Earlier on Thursday morning, Trump posted on his Truth Social account that Harris ‘pays’ for people to show up at her campaign events.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump shot back an agitated response when asked if he is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump denies being concerned about the size of Kamala&#8217;s crowds and argues that he attracts crowds similar in size to MLK. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-denies-being-concerned-about-the-size-of-kamalas-crowds-and-argues-that-he-attracts-crowds-similar-in-size-to-mlk/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/08/21/88325633-0-image-m-12_1723147281216.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:41:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":253710172,"title":"The dubious GOP attacks on Tim Walz’s military record, briefly explained","text":"In a bid to undercut Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record. The charges, which a closer look suggests are misleading or exaggerated, are a notable escalation against the Democratic ticket by the Trump campaign. The attacks began in earnest on August 7, when Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, President Donald Trump’s running mate, sought to tout his own military experience compared to Walz’s. Prior to running for Congress, Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, while Vance served for four years in the Marine Corps. Neither has seen combat. “When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service,” Vance said. “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.” But Vance’s sweeping statement contains some key omissions. For instance, Walz retired in 2005, two months before his unit received formal notice it would be sent to Iraq. Another Republican attack on Walz’s service — that he misrepresented himself as a retired command sergeant major — is also more complicated: While he held that rank at one point, his rank was changed after retirement because he did not complete the required coursework. Yet another claim by Republicans is that Walz misrepresented his service by implying in a past statement that he once served in a combat zone. In that case, the language he used appears to have been imprecise. There is precedent for these types of attacks: Republicans appear to be resorting to the same “swift-boating” tactics that they once levied against former Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. A reference to the small speedboats used in the Vietnam War where Kerry served, the campaign sought to impugn his character by casting doubt on his account of military service in Vietnam. Notably, the architect of that campaign against Kerry was Chris LaCivita — now a prominent staffer on former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. Walz has faced questions about his military service before, including when he ran for Minnesota governor in 2018. And in that instance — and this one — he’s had several veterans defend him as well. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the National Guard, told the Minnesota Star Tribune in 2022, “He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.” The Harris campaign for its part has responded by stressing Walz’s tenure and policy record. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. The campaign also pointed to Walz’s time as a ranking member on the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his support for funding and mental health resources for the military. The claims, and the information we know, briefly explained The claims that Republicans have made about Walz focus on three issues: his decision to retire from the Army National Guard in 2005, his rank upon retirement, and a comment he made about carrying weapons “in war.” Here’s what we know about each of them. Claim 1: Walz retired from the Army National Guard to avoid serving in Iraq. What we know: Notably, Walz retired in May 2005, two months prior to his unit receiving an official deployment order to Iraq. He stated in 2009 that his reasons for retiring were to pursue a run for the House of Representatives, which he won the following year, and to avoid conflicts under the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. Walz filed for his run for office before the National Guard had notified his unit of the possibility of a deployment to Iraq. It’s unclear if, at the time, he already knew that a deployment could be a possibility. Below is a more detailed timeline of how this all unfolded. February 10, 2005: Walz files paperwork with the Federal Election Commission declaring his candidacy for the House seat in Minnesota’s First Congressional District. March 17, 2005: The National Guard informs members of the possibility of deployment to Iraq within the next two years. The public affairs office notes that 2,000 members could be sent from the Minnesota National Guard, which could include part of, or the entirety of, Walz’s battalion. March 20, 2005: Walz issues a statement responding to the National Guard notice, saying he intends to continue to serve, and to continue his run for Congress. “I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” he said. “As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.” May 16, 2005: Walz retires from the National Guard, according to a comment the Minnesota Army National Guard provided CBS News. July 14, 2005: Walz’s battalion receives an alert order for mobilization to Iraq. March 2006: Walz’s unit is deployed to Iraq. Claim 2: The Harris-Walz campaign misrepresented his title by stating that he’s a “retired Command Sergeant Major.” On the Harris campaign website and a Minnesota government website, Walz had been listed as a “retired Command Sergeant Major,” according to CBS News. Republicans have argued that this is an inaccurate description of his title. That phrase has now been changed on the Harris campaign website to note that this title was the highest rank he earned. What we know: Walz did, in fact, attain the position of Command Sergeant Major. However, after he retired, his title was changed to Master Sergeant, because he did not finish the coursework required to retire under the promoted title. As a result, it’s accurate to say that he was once a Command Sergeant Major, but not that he was a “retired Command Sergeant Major.” Claim 3: Walz misrepresented his involvement in combat in a speech about gun control. “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in remarks about an assault weapons ban in 2018. [Media: https://twitter.com/KamalaHQ/status/1820918063966962143] Vance argues that Walz’s statements imply that he was in combat when he wasn’t. What we know: Walz was deployed as part of the National Guard to Vicenza, Italy, in August 2003 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom but was not in a combat zone. The phrasing of the statement in his gun control remarks, suggesting that he carried the weapons “in war,” was imprecise. While technically correct given the operation he was part of, it appears to suggest an experience he didn’t have. Walz has openly acknowledged in other interviews that he hadn’t seen combat while deployed. The Harris campaign has stressed Walz’s training with firearms in response. “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way.”","summary":"In a bid to undercut Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record.

Lawyers for Special Counsel Jack Smith wrote U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ahead of a Friday deadline, to request more time to develop “an informed proposal” about next steps in the four-count felony case against Trump. The prosecutors said they have been consulting with other parts of the Justice Department but need more time to finalize their position. They proposed filing an update with the court by Aug. 30. Defense attorneys for Trump did not oppose the delay, the Thursday night filing said. If the judge approves the request, it would push pretrial proceedings in the case well into September. The prosecution of the former president stalled for eight months while higher courts reviewed Trump’s bid for immunity for actions he took while in the White House. The case charges Trump with conspiring to defraud the United States, and deprive millions of voters of the right for their 2020 ballots to be counted. There's now no chance the case will to go to trial before Election Day in November. Trump has pleaded not guilty. If Trump regains the White House, he could order the Justice Department to drop the prosecution, which accuses him of taking illegal actions that culminated in violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. More than 140 law enforcement officers suffered injuries that day, in what the Justice Department has called the largest mass-casualty event for police.","summary":"The Justice Department is asking for more time to share next steps in the federal election interference case against former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/08/g-s1-16083/trump-election-interference","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4231x2821+0+0/resize/4231x2821!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2F88%2Fbfd9ff3143d98123ce78a283a4a3%2Fgettyimages-1738985047.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:38:30","author":"Carrie Johnson","authors":["Carrie Johnson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":253710054,"title":"Top election predictor moves three battleground states out of the Trump column into ‘toss ups’","text":"Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, no longer look like they will be wins for the Trump campaign in 2024, according to election forecasters at the Cook Political Report, which moved the states from leaning Republican to “toss-ups.” “Three weeks ago, Donald Trump was leading President Joe Biden in the Cook Political Report national vote tracker by about 2.5%,” editor-in-chief Amy Walter wrote on Thursday. “Today, Kamala Harris leads Trump by less than one point, a shift of more than three points in Harris’ direction. Battleground state polls are showing similar results, with Harris cutting into Trump’s lead by anywhere from two to five points.” The site also found that the projected election results were within the margin of error in the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If the Harris-Walz campaign were able to win the states, it would build on the unlikely success of the Biden campaign, which flipped Arizona and Georgia in 2020. Other election monitors have shown similar results in recent days. The RealClearPolitics poll average has Harris over Trump by less than one percent, while the 538 poll aggregate has Harris leading by more than two percent. On Thursday, Donald Trump held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, seen as an attempt to recapture some of the spotlight from a surging Democratic side that’s seemed to have all the attention since Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the ticket.

United States … including through consultation with other Department of Justice components,” according to the joint status report filed to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. Although Smith notes those “consultations are well underway,” the government has not finalized its position on the “most appropriate schedule for the parties to brief issues related to the decision,” the special counsel’s office wrote, referring to the Supreme Court ruling that found former presidents are immune from prosecution for “official” acts taken while in office. Trump’s counsel did not object to the government’s request for an extension. Trump responded to the request Thursday evening in a statement, saying “It is clear that the Supreme Court’s historic decision on immunity demands and requires a complete and total dismissal of all the witch hunts.” Smith’s office said they are available to proceed “any day after August 30” but noted Trump’s defense is not available on Sept. 6 and the week of Sept. 16, which is the week when New York Judge Juan Merchan is set to decide on whether the immunity ruling should result in overturning Trump’s criminal conviction in the separate criminal hush money case. Both parties were initially expected to submit filings beginning on Friday after Chutkan ordered both parties to propose how to move forward following the Supreme Court’s decision on July 1. Chutkan has currently slated a hearing for next Friday to begin work on the case after an eight-month delay, which was spurred due to Trump’s immunity appeal effort. The move by Smith to request a delay marks a stark change in the way he handled the case after it became the third of four criminal indictments against the former president last year. The special counsel often cited the need for a trial to occur before the election and emphasized the public’s need for a resolution. Chutkan had only regained jurisdiction last Friday after a monthlong wait for the case to return to her chambers. Due to the compounding delays in the case, legal experts suggested the case wouldn’t get to trial before the November presidential election but that there could be a sort of “mini-trial,” or evidentiary hearings with live witness testimony ahead of the election. If Chutkan grants this request, it will likely further diminish the extent of pretrial adjudication ahead of the election. The request also signals how Smith and the Justice Department are still grappling with the best route forward following the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision, which has become a point of marked criticism by President Joe Biden, who recently backed an effort by Congress to pass an amendment that would effectively undo the justices’ decision. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Smith has also faced setbacks in his separate federal indictment against Trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the Oval Office, with U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida recently dismissing the case on the grounds that Smith was improperly appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. That decision is currently being appealed by Smith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Trump is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, witness tampering, conspiracy against the rights of citizens, and obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, which encompasses his challenging of the election results after his defeat in November 2020. He pleaded not guilty to the charges last August.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump&#8216;s attorneys and special counsel Jack Smith requested a three-week delay to proceedings in the federal 2020 election subversion case, citing a need to further evaluate the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent presidential immunity ruling. &#8220;The Government continues to assess the new precedent set forth last month in the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3116139/trump-jack-smith-seek-three-week-delay-2020-election-case/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MixCollage-27-May-2024-09-14-PM-2889.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:33:59","author":"Kaelan Deese","authors":["Kaelan Deese"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":253710042,"title":"FACT FOCUS: A look at claims made by Trump at news conference","text":"In his first news conference since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, former President Donald Trump said he would debate her on Sept. 10 and pushed for two more debates. The Republican presidential nominee spoke for more than an hour, discussing a number of issues facing the country and then taking questions from reporters. He made a number of false and misleading claims. Many of them have been made before. Here’s a look at some of those claims. ___ CROWD SIZES CLAIM: “The biggest crowd I’ve ever spoken — I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. And they said he had a million people, but I had 25,000 people.” THE FACTS: Trump was comparing the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd that attended Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But far more people are estimated to have been at the former than the latter. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Moreover, Trump and King did not speak in the same location. King spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which looks east toward the Washington Monument. Trump spoke at the Ellipse, a grassy area just south of the White House. ___ JAN. 6 CLAIM: “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6.” THE FACTS: That’s false. Five people died in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and its immediate aftermath. Pro-Trump rioters breached the U.S. Capitol that day amid Congress’ effort to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory. Among the deceased are Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter shot and killed by police, and Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died the day after battling the mob. Four additional officers who responded to the riot killed themselves in the following weeks and months. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from San Diego, was shot and killed by a police officer as she climbed through a broken part of a Capitol door during the violent riot. Trump has often cited Babbitt’s death while lamenting the treatment of those who attended a rally outside the White House that day and then marched to the Capitol, many of whom fought with police. ___ DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION CLAIM: “The presidency was taken away from Joe Biden, and I’m no Biden fan, but I tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you look at, they took the presidency away.” THE FACTS: There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents the Democratic Party from making Vice President Kamala Harris its nominee. That process is determined by the Democratic National Committee. Harris officially claimed the nomination Monday following a five-day online voting process, receiving 4,563 delegate votes out of 4,615 cast, or about 99% of participating delegates. A total of 52 delegates in 18 states cast their votes for “present,” the only other option on the ballot. The vice president was the only candidate eligible to receive votes after no other candidate qualified by the party’s deadline following President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race on July 21. ___ THE ECONOMY CLAIM: Suggesting things would be different if he had been in office rather than Biden: “You wouldn’t have had inflation. You wouldn’t have had any inflation because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems. Now they’ve gone back to the Trump thing because they need the votes. They’re drilling now because they had to go back because gasoline was going up to 7, 8, 9 dollars a barrel.” THE FACTS: There would have been at least some inflation if Trump had been reelected in 2020 because many of the factors causing inflation were outside a president’s control. Prices spiked in 2021 after cooped-up Americans ramped up their spending on goods such as exercise bikes and home office furniture, overwhelming disrupted supply chains. U.S. auto companies, for example, couldn’t get enough semiconductors and had to sharply reduce production, causing new and used car prices to shoot higher. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March 2022 also sent gas and food prices soaring around the world, as Ukraine’s wheat exports were disrupted and many nations boycotted Russian oil and gas. Still, under Biden, U.S. oil production reached a worldwide record level earlier this year. Many economists, including some Democrats, say Biden’s $1.9 trillion financial support package, approved in March 2021, which provided a $1,400 stimulus check to most Americans, helped fuel inflation by ramping up demand. But it didn’t cause inflation all by itself. And Trump supported $2,000 stimulus checks in December 2020, rather than the $600 checks included in a package he signed into law in December 2020. Prices still spiked in countries with different policies than Biden’s, such as France, Germany and the U.K., though mostly because of the sharp increase in energy costs stemming from Russia’s invasion. ___ IMMIGRATION CLAIM: “Twenty million people came over the border during the Biden-Harris administration — 20 million people — and it could be very much higher than that. Nobody really knows.” THE FACTS: Trump’s 20 million figure is unsubstantiated at best, and he didn’t provide sources. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports 8.2 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through June 2024. That’s arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests. In addition, CBP says it stopped migrants 1.1 million times at official land crossings with Mexico from January 2021 through June 2024, largely under an online appointment system to claim asylum called CBP One. U.S. authorities also admitted nearly 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under presidential authority if they had financial sponsors and arrived at an airport. All told, that’s nearly 8.7 million encounters. Again, the number of people is lower due to multiple encounters for some. There are an unknown number of people who eluded capture, known as “got-aways” in Border Patrol parlance. The Border Patrol estimates how many but doesn’t publish that number. ___ CLAIM: Vice President Kamala Harris “was the border czar 100% and all of a sudden for the last few weeks she’s not the border czar anymore.” THE FACTS: Harris was appointed to address “root causes” of migration in Central America. That migration manifests itself in illegal crossings to the U.S., but she was not assigned to the border. ___ NEW YORK CASES CLAIM: “The New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice.” THE FACTS: Trump was referring to two cases brought against him in New York — one civil and the other criminal. Neither has anything to do with the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil case was initiated by a lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Trump was ordered in February to pay a $454 million penalty for lying about his wealth for years as he built the real estate empire that vaulted him to stardom and the White House. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a state-level prosecutor, brought the criminal case. In May, a jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. ___ Associated Press writers Melissa Goldin and Elliot Spagat and economics writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this article. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.

President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, hosted a thank you event on Thursday for hundreds of staffers who worked on the reelection campaign that he chose to exit nearly three weeks ago. Judging by the security tents, the location offered a dose of political nostalgia: The staffers met with Biden at The Queen, a music venue that played a critical role in his successful race for presidency in 2020, when he often spoke to the public from the theater’s stage. After having dropped out of the race, Biden wanted to show his appreciation for the staff’s work over the past year and their continued efforts in support of Vice President Kamala Harris, who succeeded him as the Democratic nominee. That’s according to a person familiar with the president’s plans who shared details of the events but insisted on anonymity to discuss the arrangements. The event featured food and, naturally for Biden, his beloved ice cream. The president has kept a lower profile since leaving the presidential race, a response to a loss of confidence in his ability to beat Donald Trump after a disastrous debate on June 27 against his rival. He has pared back his travel schedule and held more closed-door policy briefings. Biden still has engaged in some prominent activities such as work toward a prisoner swap involving Russia that resulted in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free. The Queen, the concert hall in downtown Wilmington where Biden met with staff, played a critical role in the 2020 election as Biden staged events there because the pandemic limited public gatherings and travel. He used the space to hold news conferences and deliver remarks. The building was originally a 19th Century hotel that was popular among traveling sailors, according to the venue’s web site. From 1916 to 1959, it was converted into a movie theater, only to then be abandoned and fall into disrepair over the next 50 years. The Queen reopened in 2011 as a music venue. Following Biden’s appearance, the theater’s web site indicates, it will next host on Friday the bands Cobra Whip, The Stone Eye and Dirty House.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. – Of course, ice cream was involved.

Both Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, and Harris, his Democratic counterpart, have confirmed their participation in the debate, said the network in a statement. The 90-minute debate is expected to be held in Philadelphia, and the ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis will serve as moderators, according to The New York Times. The debate will probably be held without a live audience, but the exact format and ground rules are still being determined, the report said, quoting two people with knowledge of the plans. The announcement followed a Trump news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, during which he proposed three debates with Harris. Trump had previously agreed to debate President Joe Biden on Sept. 10, but pulled out after Biden withdrew from the Democratic ticket.

The former president cited three separate debates with Harris by three different television networks, which prompted the Harris campaign to quickly send an email correcting Trump on the dates. \"I think they'll be very revealing,\" he said. A September 4 debate will be hosted by Fox, followed by an NBC debate on September 25 and then a September 10 debate hosted by ABC. The hosting networks, Trump says, are \"very anxious awaiting those dates.\" He said he spoke with network heads, adding that \"fairly minor details\" await -- such as city of location and audience rules and requests, which Trump said \"will be settled very easily.\" He also used the event to turn his invective on Harris. The vice president, Trump said, is \"a bad debater\" who is \"worse than Biden\" and \"not as smart\" as him. He said that, since Biden dropped his campaign for another four years in the Oval Office, \"I haven't recalibrated policy at all\" to better take on Harris. He went on to call Harris the \"worst admired, least respected, most unpopular vice president\" in American history. \"I'm very happy to run against her,\" he added, taking aim at Harris' newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling him part of the \"radical left.\" \"He doesn't want to have borders, he doesn't want to have walls,\" Trump claimed as he also briefly mentioned his own running mate. \"JD Vance has really stepped up,\" he says. \"He's doing a fantastic job.\" The ex-president also spoke at length about campaign crowd sizes in response to questions about a perceived lack of enthusiasm for the Republican ticket, which some say is evidenced by sparsely attended crowds at some Trump rally events. \"We have the enthusiasm; the Republican Party and me as a candidate, we have the enthusiasm,\" he responded. Trump also faced questions about his thin campaign event schedule. He is not making many campaign swings, Trump said, because he is \"winning by a lot\" despite recent contradictory polling that would suggest otherwise. He said he will step up his campaigning after the Democratic National Convention later this month. Tramp also said he is \"doing commercials to a level never done before\" at Mar-a-Lago and creating \"a lot of recording.\" The former president also said that abortion, which will be a top ballot concern this fall, is \"much less of an issue\" now, despite the overturning of abortion access protections formerly offered by Roe vs. Wade, something of which Trump takes credit. \"Democrats, Republicans, everybody,\" he said, wanted the federal issue to revert to the purview of state courts and state laws. \"I did that. Now states are voting\" on their own abortion polices, he said. Later on Thursday, former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham suggested in a social media post that the former president is \"panicking\" with his \"self-announced\" press conference, which prompted the Trump team to issue a response personally criticizing her.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday held a self-announced press conference in which he said he is looking forward to upcoming debates with Vice President Kamala Harris, now the official Democratic nominee.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/08/Donald-Trump-press-conference-Kamala-Harris-presidential-debates/8321723136079/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8321723136079/2024/upi/3eef8a4e99cccf24f2eeea485fda872f/v1.2/At-self-announced-press-event-Trump-says-hes-eager-for-debates-with-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:15:53","author":"Chris Benson","authors":["Chris Benson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":253709630,"title":"Trump compares his Jan. 6 crowd to the audience for MLK's 'I Have a Dream' speech","text":"PALM BEACH, Fla. — Donald Trump has long boasted about crowd sizes at his rallies, but on Thursday, he used an unexpected comparison when making the case he is the biggest draw: Martin Luther King Jr. “Nobody has spoken to crowds bigger than me,” Trump said at his news conference at Mar-a-Lago. “If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people.” The answer came in response to a question the former president received about whether or not he thought the conclusion of his term could be considered a peaceful transfer of power, even though it was marked by the Jan. 6 insurrection. As he has previously, Trump said the people who have been arrested as a result of storming the Capitol have been treated unfairly. Then, unprompted, he compared the “Stop the Steal” rally he had before the protesters marched towards the Capitol to King’s “I have a Dream” speech, which was held at the same location. Trump acknowledged that official estimates put his crowd size as smaller than King's, but he said he thought he had \"more people.\" “But when you look at the exact same picture and everything is the same — because it was the fountains, the whole thing all the way back to go from Lincoln to Washington — and you look at it, and you look at the picture of my crowd…we actually had more people,\" he said. The congressional Jan. 6 committee pegged Trump’s crowd at 53,000 people, about one-fifth of the 250,000 who were estimated to be at King’s famous address from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump advisers and supporters alike have urged him to focus on the record of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, rather than on her race, which he has explicitly done over the past week. That tendency to go off-message, like comparing himself to a civil rights icon, was again on full display Thursday during a wide-ranging hour-long press conference in which he said Harris has been “disrespectful” to Black and Indian-American voters by identifying as both. He again baselessly questioned whether Harris has always identified as Black, called her “barely competent” and attributed her surge in the polls to her gender. At the same time, Trump acknowledged that Harris’ presence at the top of the ticket might hurt him slightly with Black voters, a demographic his campaign has heavily focused on. “It changes around a little bit. I’m getting other voters,” Trump said of the Black vote from the ornate living room of his Mar-a-Lago club. “Perhaps you know, I was doing well with Black voters and I still am. I seem to be doing very well with Black males.” “It’s possible that I won’t do as well with Black women, but I do seem to do very well with other segments,” he added. Trump was quick to focus on the race of Harris, who has a Black father and an Indian mother, when it was clear she was going to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. That dynamic was highlighted last week by comments he made during an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists. At that event in Chicago, Trump baselessly suggested that Harris had only started identifying as Black because it was politically advantageous. Later that night at a rally in Pennsylvania, his campaign posted on the arena’s big screen a headline that called Harris the first “Indian American senator.” When asked why Harris is doing better in most public polling than Biden, Trump said she “represents certain groups of people” and said the bump can also be attributed, in part, to the fact that “she’s a woman.” “I see her going way down in polls now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed the state of California with Governor Gavin Newscum,” Trump said, giving a pejorative nickname to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Harris’ campaign responded to the press conference in a press release with the headline, “Donald Trump’s Very Good, Very Normal Press Conference.” “Split screen: Joy and Freedom vs. Whatever the Hell That Was,” read the release. The press conference came during a relatively quiet week for Trump, who is holding just one event in Montana — which is heavily Republican-leaning — and has found himself in the rare position of being overshadowed by Harris’ emergence. “What a stupid question,” Trump said glibly when asked about his lighter schedule. “This [is] because I am leading by a lot.” Trump went on to say that while he is holding fewer events ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month, his campaign is in heavy rotation with TV ads, and he is meeting with the press publicly, unlike Harris. “I’m doing tremendous amounts of taping here. We have commercials that are at a level I dont think that anybody has ever done before,” he said. “I see many of you in the room where I’m speaking to you on phones. I’m speaking to the radio. I’m speaking to televisions. Television is coming here.” “Excuse me, what are we doing right now?” Trump added, referencing the press conference. “She is not doing any news conferences….she’s not smart enough to do a news conference.” Trump’s advisers have emphasized the importance of contrasting his record versus Harris, which they have routinely framed as outside of the mainstream, criticizing even supporters who sometimes deviate from their desired message. “Sometimes our allies don’t do us any favors, clarifying the differences,” a senior Trump advisor said. “So for us as a campaign, we have to make clear where each candidate stands on the issues that matter to the persuadable voters so they have the real information and we have to spend money across all of the means necessary to do that.” Asked whether Trump always helps himself by making those contracts clear in his messaging, the adviser dodged. “I won’t comment on that,” they said.","summary":"Donald Trump has long boasted about crowd sizes at his rallies, but on Thursday, he used an unexpected comparison: Martin Luther King Jr.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-compares-jan-6-crowd-audience-mlk-dream-speech-rcna165894","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-donald-trump-conference-wm-346p-d0e4de.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 23:11:04","author":"Jonathan Allen,Matt Dixon","authors":["Jonathan Allen","Matt Dixon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":253709864,"title":"House Republicans Pivot Scrutiny From Biden to Harris","text":"Good evening.

Preserve America, a pro-Trump super PAC, is releasing a new TV and digital spot in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as part of an eight-figure ad campaign running from the opening ceremony of the Olympics until Labor Day. The ad, titled “Damage,” features the testimony of Julie Ann Willoughby, an emergency room nurse and Republican State representative in Arizona, discussing the toll of the border crisis on the healthcare system. “I’ve seen firsthand the damage that Kamala Harris caused as our country’s borders czar,” Willoughby charges in the new ad, showing her wearing scrubs and appearing to be at a hospital. “Hospitals everywhere are overwhelmed and American patients are paying the price.” “My patients are covering the healthcare costs for people here illegally while their own care is jeopardized,” Willoughby says, looking straight into the camera. “Kamala Harris is weak and dangerous.” The ad, shared first with the Washington Examiner on Thursday, is the latest attack against Harris for her role in the administration’s handling of the U.S. southern border, which has seen unprecedented levels of migrants. The issue has been a major political liability for the Biden administration as Republicans have sought to use the border crisis as an example of President Joe Biden’s failures as president and now Harris’s after she became the presumptive Democratic nominee last month. Since Biden made his exit and endorsed Harris, the vice president has largely not mentioned the crisis on the southern border and her role in immigration policy, which is now in the spotlight. However, she has begun reflecting on her time prosecuting transnational gangs and drug traffickers as the attorney general of a border state during her rallies. “In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico,” Harris said during a rally in Atlanta last week. “I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won.” Harris also continues to point to a border bipartisan compromise bill that Sens. James Lankford (R-OK), Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), and Chris Murphy (D-CT) and officials from the White House put together in February, which ultimately died under political pressure from Trump. “It was all set to pass, but at the last minute Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,” Harris said.

The president tried to project confidence in front of the 2,000 people gathered in the school's gym, insisting he was the only one who could beat Donald Trump and that he wasn't dropping out of the race. Less than four weeks later, Biden had been replaced as his party's candidate, and Michigan's biggest city was hosting a very different kind of campaign event. Beyonce's lyrics \"Who run the world? Girls\" blared from the speakers as the vice-president's plane, Air Force Two, pulled up in front of an airport hangar packed with 15,000 of Kamala Harris's supporters. \"We are doing this,\" she told the crowd as it chanted her name. \"The path to the White House runs right through this state. And with your help, we will win in November.\" Harris is riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, officially clinching the party's nomination ahead of its national convention later this month and unveiling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. The pair are now speeding through a tour of the handful of closely fought states, including Michigan, where the election is likely to be won or lost. Opinion polls suggest the vice-president's elevation to the top of the ticket has made the contest against Trump more competitive. Some suggest Harris currently holds a narrow lead over the former president. But there are still three months to go until election day – and in a campaign that's already had more twists and turns than one of Simone Biles's gold-medal winning routines, major tests lie ahead. Recession risks and war threats hang over the campaign Harris might have reinvigorated Democrats who'd been uneasy with Biden, but she's still very much tied to his administration and its policy challenges. The economy and the rising cost of living were already huge issues for many voters, even before worse than expected jobs figures sparked fresh fears of a US recession. Trump seized on the biggest stock market sell off in nearly two years, labelling it a \"Kamala Krash\" and mocking the vice-president's previous support of her boss' \"Bidenomics\" plan. The markets have since rebounded, and opinion is divided over how serious the threat of a recession remains. But the economic nervousness creates further ammunition for Trump, and potential headaches for Harris. \"We cannot win if people think we're headed into a recession,\" a Democratic National Committee member was quoted as writing in an email to the Harris campaign. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East also creates major uncertainty, with tensions again spiking following the killings of senior figures within the Iranian-backed Hamas and Hezbollah. The White House has made a point of including the vice-president in Situation Room briefings, and on a recent call between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Harris has struck a somewhat different tone to the president on the war in Gaza so far, reaffirming US support for Israel but arguing she would \"not be silent\" on the suffering of Palestinians. In Detroit, she also met briefly with activists who'd encouraged Democrats to lodge protest votes against Biden in the party primaries over his handling of the conflict. However, Harris's campaign rejected suggestions she could be receptive to their demands for an Israeli arms embargo. And when pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted the vice-president's speech at the rally, she was quick to shut them down. \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,\" she told the protesters. \"Otherwise, I'm speaking.\" Debating debates and pressing for press conferences One of Trump's main lines of attack against Harris is that when she does speak publicly, it's mostly to deliver pre-prepared remarks. The vice-president has largely avoided taking questions from reporters since Biden withdrew from the race, leaving her campaign speeches and staged social media videos to do the talking. Harris is currently enjoying a stream of free publicity and there's risk involved in sitting down for interviews – especially when some of the most memorable moments of her vice-presidency up until recently were high-profile stumbles. But her reluctance to engage with the media has opened her up to criticism from Trump's campaign, with his running mate JD Vance approaching Air Force Two on the tarmac after their campaigns crossed over in Wisconsin. \"I just wanted to check out my future plane,\" he said. \"I also thought the press gaggle following her might get a little lonely.\" Trump also held a rare press conference of his own, arguing Harris wasn't \"smart enough\" to do the same. And he challenged his opponent to a total of three debates next month, on US networks Fox, ABC and NBC. Shortly afterwards it emerged that Harris's team had agreed to ABC's proposal, for September 10, which is when Trump and Biden had been scheduled to face off for the second time this year. Their first debate changed the course of the campaign, with the president's poor performance setting off the frenzy that eventually ended with his withdrawal. You can imagine how much scrutiny this next show stopper will attract. In case you missed it: A Central Park mystery solved by RFK Jr The reshaped race is likely bad news for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr, whose campaign was banking on support from Americans unhappy with both Biden and Trump. But dwindling poll numbers are not why the 70-year-old has once again made news. The man who'd already attracted headlines for having a worm in his brain, and for refuting claims he'd eaten a dog, has revealed he was behind a mystery that had confounded New Yorkers for years: How did a dead bear cub end up in Central Park? It turns out, according to his telling of the story, RFK Jr came across the carcass on the side of the road in upstate New York in 2014. He's said he decided it would be funny to dump it in the park along with an old bike, to make it look as though the animal had been killed by a cyclist.

When asked by a reporter about whether he supports legalizing cannabis, Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, observed that many states have already made non-medicinal marijuana legal. “As we legalize it, I start to agree a lot more because it’s being legalized all over the country,” Trump said. Florida, Trump’s home state, is set to consider legalizing cannabis through a ballot initiative in November. The measure will pass if it receives support from 60% of voters, and Trump said he would “be making a statement about that fairly soon.” He also lamented defendants who are imprisoned over recreational cannabis, observing that it is legalized throughout the country. “Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing, it’s awfully hard to have people all over the jails that are in jail right now for something that’s legal,” Trump said. “So I think obviously there’s a lot of sentiment to doing that.” While Trump was in office, he was largely antimarijuana until mid-2018, when he said he would “probably end up supporting” a bill that would defer marijuana legalization to states. A marijuana blog recently described Trump as “cannabis ambivalent,” noting he had taken mixed positions on it, though the former president has never directly said he would support a nationwide legalization. The Department of Justice completed a proposal to reschedule cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act last month, and now it is in the hands of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The timeline for the DEA to finalize the proposal is unclear. The Schedule I category is reserved for drugs that have no medical use. The government transferring marijuana out of that category would not legalize it, but the move would effectively deem it less dangerous. Pending legislative proposals, such as the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, aim to deschedule cannabis, which would make it legal.

But the biggest cringe moment by far was when Walz stepped up to the microphone and delivered the following idiocracy: “Some of us in here are old enough to remember – I see you down there; I see those old white guys,” he bellowed, pointing to a section of the audience. “Some of us are old enough to remember when it was Republicans who were talking about freedom. It turns out now what they meant was that the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. In Minnesota we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make,” he prattled, referring to abortion. “We still believe in freedom,” Pat corrects. “We believe in the baby’s freedom too.” “Here's a person who's had five born-alives from failed abortions” that he allowed to “lay there and die,” Pat condemns, referring to Minnesota’s lack of born-alive protections. “And then they’re going to lecture us on freedom?” To hear more, watch the clip above.

Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago resort on Thursday, Trump said he accepted debate invitations from NBC News, ABC News and Fox News. ‘I think it’s very important to have debates,’ said the Republican nominee. The ABC News debate set to take place on September 10 had been a hot topic as Trump said he might not participate because the then-presumptive Democratic nominee switched from President Joe Biden to his second-in-charge, Harris. Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump announced the three debates during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday (Picture: Getty Images) Harris on Thursday wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ‘I hear that Donald Trump has finally committed to debating me on September 10. I look forward to it.’ Her campaign did not respond to Trump’s two other debate proposals. The Trump campaign said the debates will be hosted by Fox News on September 4, ABC News on September 10 and NBC News on September 25. ‘So we have those three dates and those networks, they’re very anxiously awaiting that date and those dates,’ Trump said. Vice President Kamala Harris has agreed to one debate against ex-President Donald Trump but her campaign did not immediately remark on the other two dates (Picture: Getty Images) ‘We have spoken to the heads of the network and it’s all been confirmed.’ The 2024 race took a dramatic turn last month when Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed Harris, who has been polling better than he did against Trump. Some surveys show a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris. Trump has predicted that Harris’ ‘honeymoon’ in the polls will soon end. Trump also doubled down on his controversial remark last week that Harris ‘happened to turn black’ from Indian when asked about it Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday (Picture: Getty Images) ‘You’ll have to ask her that question because she’s the one that said it.

D. Vance are adapting in very different ways. First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Two Models of Attack Tim Walz introduced himself to the American public with a wide grin this week. On a rally stage in Philadelphia, he complimented Vice President Kamala Harris and the “joy” she brings to her work; praised his wife, Gwen, a longtime teacher; and talked lovingly about his kids. Then he went on the attack. “Violent crime was up under Donald Trump. That’s not even counting the crimes he committed,” Walz quipped. He accused J. D. Vance of trashing his own community in his book, Hillbilly Elegy, before throwing in a crude joke about the senator not wanting to get “off the couch” to debate him (a reference to a false claim that circulated on social media recently). Walz, the governor of Minnesota, has long projected the energy of a friendly Middle American dad. He was a high-school football coach; he wears a camo hat; he riffed with his teenage daughter at a state fair about whether turkey is vegetarian and posed with piglets. When Walz insulted Trump and Vance on Tuesday, that “midwestern nice” persona served him: Sandwiched between moments of good cheer, his blows sounded snappy but not cruel—like a normal guy telling you plainly what he thinks. Walz is just getting started on the campaign trail, but his approach so far is in sharp contrast to that of his opponent. In his public appearances, J. D. Vance has appeared almost solely in “battle mode,” so much so that he seems at times incapable of basic campaigning. Take his response yesterday to a softball question from a reporter (who prefaced the question noting that Vance is often criticized for being too serious and angry): “What makes you happy?” Instead of delivering one of many plausible responses—“my family,” “sports,” “movies,” even “Donald Trump’s vision for America” if he wanted to keep things campaign-focused—Vance snapped at the reporter, called the question bogus, and ranted about Harris. His attempts at appearing relatable have landed awkwardly: Answering another reporter’s question about why someone in Wisconsin should want to have a beer with him, his response quickly devolved into a critique of how the media “slanders” Trump, a guy who he says “likes normal people.” The whole thing came off as unnatural and, again, somewhat hostile to the questioner. Vance may appear so embattled because he is; he was met with a deluge of bad press after Trump announced him as the Republican VP pick, and he’s not seeing strong support from Trump’s allies or from Trump himself. A running mate who fights too hard can risk seeming unbefitting of the office—recall Sarah Palin’s over-the-top quips that drew attention away from John McCain’s campaign—and Vance may appear unserious to some voters if he keeps this up, Charles Holden, a historian at Saint Mary’s College of Maryland, told me. It doesn’t help that he’s now facing off against what Holden called Walz’s “happy warrior” strategy. Since at least the 1970s, the American vice-presidential candidate has been expected by strategists and party leaders to serve as an “attack dog” on the trail. The term was initially used critically, to describe an overly aggressive candidate, Holden explained. But by the ’80s, parties began to feel that having an attack dog on retainer was an asset—the running mate could go out and scrap with opponents, while the presidential candidate stayed above the fray. This dynamic was not brand-new: The historians I spoke with pointed to Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate, Richard Nixon, as an early case—he was known as the “hatchet man”—as well as Nixon’s own 1968 running mate, Spiro Agnew. By the ’90s, the “attack dog” label was so entrenched that some vice-presidential candidates, including Jack Kemp and Joe Lieberman, explicitly pushed against it. (Their tickets both lost; by 2008, both VP picks, Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, were seen as ready to fight, Holden noted.) In the Trump era, this concept, like so much other conventional political wisdom, seems dated. Trump himself, of course, has shown no desire to stay above the fray; getting down in the mud with opponents is no longer the specific purview of the vice president. During the 2016 and 2020 elections, Mike Pence served as the “respectable” foil to Trump’s own attack-dog approach. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, went head-to-head with Trump at certain points during that race, her “basket of deplorables” comment being the most notable example. The political universe that Trump helped create presents both an opportunity and a risk for the Democratic ticket: Harris and Walz likely “have a certain amount of leeway” to “engage in discourse that maybe in the pre-Trump world” they would not have, Joel Goldstein, a historian of the vice presidency and professor emeritus at Saint Louis University School of Law, told me. Some level of disagreement and self-defense is fair game in an election, he argued (for that reason, he’s skeptical of overusing the “attack dog” trope). Still, going too far carries its own dangers—particularly for Harris, who may face more scrutiny for throwing harsh jabs as a Black woman than Walz would as a 60-year-old white man. In the first few weeks of this campaign, Harris has focused on policy attacks more than ad hominem insults. When Walz made his couch joke, she looked on with what seemed like a mixture of a wince and a laugh. But as Aaron Blake noted in The Washington Post today, her campaign’s social-media accounts amplified the couch line, so Harris is not distancing herself all that much. And her campaign sent out a press release today, responding to the claims Trump made in his press conference, that began: “Donald Trump took a break from taking a break to put on some pants and host a p̶r̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶f̶e̶r̶e̶n̶c̶e̶ public meltdown.” Vance’s and Walz’s approaches may morph depending on the extent to which Trump and Harris do their own dueling. But so far, they’re presenting two diverging models of the modern vice-presidential candidate. For now, the VP campaign looks like a contest between the happy warrior and the resentful fighter. Voters will decide which line of attack they prefer. Related: Today’s News Dispatches Explore all of our newsletters here.

Crooks aimed his weapon at the officer who had scaled the structure. The officer suffered an ankle injury when he lost his grip and plummeted around eight feet. Although the video does not show Crooks during this sequence.As the footage concludes, it reveals Crooks' body surrounded by officers after he was lethally shot. \"I'm f***ing p***ed. We couldn't find him,\" A police officer said in the video.— blackvaultcom (@blackvaultcom) \"Before you motherf---ers came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he turned around and I f---ing dropped, and I started f---ing, I was calling out, ‘Bro, f---ing on top of the roof.’ F---ing, we’re not on the same frequency?,\" he added.An officer is expresses frustration over the inability to locate Crooks. A separate video features another officer recounting the incident, stating that during his initial solo inspection of the roof, Crooks' turned around and that startled him, causing him to fall.According to Fox News Digital, Butler Township Police Department Lieutenant Matthew Pearson said, the officer found himself in a precarious position, hanging from the building, which prevented him from drawing his weapon. Crooks then fired his firearm, resulting in a minor injury to Trump's right ear.Three individuals were shot during the protest, resulting in the death of Comperatore, aged 50, who died protecting his family. Among the injured were David Dutch and James Copenhaver, both of whom sustained gunshot wounds at the rally, they have been discharged from the hospital and are now recuperating at home.Mere moments before the gunfire erupted, Copenhaver's camera captured footage of an individual moving on the rooftop, a security lapse that Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe acknowledged as a \"failure\" on their part.Based on information provided by the FBI, Crooks arrived at the rally venue at around 11 am and remained there for about an hour before leaving. He returned to the location at around 3.50 pm, and local law enforcement officers first noticed his presence at 5.10 pm, approximately 30 minutes prior to Trump taking the stage.Crooks flew a drone in the vicinity of the rally site, but it did not capture any footage or images. At about 5.30 pm, law enforcement captured a photograph of Crooks and transmitted it to their headquarters along with a message. The photograph and accompanying note alerted officials to Crooks' location and activities. At approximately 6.12 pm, Crooks opened fire eight shots at Trump, who was hit in the ear and seconds later, a Secret Service sniper neutralized him.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/-on-top-of-roof-bodycam-video-footage-shows-moment-after-police-spotted-trump-shooter-watch/articleshow/112386059.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112386833/112386833.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:48:13","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.722},{"id":253709172,"title":"Kamala Harris' Husband Doug's Past Cheating Scandal Has Left Her Worried 'He Might Do it Again'","text":"Although Kamala Harris is at the pinnacle of her career, her personal life is reportedly crumbling in the aftermath of her husband Doug Emhoff's affair bombshell. The former prosecutor has been endorsed by Joe Biden as the Democratic party's presidential candidate against Republican rival Donald Trump. However, sources are saying she's \"worried\" about being deceived by her once cheater husband. Daily Mail reported the potential First Gentleman's first marriage broke because he got his children's nanny pregnant. Now, Harris is afraid he might cheat her or have already cheated as a high-placed source revealed, \"You know what they say, 'once a cheater always a cheater.' Of course, Kamala is worrying, not just that he might do it again, but could he have already done it again?\" Emhoff, an American lawyer, was previously married to film producer Kerstin Mackin from 1992 to 2008 and has two children Cole and Ella. When the second gentleman was introduced in the public during his wife Harris' presidential campaign, a report surfaced he cheated on his ex-wife Mackin with the kids' blonde school teacher cum nanny Najen Naylor. After the allegations became public, Emhoff accepted the affair in a statement saying, \"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" as per CNN. Also, the attorney informed Harris about his infidelity before the VP got married to him and according to a close friend of the nanny, she [nanny] \"did not keep the child.\" Meanwhile, his marriage with Mackin ended years before he began dating Harris. In her statement, Emhoff's ex-wife said, \"Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids, [and] continues to be a great friend to me and I am really proud of the warm and supportive blended family Doug, Kamala, and I have built together.\" They divorced in 2008. Despite knowing about Emhoff's cheating scandal, Harris was left \"unnerved\" and \"humiliated\" after she realized she'd be leading the Democratic party in the November elections after Biden dropped out of the race. An insider added, \"She's trying to focus on rebranding her image and this is the last thing she wanted right now. The Democrats' convention is just around the corner and the election is less than three months away, so any distraction has to be bad news.\" While the news was still under wraps, VP Harris and her team are worried it could negatively affect their campaign, \"Put bluntly it's not a good look and Harris and her team know it. News of the affair has dominated coverage of the candidate over the weekend and sparked panic in her camp.\" Although the damage has been done, the former prosecutor tried to distract Americans from the cheating coverage by announcing her running mate Tim Walz. However, according to some experts, Republicans could \"capitalize on [Emhoff's cheating scandal] as everyone knows Trump's history, and he wears it almost like a badge. But the Democrats claim they're above this,\" per Fox News.","summary":"Some experts think Doug Emhoff&#39;s cheating scandal news could help the Republican rival Donald Trump in the November elections.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-husband-dougs-past-cheating-scandal-has-left-her-worried-he-might-do-it-again","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/709758/uploads/86054c80-557a-11ef-986d-536606e82931_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":253708944,"title":"New bodycam video shows moment police officer saw Trump shooter just before assassination attempt","text":"(CNN) — Dramatic video obtained by CNN shows, for the first time, the moment a police officer climbed up to the roof of a building overlooking the Donald Trump rally on July 13 and saw the former president’s would-be assassin just before the shooting began. Other footage from the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which CNN obtained through a public records request, shows local officers lamenting that they told Secret Service to post officers near the building the gunman fired from days earlier. A video from the Butler police officer’s body-worn camera shows how the officer was hoisted up by his colleague onto the roof, quickly dropping down after he sees the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks. Approximately 40 seconds later, Crooks turned back and fired eight shots at Trump, who was hit in the ear. Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks. After the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle. “F**king this close bro,” the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. “Dude, he turned around on me.” One officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, “He’s straight up.” “Who’s got eyes on him?” the officer asks. “He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.” Over the radio a voice says: “We have two civilians – tending to them,” and later, “I need an ambulance in the back.” This video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN’s public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed. ‘Don’t put up your head – he’s right there’ On the dashboard camera of the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks, three shots can be heard ringing out, followed by five more shots fired in rapid succession. “Don’t put up your head – he’s right there!” the officer shouts to others after opening his car half a minute after the shots were fired. Shortly after, video shows law enforcement officers attempting to access the roof. “He’s got glasses, long hair,” the officer who saw Crooks tells several others climbing up the side of the building. “Yo, Mike, I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he’s got a book bag, he’s got mad sh*t, AR laying down.” “But watch out because he can f**king come right down on you over there,” the officer warns. The officer adds later: “Before you m*therf**kers came up here I popped my head up there like an idiot, by myself, dude. He turned around, I f**king dropped.” When they ultimately access the top of the building, footage shows Crooks’ lifeless body, his rifle and a trail of blood running down the side of the roof. Officers say they asked for Secret Service help earlier that week In a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from. “I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,” the officer said. “I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.” Another officer replied that he wasn’t “even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that’s how we — how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?” “I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, ‘Yeah, no problem, we’re going to post guys over here,’” the first officer said. Secret Service posted three local counter snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings, one of whom took pictures of Crooks earlier that day and left his post to go looking for the soon-to-be shooter.The Secret Service declined to comment. Documents from shooting range show Crooks’ preparation On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley released documents obtained from the shooter’s gun club that revealed new details about Crooks’s preparation in the months leading up to the attempted assassination of Trump. The records from Clairton Sportsmen’s Club, reviewed by CNN, show Crooks visited the gun range a total of 43 times after establishing a membership on August 10, 2023 – less than a year before the assassination attempt Sign-in sheets provided to Grassley, an Iowa Republican, by Clairton Sportsmen’s Club also indicate Crooks spent the majority of his time at the rifle range – rather than other designated areas for firing pistols or shotguns – in the months immediately preceding the rally where he ultimately used the same type of weapon to shoot Trump. Crooks attended target practice at the club three to six times per month in 2024, before making one final visit at 2:45 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024 – the day before the Trump rally, according to the records obtained by Grassley.

Growing up, Zwirner spent a year living in New York attending the Walden School and returned for college at NYU where he studied music, and, according to Wikipedia, performed as a jazz drummer. It is with some humor that Zwirner had the cartoon artist R.Crumb do the graphics image announcing the 30th Anniversary exhibition. The exhibition was so artist rich that it was like visiting a small museum. There were works from such celebrated artists as Ruth Asawa, Richard Serra, Raymond Pettibon, Gordon Matta-Calrk, Anni Albers, Paul Klee, Robert Ryman, Donald Judd, Diane Arbus, Yayoi Kusama, Barbara Kruger, Jason Rhoades, and Gerhard Richter, as well as paintings and installations completed just for the exhibition. Among the contemporary artists are Dana Schutz, Huma Bhaba, Lisa Yuskavage, Neo Rauch, Stan Douglas, Chris Ofili, Elizabeth Peyton, Toba Khedoori, Liu Ye. Wolfgang Tillmans. Zwirner’s Los Angeles galleries and spaces were designed by his longtime collaborator architect Annette Selfdorf. When Zwirner first opened the gallery, I asked him: “Why LA? Why now?” He had been a gallerist for thirty years without an LA presence. His answer was simple and direct. He said that Los Angeles now had the three elements that converged in making it a gallery destination: The art schools producing artists and giving artists employment, the artists themselves many of whom have chosen to live in LA rather than other art capitals, and the collectors who once only bought in New York or Paris but are now happy to make their purchases here. It is also true that many artists used to have a local Los Angeles gallery representing them; and, perhaps, it no longer makes sense for the major galleries to split or share sales with them. Zwirner’s anniversary exhibition spoke loudly about Los Angeles, and about the consolidation of representation by multi-location international galleries.

Kordansky, who recently celebrated his own anniversary of 20 years as a gallerist, continues to show established artists as well as younger artists marking their mark (literally and figuratively) on the art scene. David Kordansky recently had an exhibition of the work of Lucy Bull, a 34-year-old artist, who has received much attention – a work of hers, 16:10, sold in May for a record breaking $1.8 million during the Now Evening Auction at Sothebys New York. I can’t say whether her work is or isn’t worth it any more than I could say about any other living artist. What I can say is that I found her recent exhibition at David Kordansky Los Angeles, Ash Tree, which ran from May 11 to June 15, 2024, compelling, engaging, even satisfying. Ash Tree featured large works of abstraction, including horizontal and vertical diptychs that were absorbing from first impression and further rewarded close inspection. In looking at her work, the mind cannot help seeing the gestural traces of the painters who came before her, or imagining pictorial elements in the hallucinatory and, at times, psychedelic maelstroms Bull creates. Lucy Bull, 1:24, 2024 Courtesy of David Kordansky Gallery Los Angeles and the artist So, for example, in her painting 15:15, I imagined Munch-like figures gathered together, spirits from the world of The Scream. In another work, 1:24, I conjured figures from Chagall flying like lovers above the scrum of humanity. Similarly, it would be hard to look at her large horizontal work 23:22 and not reference Jackson Pollock. However, it is Bull’s work that draws the viewer in and speaks with great confidence. Whatever references one sees are the viewers (and the brain’s) relentless need to see connections to what we already know. However, as concerns Bull and Ash Tree, we might see trees, but we get lost in the forest of her thickly painted canvases. ALL LI(V)ES MATTER by Hank Willis Thomas Credit: Aaron Wessling Photography, Courtesy of Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation Christie’s Los Angeles has a non-selling show at their Beverly Hills gallery, When Art is a Mirror: Reflections on America 1965-2023, on exhibit through August 9. which is drawn from the collection of Jordan Schnitzer, who probably has the largest (and best) modern and contemporary print collection, much of which is often on loan and on exhibit throughout the country and the world, his foundation having organized some 160 exhibitions and loaned works to over 120 museums, according to the press release for the exhibition. The prints on exhibit are very much a mirror of the times when they were made and cause us to consider our own times. There is a Warhol of Richard Nixon, garish in its colors; one of Robert Longo’s black flags; and a very striking print by Hank Willis Thomas that is a canny commentary of those who oppose the Black Lives Matter movement. Too often, prints are considered lesser than paintings and are rarely what Museum exhibitions and galleries put on display, but the Christies Jordan Schnitzer show reminds us of the power of the print to express, comment, and stand-up to the issues of our times. These were all great exhibitions that added to summer in LA, and were each in their own illuminating of directions in contemporary art. Follow me on LinkedIn.

Arizona's other Senate seat is currently held by Democrat Mark Kelly, who was elected to a six-year term in 2022.The poll found that 50 percent of likely voters support Gallego, while 39 percent back Lake. The 11-point gap was the best result for Gallego since a YouGov/CBS News poll in May found the congressman leading Lake by a margin of 49 percent to 36 percent.Most polling conducted since May has suggested that the Democratic candidate is leading the Republican. The lone exception was a survey commissioned by the Lake campaign that showed her with a 1 percent lead in early July.In a statement emailed to Newsweek on Thursday, a Lake spokesperson said, \"If you believe Kari Lake is down 11 points, you are as dumb as we thought.\"Lake is a supporter of Trump's false claims of a \"stolen\" 2020 presidential election and has repeatedly made similar false claims about her own 2022 loss to Democratic Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs.On Sunday, Gallego announced that a coalition of 40 Republican and independent Arizona leaders were supporting his campaign. The coalition includes current and former elected officials, industry experts, business owners and community leaders.\"I am a lifelong Republican. But I cannot in good conscience stand on the sidelines while extremists like Kari Lake, who have hijacked our party for the sake of personal gain, undermine the very fabric of what makes America exceptional,\" Mesa Mayor John Giles said in a press release.In a previous statement to Newsweek, a Lake campaign spokesperson said the following: \"Kari Lake is uniting Republicans, meanwhile Ruben Gallego still doesn't have the endorsement of Senator Sinema, and is tanking in the polls because of his support for open borders and illegal immigrants voting in our elections.\"Arizona is considered a crucial swing state in November, both in terms of the presidential election and regarding the balance of power in the Senate, which Democrats currently control by a razor-thin margin.The new poll also showed Vice President Kamala Harris with a narrow 2.8-point lead over Trump, with 44.4 percent of respondents favoring the Democrat and 41.6 percent preferring the Republican.While President Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona in 2020, polling from earlier this summer showed the president losing to Trump before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris on July 21.The HighGround poll was conducted among 500 likely Arizona voters between July 31 and August 3.

Critics are blasting his remarks. The ex-president, who is currently down in the polls as Vice President Kamala Harris has flipped the trajectory of the election, pushed though his answer while leaving the impression he would support banning the drug, effectively moving the country closer to a nationwide near-total ban on abortion, while also supporting having the general public vote nationally on the issue. Trump has repeatedly bragged he ended Roe v. Wade by putting three right-wing justices on the U.S. Supreme Court who stripped away the constitutional right to abortion. But as public opinion has come out sharply against that ruling he has tried to sidestep it, angering anti-abortion activists and his evangelical Christian base. On Thursday, asked if he would “direct your FDA, for example, to revoke access to Mifepristone?” Trump interrupted the reporter to provide an answer (video below). READ MORE: Harlan Crow Helped Fund Swiftboating. Trump Campaign Continues That Legacy in Walz Attack “You could do things that will be, would supplement. Absolutely. And those things are pretty open and humane. But you have to be able to have a vote, and all I want to do is give everybody a vote and the votes are taking place right now as we speak. There are many things on a humane basis that you can do outside of that, but you also have to give a vote and the people are going to have to decide.” Trump appeared to be suggesting he would order the FDA to ban the abortion drug Mifepristone, while claiming there are alternatives to it, which defeats the intended purpose of a ban. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of all abortions in the U.S. are done via medication abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In 2020 that number was 53%. There is no medical evidence that would necessitate banning Mifepristone. The ex-president also appeared to be unaware that, outside of a constitutional amendment and elections, the U.S. has never held a national referendum on any issue, and there is no constitutional method to “give a vote” so “the people” can decide the issue. Strong majorities of Americans support the right to abortion, and even stronger majorities oppose a national abortion ban, the Associated Press reported last month. Many of those who watched the former president Thursday and remarked on social media expressed astonishment at his response. “Preceding the question,” noted Los Angeles Times columnist Jackie Calmes, “Trump says Harris isn’t smart. Then he takes the mifepristone question: He clearly has no idea what he’s talking about–the drug used in 2/3 of abortions today–& seems to suggest, yes, his FDA will revoke it (as the right wants).” “It’s like bad improv at this point,” commented U.S. Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) “Not funny, not present, doesn’t understand the word the audience just tried to prompt him with… but massively overconfident in his skills.” RELATED: Is Donald Trump ‘Quiet Quitting’? Here’s What His ‘Meltdown at Mar-a-Lago’ Reveals “He has no idea what mifepristone is,” remarked columnist and former Jezebel editor-in-chief Laura Bassett. “Trump’s answer is pure gibberish. He has no idea what mifepristone is or what he’s saying,” wrote communications strategist Laura Chapin. “Sweet Jesus,” exclaimed communications professor and McClatchy News columnist Issac Bailey. “This dude is trying to BS his way through important policy questions, which he clearly knows next to nothing about.” “Yeah,” wrote Jessica Mason Pieklo, Executive Editor and senior vice president of the Rewire News Group, “this man has no idea what mifepristone is lol.” “He tried to couch it in nonsensical double-speak,” noted political strategist Maya Rupert, “but here is Trump confirming that he would direct his FDA to revoke access to medication abortion NATIONWIDE. This is a national abortion ban. This is what we are voting on.” “If any other presidential candidate gave a non-answer this incoherent, it would lead the news for like 5 days,” remarked author and University of Pennsylvania scholar and instructor Brian Rosenwald. “I mean I’ve seen toddlers be more coherent. Does he know what Mifepristone is?” Watch the video of Trump below or at this link.

Critics are blasting his remarks.\n\nThe ex-president, who is currently down in the polls as Vice President Kamala Harris has flipped the trajectory of the election, pushed though his answer while leaving the impression he would support banning the drug, effectively moving the country closer to a nationwide near-total ban on abortion, while also supporting having the general public vote nationally on the issue.\n\nTrump has repeatedly bragged he ended Roe v.

In one of the videos, a Butler Township officer is being hoisted onto the roof of a building near the July 13 rally, minutes before Trump was set to speak. The officer appears to peek his head over the roof before quickly dropping to the ground and running to a nearby police vehicle, the video shows. The shooter cannot be seen in this angle of bodycam video, and there is no audio. NBC News has previously reported that in that moment, the officer came face to face with the shooter, Thomas Crooks, who pointed his weapon at the officer, prompting the officer to hit the ground, according to Butler Township Manager Tom Knights. Later in the video, the officer appears to confirm the encounter, saying, \"f------ this close, dude, he turned right around on me.\" Officials later determined that the shooter was on top of a building in a complex next to the Butler Farm Show — where Trump was giving his speech — which was roughly 148 yards from Trump and outside the safety perimeter set by the Secret Service that day. Crooks fired eight shots, nicking Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and critically injuring two others. Crooks was shot and killed by counter-snipers within seconds. A later portion of the same video clip shows the Butler Township officer jumping back onto the rooftop. In that video, Crooks' bloodied body can be seen, handcuffed, after Secret Service snipers shot and killed him. \"Before you motherf------ came out here I put my head up here like a f------- idiot by myself dude…\" the officer said on radio traffic captured in the clip. \"I was calling out, 'bro, on top of the roof, bro,' were you on the same frequency?\" An unknown member of the SWAT team then said he was \"pissed\" that he \"couldn't ... find him,\" apparently referring to Crooks. In another clip released Thursday, an unidentified Butler Township officer said about 10 minutes after Trump was shot that he told the Secret Service about the building's vulnerability days before the rally. The officer is heard saying that he \"told them they needed to post the guys over here. I told them that.\" When asked \"who\" he told, the officer replied: \"the Secret Service.\" The officer said he told Secret Service members July 9 — four days before the July 13 event — to \"post guys over here,\" referring to the building where the shooter was found. \"How the hell could you lose a guy walking over here?\" the officer said. Asked whether the officer's team was on the roof, the officer answered no and said the team was inside. Some back and forth can be heard in the audio about where people were stationed. The officer added that the Secret Service assured officials earlier in the week that \"we're going to post guys over here.\" He does not specify the location in the video. Anthony Guglielmi, U.S. Secret Service spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency is reviewing the video. \"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Guglielmi said. \"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\" Pennsylvania State Police has said it identified Crooks as \"suspicious\" before the attack. The Secret Service has been criticized for its handling of the incident and any warnings before Trump took the stage, for how long it took to get the former president off the stage, and for its preparedness before the rally. Amid the fallout, the head of the agency, Kimberly Cheatle, stepped down from her post. Days later, the acting head of the Secret Service said in a Senate committee hearing that Secret Service agents could be fired if it is found they broke protocol that day.","summary":"New body camera video released Thursday by Butler Township from the day a man attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump shows the moment police encountered the shooter before he opened fire on the Pennsylvania crowd and includes a police officer saying he warned the Secret Service about the building vulnerability.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/bodycam-video-shows-moments-police-encounter-trumps-assassin-officer-s-rcna165877","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240717-trump-law-enforcement-ch-0857-19bb31.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:40:06","author":"Rebecca Cohen,Tom Winter","authors":["Rebecca Cohen","Tom Winter"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.608},{"id":253707836,"title":"Harris and Walz show their support for organized labor with appearance at Detroit union hall","text":"WAYNE, Mich. — Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, played up their support for organized labor at a Detroit-area union hall on Thursday, with the Democratic nominee saying “we’re all in this together” as the new ticket lavishes attention on a crucial base of support. Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Walz, who joined the ticket on Tuesday, spoke Thursday to about 100 United Auto Workers members at Local 900 Hall, which represents Ford’s Michigan Assembly Plant. The stop occurred shortly after Republican nominee Donald Trump held a press conference in Palm Beach, Florida. As she proclaimed that it was “good to be in the house of labor,” Harris described the value of unions, saying they were “about understanding that no one should be made to fight alone” and that “hard work is good work.” “We have fun doing hard work, because we know what we stand for,” she said. “When you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for. We know what we stand for, and we stand for the people and we stand for the dignity of work, and we stand for freedom. We stand for justice. We stand for equality. She continued: “And so we will fight for all of it.” Walz, riffing off a favorite line of President Biden, told the labor crowd that “we know that unions built the middle class. “The rest of America has to,” Walz added. The members at Local 900 were the first Ford workers to strike in 2023 when the union’s contract with the company expired. Workers at the assembly plant went on strike Sept. 15 and remained on the picket lines until Oct. 25, when the union announced a tentative agreement with Ford. After President Biden ended his reelection campaign last month and endorsed his vice president, organized labor quickly rallied around Harris. The AFL-CIO endorsed her after having first backed Biden. The UAW formally backed her last week. Harris and Walz have been highlighting their support for working people during their first joint appearances this week in some of the most closely contested states that will help decide whether she becomes the first female U.S. president or whether Trump returns to the White House and brings along Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his vice president. Trump, Vance and other Republicans have increasingly criticized Harris for not engaging extensively with journalists and taking questions during the early days of her candidacy. In a brief exchange with reporters before leaving Michigan, Harris said she has talked with her aides and wants to schedule an interview before the end of the month. She also re-confirmed that she would participate in a Sept. 10 debate on ABC News – which Trump had backed out of before recommitting to it earlier Thursday during his Palm Beach press conference – and said she would be “happy” to discuss subsequent debates after that one occurs. The Democrats visited Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, hoping to shore up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping Biden get elected in 2020. Two new polls of likely voters in Wisconsin and Georgia, another key state, show close races in both. Several Georgiapolls conducted earlier in the summer found Trump slightly ahead in the state, which Biden won narrowly in 2020. UAW President Shawn Fain told The Associated Press last week that Harris’ leading the Democratic ticket boosts the party’s chances of winning Michigan and keeping the White House in November. Fain said Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse in a second term. On Thursday, Fain welcomed the ticket to “labor’s house” and rallied the union crowd by exclaiming: “Kamala Harris is one of us. Gov. Tim Walz is one of us” and praising their pro-labor records. “This isn’t about opinions. This election is not about party politics,” Fain said. “All we have to do is look at these candidates in their own words and actions. That’s all the facts we need.” Fain also spoke Wednesday at Harris’ campaign rally at a Detroit-area airport hangar. The UAW leader has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against Fain at rallies and in speeches. Vance made his own stops in Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday, intent on showing that Republicans will compete in the “blue wall” of Midwestern states. He called Walz a “crazy radical” and said that Harris’ decision to pick him as a running mate shows that she “bends the knee to the far left of the Democratic Party.” As Harris spoke to an estimated 15,000-person crowd at the airport, she was interrupted by protesters opposed to Israel’s war in Gaza with Hamas. At first, Harris said to those trying to disrupt her, “I am here because I believe in democracy, and everybody’s voice matters.” But Harris lost patience as the shouting continued, with protesters accusing her of supporting genocide in Gaza. That led her to deliver a sharper rejoinder. “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that,” she said, talking over the protesters. “Otherwise, I’m speaking.” Metro Detroit, home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States, has become a focal point of tension and unrest due to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Shortly after her remarks Wednesday, Harris won the backing of Assad I. Turfe, the deputy Wayne County executive, who is the highest-ranking Arab American official in Michigan’s largest county. Turfe told The Associated Press he spoke with Harris backstage at the event before his endorsement. “Kamala Harris embodies the America we deserve –- an America that stands for strength, inclusivity and unwavering commitment to justice,” Turfe said in a statement. “I wholeheartedly endorse Kamala Harris, as she represents the true spirit of our nation and the values we hold dear.” Turfe also pressed the need for a cease-fire in Gaza, but said that Harris “gives us the best chance of achieving peace in that region moving forward.” Union members attending the rally said they supported Harris. Jeanne Ruff of Livonia, Michigan, whose husband is a longtime UAW member, said she hoped Harris would visit a union shop in Michigan to show her support. “I want her to make sure skill trades are back in schools so that the next generation can understand what unions are about. What solidarity is and how strong we can be together, working as one,” Ruff said. ___ Cappelletti reported from Lansing, Michigan, and Kim from Washington.

Trump is rejoining the ABC debate days after posting on his social media network that he would not appear on the network, citing a lawsuit he has filed. His decision sets up a highly anticipated moment in an election where the first debate led to a massive change in the race — with Democratic President Joe Biden ending his reelection bid and endorsing Harris. “I think it’s very important to have debates,” Trump said Thursday. “I look forward to the debates because I think we have to set the record straight.” On the social media site X later on Thursday, Harris wrote that “I hear that Donald Trump has fully committed to debating me on September 10. I look forward to it.” At a private fundraiser in Paris on Thursday, Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, said he “cannot wait” to see his wife debate Trump. He was in Paris as head of the U.S. delegation to the Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Fox News has also proposed a debate between Harris and Trump to take place on Sept. 4, and NBC News is angling to air one on Sept. 25. During an appearance in Michigan, Harris said she was “happy to have that conversation” about an additional debate. Trump also said he wants his vice presidential candidate, JD Vance, to debate Harris’ choice for veep, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on CBS. The network is discussing potential dates to propose for that meeting. ABC says that David Muir and Linsey Davis will moderate the Sept. 10 contest. That’s the same date that Trump and Biden had agreed to their second and final debate, before Biden’s decision put that event in doubt. Any debate promises to take on extra importance with polls showing a tight race between the former president and current vice president. While Harris has ridden a wave of excitement among Democrats since inheriting the mantle from Biden, she has yet to appear at a news conference or give an interview to a journalist. Republicans are already making that an issue. Vance, in a post on X as Trump was in his news conference on Thursday, said Harris was hiding behind a TelePrompter. “It’s been 18 days since she answered real questions from the media,” he wrote. ____ Associated Press writers Jocelyn Noveck in Paris and Darlene Superville in Romulus, Mich. contributed to this report.

Which at first glance seems minor, one of those tiny things that flies by unchallenged in the endless media whirlwind. The Washington Post counted 30,573 lies and misleading statements during the four years of the Trump presidency; to focus on the latest addition seems futile. By the time you’ve remarked on it, it’s already out-of-date. Trump is fond of tagging childish nicknames on his opponents. But “Kamabla” resonates more, at least with me. Mangling someone’s name is a classic racist go-to move. The “What kinda funny name is THAT?” grin is implied. I get “Bergstein” and “Steingold” and “Goldstein” and a dozen variants in my emails, all signs that I’m about to read the thoughts — to stretch the term — of some sneering anti-Semite who feels compelled to weigh in on today’s topic. Or not read them. Why bother? Racism, remember, is a form of ignorance — you’re not perceiving the world as it is, but through the crazy kaleidoscope lens of your own obsessive fears. Who cares what dumb haters think? And the funny thing is, egotism is such an intrinsic part of being a bigot, the thought that they’ve been disregarded as beneath contempt doesn’t occur to them. I have people who’ve been gibbering in my spam folder, ignored, for years. But the Republican presidential candidate cannot be dismissed so easily. Even though none of this is news. His behavior hasn’t changed since he came down that brass escalator in the garish lobby of Trump Tower on June 16, 2015 and started slurring Mexicans as criminals and rapists. I won’t categorize how he’s been since then . Either you figured it out long ago or you never will. Nearly a decade. No wonder we’re all loopy. No wonder Joe Biden bowing out of the race caused Democrats to explode with joy, optimism and energy. Hope dawned. Maybe the country can finally break the spell. This has been a particularly exuberant week for Democrats, since Harris announced her running mate is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Walz wasn’t on my radar. But Secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg was. Buttigieg, the sharpest razor wit in politics, could have vivisected Trump and Vance for the next three months. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also was on my radar. He’s a guy who can deliver a verbal broadside and could be expected to win his own battleground state. Plus, he’s Jewish — as with Sandy Koufax, you like to see your guy on the mound, striking ‘em out. Both men had drawbacks. Buttigieg is gay, so picking him would churn the Republican waters — not that they wouldn’t churn anyway — plus give pause to some Democrats who harbor anti-gay bias. Sure, it would be cool to have a gay vice president — a sign that maybe our country isn’t really a nest of hidebound religious loons who live their lives in a sex panic frenzy. But prejudice isn’t something people gladly admit to pollsters, and Democrats may not want to bet the nation’s democracy on just how progressive people are in their secret hearts, then wake up Nov. 6 and find out they were wrong. Shapiro being Jewish, while catnip to Jews, would have merely been a drawback last year. But since Oct. 7, it has become an anchor, as the outrage of Palestinians — and their undergraduate allies — over the Israel-Hamas War tends to drift from Israelis to Zionists to Jews in general. And Shapiro is no random member of the Tribe, but as governor shut down campus protest in a way that Palestinian activists didn’t like. “Somebody like Shapiro would be an absolute disaster since he essentially has made it seem as if the Palestinians don’t have any rights to freedom or self-determination or anything,” said Hatem Abudayyeh, national chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, while Harris was still pondering her choice. Some Jews chose to register displeasure at Shapiro being passed over. Me, I understand the Democrats’ goal here is to win, and if Harris-Walz has a slightly better chance at victory than Harris-Shapiro, then Harris-Walz it is. Would you rather lose with your guy, or win with somebody else? You can work at perfecting American society afterward. That’s called strategic thinking. The idea that people unhappy with some current administration policy are going to withhold their support, or back the guy who would be much, much worse, is cutting off your nose to spite your face. Maybe Jews are unduly attached to our often considerable noses. But doing that just isn’t smart.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/08/08/harris-walz-shapiro-vice-president-2024-election-jews-israel","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/860b436/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5359x3059+0+257/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2F29%2F81b2db0b4ecb83dcb303b2ff679a%2Fshap","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:32:17","author":"Neil Steinberg","authors":["Neil Steinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":253707352,"title":"Trump reveals he almost ‘went down’ in a helicopter with Kamala Harris’ ex-lover, Willie Brown","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Former President Donald Trump on Thursday recounted a harrowing helicopter ride with Vice President Kamala Harris’ ex-boyfriend, Willie Brown, in which the two men thought they might not survive the landing. “I know Willie Brown very well,” Trump said, when asked by The Post about Harris’ relationship with the former San Francisco mayor. “In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him,” the 78-year-old Republican nominee for president recalled. “We thought, maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing,” Trump explained. “This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was – he was a little concerned.” Brown, 90, was involved in a bumpy helicopter landing in September 2004, while traveling from a Santa Barbara, Calif., fundraiser to Los Angeles International Airport. The helicopter experienced transmission problems and “buzzed” a Malibu High School football game before making an emergency landing in an adjacent elementary school field, the San Francisco Chronicle reported days after the incident. “They barely cleared the high school and then landed very quickly at the elementary school playground,” Hans Laetz, a witness to the crash landing, told the outlet. “This guy came in fast and he was down in 10 seconds. You could tell it was not a planned landing.” It’s unclear if Trump was aboard that particular helicopter with Brown. His campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment. The former president also claimed during his Mar-a-Lago press conference that Brown, who dated Harris in the mid-1990s, didn’t have nice things to say about his ex. “He told me terrible things about her,” Trump said, referring to what the former mayor said of the vice president. “He had a big part in what happened with Kamala,” the former president continued, noting that at the time he and Brown were in touch, “he was not a fan of hers.” Brown was speaker of the California Assembly and Harris was a prosecutor in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office when the couple dated, a relationship that reportedly began in 1994 and ended sometime in 1995.","summary":"“We thought, maybe this is the end,\" Trump said of bumpy helicopter ride with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/08/us-news/trump-reveals-he-almost-went-down-in-a-helicopter-with-kamala-harris-ex-lover-willie-brown/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87389355.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dIH4M9Wt-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-08 22:31:43","author":"Jon Levine,Victor Nava","authors":["Jon Levine","Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":253707466,"title":"Josh Shapiro Shares Daily Beast Podcast in Response to Trump Attack","text":"Pennsylvania Gov.

Walz has also allegedly misrepresented his service by claiming to have \"carried a weapon of war in war\" even though he had never deployed to a combat zone during his 24-year career in the National Guard. Veterans who have served in Afghanistan have also taken issue with Walz labeling himself as a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom. One Afghanistan veteran went to then-Congressman Walz's office in Minnesota to bring it up with his staffers. Despite their agreement the label could be misleading to civilians and something would be done about it, nothing was done to make Walz's service more clear. Like Blaze News?
