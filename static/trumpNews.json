A nineteen-year-old high school graduate who now has access to sensitive government information is known online as “Big Balls.” A former intern at Musk’s SpaceX, who dropped out of the University of Nebraska, is now working out of the General Services Administration. Scenes of low comedy and spy-movie drama have been reported throughout the federal government—an unclassified e-mail listing all recent C.I.A. employees was sent to the White House to comply with a Musk decree; workers at NASA were ordered to “drop everything” in order to scrub the space program’s Web sites of offending references to banned phrases such as “diversity,” “Indigenous People,” and “women in leadership.” Musk and his command team at the Department of Government Efficiency, a made-up agency with no legal power that Trump established by executive order on his first day back in office, have been sleeping at the Office of Personnel Management.\nIn its short existence, Musk’s small occupying force has gained access to the entire U.S. Treasury federal payments system—to what end, no one yet knows—and has seemingly orchestrated the dismantling of U.S.A.I.D., the decades-old federal agency in charge of distributing American foreign aid around the world. Upcoming targets reportedly include everything from the Department of Education to the government weather-forecasting service and the U.S. aviation system. Federal employees were given a deadline of Thursday at midnight to accept Musk’s offer of a government-wide deferred-resignation “buyout.” A federal judge has delayed the move, which was expected to yield more than forty thousand takers—well short of the five per cent or more of the federal workforce that Musk hoped to purge, but still an enormous upheaval whose repercussions will echo for years.\nIn a series of posts on X, the social-media site that Musk owns, the world’s wealthiest man bragged of feeding U.S.A.I.D. to “the wood chipper,” claimed the agency was a “criminal” enterprise, and crowed about “dismantling the radical-left shadow government.” This seemed like a far cry from his initial mandate of serving as an “outside volunteer” to advise Trump on possible budget cuts. Let the record show that, at 3:59 A.M. on day sixteen of the Trump restoration, as Democrats sputtered ineffectually about an unelected billionaire’s illegal power grab, Musk openly proclaimed his project as nothing less than “the revolution of the people.”\nA day later, I spoke with a Republican who worked closely with the architects of America’s botched Iraq invasion. I asked whether he had been surprised by anything so far in a Trump Administration designed to shock. Yes, he replied—Musk’s sneaky takeover of the apparatus of the vast U.S. executive branch was something entirely new in the annals of global coups. “Elon figured out that the personnel, information-technology backbone of the government was essentially the twenty-first-century equivalent of the nineteen-fifties television tower in the Third World,” he observed, and “that you could take over the government essentially with a handful of people if you could access all that.” My friend, incidentally, chose to speak on background despite his years of public criticism of Trump, noting that a think tank with which he is affiliated receives government contracts. Fear, in this revolution, as in all revolutions, is perhaps the most effective weapon of all.\nTwo decades ago, Bush’s Republican Party chose to topple the far-off regime of Saddam Hussein. It’s worth taking a second to reflect that, only a short political lifetime later, the government that Trump’s G.O.P. has chosen to go after is our own.\nWe don’t yet know to what extent this brazen ploy will succeed, of course. Congressional Democrats and others have mobilized to defend various embattled agencies; lawsuits have been filed; protests have been convened. But for now, the politics may even be working for Trump and Musk. The Democratic strategist David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama, have both warned that they fear their party is falling into a trap in defending U.S.A.I.D. “My heart is with the people out on the street outside USAID, but my head tells me: ‘Man, Trump will be well satisfied to have this fight,’ ” Axelrod told Politico’s Rachael Bade. “When you talk about cuts, the first thing people say is: Cut foreign aid.”\nIt’s also true that, if cutting the federal government is what this is all about, then Trump and Musk would not be bothering with tiny U.S.A.I.D., whose estimated budget of some forty billion dollars is less than one per cent of the federal government’s. The point is not a policy fight; it’s an execution. They are killing one agency to terrify a thousand others. Congress should be one of the main aggrieved parties here, given that it passed the laws authorizing U.S.A.I.D. and other departments under attack and appropriating the funding for them, but this is the Republican-controlled Congress in the age of Trump. Speaker Mike Johnson, on Wednesday, dismissed the furor over Musk’s power play as “gross overreaction in the media.” Perhaps the most perfect distillation of where elected Republican officials are at right now came from the North Carolina senator Thom Tillis. Asked about what Musk is doing on Trump’s behalf, he replied, “That runs afoul of the Constitution in the strictest sense.” But, he added, “nobody should bellyache about that.”\nThe message here is loud and clear: the revolution will not be stopped on Capitol Hill. And indeed, on Tuesday, two of Trump’s most controversial nominees, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., for Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Tulsi Gabbard for director of National Intelligence, were voted out of Senate committees after key Republican senators abandoned their objections to them. On Thursday evening, despite an all-night Democratic filibuster against the nomination of Russell Vought to be Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate was expected to go ahead and confirm him. Vought is an intellectual architect of the attack on the federal government who helped write the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 agenda for the new Administration, and he has made little secret of the pain he is hoping to inflict. “We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,” he said at a conference in 2023, a tape of which was later obtained by ProPublica. “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work. . . . We want to put them in trauma.”\nEarlier this week, I spoke with one of Vought’s millions of targets, a career prosecutor who’s spent decades in the Justice Department’s environment division. The purge of her corner of the bureaucracy hadn’t yet made headlines, but it had arrived nonetheless. “They’ve already come,” she told me. Four of the division’s eight section chiefs had been removed and reassigned to a task force on combatting so-called sanctuary cities. Multiple employees whose roles involved “diversity” had been placed on administrative leave. The division’s “law and policy” section attorneys were told their entire office would be eliminated. And all that was before the incoming Attorney General, Pam Bondi, was confirmed by the Senate. “It’s just basically like we’re in a black hole, where our leadership has been eliminated but no political leadership has come in,” she said.\nIf trauma is the goal, Trump and his minions have already succeeded. But my source also offered up an eloquent rebuttal to the mindless cutting, an approach that she compared to an elementary-school principal deciding that, rather than trim the budget a few per cent, she’d just go ahead and eliminate the entire third grade. Should we get rid of air-traffic controllers and FEMA and E.P.A. testing for lead in your kids’ water, too? She asked. Frankly, her defense of the federal government was better than just about anything I’ve heard from the beleaguered Democrats. The revolution, however, will get the last laugh: After more than thirty years of public service, she already planned to retire later this year. Congrats, Elon Musk. ♦","summary":"The evisceration of U.S.A.I.D. isn’t a policy fight—it’s an execution designed to strike fear in our own government.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/elon-musks-revolutionary-terror","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/67a545f06cbeedf5e4d287fb/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/Glasser-Musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 01:00:00","author":"Susan B.

Cmdr. Geirid Morgan, a program officer with the Office of Naval Research who is transgender. \"I have 14 years of active-duty service, including enlisted duty and officer time. I have a pretty wide scope of operational and just general military-relevant experience, and it will be very, very hard on me and very sad to let go of that.\"The Pentagon has 60 days to implement policies related to Trump's order that could have dire implications for nearly 15,000 transgender troops.\"One of the scariest things about this is that we're not sure exactly how it's going to get implemented,\" a staff member with Modern Military Association of America, the largest nonprofit organization in the US supporting LGBTQ+ military, told Business Insider. \"That's what's scary about EOs, particularly these EOs, is that you put the burden on the agencies to figure out what compliance looks like.\"The Defense Department declined to answer questions about how their forthcoming policy would impact active-duty transgender personnel.It's still unclear what policy enforcement could look like. The executive order directs the Pentagon to update medical standards for service members, prohibit the use of pronouns other than an individual's birth sex, and ban individuals from using facilities for sleeping, changing, and bathing that do not correspond to their sex assigned at birth.Trump also revoked the Biden-era policy allowing all qualified Americans to serve in the military, which reversed the previous ban on transgender members from service implemented during Trump's first term.The order does not explicitly call for the immediate discharge of active-duty transgender troops, but it \"sets the stage for potential future removals based on medical standards we're not sure of yet,\" the official said, who asked to remain anonymous due to LGBTQ-targeted harassment and doxxing campaigns.The Trump administration has already started removing transgender troops and rejecting transgender military applicants, according to an emergency legal filing obtained by Reuters.\"There are thousands of us currently serving,\" Morgan told Business Insider. \"Those are trained and experienced personnel who will be removed from their jobs, and that can take years to a decade or more to replace, depending on the experience level and the specialty of the person.\"Alaina Kupec, a former US naval intelligence officer, told Business Insider that the \"medical conditions or physical defects\" mentioned in the executive order of being transgender is \"such a tiny part of who we are. Kupec, who transitioned in 2012, said the recovery time and post-operation treatments related to a physical transition is \"such an afterthought.\"Kupec said the Trump order seeks to \"spread falsehoods and to dehumanize the community because it's not based in reality, it's not based in medical evidence, it's not based in the lived experience of people who are serving our country.\"Morgan said the order sends a message to US troops that \"no matter who you are, no matter what demographic group you belong to, your service may not be valued as much as somebody else's service simply because of who you are.\"\"We are no different than any other service member,\" she said. \"We meet the same physical standards, we meet the same medical readiness standards. If you are actively serving, if you are deployed and doing your job, that means you have met those standards.\"As Morgan weighs her options for the future, she said she has met with her chain of command to discuss possible courses of action pending the Defense Department's policies.Transgender personnel make up a fraction of the over 1 million active-duty troops. But 73% of trans service members are senior personnel, some of whom have up to two decades of military experience.Morgan falls into that demographic as a Ph.D. level research physiologist for the Navy — one of 15 on active duty, she said. Exiting service would leave her department with a leadership gap, she said.\"I'm at a point in my career as a field grade officer where the expectation is that I take on greater responsibility and leadership roles, so that's going to be a gap at that command,\" she said. \"They're not going to have the field grade officer in a leadership role that they were expecting.\"Kupec said the potential removal of transgender troops would hurt national security.\"They're serving in the Red Sea, they're serving the Asia Pacific region, and if we're going to have to force them out of their commands, that's going to leave a gap in readiness,\" Kupec said. \"Many of them are leaders, it's going to leave a gap in command structures.\"The Modern Military official said the order could spark fears for other marginalized groups in the military.\"I'm speculating, but let's say you're a cis-gendered lesbian or gay person in the military, and you see your trans friend get kicked out,\" the official said. \"You got to be thinking, 'Are we going back in the closet? Is 'Don't ask, don't tell' coming back? Am I next?' There are a lot more scary places this could go, and it would be naive to assume it stops here.\"","summary":"Trump's order targeted \"radical gender ideology\" in the US military.

It's okay if you're not.'\n'You said you wouldn't kiss her but you did,' Grace said, looking angry, before she added: 'Just shut the f*** up.'\n\nNow, Olivia, 33, has weighed in on the whole situation by taking to TikTok to share what she thinks\n\nOlivia made fun of the situation, insinuating that her reaction would've been the same \n\nShe later turned to him and said: 'I literally told you I would be uncomfortable if you did that and you did it.'\nThe game continued but Luca looked over at Ronnie Vint and mouthed: 'I f***ed up.'\nLuca then chimed in after Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu's to ask that it be the last round - before he stormed off and the episode ended.\nMany fans were quick to side with Grace as they praised her for standing firm after Luca said he wouldn't kiss Samie but did.\nMore recently, Love Island viewers were left fuming on Thursday night as the episode ended on a huge cliffhanger.\nThe stars took part in the classic Snog, Marry, Pie challenge on the instalment - with Samie's choice looking set to make waves in Friday's show.\n\nLove Island: All Stars' viewers were left fuming on Thursday night as the episode ended on a huge cliffhanger\n\nThe stars took part in the classic Snog, Marry, Pie challenge on the instalment - with Samie's choice looking set to make waves in Friday's show\n\n Love Island: All Stars: Snog, Marry, Pie challenge ends on HUGE cliffhanger \nSamie has been keen to get to know Luca after coming in as a bombshell despite his strong connection with Grace.\nThe public chose to couple them up this week leaving Grace in tears - especially since Luca chose to kiss Samie in a spin the bottle game.\nThursday night's episode ended just as Samie walked up to the boys to pick who to kiss, marry or pie and it appeared right at the last minute she was heading to smooch Luca.\nFrustrated viewers will have to wait for Friday's show to see who she does actually pick.\nMaya JamaITVSamie ElishiOlivia Attwood\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOlivia Attwood weighs in on Love Island backlash over Grace Jackson's reaction to Luca Bish kissing Samie Elishi (and host Maya Jama agrees!)\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nDemi Moore gives emotional update on Bruce Willis amid his dementia battle\n\nTaylor Swift 'feels used' by BFF Blake Lively after she was dragged into Justin Baldoni It Ends With Us lawsuits\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

Republicans backed Vought’s nomination, arguing he proved a qualified candidate for the role since he previously held the position during President Donald Trump’s first term. Democrats, however, raised multiple concerns about his nomination and said his views on the Impoundment Control Act, which reinforces that Congress holds the power of the purse, disqualified him from the role. Democrats held a 30-hour-long protest against Vought's nomination, delivering speeches in the middle of the night on Wednesday in an attempt to delay the confirmation vote. The Senate, in a chaotic final floor vote on Thursday evening, voted to confirm Vought to lead the OMB, 53 to 47. SENATE DEMOCRATS SPEAK ALL NIGHT AGAINST TRUMP OMB NOMINEE, DELAYING CONFIRMATION VOTE Democratic Senators repeatedly injected themselves during the confirmation vote, protesting the nomination until the last second. \"No debate is permitted during a vote,\" Republican Sen. Ashley Moody told the lawmakers. The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for developing and executing the president’s budget, as well as overseeing and coordinating legislative proposals and priorities aligned with the executive branch. Vought appeared before the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for confirmation hearings, where he defended statements asserting that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional. TRUMP HEALTH SECRETARY NOMINEE RFK JR CLEARS SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CONFIRMATION VOTE The law, adopted in 1974, stipulates that Congress may oversee the executive branch’s withholdings of budget authority. But Vought encountered criticism from Democrats for freezing $214 million in military aid for Ukraine in 2019 — a decision that ultimately led to Trump’s first impeachment. \"You’re quite comfortable assuming that the law doesn’t matter and that you’ll just treat the money for a program as a ceiling … rather than a required amount,\" Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said Wednesday. \"Well, the courts have found otherwise.\" In the 1975 Supreme Court ruling Train v. New York, the court determined the Environmental Protection Agency must use full funding included in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, even though then-President Richard Nixon issued orders to not use all the funding. Even so, Vought told lawmakers that Trump campaigned on the position that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional — and that he agrees with that. Vought’s statements on the issue left Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., \"astonished and aghast\" during one confirmation hearing. \"I think our colleagues should be equally aghast, because this issue goes beyond Republican or Democrat,\" Blumenthal said on Jan. 15. \"It’s bigger than one administration or another. It’s whether the law of the land should prevail, or maybe it’s up for grabs, depending on what the president thinks.\" Vought also faced questioning from Democrats on his views regarding abortion as an author of Project 2025, a political initiative conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation released in 2023 that called for policy changes that would implement a national ban on medication abortion. Other proposals included in Project 2025 include eliminating the Department of Education, cutting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and reducing funding for Medicare and Medicaid. \"You have said that you don’t believe in exceptions for rape, for incest, or the life of the mother,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said during a confirmation hearing on Wednesday. \"Is that your position?\" \"Senator, my views are not important,\" Vought said. \"I’m here on behalf of the president.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump repeatedly has stated that he backs abortion in certain instances, and stated that \"powerful exceptions\" for abortion would remain in place under his administration.

This may not happen to everyone but as I'm left with scars seven months later I just wanted to take to social media just to let everyone know what had happened to myself.'\nShe then showed her followers what it looked like after she had it done, adding: 'I now have a dint in the side of my face.'\nChloe went on to reveal the difficulties she faced, including hospital treatments and medication after she underwent the controversial £800 cosmetic procedure and told fans: 'I have been through hell with it, I have been to hospital, I have been on tablets.'\n\nWriting a statement, Chloe penned: 'I'm writing this post as I'd like to share with you all something personal to me that I have never publicly addressed.

Bill Hagerty, who served as U.S. ambassador to Tokyo under Trump's first presidency, said Japan buying more liquefied natural gas from the United States will have an enormous impact on wider Asia.\n\nWASHINGTON - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Washington on Thursday for his first summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to confirm the strength of their nations' alliance.\n\nIshiba will also exchange views with Trump on economic and security issues and agree on further cooperation toward \"a free and open Indo-Pacific\" in their talks at the White House on Friday, Japanese government officials said.\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is almost certain to pressure Japan to increase its defense spending during a meeting with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba later this week, a U.S. government official said Wednesday.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not touch on any numerical targets, adding it is ultimately up to Trump to decide what to tell Ishiba regarding various issues when the two meet in Washington on Friday.\n\nTOKYO - People in Japan were swindled out of a record-high amount of money in romance and investment scams on social media in 2024, with the number of cases more than doubling from the previous year, police data showed Thursday.\n\nScammers stole some 126.8 billion yen ($833 million), up 81.3 billion yen from 2023, according to preliminary figures released by the National Police Agency.\n\nTOKYO - The CEO of Nissan Motor Co. conveyed the company's intent to terminate merger talks with Honda Motor Co. on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said, signaling the end of an initiative that would have created the world's third biggest auto group.\n\nMakoto Uchida met Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe during a visit to the headquarters of Japan's second biggest automaker in Tokyo in the morning, the source said.\n\nTrader Itochu says weighing joining Seven & i management buyout plan\n\nTOKYO - Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. said Thursday it is considering joining other companies in a management buyout of Seven & i Holdings Co. proposed by its founding family to fend off a takeover bid by Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.\n\nWhile no decisions have yet been made, Itochu is \"able to handle any scenario\" as securing funds for the massive investment would not be an issue, Executive Vice President Tsuyoshi Hachimura said at a press conference on its latest earnings.\n\nTOKYO - A member of the Japanese Olympic Committee board expressed opposition Thursday to an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.\n\nThe executive order \"sends a discriminatory message against all members of the LGBTQ+ community and has a negative impact on the entire sports world,\" Fumino Sugiyama, a transgender activist and a former member of the Japanese women's national fencing team, said in a statement.\n\nVideo: Traditional fire festival in Shingu in the western Japan prefecture of Wakayama","summary":"TOKYO - \n Men hold up burning torches during a traditional festival dating back about 1,400 years at Kamikur...","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/02/9c23d57d1309-kyodo-news-digest-feb-7-2025--1-.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/6b197499ebcac3f2c62e66b7540c22ff/photo_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:34:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.021},{"id":287887862,"title":"Japan PM Ishiba arrives in Washington for 1st summit with Trump","text":"Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Washington on Thursday for his first summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to confirm the strength of their nations' alliance.\n\nIshiba will also exchange views with Trump on economic and security issues and agree on further cooperation toward \"a free and open Indo-Pacific\" in their talks at the White House on Friday, Japanese government officials said.\n\n\"Since it's going to be our first face-to-face meeting, I hope to build trust with him,\" Ishiba told reporters at his office before departing from Tokyo's Haneda airport.\n\nHe also said he wants to confirm with Trump that U.S.-Japan cooperation will contribute to the \"development and peace\" of the Indo-Pacific region and the world.\n\nThe leaders are planning to hold a press conference after their meeting on Friday, according to the Japanese government. A post-summit joint statement is expected to describe the U.S. commitment to Japan's defense as \"unwavering,\" Japanese government sources said, amid China's military buildup and North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile development.\n\nThe summit comes as Japan is trying to maintain close U.S. military involvement in the Indo-Pacific, amid concern over the unilateralist, deals-based \"America First\" approach to foreign policy that characterized Trump's first presidential term, which started in 2017.\n\nIshiba is set to be the second foreign political leader to hold an in-person, sit-down meeting with Trump since his return to the White House on Jan. 20. The Republican president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday.\n\nThe officials said they believe the new U.S. administration understands the significance of ties with Japan and see the talks as a great opportunity for Ishiba, who became prime minister in October, to build a relationship of trust with Trump.\n\nIshiba and Trump are expected to reaffirm the importance of \"peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" as their predecessors have done in recent years, according to the sources.\n\nChina has been piling military pressure on Taiwan, viewing the self-ruled democratic island as a breakaway province to be eventually reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary.\n\nThe joint statement would also affirm that Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. security treaty applies to the Japanese-controlled, Chinese-claimed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, according to the sources.\n\nArticle 5 obliges the United States to defend territories under Japan's administration from armed attack. Tokyo is wary of Beijing's maritime activities in the East China Sea, with Chinese coast guard vessels repeatedly intruding into waters around the uninhabited Senkakus that China calls Diaoyu.\n\nAs for North Korea, Ishiba is expected to seek U.S. cooperation on the issue of Pyongyang's abductions of Japanese nationals in the 1970s and 1980s. Trump held summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term and has expressed a readiness to resume dialogue.\n\nKeeping in mind Trump's demand for NATO members to increase their defense spending, Ishiba intends to explain that Japan is on course to boost it toward the goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nOn the economic front, the promotion of further bilateral collaboration on cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, will be discussed.\n\nJapan's expansion of U.S. liquefied natural gas imports following Trump's directive to increase fossil fuel production, and a request for Trump to visit Japan later this year are also likely to be on the agenda, the sources have said.\n\nRelated coverage","summary":"WASHINGTON - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Washington on Thursday for his first summit with U...","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/02/efa8d698570a-update1-japan-pm-ishiba-arrives-in-washington-for-1st-summit-with-trump.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/c966e09953f363d0dc8441076f7873f7/cropped_image_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:34:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.17},{"id":287891754,"title":"EPHRAIM HARDCASTLE: Does the King support the building of Heathrow's third runway?","text":"Does the King support the building of Heathrow’s third runway?

Money back!’\n\nReviewing Hope, the autobiography of Pope Francis, in the Times Literary Supplement fellow Catholic AN Wilson calls him ‘inelegant, egotistical and brutal’. \n\n‘His clumsiness and his desire for a punch-up seem almost ridiculous...

Email Taryn.pedler@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TARYN PEDLER \n Published:00:09 GMT, 7 February 2025 |Updated:00:33 GMT, 7 February 2025 \n\nGreece has declared an month-long state of emergency on Santorini after a series of earthquakes forced thousands of people to flee the tourist hotspot. \nSince January 31, a series of undersea tremors have been recorded between Santorini and the neighbouring islands of Amorgos, Anafi, and Ios, with the strongest- a 5.2-magnitude quake - striking on Wednesday night.\nOn Thursday evening, a 4.6 magnitude quake was recorded at 20:16 local time in the sea between Santorini and Amorgos, followed by a 4.2 magnitude quake roughly two hours later. \nThe near-constant tremors have left residents and tourists terrified, with authorities shutting schools, cordoning off cliff-top towns, and warning of landslides.\nLocals have been urged to stay away from ports and avoid gathering indoors, as emergency crews - including the army, fire service, and police - have been deployed across the island.\nThe emergency measures will remain in place until at least March 3, allowing Greece's climate crisis and civil protection ministry to coordinate its response to the ongoing seismic activity.\nMore than 11,000 people have now fled Santorini as the island remains gripped by the relentless earthquakes, with tremors now being recorded minute by minute.\nExperts have warned that the island is facing a 'seismic crisis' with no clear end in sight, raising fears of a larger, more destructive quake in the days ahead.\n\nFirefighters walk in the almost evacuated village of Fira in Santorini, Greece, 06 February 2025\n\nA police cordon blocks access to an area in Santorini as earthquake fears prompt heightened safety measures\n\nResidents and tourists scramble to leave Greek island on ferries and planes due to ongoing seismic activity in Santorini\nWhile Thursday's tremors have not yet matched the 5.2-magnitude quake that struck on Wednesday, authorities remain on high alert for potential landslides and aftershocks.\nSo far, no injuries or major damage have been reported, but emergency teams are preparing for the worst. \n\n Fear grips Santorini as earthquakes strike every ten minutes \nSome residents have taken matters into their own hands, building makeshift tsunami defences using sandbags along Monolithos beach, where buildings sit dangerously close to the water.\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who is set to visit Santorini on Friday, has called for calm while reassuring residents that authorities are ready to respond.\n'All emergency plans have been implemented. Forces have been deployed to Santorini and the surrounding islands so we are ready for any eventuality,' he said.\nSeismologists say the quakes are the result of tectonic plate movements, not volcanic activity, despite Santorini sitting on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands formed by ancient eruptions.\nGreece is one of Europe's most earthquake-prone countries, but seismologists say the current level of activity is unlike anything seen before - and could continue for weeks or even months.\n\nSince January 31, a series of undersea tremors have been recorded between Santorini and the neighbouring islands of Amorgos, Anafi, and Ios, with the strongest- a 5.2-magnitude quake - striking on Wednesday night\n\nGreece declared a state of emergency for Santorini, the focal point of ongoing seismic activity in the southern Aegean Sea\n\nDust rises following a landslide during high seismic activity, on the island of Santorini, Greece, February 3, 2025\n\nPeople cross a police cordon as they evacuate their home in the village of Oia on Santorini island, Greece, 05 February 2025\nDespite the alarm, experts insist the tremors are not linked to volcanic activity in the region. However, they cannot rule out the possibility of an even stronger earthquake.\nSeismologist Vassilis K. Karastathis of the National Observatory of Athens admitted: 'We are still in the middle of this - we haven't seen any signs that the activity is slowing down.'\n\n Locals flee Santorini as volcanic holiday spot is hit by hundreds of tremors, sparking landslides \nThe only silver lining, experts say, is that because the tremors are occurring underwater, the risk of catastrophic destruction is lower compared to land-based quakes.\nEarlier in the week, prominent Greek seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos cautioned that the current earthquake sequence - displayed on live seismic maps as a growing cluster of dots between the islands of Santorini, Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi - could indicate a larger impending event.\n'I have never felt anything like this and with such frequency - an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried,' said Santorini local Michalis Gerontakis.\nMobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rockslides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles.\nGovernment officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios for the entire week. \n\nDespite the alarm, experts insist the tremors are not linked to volcanic activity in the region\n\nMore than 11,000 people have now fled Santorini as the island remains gripped by the relentless earthquakes, with tremors now being recorded minute by minute\n\nResidents and tourists scramble to leave Greek island on ferries\n\nEarthquakes measuring 6.0 or higher are considered severe, while the 5.2-magnitude tremor recorded on Wednesday is classified as moderate\nResidents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.\nFire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.\n\n Looting fears amid chaos on Santorini as 11,000 flee with earthquakes STILL rocking Greek island \n'We arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog,' said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.\nSome residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.\n'We've had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different,' said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.\n'I need to get away for a few days until things calm down,' she said.\nEarthquakes measuring 6.0 or higher are considered severe, while the 5.2-magnitude tremor recorded on Wednesday is classified as moderate.\nFor now, residents and those who remain on the island can do little more than brace for the unknown, as tremors continue to shake the ground beneath one of Greece’s most iconic tourist destinations.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGreece declares month-long state of emergency on Santorini after series of earthquakes forced thousands to flee tourist hotspot\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCelebrity chef Gino D'Acampo hit with multiple allegations of 'sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour' over 12-year period\n\nDemi Moore gives emotional update on Bruce Willis amid his dementia battle\n\nTaylor Swift 'feels used' by BFF Blake Lively after she was dragged into Justin Baldoni It Ends With Us lawsuits\n\nMOLLY CLAYTON: Lottie Moss has branded me 'jealous' after I revealed our encounter from hell.

she traveled with USAID to Africa and praised its work there\n\nIn his first term, Trump heavily cut funding for the aid agency but it still found money to invest into his family's government ventures.\n\nIvanka Trump used USAID for her program to promote women in business, claiming 12 million women around the world had been helped by it.\n\nShe travelled with the agency to Colombia in September 2019 to run a workshop for women entrepreneurs.\n\nThat same year, she also used over $11,000 from the agency to buy video recording and reproducing equipment for a White House event, its records show.\n\nMeanwhile, USAID was one of the first agencies to name an ambassador to Melania Trump's Be Best initiative.\n\nWhen Melania Trump first announced her signature program in May 2018, she asked government agencies to name a liaison to her group. USAID immediately did so.\n\nAt her one-year anniversary celebration in May, Melania acknowledged the agency and thanked it for naming the first Be Best ambassador.\n\nBlistering moment Karoline Leavitt rips USAID spending to shreds in front of stunned reporters\n\n'For the first time in history, the United States Agency for International Development has appointed a Be Best ambassador,' she said.\n\n'On this one year anniversary of my initiative, I call on all of our partner agencies to appoint a be best ambassador who will serve as a liaison between my office and their respective agency to better highlight and promote the programs and services offered to parents and children on behalf of the US government,' she added.\n\nDonald Trump was sitting in the audience listening.\n\nNeither the East Wing, the West Wing, nor Ivanka Trump's office responded to DailyMail.com's request for comment.\n\nUSAID delivers billions of dollars in humanitarian aid overseas.\n\nThe Trump administration is threatening to shut it down or bring the independent agency under the umbrella of the State Department.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is now acting director of the agency it's been announced this week.\n\nHundreds of USAID contractors were placed on unpaid leave and some were terminated. Elon Musk, who is running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE program, said the agency would be eliminated.\n\nIts Washington D.C. office is closed and employees were either put on leave or told to work from home.\n\nIvanka Trump talks to Venezuelan migrant Andry Rodriguez at a migrant shelter in La Parada near Cucuta, Colombia when she traveled with USAID to the country in September 2019\n\nTrump has said of the agency: 'It's been run by a bunch of radical lunatics, and we're getting them out.'\n\nHe also claims it 'had to be corrupt' to approve certain initiatives. \n\nThe president has berated the agency for its spending practices, including having a subscription to Politico Pro, a service that tracks legislation and other government news.\n\nAnd his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, gave a blistering account of USAID's spending. Speaking to reporters at the White House last week, she held up a sheet of paper giving details of the astonishing ways in which taxpayers' money had been doled out.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump sits with a students and head teacher Maureen Masi during language class as she visits Chipala Primary School, in Lilongwe, Malawi as part of her trip to Africa with USAID in October 2018\n\nThen White House adviser Ivanka Trump and Mark Green, the head of the USAID, enjoy a coffee in a women-owned cafe in Asuncion, Paraguay in September 2019\n\nIt was an apparent reference to a story in Daily Mail, which first outlined the shocking expenditures related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), on which President Trump has ordered a crackdown.\n\n'I don't know about you. But as an American taxpayer, I don't want my dollars going toward this crap. And I know the American people don't either. And that's exactly what Elon Musk has been tasked by President Trump to do. To get the fraud, waste and abuse out of the federal government,' Leavitt said.\n\nDonald TrumpIvanka TrumpMelania Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMelania and Ivanka's close ties to USAID exposed as Trump goes scorched-earth on the 'corrupt' agency\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Melania and Ivanka Trump used thousands of dollars from USAID to fund pet projects during Trump's first term it's been revealed as the agency's spending comes under scrutiny from the president.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14369601/Melania-Ivanka-donald-trump-USAID-spending-cuts.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/06/19/94944335-0-image-a-28_1738869921470.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/05/88690527365711737/1024x576_MP4_88690527365711737.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:32:26","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.282},{"id":287891764,"title":"DAILY MAIL COMMENT: Rachel Reeves's Budget, the slow-mo car crash","text":"In opposition, Rachel Reeves seemed to have all the answers to Britain’s economic woes. To many, she also exuded calm, credibility and competence.\n\nHow appallingly wrong such judgments look now.\n\nWith the economy resembling a slow-motion car crash, her unsuitability as Chancellor is ever more painfully obvious.\n\nBefore she entered the Treasury, the ONS had said the economy was ‘going gang-busters’. Instead of building on that inheritance, however, she has destroyed it.\n\nFirst, Ms Reeves talked down the economy, conjuring up a £22 billion black hole designed for one purpose only – to denigrate the dastardly Tories.\n\nTo make matters worse, she then delivered an omnishambles Budget – a tax-and-spend onslaught that knocked the stuffing out of consumer and business confidence.\n\nYesterday, the consequences of those dismal decisions came home to roost.\n\nIn a damning verdict, the Bank of England halved Britain’s growth forecast while warning inflation will rise to nearly 4 per cent this year – hammering family budgets.\n\nTrue, there was some relief for households as the Bank cut interest rates. But it looks inevitable we are heading back to the 1970s and a bleak era of stagflation.\n\nA Government that genuinely prioritised economic growth, as this one claims to have done, would incentivise hard work, prudent saving and bold aspiration.\n\nYet Sir Keir Starmer’s Plan for Change is already hurting pensioners, business, agriculture and, above all, families.\n\nBitter experience has taught us Labour governments leave the public finances in a worse state than they find them.\n\nUsually, such damage takes place over several years. The hapless Ms Reeves has achieved this in 100 days.\n\nEnd Chagos insanity\n\nWith every passing day, the Prime Minister’s desperation to surrender the Chagos Islands looks more irrational, self-harming and traitorous.\n\nLabour says there is no money for OAPs’ winter fuel payments, but it has somehow found £18 billion to pay Mauritius to take ownership of this strategic asset and lease back the UK-US airbase on Diego Garcia.\n\nNow we learn that Britain’s nuclear deterrent would be exposed to interference by China, which sees Mauritius as an ally, if the sovereignty deal is signed off.\n\nThere is no obligation for Britain to heed what is a non-binding opinion issued by the highly politicised International Court of Justice to cede the islands.

Trump said that the U.S. would “own it” and “level the site” to “create economic development” as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who later praised the idea.\n\nGreen told The Independent it was an unbelievable sight.\n\n“There are some things that will shock the conscience. There are some things that literally would cause one to think, ‘This is not happening,’” Green said Thursday afternoon. “It was unbelievable, when I saw the President and the Prime Minister of Israel standing near each other, and the President was indicating that there would be this takeover of Gaza.”\n\nReports indicate there isn’t much Democratic support for Green’s efforts. Representative Pete Aguilar, the third-ranking House Democrat, told Politico the caucus isn’t focusing on Green’s effort. A senior House Democrat, when asked by Axios whether Green’s article might gain traction, similarly replied: “No.”\n\nBut Green revealed he isn’t interested in lobbying anyone to vote in support of his efforts.\n\n“I'm not going to lobby a single person,” Green said. “I'm not going to ask anyone to vote for this resolution that I will bring.”\n\n“I believe that we have to give people the opportunity to do what we perceive to be right, and more appropriately, what we perceive to be the righteous thing to do,” he continued.\n\nWorld leaders are joining Green in speaking out against Trump’s call to “take over” Gaza. Saudi Arabia said it “unequivocally rejected” the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Palestinians “must be allowed home.” French and German officials also said that any such movement of Palestinians would violate international law.\n\n“These are human beings,” Green told The Independent. “They're not cattle. They're not cattle that you can just herd. They're not dogs that you can push off into some area of a yard. These are human beings, and by the way, this is their land.”\n\nGreen hasn’t submitted the articles yet, he said, and the exact charges he outlines could vary. But the overarching theme of the articles is already clear.\n\n“The overarching theme will be that the President is unfit,” Green said. “He is unfit to the President of the United States of America, and I will state my rationale, that he's unfit, in the articles of impeachment.”\n\nThe White House has dismissed Green’s efforts, with White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Harrison Fields accusing Democrats of continuing to “waste their time on publicity stunts that go against the wishes of the American people.”\n\n“President Trump was elected in a historic landslide to deliver his America First agenda and keep the promises he made on the campaign trail—Democrats can either get on board or keep losing elections,” Fields previously told The Independent.\n\nThis isn’t Green’s first time trying to impeach Trump.\n\nIn 2017, before Trump was successfully impeached twice, Green forced a vote on whether to open debate on a motion to impeach the then-president. The effort failed after only 58 other Democrats supported it.\n\nThen, in 2019, Democrats successfully impeached Trump for the first time on two articles: obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, related to his dealings with Ukraine. The Senate later voted to acquit him on both articles.\n\nTrump was impeached again two years later. Democrats and 10 Republicans voted in support of the article, which charged Trump with “incitement of insurrection” following the January 6, 2021 Capitol riots.\n\nThe Senate once again acquitted him in February 2021, despite a majority of senators – 57 to 43 – voting to convict him. However, that number failed by 10 votes to reach the two-thirds limit required for a conviction.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE: Representative Al Green tells The Independent it was ‘unbelievable’ to watch Trump say the U.S. should ‘take over’ Gaza","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/al-green-trump-impeachment-articles-b2693806.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/06/15/27/Representative-Al-Green.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6WiHut1v-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:26:29","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":287891280,"title":"Trump sanctions International Criminal Court for investigation of Israel","text":"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to impose sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) over its investigation of Israel. The US and Israel are not members of the court and do not recognize its authority. The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes related to Israel’s military actions in Gaza following the Hamas attack in October 2023. Many Palestinians, including children, have been killed during Israel’s response. The order says that the ICC is carrying out \"illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel\" and accuses the court of misusing its power by issuing \"baseless arrest warrants\" against Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant. \"The ICC has no jurisdiction over the United States or Israel,\" the order says, adding that its actions set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Trump signed the order while Netanyahu was in Washington. The two met at the White House on Tuesday, and Netanyahu also met with lawmakers on Thursday. The order further says that the US will impose \"tangible and significant consequences\" on those responsible for the ICC’s actions. Possible measures include blocking assets and banning ICC officials, employees, and their families from entering the US Human rights groups said these sanctions could discourage the court's work and contradict US efforts in other international cases. \"Victims of human rights abuses around the world turn to the International Criminal Court when they have nowhere else to go, and President Trump's executive order will make it harder for them to find justice,\" said Charlie Hogle of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The order also raises serious First Amendment concerns because it puts people in the United States at risk of harsh penalties for helping the court identify and investigate atrocities committed anywhere, by anyone.\" Hogle added that the order \"is an attack on both accountability and free speech.\" The US has never joined the ICC and has long opposed a global court with unelected judges prosecuting American officials. A 2002 law allows the US military to free any American or ally detained by the ICC. In 2020, Trump imposed sanctions on the ICC’s previous chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, for opening an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan, including those committed by the US Former President Joe Biden later lifted those sanctions and the US began limited cooperation with the ICC, especially after it charged Russian President Vladimir Putin with war crimes in Ukraine. Sanctions could make it harder for ICC investigators to travel and use US technology to secure evidence. Last year, the ICC experienced a cyberattack that disrupted access to files for weeks. Some European countries oppose US sanctions. The Netherlands urged ICC member states to \"cooperate to mitigate risks of these possible sanctions, so that the court can continue to carry out its work and fulfil its mandate.\"","summary":"US President Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on the ICC over its investigation into Israeli actions in Gaza, including an arrest warrant for Prime Minister Netanyahu.

Because that’s part of our discussion tonight. We all committed that we wouldn’t go out and telegraph all this before it’s done but it’s very close and probably by tonight, we wrap it all up,” Johnson said, adding that Trump wouldn’t be needed to conclude discussions Thursday evening.\n\nRepublicans have said they want to get a bill through both chambers and to Trump by Easter, which is April 20, or by Memorial Day at the latest.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters while the meeting was going on that Trump had laid out his tax priorities for the group, most of which he had promised during the presidential campaign: not tax on tips, Social Security or overtime pay; renewing his 2017 tax cuts; adjusting the cap on state and local taxes; eliminating tax breaks for professional sports team owners; closing the carried interest tax deduction loophole; and tax cuts for products made in the U.S.\n\n\"This will be the largest tax cut in history for middle class, working Americans,\" she said. \"The President is committed to working with Congress to get this done.\"\n\nJohnson said the goal is for the House Budget Committee to meet early next week to mark up a budget resolution, which would unlock the reconciliation process.\n\nJohnson said that Trump “put a steady hand at the wheel.”\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said they hoped to mark up a budget resolution next week -- a week later than leadership had initially targeted.\n\n“President Trump was very engaged throughout the meeting and we are narrowing down the areas of differences. Definitely was a lot of give and take between the members of the group that we had assembled.”\n\nHouse Budget Chairman Jodey Arrington agreed that the meeting was “very productive” as his committee aims at passing a budget resolution to unlock the budget reconciliation process.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a key moderate voice in the caucus, said the meeting was tense “at times.”\n\nAsked if there was tension in the meeting, Arrington replied, “I mean, look, we all care about getting this right.”\n\nSome hardliners who insist on bigger budget cuts weren’t invited to the meeting and are frustrated.\n\n“They’re not telling me what’s in the daggum bill,” Rep. Tim Burchett, R.-Tenn.) said. “I just had it out with some leadership in there.”\n\nBurchett said leadership showed him some points of a potential deal “on the back of a card” on the House floor.\n\nRepublicans must pass a budget resolution to unlock a complex process to enact sweeping reforms to taxes, energy, border security and more. But Johnson currently has just a one-vote cushion to pass legislation through the lower chamber, so Republican leaders are cognizant that dissenting Republicans could doom their collective efforts.\n\n“We've got to work very meticulously with our members to first make sure we have the votes to get a budget passed,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said before the meeting. “We can't have 22 [Republicans] opposing. We can't have four opposing. And so we're working through a lot more detail now on what reconciliation would look like on the front end before we actually get the budget passed.”\n\nScalise also raised concerns about the Senate’s evolving approach, which could punt tax reform to a second attempt to overhaul the budget late this year. The No. 2 House Republican explained that delaying tax reform in 2017 undercut the anticipated economic growth at the time.\n\n“You didn't really get the bounce because it took so long to get the second bill done,” Scalise said. “The President remembers that. You know, it's one of the reasons we lost the majority. And so do you want to repeat that history, or do you want to do it earlier? You get the benefits earlier, and increase the likelihood that you actually get tax [reform], because the question of whether or not you can even pass a second bill is a real, real, serious concern.”\n\nSenate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told senators during a closed-door lunch on Wednesday that the Senate will take the reins and begin work to advance its own package next week.","summary":"After meeting at the White House with Trump for four hours, House Republicans say they made progress, but some fiscal hardliners are frustrated.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-republicans-meet-trump-move-ball-forward-agenda/story?id=118534607","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2f3c5072-7a9b-48ce-a180-c837058c9841/donald-trump-7-gty-gmh-250206_1738853715383_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:22:40","author":"Jay O'brien,John Parkinson,Lauren Peller","authors":["Jay O'brien","John Parkinson","Lauren Peller"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":287893630,"title":"Rajnath, Hegseth speak on phone, agree to boost ties","text":"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his US counterpart Pete Hegseth today spoke on the phone and agreed to work on a 10-year comprehensive framework (2025-35) to bolster the India-US defence partnership, especially in the spheres of intelligence, logistics, operational and industrial engagement.

They insist in self-righteousness, that they have nothing to be held accountable for, and they are proving it to the entire international community,” said Francesca Albanese, U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nAlbanese said she feared Israel’s military actions, which she alleged to be a “genocide” against the Palestinians, would expand and intensify on the West Bank, which Palestinians want along with Gaza as the core of a future independent state.\n\nIn a letter to UNHRC President Jorg Lauber, Saar said bias against Israel had been ongoing since the group’s inception in 2006.\n\n“The UNHRC has traditionally protected human rights abusers by allowing them to hide from scrutiny, and instead obsessively demonizes the one democracy in the Middle East - Israel,” Saar said in his post on the X platform.\n\n“This body has focused on attacking a democratic country and propagating anti-Semitism instead of promoting human rights.”\n\nSaar noted that several countries known to have human rights violations received fewer council resolutions against them than Israel.\n\n“The discrimination against us is clear: In the UNHRC, Israel is the only country with an agenda item dedicated solely to it. Israel has been subjected to over 100 condemnatory resolutions, over 20 percent of all resolutions ever passed in the Council - more than against Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela combined. Israel will not accept this discrimination any longer!”\n\nIsrael’s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Daniel Meron, told reporters that the council “has been a biased body since its beginning, where dictatorships lecture democracies on human rights.”\n\n“Israel remains committed to human rights and will engage through credible, non-politicized mechanisms,” Meron said.\n\nCouncil members have frequently alleged Israeli human rights violations in its war in Gaza against the Hamas terrorist group. A U.N. inquiry it set up found last year the scale of killings amounted to a crime against humanity.\n\nIsrael rejected the finding and says it takes care to avoid civilian casualties. Many of Gaza’s large displacements of people took place after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned residents of specific areas to leave in advance of a coming offensive, the IDF said.\n\nTrump announced Tuesday that the United States would withdraw from the Human Rights Council and also would not resume funding of UNRWA, the U.N. agency that addresses Palestinians and is the largest employer in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe United States previously froze payments to UNRWA in 2018, during Trump’s first term. It was restored under the Biden administration but stopped again after it was shown that at least nine agency employees participated in terrorist group Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of the Human Rights Council in June 2018. Nikki Haley, then U.N. ambassador, accused the council of “chronic bias against Israel” and pointed to what she said were human rights abusers among its members.\n\nBiden renewed support for the council, and the United States won a seat on it in October 2021.

The order also said the tribunal had engaged in \"illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel,\" referring to ICC probes into alleged war crimes by US service members in Afghanistan and Israeli troops in Gaza.The US president ordered asset freezes and travel bans against ICC officials, employees and their family members, along with anyone deemed to have helped the court's investigations.The sanctions are a show of support after Netanyahu's visit to the White House, during which Trump unveiled a plan for the US to \"take over\" Gaza and move Palestinians to other Middle Eastern countries.Neither the United States nor Israel are members of the court.There was no immediate reaction from the ICC.The ICC issued arrest warrants on November 21 for Netanyahu, his former defense minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif -- whom Israel says is dead.The warrants, approved after an application by ICC prosecutor Karim Khan in May, are for \"crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024.\"During his first term, Trump imposed financial sanctions and a visa ban on the ICC's then-prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and other senior officials and staff in 2020. Describing it as a \"kangaroo court,\" his then-administration made the move after Gambian-born Bensouda launched an investigation into allegations of war crimes against US soldiers in Afghanistan.While his order at the time did not name Israel, Trump administration officials said they were also angered by Bensouda's opening of a probe into the situation in the Palestinian territories in 2019.President Joe Biden lifted the sanctions soon after taking office in 2021.Prosecutor Khan later effectively dropped the United States from the Afghan investigation and focused on the Taliban instead. Biden strongly condemned the \"outrageous\" warrant against Netanyahu in November.The US House passed a bill last month to sanction the ICC, but Senate Democrats blocked it last week, saying the bill could backfire on US allies and firms.But Democrats have also expressed anger at the sanctions on Netanyahu.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/07/trump-sanctions-icc-for-illegitimate-israel-us-probes","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-02-06/p25prhdb/0632197982410.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:11:53","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":287884316,"title":"Trump Imposes Sanctions On International Criminal Court Over Probes Involving the US And Israel","text":"On Thursday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). The move came in response to what the Trump administration described as \"illegitimate and baseless investigations\" targeting the United States and its close ally Israel.\nThe executive order, announced by the White House, accuses the ICC of abusing its power by issuing an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The court had also launched probes into alleged war crimes committed by US military personnel in Afghanistan and Israeli forces in Gaza.\nDetails of the Executive Order\nThe sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans for ICC officials and employees, and restrictions extended to their family members and anyone assisting the court’s investigations. These measures aim to deter further legal actions against the US and Israel by the Hague-based tribunal.\nThe sanctions follow Netanyahu’s recent visit to the White House, during which Trump expressed strong support for Israel. During the meeting, Trump unveiled a controversial plan to \"take over\" Gaza and resettle Palestinians in other Middle Eastern nations.\nIn November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed from October 2023 to May 2024. These developments prompted renewed criticism from Trump.\nHistory of US-ICC Relations\nDuring Trump’s first term, his administration imposed financial sanctions and visa bans on the ICC’s then-prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and other officials. This move was made after Bensouda initiated an investigation into alleged war crimes by US soldiers in Afghanistan.\nAlthough the initial sanctions did not directly reference Israel, officials indicated dissatisfaction with Bensouda’s probe into the Palestinian territories. President Joe Biden reversed these sanctions shortly after taking office in 2021, signaling a softer stance towards the ICC.\nPresident Biden condemned the ICC’s warrant for Netanyahu as \"outrageous.\" Recently, the US House passed a bill to sanction the ICC, but it was blocked by Senate Democrats, who argued that the bill could have unintended consequences for US allies and businesses.\nNo Immediate ICC Reaction\nThe ICC has yet to issue an official response to the latest round of sanctions. The court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, had previously shifted focus away from the US in the Afghan investigation to concentrate on the Taliban instead.\nTrump’s executive order to sanction the ICC underscores ongoing tensions between the US, Israel, and the international tribunal. With Biden and the Democratic-led Senate expressing contrasting views, the future of US-ICC relations remains uncertain.\nRead More : Virginia's Democratic-Led House And Senate Approve Separate State Budget Amendment Plans","summary":"On Thursday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC).","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-imposes-sanctions-on-international-criminal-court-over-probes-involving-the-us-and-israel/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/federal-freeze-trump-financial-aid-federal-grant-freeze-federal-funding-are-food-stamps-paused-pell-grant-trump-trump-snap-benefits-federal-student-aid.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:09:44","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.011},{"id":287885508,"title":"Mike Johnson Gives Update on Budget Talks After Long Meeting with Trump","text":"House Speaker Mike Johnson along with Republican lawmakers held an hours-long meeting with President Donald Trump on Thursday about budgets and a future spending bill.Why It MattersA spending bill, or \"reconciliation\" bill, has historically divided House Republicans as members have been split on what the bill should include. The reconciliation process attaches money to policy and needs to be passed in order to be implemented.Conservative Republicans are in favor of deep budget cuts and pushing Trump's agenda forward. More central-leaning Republicans are in favor of keeping certain programs in place that do or could benefit the voters in their districts.Since winning his congressional election and subsequent Speakership title, Johnson has been treading a fine line throughout the process of budget talks as the House holds a razor-thin majority.What To KnowFollowing the four-plus hour meeting, Johnson spoke to reporters in the Capitol building following his return from the White House. In an email to Newsweek, Johnson's office shared the speaker's remarks. \"We had a very good meeting at the White House, very productive. We had a large cross-section of members there from committees of important jurisdiction,\" Johnson said.He said Trump \"started off the meeting and sort of set the table for the discussion. And we stayed there in the cabinet meeting room for, I don't know, maybe four hours or longer.\" Johnson added that lawmakers \"got out the whiteboards and we worked out the framework for what we believe will be the path forward. And we're gonna meet again tonight to finish up some final details.\"I think we'll be able to make some announcements probably by tomorrow. And we're excited about that. The idea would be to get the Budget Committee working potentially as early as early next week, maybe Tuesday for a markup for the budget resolution,\" Johnson said. \"And then we'll unlock this process and get it moving.\"Johnson was also scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday and hold remarks afterward. The meeting was pushed due to the budget talks, multiple outlets reported. Johnson's office told Newsweek, \"Any updates on that front are forthcoming.\"What People Are SayingIn his shared remarks to Newsweek Johnson concluded: \"So our message to our friends and colleagues in the Senate is, allow the House to do its work. We are moving this as quickly and as expeditiously as possible. Very positive developments today. We're really grateful for the president, for leaning in and doing what he does best. And that is put a steady hand at the wheel and get everybody working. And that's what happened today.\"Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York said after the meeting according to Spectrum News' Taylor Popielarz: \"We made a lot of progress and we're getting closer.\"Republican Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska said after the meeting, according to Spectrum News' Taylor Popielarz: \"I'm gonna defer to the speaker and the president...we had a four hour meeting...I think we're making progress, but we got more work to do.\" Bacon added that \"at times\" the meeting was tense, Popielarz says.The Center on Budget X account on Thursday: \"House Rs are considering major cuts to clean energy and climate funding, while the Trump admin moves to delay grants and loans—hitting Black, Latine, Native, and low-wealth communities hardest.

And while the courts have the authority to halt the executive orders, the reopening of the ghastly Guantánamo camps and the deportation of immigrants have already started.\n\nThe willingness of the populace to accept the authority used is one factor in the accumulation of authoritarian power. While Donald Trump’s statements are sometimes intended to test the waters, other times the absurd assertion in itself stands alone as a triumph. In order to demonstrate his ability to do so, he disobeys legal restrictions with humiliation, which seems to expose the possibility of a blatant sadism towards the public.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump just announced that the US reopening a 30,000-bed detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to house criminal illegal migrants: pic.twitter.com/UwxFWkRNiR\n— John Roberts (@johnrobertsFox) January 29, 2025\n\nThe thrills of the aforementioned possible blatant sadism inspire others to celebrate this brand of manhood, one that is not only prepared to violate the freedom, equality, and justice that are the cornerstones of democratic life but also to enact these as means of “liberation” from erroneous beliefs and the restraints of the law.\n\nWhile the freedoms for which many have fought for decades are misrepresented and trampled under the guise of morally repressive “wokeism,” an exuberant hatred now parades as freedom.\n\nThe sadistic joy in question is not unique to him; it is a collective and contagious celebration of cruelty that must be shared and widely appreciated to survive. Indeed, the merciless rampage is fuelled by the public attention it receives.\n\nThis procession of reactionary outrage and defiance must be heard, seen, and known. Because of this, exposing hypocrisy is no longer a straightforward task that will benefit us in the present. It is not necessary to remove the moral veneer.

The new policy states, \"A student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women’s team.\" HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE Prior to Trump signing the order Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said part of the motivation behind Trump's executive order would be to create a \"pressure campaign\" for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and NCAA to follow and prevent transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. During Trump's ceremony at the White House to sign the executive order, he announced that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will prohibit any transgender athletes attempting to compete as women from entering the country for the Olympics in 2028. Trump said he will instruct Noem \"to deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes try and get into the Games.\" There was controversy surrounding gender eligibility at the Paris Olympics in July and August. Boxers Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan won gold medals in women's boxing. Both athletes had previously been disqualified from international competitions for failing gender eligibility tests. However, the IOC and current President Thomas Bach voiced support for both athletes. The IOC also insisted that both athletes were biologically female. Before that, Laurel Hubbard, a transgender woman, competed in weightlifting for the New Zealand team, and Canadian soccer player Quinn came out as nonbinary and transgender in 2020. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM With Bach preparing to leave office later this year, the IOC's next president could help carry out Trump's vision on the issue more cooperatively. Former British Olympic champion Sebastian Coe is a candidate to be the next IOC president and has suggested he will take action to prevent transgender inclusion in women's events. Coe is the head of World Athletics, the governing body for international track and field competition. In 2023, the governing body tightened its regulations on transgender athletes to exclude transgender women who have gone through male puberty from competing in the female category. That regulation also lowered the maximum testosterone level for eligible female competitors. Coe said if he becomes IOC president, the new Olympic policy on transgender inclusion will \"probably\" reflect the one he has established in World Athletics. Coe has also said the controversy surrounding Khelif and Yu-ting made him feel \"uncomfortable.\" The United Nations released study findings saying nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of winning medals because they lost to transgender athletes. The study, \"Violence against women and girls in sports,\" said more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. \"The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,\" the report said.

The IOC recommended that the individual sports organizations balance inclusivity with fairness. The IOC allowed Khelif and Lin to compete in 2024 because it does not recognize the International Boxing Association as the sport’s world governing body.\n\nTrump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio is going to make clear to the IOC “that America categorically rejects transgender lunacy.”\n\n“We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject that we even have to talk about,” Trump said. “If you went back 10 years or 15 years and you would move forward and listen to this you’d say, What the hell are they talking about? This is impossible.\n\n“But you have people out there, Democrats, that are still totally in favor. They can’t win the argument. They can’t win a debate.\n\n“They look like fools, and they continue to go on, and it’s OK because as long as they do this – and open borders and all of the other things they talk about – transgender, everything. All they want to do is transgender and men playing in women’s sports and all of these crazy things and if they continue, I think we’re gonna end up ultimately, it’s not gonna matter because we’re never going to go along with them and we’re just going to keep winning elections.”\n\nMichael Katz ✉\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nJudge Blocks Trans Women Sent to Men’s Prisons\n\nHouse Passes Ban on Trans Athletes in Women’s Sports\n\n© 2025 Newsmax.

White House budget office","text":"By STEPHEN GROVES\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed Russell Vought as White House budget director on Thursday night, putting an official who has planned the zealous expansion of President Donald Trump’s power into one of the most influential positions in the federal government.\n\nThe Thursday night vote came after Democrats had exhausted their only remaining tool to stonewall a nomination — holding the Senate floor throughout the previous night and day with a series of speeches where they warned Vought was Trump’s “most dangerous nominee.”\n\n“Confirming the most radical nominee, who has the most extreme agenda, to the most important agency in Washington,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech. “Triple-header of disaster for hardworking Americans.”\n\nVought’s return to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which he also helmed during Trump’s first term, puts him in a role that often goes under the public radar yet holds key power in implementing the president’s goals. The OMB acts as a nerve center for the White House, developing its budget, policy priorities and agency rule-making. Vought has already played an influential role in Trump’s effort to remake the federal government as one of the architects of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term.\n\nThe budget office is also already shaking up federal spending. It had issued a memo to freeze federal spending, sending schools, states and nonprofits into a panic before it was rescinded amid legal challenges.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans have stayed in line to advance Vought’s nomination and argued that his mindset will be crucial to slashing federal spending and regulations.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune pushed for his confirmation this week, saying he “will have the chance to address two key economic issues — cutting burdensome government regulations and addressing excessive spending.”\n\nVought has often advanced a maximalist approach to conservative policy goals. After leaving the first Trump administration, he founded the Center for Renewing America, part of a constellation of Washington think tanks that have popped up to advance and develop Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. From that position, Vought often counseled congressional Republicans to wage win-at-all-costs fights to cut federal programs and spending.\n\nWriting in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, Vought described the White House budget director’s job “as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President’s mind.”\n\nThe OMB, he declared, “is a President’s air-traffic control system” and should be “involved in all aspects of the White House policy process,” becoming “powerful enough to override implementing agencies’ bureaucracies.”\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Vought pushed to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as political appointees, which could then enable mass dismissals.\n\nVought has also been a proponent of the president using “impoundment” to expand the executive branch’s control over federal spending.\n\nWhen Congress passes appropriations to fulfill its Constitutional duties, it determines funding for government programs. But the impoundment legal theory holds that the president can decide not to spend that money on anything he deems unnecessary because Article II of the Constitution gives the president the role of executing the laws that Congress passes.\n\nDuring confirmation hearings, Vought stressed that he would follow the law but avoided answering Democrats’ questions on whether he would withhold congressionally allotted aid for Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats charged that Vought’s responses amounted to an acknowledgment that he believes the president is above the law.\n\nIn response to questions from Republican lawmakers, Vought did preview potential budget proposals that would target cuts to discretionary social programs.\n\n“The president ran on the issue of fiscal accountability, dealing with our inflation situation,” he said.\n\nVought has also unabashedly advanced “ Christian nationalism,” an idea rising in the GOP that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and the government should now be infused with Christianity.\n\nIn a 2021 opinion article, Vought wrote that Christian nationalism is “a commitment to an institutional separation between church and state, but not the separation of Christianity from its influence on government and society.”","summary":"Vought was confirmed on a party-line vote of 53-47.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/06/project-2025-russell-vought-confirmed-white-house-budget-office/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Senate_Budget_82552.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 00:01:58","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.151},{"id":287891598,"title":"Senate confirms Project 2025 architect Russell Vought to lead powerful White House budget office","text":"By STEPHEN GROVES\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed Russell Vought as White House budget director on Thursday night, putting an official who has planned the zealous expansion of President Donald Trump’s power into one of the most influential positions in the federal government.\n\nThe Thursday night vote came after Democrats had exhausted their only remaining tool to stonewall a nomination — holding the Senate floor throughout the previous night and day with a series of speeches where they warned Vought was Trump’s “most dangerous nominee.”\n\n“Confirming the most radical nominee, who has the most extreme agenda, to the most important agency in Washington,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech. “Triple-header of disaster for hardworking Americans.”\n\nVought’s return to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which he also helmed during Trump’s first term, puts him in a role that often goes under the public radar yet holds key power in implementing the president’s goals.

Brandon Gill, R-Texas, and CNN host Pamela Brown got into a heated exchange over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk's inquiries into government spending on Thursday. \"What specifically is Elon Musk is actually doing within the federal government right now with his tech staffers in the name of DOGE?,\" Brown started off the exchange by asking the GOP lawmaker. Gill responded by pointing out that the work DOGE is doing, at the behest of President Donald Trump, was mandated by the American people when a majority voted for him in the 2024 election. DOGE TARGETS MEDICARE AGENCY, LOOKING FOR FRAUD \"Well, the American people delivered President Trump a very clear mandate to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. And, you know, let me tell you, we have been talking about bringing Elon Musk in for months and months and months now. I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to act as if this is something novel, as if this is something that‘s unexpected. This is part of the Trump mandate. Getting rid of wasteful spending,\" he said. Back in November, Trump said that Musk, through DOGE, will work to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies.\" The CNN anchor continued to press Gill on the specifics of what Musk and his staffers are working on, while also questioning what government systems they have access to and what they plan on doing with the confidential data they are collecting. \"Elon Musk and his team are not acting as outside advisors. They are acting as employees of the relevant federal agencies. They have security clearances. They‘re complying with applicable federal laws,\" he responded. \"So they’re doing this entirely above board.\" AFTER DOGE CRACKDOWN ON USAID, TRUMP'S HOUSE ALLIES WANT THIS CABINET AGENCY ON CHOPPING BLOCK He also pointed to some example of spending that he considers wasteful that DOGE has uncovered . \"You saw a great example of this with what Elon Musk has been doing with USAID, for instance. He uncovered that we have been sending millions of dollars for transgender activism in South America, millions of dollars for DEI scholarships in Burma. These are things that the American people largely didn‘t know about until now, and we’re going after them,\" Gill said. Brown then moved onto a different concern she had. House Republicans blocking a subpoena against Musk on Wednesday. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Gill labeled the subpoena \"political theatrics,\" and questioned why Democrats didn't invite Musk to the Oversight Committee's hearing yesterday. \"They could have invited Elon Musk. Then, once the committee began, they demanded that chairman Comer invite Elon Musk whenever they could have done it to begin with. And then they began this partisan political game of trying to subpoena Elon Musk. This is pure theatrics. Democrats can play political games, but Republicans are focused on rooting out waste, fraud and abuse from our federal government and doing real substantive work to save American taxpayer dollars,\" Gill said. Gill also claimed that the federal government is spending \"over $500 million every single year to fund state-sponsored media like NPR and PBS to promote left-wing values that are utterly antithetical to the American experience.\" \"It's journalism,\" the CNN host quipped back, adding, \"we can agree to disagree on that.

Eisenhower","text":"Americans expecting a hero's farewell speech—the kind that General Douglas MacArthur gave at West Point one year later—were surprised by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's final address from the Oval Office on January 17, 1961, which lasted a mere 10 minutes. It would take a man of his military standing and experience—he led America and her allies to victory as supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe in World War II—to deliver what would become known as the military-industrial complex speech.But Eisenhower, who'd just completed two terms leading the world's largest economy, military force and military budget, didn't just set his sights on the Pentagon. He issued similar warnings, and expressed similar worries, about two other segments of our economy where large corporate interests and big government contracts converged: science and technology.Much has been written about Eisenhower's fear of the military-industrial complex but little about the latter. Indeed, little to nothing has been written about Eisenhower's prophetic warning about government capture by our scientific and technological elites, an issue that would propel President Donald Trump to victory and begin a top-to-bottom review of government waste, fraud and abuse. And a review of the contracting and procurement process itself, with the advent of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Trump and led by one of the world's greatest technology, data and engineering minds: Elon Musk.Ike started his short farewell speech with some broad and positive strokes:Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. But it didn't take long for Eisenhower to set up the broader theme of his speech, which was his sensible fear of ever-growing federal bureaucracies, especially those designed to solve our nation's ills or crises.In meeting them...there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research—these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel.Eisenhower was just getting started, and his words that follow resonate more today than they did six decades ago.But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs, balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped-for advantage, balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable, balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual, balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration. The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of stress and threat. But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. I mention two only.Eisenhower, no peacenik, then began the better-known part of his speech aimed at our military spending and preparedness—and the ever-growing scale of both.This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.Then came the part of the speech few Americans today know anything about—but should. Ike turned his attention to the revolution occurring in America's scientific and technology sectors.In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by or at the direction of, the federal government. Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.And then came Eisenhower's prophetic warning about American public policy being held hostage by America's scientific and technology elites.The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.Few called into question Eisenhower's national defense bona fides as he called for a national dialogue and review of our nation's defense spending. Critics hell-bent on passing off Ike's concerns as endangering our national defense would have seen their remarks fall on deaf ears.Many media critics are attacking the upside-down review of America's biggest and smallest federal bureaucracies by Musk and his band of data and engineering geeks, but they are precisely the kinds of people predisposed to find such waste, fraud, abuse and regulatory and government capture. And government corruption too.Indeed, Musk and his team are doing the very job America's press should have been doing over the past 50 years: uncovering government waste, fraud, abuse and regulatory capture. Rather than serve the public, as the Fourth Estate should, many in the media have become defenders of the state and its vast and complex powers.The fact is, Americans on the left, right and in between should be cheering on the work DOGE is doing on our behalf. Our nation's companies and families do the very same work each and every day in boardrooms and at kitchen tables alike. We routinely analyze our allocation of resources, figuring out how best to trim our costs, adjust budgets and renegotiate contracts with vendors and contractors we do business with. Or drop them altogether.In the coming weeks and months, Americans should ignore the critics screaming the loudest about how Musk and his team are destroying the fabric of our government. Many of them have the most to lose, from funding sources to raw political power.It's \"We the People\" who have the most to gain from Trump's efforts with DOGE. And our government institutions too.","summary":"In his military-industrial complex speech, Eisenhower didn't just target the Pentagon.

Ms Slater, 49, alluded to Mr Trump's announcement the United States intends to \"take over and own\" the Gaza Strip, suggesting all Palestinians should be relocated from the conflict-afflicted territory into \"a beautiful area\".\n\nThe Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Lothian described what she believes is the \"full horror\" of Mr Trump's \"ethnic cleansing\" and \"erasing of a state\" in the State of Palestine.\n\nSpeaking on the topical debate show, this week held in Glasgow, Ms Slater said: \"Ethnic cleansing doesn't capture the full horror of trying to erase a state, to erase people and that is after 15 months of bombardment, in which their homes have been laid to rumble. About half of the 45,000 deaths were women and children, who were held collectively responsible for the heinous atrocities that Hamas committed.\n\n\"During that bombardment, they had water withheld, food withheld, medical care withheld from them. Now they are being told Donald Trump is going to remove Palestine from the map entirely, remove Palestinians from Palestine so that he and his billionaire pals can build a resort! I think the sensible question is not only 'Who elected Donald Trump' but 'Who elected Elon Musk?'\"\n\nThe audience clapped as the politician, former Minister for Green Skills, Circular Economy and Biodiversity in the Scottish Government, made the swipe at Mr Trump and Mr Musk's ruse.\n\nMr Trump, 78, would \"violate international law\" with the move, an expert told the Mirror this week. Inderjeet Parmar, professor of International Politics at the City, University of London, said: \"President Trump by speaking about Gaza as in need of 'cleaning up' has raised the spectre of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians – the mass removal of the population – which is a violation of international law. He’s effectively ramped up a process supported by the Biden administration that enabled the Israeli state’s war on Gaza since October 2023.\"\n\nIt was an opinion echoed by Ms Slater whose rant was followed on the show by further anger about Mr Trump. Newspaper columnist Alex Massie called the US President a \"showman\" but Scottish Conservatives' Russell Findlay stressed \"diplomacy goes a long way\" when working with Mr Trump - or the UK will face detrimental consequences. \n\nHe added: \"Donald Trump does bear grudges and he does listen to what people say about him, and we have to be conscious of the fact that he is on the rampage in respect of tariffs. There is a very real chance he might seek to apply tariffs on the United Kingdom and that could potentially have a great impact on Scottish jobs, diectly in relation to the Scotch whisky industry...

Is a Win for Autocrats Everywhere","text":"We are witnessing one of the worst and most costly foreign policy blunders in U.S. history. Less than three weeks into Donald Trump’s second term, he, Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have halted the U.S. Agency for International Development’s aid programs around the world. In so doing, they have imperiled millions of lives, thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars of investment in American small businesses and farms while severely undermining our national security and global influence — all while authoritarians and extremists celebrate their luck.\n\nI am shocked by the gleeful assault perpetrated by our own government against U.S.A.I.D.’s programs and the public servants who work on them. But after running the agency for four years, I am not surprised that the attacks are being cheered by Moscow and Beijing. They understand what those seeking to dismantle the agency are desperate to hide from the American people: U.S.A.I.D. has become America’s superpower in a world defined by threats that cross borders and amid growing strategic competition.\n\nThe assistance provided by U.S.A.I.D. comes in many forms, and with a budget of less than 1 percent of the U.S. government’s overall annual spending, it, alone, is no panacea for the world’s major challenges. Like all government agencies, it could be more efficient, and making it so was an effort I spearheaded during my tenure. Yet for much of the world population, the investments and work of U.S.A.I.D. make up the primary (and often only) contact with the United States.\n\nSome investments save lives almost immediately — like the medicines dispensed to 500,000 children with H.I.V., or the nutrient-rich food manufactured in states like Rhode Island and Georgia that pulls starving children from the brink of death. Out of the $38 billion that U.S.A.I.D. spent in fiscal year 2023, nearly $20 billion was for health programs (such as those that combat malaria, tuberculosis, H.I.V./AIDS and infectious disease outbreaks) and humanitarian assistance to respond to emergencies and help stabilize war-torn regions. Other U.S.A.I.D. investments are less visible but pay dividends in the longer term, such as giving girls a chance to get an education and enter the work force, or growing local economies.","summary":"The attacks on the agency are cruel and counterproductive.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/opinion/usaid-trump-samantha-power.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/06/multimedia/06Power-hfmp/06Power-hfmp-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 23:55:19","author":"Samantha Power","authors":["Samantha Power"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049},{"id":287889028,"title":"Is DOGE a cybersecurity threat? A security expert explains the dangers of violating protocols and regulations that protect government computer systems","text":"The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), President Donald Trump’s special commission tasked with slashing federal spending, continues to disrupt Washington and the federal bureaucracy. According to published reports, its teams are dropping into federal agencies with a practically unlimited mandate to reform the federal government in accordance with recent executive orders.\n\nAs a 30-year cybersecurity veteran, I find the activities of DOGE thus far concerning. Its broad mandate across government, seemingly nonexistent oversight, and the apparent lack of operational competence of its employees have demonstrated that DOGE could create conditions that are ideal for cybersecurity or data privacy incidents that affect the entire nation.\n\nTraditionally, the purpose of cybersecurity is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information and information systems while helping keep those systems available to those who need them. But in DOGE’s first few weeks of existence, reports indicate that its staff appears to be ignoring those principles and potentially making the federal government more vulnerable to cyber incidents. \n\nTechnical competence\n\nCybersecurity and information technology, like any other business function, depend on employees trained specifically for their jobs. Just as you wouldn’t let someone only qualified in first aid to perform open heart surgery, technology professionals require a baseline set of credentialed education, training and experience to ensure that the most qualified people are on the job.\n\nCurrently, the general public, federal agencies and Congress have little idea who is tinkering with the government’s critical systems. DOGE’s hiring process, including how it screens applicants for technical, operational or cybersecurity competency, as well as experience in government, is opaque. And journalists investigating the backgrounds of DOGE employees have been intimidated by the acting U.S. attorney in Washington. \n\nDOGE has hired young people fresh out of – or still in – college or with little or no experience in government, but who reportedly have strong technical prowess. But some have questionable backgrounds for such sensitive work. And one leading DOGE staffer working at the Treasury Department has since resigned over a series of racist social media posts.\n\nAccording to reports, these DOGE staffers have been granted administrator-level technical access to a variety of federal systems. These include systems that process all federal payments, including Social Security, Medicare and the congressionally appropriated funds that run the government and its contracting operations.\n\nDOGE operatives are quickly developing and deploying major software changes to very complex old systems and databases, according to reports. But given the speed of change, it’s likely that there is little formal planning or quality control involved to ensure such changes don’t break the system. Such actions run contrary to cybersecurity principles and best practices for technology management.\n\nAs a result, there’s probably no way of knowing if these changes make it easier for malware to be introduced into government systems, if sensitive data can be accessed without authorization, or if DOGE’s work is making government systems otherwise more unstable and more vulnerable. \n\nIf you don’t know what you’re doing in IT, really bad things can happen. A notable example is the failed launch of the healthcare.gov website in 2013. In the case of the Treasury Department’s systems, that’s fairly important to remember as the nation careens toward another debt-ceiling crisis and citizens look for their Social Security payments. \n\nOn Feb. 6, 2025, a federal judge ordered that DOGE staff be restricted to read-only access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems, but the legal proceedings challenging the legality of their access to government IT systems are ongoing.\n\nDOGE email servers\n\nDOGE’s apparent lack of cybersecurity competence is reflected in some of its first actions. DOGE installed its own email servers across the federal government to facilitate direct communication with rank-and-file employees outside official channels, disregarding time-tested best practices for cybersecurity and IT administration. A lawsuit by federal employees alleges that these systems did not undergo a security review as required by current federal cybersecurity standards. \n\nThere is an established process in the federal government to configure and deploy new systems to ensure they are stable, secure and unlikely to create cybersecurity problems. But DOGE ignored those practices, with predictable results. \n\nFor example, a journalist was able to send invitations to his newsletter to over 13,000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees through one of these servers. In another case, the way in which employee responses to DOGE’s Fork in the Road buyout offer to federal employees are collected could easily be manipulated by someone with malicious intent – a simple social engineering attack could wrongly end a worker’s employment. And DOGE staff members reportedly are connecting their own untrusted devices to government networks, which potentially introduces new ways for cyberattackers to penetrate sensitive systems. \n\nHowever, DOGE appears to be embracing creative cybersecurity practices in shielding itself. It’s reorganizing its internal communications in order to dodge Freedom of Information Act requests into its work, and it’s using cybersecurity techniques for tracking insider threats to prevent and investigate leaks of its activities.\n\nLacking management controls\n\nBut it’s not just technical security that DOGE is ignoring. On Feb. 2, two security officials for the U.S. Agency for International Development resisted granting a DOGE team access to sensitive financial and personnel systems until their identities and clearances were verified, in accordance with federal requirements. Instead, the officials were threatened with arrest and placed on administrative leave, and DOGE’s team gained access. \n\nThe Trump administration also has reclassified federal chief information officers, normally senior career employees with years of specialized knowledge, to be general employees subject to dismissal for political reasons. So there may well be a brain drain of IT talent in the federal government, or a constant turnover of both senior IT leadership and other technical experts. This change will almost certainly have ramifications for cybersecurity.\n\nDOGE operatives now have direct access to the Office of Personnel Management’s database of millions of federal employees, including those with security clearances holding sensitive positions. Without oversight, this access opens up the possibilities of privacy violations, tampering with employment records, intimidation or political retribution.\n\nSupport from all levels of management is crucial to provide accountability for cybersecurity and technology management. This is especially important in the public sector, where oversight and accountability is a critical function of good democratic governance and national security. After all, if people don’t know what you’re doing, they don’t know what you’re doing wrong.\n\nAt the moment, DOGE appears to be operating with very little oversight by anyone in position willing or able to hold it responsible for its actions.\n\nMitigating the damage\n\nCareer federal employees trying to follow legal or cybersecurity practices for federal systems and data are now placed in a difficult position. They either capitulate to DOGE staffers’ instructions, thereby abandoning best practices and ignoring federal standards, or resist them and run the risk of being fired or disciplined.\n\nThe federal government’s vast collections of data touch every citizen and company. While government systems may not be as trustworthy as they once were, people can still take steps to protect themselves from adverse consequences of DOGE’s activities. Two good starting points are to lock your credit bureau records in case your government data is disclosed and using different logins and passwords on federal websites to conduct business.\n\nIt’s crucial for the administration, Congress and the public to recognize the cybersecurity dangers that DOGE’s activities pose and take meaningful steps to bring the organization under reasonable control and oversight.","summary":"News reports paint a frightening picture of DOGE staff trampling time-tested – and in many cases legally required – management and security

the federal government’s outrageous spending draws the Trump administration’s hugely deserved scrutiny, one of this week’s many scandals is that We the Taxpayers have been shelling out millions to buy bureaucrats subscriptions to left-leaning media sources.\n\nYet as offensive as these expenditures are — and as grotesque as is the appearance of government rewarding its friendly propagandists with our money — it’s just a footnote to a far graver and more consequential scandal: That the feds have showered incalculably greater benefits on de facto regime media outlets by seeking to systematically suppress conservative and independent competitors through the Censorship-Industrial Complex.\n\nTo be sure, it’s perverse that (per USASpending.gov), we’ve forked over $8.2 million over the last 12 months across a bevy of agencies — including for pricey premium subscription services — to Politico, the chosen conduit for the notorious letter from 51 former intelligence officials seeking to discredit The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story for the benefit of then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nLikewise the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year lavished on The New York Times, rewarded with a Pulitzer for unquestioningly printing the leaks and lies fed to it by government officials to spin up the Russiagate hoax .\n\nSame goes for the Associated Press, which raked in more than $600,000 in taxpayer cash over the last year, and well over $10 million from 2021 onward.\n\nSimply put, the American people should not be on the hook for news subscriptions to biased sources, or arguably to any sources at all.\n\nFor those in conservative and independent media, these payments to competitors just add insult to injury. \n\nAs has been revealed over the last eight years, the feds have leveraged the power of the government — and hundreds of millions of dollars in government funding — to pressure social-media companies to purge disfavored news and views, and crush the business models of the conservative and independent media companies producing them.\n\nSeeking to cancel en masse competing media companies through censorship, shadow-banning and cutting off the ad revenue that is their lifeblood provided a benefit worth many multiples of the funds taxpayers have been doling out to favored media outlets.\n\nThe unspoken quid pro quo is that these outlets will faithfully attack conservative and independent media, serve as witting conduits for government officials to run information operations via leaks and lies and refuse to lay a glove on the political establishment that butters their bread.\n\nOn top of all that, for conservative and independent media outlets, sums like the $8 million Politico payout is the cherry on top of this broader government-media scandal.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are getting a window into USAID’s funding of media entities abroad, sometimes in service of regime-change efforts.\n\nReporters Without Borders, a Paris-based non-governmental organization, reported that Congress allocated $268,376,000 for 2025 for “training … for 6,200 journalists, assist[ing] 707 non-state news outlets, and support[ing] 279 media-sector civil society organizations dedicated to strengthening independent media” to bolster “the free flow of information.”\n\nBeyond the question of whether this work actually serves the national interest, the feds have lost the benefit of the doubt: We cannot assume that such initiatives are all above board, and neither wasteful nor potentially nefarious.\n\nStories like one recently reported by Michael Shellenberger and Alex Gutentag in the Public substack is one reason they have lost our trust. They found that at least one purportedly independent but actually US government-funded and -directed outlet, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, created critical “research” that was cited in the so-called CIA whistleblower complaint used to generate the first impeachment of Donald Trump.\n\nSickeningly, it appears our own government used derogatory information generated from a putatively foreign outlet — one allegedly responsible for taking down political figures abroad — to try to topple a duly elected US president here at home.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the feds have in myriad ways been monkeying with our First Amendment through co-opting and colluding with friendly media that do its bidding in service of its power.\n\nTrump started to right that wrong with his Day 1 executive order launching a missile at the Censorship-Industrial Complex, prohibiting the government from any further participation.\n\nHis orders to freeze the Politico funding, and on Thursday to cut “every single media contract,” represents the next leg of an effort to restore our freedom of speech by further separating the media and the state.\n\nBenjamin Weingarten is a contributor at RealClearInvestigations.","summary":"The American people should not be on the hook for news subscriptions to biased sources, or arguably to any sources at all.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/opinion/feds-8m-politico-payout-is-dcs-reward-for-lapdog-media/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/2012-remaining-track-exceed-1-34783548.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 23:54:17","author":"Benjamin Weingarten","authors":["Benjamin Weingarten"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133}]}
