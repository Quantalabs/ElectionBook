Now, after Centuries, it is time for Denmark to give back — World Peace is at stake! China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it. They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently. Only the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!Nobody will touch this sacred piece of Land, especially since the National Security of the United States, and the World at large, is at stake. On top of everything else, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown. This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet. These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question. Starting on February 1st, 2026, all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland), will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America. On June 1st, 2026, the Tariff will be increased to 25%. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland. The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years.Many Presidents have tried, and for good reason, but Denmark has always refused. Now, because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important. Hundreds of Billions of Dollars are currently being spent on Security Programs having to do with “The Dome,” including for the possible protection of Canada, and this very brilliant, but highly complex system can only work at its maximum potential and efficiency, because of angles, metes, and bounds, if this Land is included in it.The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/trump-slaps-tariffs-on-8-european-nations-over-dangerous-game-on-greenland-takeover-plan-full-statement-11768670875086.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/17/1600x900/logo/USA-TRUMP--46_1768454357605_1768454381550_1768676907322.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 19:10:11","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.088},{"id":393890616,"title":"Trump tariffs LIVE: Macron denounces tariff threat to EU nations over Greenland: ‘No intimidation will influence us'","text":"Trump tariffs news LIVE: President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to roll out escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is permitted to acquire Greenland, intensifying tensions over the future of the Danish Arctic territory.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an additional 10% import duty would be imposed from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and Great Britain, all of which are already facing tariffs introduced by his administration.He added that these tariffs would rise to 25% starting June 1 and would remain in place until an agreement is reached allowing the US to acquire Greenland.According to Reuters, Trump has repeatedly argued that Greenland is crucial to US national security due to its strategic position and vast mineral resources, and has not ruled out the use of force to take control of the island.

He didn’t elaborate. JPMorgan didn’t immediately respond to a weekend request for comment.Trump claimed in August that JPMorgan “discriminated against me very badly” when he alleged the bank asked him to close accounts he held for decades, an action he believes was connected to his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the 2021 certification of President Joe Biden’s victory. The bank later said it’s facing reviews, investigations and legal proceedings tied to the Trump administration’s fight against “debanking.”Dimon said earlier this week he wouldn’t consider being the Fed chair.In response to a question Thursday at a US Chamber of Commerce event about whether he’d consider taking over the central bank, Dimon said, “Chairman of the Fed, I’d put in the absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.” As for running the Treasury, “I would take the call,” he said.Trump has not yet said who he will nominate to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term as Chair ends in May. Trump said Friday he has a pick in his mind but declined to identify them.Dimon’s comments follow a public back-and-forth between Dimon and Trump earlier this week over the president’s attacks on the Fed, including criminal subpoenas issued by the Justice Department over the renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Dimon said Tuesday that chipping away at Fed independence is “not a great idea,” and could lead to higher inflation and interest rates over time.Dimon has pushed back in the past against attempts by Trump’s allies to suggest that the bank’s customer decisions are biased.“We do not debank people’s religious or political affiliations,” Dimon told Fox Business in December.With assistance from Tony Czuczka.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/trump-blasts-dimon-threatens-to-sue-jp-morgan-over-debanking-11768674874669.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_2_1733465085102_1733465089141.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 18:34:34","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.578},{"id":393890614,"title":"Gaza ‘Board of Peace’ Takes Shape as Israel Raises Concern","text":"Donald Trump’s so-called Board of Peace for Gaza is beginning to take shape with Argentina’s Javier Milei and Canada’s Mark Carney set to become founding members, even as Israel voiced rare objections against parts of the US president’s plan to build on the fragile ceasefire in the region. The Argentine leader on Saturday thanked Trump for the invitation, saying it would be an honor to join. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also invited to be a founding member of the council, the head of his communications office said on X, while AFP reported that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi was mulling whether to take part. They would be joined by Carney, who has accepted the offer to participate, a senior Canadian official has said. But on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized plans for a committee underneath the Board of Peace, saying it hadn’t been coordinated with Israel.“The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. “The Prime Minister has instructed the Foreign Affairs Minister to contact the US Secretary of State on this matter.”On Friday, the White House announced a first executive panel that would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair before the formation of the overall board. It also appointed a second executive committee, which is expected to do the bulk of the work in remaking Gaza and that includes the Turkish foreign minister and a diplomat from Qatar. The second panel is the one objected to by Netanyahu, which considers those countries as too close to Hamas and unlikely to remake the coastal strip as Israel wants. It’s a rare open disagreement to Trump from the Israeli leader, who has consistently sought to portray his relationship with the US president as one of unity and full coordination. In the invitation shared by Milei, Trump wrote that the effort “will bring together a distinguished group of nations ready to shoulder the noble responsibility of building LASTING PEACE, an Honor reserved for those prepared to lead by example, and brilliantly invest in a secure and prosperous future for generations to come.” The partners are set to convene “in the near future,” he added.Trump is trying to deliver on his 20-point plan for a sweeping and potentially decades-long transformation of Gaza, which has been largely destroyed over two years of war between Israel and Hamas. He announced the formation of the board on Thursday on social media, but didn’t say who was on it. “I can say with certainty that it is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” he said at the time. As Hamas still retains control of almost half of Gaza and refuses to disarm, the prospect of a durable and prosperous peace is uncertain. The Iran-backed group is still to return the remains of the last hostage taken during the October 2023 attacks that triggered the conflict, a critical part of the first phase of the Trump proposal.Despite Israeli misgivings about the sequencing, the Trump administration this week announced the launch of the second phase, including the formation of a 15-member technocrat government to replace Hamas rule in Gaza. At the same time, the White House sent out invitations to prospective Board of Peace constituents. The board’s chief executive officer, Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, was earlier tapped for the role. An International Stabilization Force, made up of soldiers from different nations that’s also part of the Trump plan, is slated to follow at a later date. For now, it’s unclear which countries might contribute personnel and on what terms. The US will lead from the rear, having announced that it won’t put boots on the ground in Gaza.Israel has threatened to resume the war if the ISF fails to persuade or compel Hamas to lay down its weapons. The militant group has shown no inclination to do so since the ceasefire was agreed to in mid-October. Still, the Trump administration has signaled determination to achieve “full demilitarization” of the entire Gaza Strip.With assistance from Ugur Yilmaz, Valentine Baldassari, Angela Cullen and Jonathan Gilbert.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/gaza-board-of-peace-takes-shape-as-israel-raises-concern-11768674689568.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/17/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1768674692177.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 18:31:29","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.24},{"id":393937264,"title":"Board of Peace for Gaza is forming with ambitions for a wider mandate of other conflicts","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace,\" which was initially seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, is taking shape with ambitions to have a far broader mandate of other global crises, potentially rivaling the United Nations in what would be a major upheaval to the post-World War II international order.\n\n FILE - US envoy Steve Witkoff, left, and US businessman Jared Kushner attend a press conference after the signing of the declaration on deploying post-ceasefire force in Ukraine during the 'Coalition of the Willing' summit on security guarantees for Ukraine, at the Elysee Palace in Paris, Tuesday, Jan 6, 2026. (Ludovic Marin, Pool photo via AP, File)\n\nIn letters sent Friday to various world leaders inviting them to be \"founding members\" of the board, Trump says the body would \"embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict.\"\n\nInvitation letters from Trump to Argentine President Javier Milei and Paraguay's leader Santiago Peña, that were posted Saturday to their official social media accounts note that Trump's 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan, which includes the creation of the Board of Peace, was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council and indicates that the panel of world leaders may not confine their work to Gaza.\n\n\"Now it is time to turn all of these dreams into reality,\" Trump wrote. \"At the heart of the plan is the Board of Peace, the most impressive and consequential board ever assembled, which will be established as a new International Organization and Transitional Governing Administration.\"\n\nOther leaders whose governments have confirmed receiving invitation letters include Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. It was not immediately clear how many or which other leaders would receive invitations.\n\nTrump's apparent aspirations to turn to the Board of Peace into an international institution that could provide an alternative to the United Nations is sure to be controversial and opposed by numerous countries, including China and Russia, which hold veto power in the U.N. Security Council and have significant interests in opposing any radical change in the world order.\n\nSmaller nations are also likely to have objections as the U.N. system has given them at least a voice in major international decisions since the end of the Second World War.\n\n\"This is a U.S. shortcut in an attempt to wield its veto power on world affairs,\" Daniel Forti, head of U.N. affairs at the International Crisis Group, said. \"It allows the U.S. to really take the role it has on the Gaza-Israel file, where it's able to shape things to its will and try to extend that to other conflicts.\"\n\nHe added that this idea \"would give world leaders involved a sort of mechanism to try and sidestep longstanding agreements around sovereignty and territorial integrity in exchange for transactional deals.\"\n\nA senior U.S. official said an expanded role for the Board of Peace remains \"aspirational\" but that Trump and his advisers believe it is possible, particularly as the U.S. and others have repeatedly expressed frustration with the United Nations and its associated organizations, commissions and advisory boards.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal Trump administration thinking, did not say the Board of Peace is intended to replace the United Nations but suggested that it could perhaps galvanize the world body into action.\n\nThe Trump administration has often been at odds with the United Nations as it zeroed in on eliminating billions of dollars in funding to international organizations and humanitarian assistance at large. Trump and his allies have blasted the world body for not reaching its potential and for \"bloated\" and redundant agencies that push \"woke\" ideology.\n\nThe letters follow Trump's post on social media Thursday, saying the Board of Peace had been formed and that the names of its members would be announced \"shortly.\" Officials say a formal announcement is expected to be made next week during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIt comes after the White House on Friday evening released the names of some of the leaders who will play a role in overseeing next steps in Gaza, including an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace. Israel's government objected Saturday, saying it \"was not coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy.\n\nThat executive committee includes Trump administration officials Secretary of State Marco Rubio and envoy Steve Witkoff as well as businesspeople like Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and others like former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and World Bank President Ajay Banga.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday on Trump's ambitions for the Board of Peace nor the letters posted by leaders. The United Nations also did not immediately respond.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/18/board-of-peace-for-gaza-is-forming-with-ambitions-for-a-wider-mandate-of-other-conflicts","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/images/2026/01/18/72580.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 08:21:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.15},{"id":393932818,"title":"Justice Ministry proposes new courthouses for some parishes after Melissa damage","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe damaged roof of the Westmoreland Circuit Court, which is being housed in a section of the Westmoreland Parish Court (Photos: Anthony Lewis) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 17, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Justice Ministry proposes new courthouses for some parishes after Melissa damage \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Justice is proposing the construction of new courthouses in parishes where existing facilities were severely impacted by Hurricane Melissa.\n\nJustice Minister Delroy Chuck raised the issue during a ministerial statement in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.\n\n“Melissa has left a trail of destruction, mainly in the western end of the island. Three parish courts in Westmoreland, St Elizabeth and Trelawny were either totally or substantially damaged,” said Chuck. \n\nHe said at this stage, the ministry’s team will need to work in close collaboration with Chief Justice Bryan Sykes and his team to identify suitable locations.\n\n“The necessary allocation will be requested for these new constructions. I hasten to add that work is well underway for new courts in St Thomas, Manchester and St Catherine,” Chuck noted.\n\n“The work towards a first-class justice system continues. I look forward to the support of all stakeholders as we strive to make it a reality in the very near future,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the minister noted that the chief justice has again highlighted concerns regarding court infrastructure. He pointed out that there are 57 courts across Jamaica and that apart from the Supreme Court, the vast majority are more than a century old. \n\n“But for the effects of the devastating hurricane, most of them are in the best shape they have ever been,” he said.\n\nThis, Chuck said was because of “significant sums” spent for major renovation and improvement of some of these facilities.\n\n“In the last two financial years, we spent approximately $764 million,” he shared.\n\nSome of the courts that have seen marked improvement over the last two years include the St Catherine Parish Court (Linstead), Manchester Parish Court (Cross Keys), Clarendon Parish Court, Portland Parish Court (Bryan’s Bay) and the St Ann Family Court. \n\n“I would proudly practice in any of the courts across the country,” said Chuck while acknowledging that despite the “significant progress”, upgrading work is still needed in many courts across the island.\n\n-Lynford Simpson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Bryan Sykes courthouse Delroy Chuck Hurricane Melissa Ministry of Justice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Glasner feels ‘abandoned’ by Palace hierarchy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom -- Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner said on Saturday his players are being \"abandoned completely\" by the club's board afte... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Mary cabbie allegedly caught stealing from farm, charged \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n ST MARY, Jamaica — A taxi operator has been charged with larceny of produce following an incident at a farm in St Mary on Thursday, January 15.

(Photo: AFP) \n\n Latest News, Sports \n\nJanuary 17, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Glasner feels ‘abandoned’ by Palace hierarchy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom — Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner said on Saturday his players are being “abandoned completely” by the club’s board after the Eagles’ winless run stretched to 10 games with a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland.\n\nGlasner, who revealed on Friday he will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the season, had to cope without captain Marc Guehi with the centre-back set to join Manchester City.\n\nPalace also cashed in to sell Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in August and could reportedly lose star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta to Juventus before the end of the January transfer window.\n\nGlasner led Palace to their first major trophy by winning the FA Cup last season.\n\nHowever, their defence of the competition ended in embarrassing circumstances with defeat to sixth-tier Macclesfield last weekend.\n\nGlasner’s side have looked exhausted in recent weeks after already playing 34 times this season in four competitions.\n\nThe Austrian defended his players for their poor run as he put the blame on his superiors for not arming him with a stronger squad.\n\n“I feel we are being abandoned completely,” he told the BBC after the Sunderland defeat.\n\n“I can’t blame any player. They did everything they could and this has been going on for weeks and months now.\n\n“We have 12 or 13 players from the squad available and we feel no support.\n\n“The worst thing is selling our captain one day before playing a Premier League game.\n\n“We are preparing, it’s the first (full) week we are training since September, and then we are selling our captain one day before a game. So I have no understanding of this.”\n\nGlasner, 51, has been linked with taking over at Manchester United and Tottenham next season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Crystal Palace English Premier League Marc Guehi Oliver Glasner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Mary cabbie allegedly caught stealing from farm, charged \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n ST MARY, Jamaica — A taxi operator has been charged with larceny of produce following an incident at a farm in St Mary on Thursday, January 15.

(Photo: AFP) \n\n Latest News, Sports \n\nJanuary 17, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Carrick magic dents Man City title bid as Arsenal extend lead \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLONDON, United Kingdom — Michael Carrick made a flying start to life as Manchester United boss on Saturday, orchestrating victory against Manchester City as Arsenal tightened their grip on top spot despite a goalless draw at Nottingham Forest.\n\nSorry Tottenham slipped to defeat against relegation-threatened West Ham, further increasing the pressure on beleaguered boss Thomas Frank, while Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Burnley.\n\nThe early result at a bouncing Old Trafford — in Carrick’s first game at the start of his second spell in temporary charge of the Red Devils — left Pep Guardiola’s City seven points behind Arsenal.\n\nFormer United midfielder Carrick was appointed as head coach until the end of the campaign following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who was also briefly United’s caretaker boss in 2021, said ahead of his first game that there was still “magic” at United, and his team put on a memorable show in a 2-0 win that could easily have been much wider.\n\nSecond-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu capped a dominant display by United, who have had to play second fiddle to neighbours City for more than a decade.\n\n“Great start. No getting away from that,” said Carrick. “The boys were fantastic.”\n\n“Consistency is the key to any success,” he added. “If you could find that, then you’re onto a winner.”\n\nGuardiola admitted that his team — winless in four league games this year — were outplayed by Carrick’s inspired United.\n\n“The better team won,” said the City boss. “We weren’t at the level required to win this game.\n\n“In many departments, we weren’t there. They were better. They had an energy we didn’t have.”\n\nArsenal, facing Forest in the late kick-off, had the chance to pull nine points clear of Guardiola’s men but were held to a 0-0 draw at the City Ground.\n\nThe Gunners, chasing a first Premier League title since 2004, dominated the game but could not break the deadlock.\n\n– Spurs crisis –\n\nThe mood at Tottenham darkened further after Spurs slipped to a 2-1 defeat against West Ham, who had not won a Premier League match since early November.\n\nSpurs fans turned on Frank and chanted “you’re getting sacked in the morning” after Callum Wilson struck a stoppage-time winner.\n\nSpurs, 14th in the table, have now won just two of their league games at home this season, leaving Frank, in his first campaign in charge, under enormous pressure.\n\n“It’s tough to take, it hurts a lot,” the Spurs boss told Sky Sports. “The boys put everything in, and that’s a sign of a squad that is fighting, doing everything they can to try and win.\n\n“It’s fair to say, if there was to be a winner in the second half, then it should have been us.”\n\nNuno Espirito Santo’s West Ham finished the day five points behind Forest, who are just above the relegation zone.\n\nDefending champions Liverpool are now unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions but dropped two valuable points against struggling Burnley at Anfield.\n\nGermany midfielder Florian Wirtz scored his third league goal since his arrival but the visitors drew level in the 65th minute when Marcus Edwards placed his shot beyond the reach of Alisson Becker.\n\n“It feels like a defeat,” said Wirtz. “When we had so many shots and so many on target, I think we had to score more goals.\n\n“But some days are like this -– you try everything but in the end it doesn’t go in the goal. We only take one point but I can only say (in) the next game we go again and try to do better.”\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who replaced the departed Enzo Maresca earlier this month, watched as his side saw off high-flying London rivals Brentford 2-0.\n\nJoao Pedro gave the Blues the lead in the first half and Cole Palmer doubled the advantage from the spot in the 76th minute.\n\nSunderland beat Crystal Palace 2-1 while Leeds scored late on to beat Fulham 1-0, remaining eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Arsenal English Premier League Manchester City Manchester United Nottingham Forest \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kishane Thompson, Tia Clayton win 60m at Puma JAAA Fuller-Anderson Meet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n Olympic and World Championship silver medallist Kishane Thompson and World Championship relay silver medallist Tia Clayton won the 60m dash events at ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Higher food prices drive 1.3 per cent increase in December CPI, says STATIN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n The Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) is reporting that the All Jamaica Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2025 increased by 1.3 per cent... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Europe with tariffs over Greenland as protesters rally \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n PALM BEACH, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday escalated his quest to acquire Greenland, threatening multiple... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n UK-Caribbean Healthcare Mission strengthens UK-Jamaica partnership \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United Kingdom (UK) and Jamaica have strengthened their partnership in healthcare and regulatory cooperation following Jamaica... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manchester farmer charged following shooting incident \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica — A farmer has been charged following a shooting incident in Mandeville, Manchester, on Tuesday, January 6.

Why It Matters The nation has grown increasingly divided over the immigration operations carried out by the Trump administration through ICE, especially following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. Democratic governors have proposed or pursued various means by which they believe they can limit ICE in their state, usually by telling local law enforcement they are under no obligation to cooperate with federal authorities; meanwhile, Republican governors and lawmakers have insisted that ICE are pursuing lawful orders and that law enforcement and local governments should cooperate. RICHMOND, VIRGINIA - JANUARY 17: Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger signs executive orders after being sworn into office at the Virginia State Capitol January 17, 2026 in Richmond, Virginia. Spanberger is the first woman elected to the Commonwealth of Virginia’s highest office. The executive orders focused on affordability for residents of Virginia. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) What To Know Spanberger, who is the first woman to hold the office of governor in Virginia, was sworn into office on Saturday. She defeated Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, who had backing from President Donald Trump. Following her inauguration, Spanberger got right to work and signed Executive Order No. 10 (2026), which rescinded directives under Youngkin's Executive Order No. 47 (2025) that required and encouraged state and local law enforcement to “divert their limited resources for use in enforcing federal civil immigration laws,“ according to Spanberger's order. “Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor under Article V of the Constitution of Virginia and under the laws of the Commonwealth, I hereby rescind Executive Order No. 47 (2025), which is not an appropriate use of state or local resources,“ Spanberger wrote. The order is effective upon its signing, which was done by Spanberger and Secretary of the Commonwealth Jennifer B. Moon. What People Are Saying Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger at her inauguration: “As we write this next chapter, we will focus on the security and safety of all our neighbors. We we will take action to prevent gun violence, to support Virginians struggling with addiction, and to address the mental health crisis impacting our kids and our neighbors. And in Virginia, our hard working, law abiding immigrant neighbors will know that when we say that we will focus on the security and safety of all of our neighbors, we mean them too.” Washington Governor Bob Ferguson on X: “CNN found there were more ICE impersonation incidents in 2025 than the prior 4 presidential terms combined. It's not hard to see why. I requested a bill establishing that if you're not a law enforcement officer, you can't be wearing something that gives the impression you are.“ U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Friday: “When the Governor or the Mayor threaten our officers, when the Mayor suggests that he's encouraging citizens to call 911 when they see ICE officers, that is very close to a federal crime,“ adding, “If you impede the work we're doing... We're coming after you.“","summary":"Abigail Spanberger is the first woman elected to the office of governor in Virginia.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-repeals-ice-cooperation-order-virginia-youngkin-11377825","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256791372.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 01:25:13","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":393939006,"title":"Iran dubs Donald Trump a 'criminal' for supporting protests that killed 'thousands'","text":"significant casualties since unrest began on December 28 and devolved into a bloody crackdown at the hands of Iranian authorities. “In this revolt, the US President made remarks in person, encouraged seditious people to go ahead and said, ‘We do support you, we do support you militarily’,” Ayatollah Khamenei told his nation. He reiterated an accusation that the US seeks domination over Iran’s economic and political resources. “We do consider the US President a criminal, because of casualties and damages, because of accusations against the Iranian nation,” he said. He described the protesters as “foot soldiers” of the United States and said they had destroyed mosques and educational centres.\" He then went on to blame those involved in civil unrest as the cause of \"several thousand\" dead. “Through hurting people, they killed several thousand of them,” he said. The protests began in late December amid concerns about the dire economy, as the government moved to end currency subsidies that had helped to contain prices in the face of an inflation rate of about 40 per cent. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said on Wednesday that 2,435 protesters and 153 security personnel had been killed and more than 18,470 people had been arrested. Other reports have suggested the death toll may be as high as 10,000; the highest since chaos ensued in the 1979 revolution that led to at the current regime in Iran exceeding that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalling the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution. In response, Mr Trump called for an end to Ayatollah Khamenei’s nearly 40-year reign. “The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,” Mr Trump told Politico in an interview on Saturday. “His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.” “It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran.” The back-and-forth rhetoric came a day after Mr Trump sounded a conciliatory tone, saying that “Iran cancelled the hanging of over 800 people” and adding that “I greatly respect the fact that they cancelled”. He did not clarify who he spoke to in Iran to confirm the state of any planned executions. His comments were a sign he may be backing away from a military strike. In recent days, Mr Trump had told protesting Iranians that “ help is on the way” and that his administration would “act accordingly” if the killing of demonstrators continued or if Iranian authorities executed detained protesters. In his speech, Ayatollah Khamenei said rioters were armed with live ammunition that was imported from abroad, without naming any countries. “We do not plan, we do not take the country towards war. But we do not release domestic offenders, worse than domestic offenders, there are international offenders. We do not let them alone either,” he said, and urged officials to pursue the cases. Iran has returned to an uneasy calm after the harsh repression of protests that began on December 28 over its ailing economy.

The rate would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States, he said.\n\nThe Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security.\n\n“The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them,” Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nThe tariff threat could mark a problematic rupture between Trump and America’s longtime NATO partners, further straining an alliance that dates to 1949 and provides a collective degree of security to Europe and North America. Trump has repeatedly tried to use trade penalties to bend allies and rivals alike to his will, generating investment commitments from some nations and pushback from others, notably China.\n\nTrump is scheduled to travel on Tuesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he likely will run into the European leaders he just threatened with tariffs that would start in little more than two weeks.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Trump’s move was a “surprise” given the “constructive meeting” with top U.S. officials this week in Washington.\n\nThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said in a joint statement that tariffs “would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” They said Europe would remain “committed to upholding its sovereignty.”\n\nThere are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading, according to a European diplomat who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. It was unclear, too, how Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a U.S. Supreme Court challenge.\n\nTrump has long said he thinks the U.S. should own the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which has a population of about 57,000 and whose defense is provided by Denmark. He intensified his calls a day after the military operation to oust Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.\n\nThe president indicated the tariffs were retaliation for what appeared to be the deployment of s ymbolic levels of troops from the European countries to Greenland, which he has said was essential for the “Golden Dome” missile defense system for the U.S., He also has argued that Russia and China might try to take over the island.\n\nThe U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations to 200 at the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest of the island, the Danish foreign minister has said. That base supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.\n\nResistance has steadily built in Europe to Trump’s ambitions even as several countries on the continent agreed to his 15% tariffs last year in order to preserve an economic and security relationship with Washington.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, in a social media post, seemed to equate the tariff threat to Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“No intimidation or threats will influence us, whether in Ukraine, Greenland or anywhere else in the world when we are faced with such situations,” Macron said in a translated post on X.\n\n‘Important for the whole world’\n\nEarlier Saturday, hundreds of people in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, braved near-freezing temperatures, rain and icy streets to march in a rally in support of their own self-governance.\n\nThousands of people also marched through Copenhagen, many of them carrying Greenland’s flag. Some held signs with slogans such as “Make America Smart Again” and “Hands Off.”\n\n“This is important for the whole world,” Danish protester Elise Riechie told The Associated Press as she held Danish and Greenlandic flags. “There are many small countries. None of them are for sale.”\n\nThe rallies occurred hours after a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers, while visiting Copenhagen, sought to reassure Denmark and Greenland of their support.\n\nEuropean training exercises\n\nDanish Maj. Gen. Søren Andersen, leader of the Joint Arctic Command, told the AP that Denmark does not expect the U.S. military to attack Greenland, or any other NATO ally, and that European troops were recently deployed to Nuuk for Arctic defense training.\n\nHe said the goal is not to send a message to the Trump administration, even though the White House has not ruled out taking the territory by force.\n\n“I will not go into the political part, but I will say that I would never expect a NATO country to attack another NATO country,” he said from aboard a Danish military vessel docked in Nuuk. “For us, for me, it’s not about signaling. It is actually about training military units, working together with allies.”\n\nThe Danish military organized a planning meeting Friday in Greenland with NATO allies, including the U.S., to discuss Arctic security on the alliance’s northern flank in the face of a potential Russian threat. The Americans were also invited to participate in Operation Arctic Endurance in Greenland in the coming days, Andersen said.\n\nIn his 2½ years as a commander in Greenland, Andersen said that he hasn’t seen any Chinese or Russian combat vessels or warships, despite Trump saying that they were off the island’s coast.\n\nBut in the unlikely event of American troops using force on Danish soil, Andersen confirmed that Danish soldiers have an obligation to fight back.\n\n‘Almost no better’ ally to US than Denmark\n\nTrump has contended that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland and its vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. He said recently that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.”\n\nThe president has seen tariffs as a tool to get what he wants without having to resort to military actions. At the White House on Friday, he recounted how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals and he teased the possibility of doing so again.\n\n“I may do that for Greenland, too,” Trump said.\n\nAfter Trump followed through, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said “Congress must reclaim tariff authorities” so that they are not used solely at a president’s discretion.\n\nDenmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.\n\n“There is almost no better ally to the United States than Denmark,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., while visiting Copenhagen with other members of Congress. “If we do things that cause Danes to question whether we can be counted on as a NATO ally, why would any other country seek to be our ally or believe in our representations?”","summary":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.— President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to American control of Greenland, setting up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe.

Ratification is considered all but guaranteed in South America, where the agreement has broad support.Mercosur consists of the region's two biggest economies, Argentina and Brazil, as well as Paraguay and Uruguay. Bolivia, the bloc's newest member, can join the trade deal in the coming years. Venezuela has been suspended from the bloc and isn't included in the agreement.Promoted by South America’s renowned grass-fed cattle-raising countries and Europe’s industrial interests, the accord will gradually eliminate more than 90% of tariffs on goods ranging from Argentine beef to German cars, creating one of the world’s largest free trade zones and making shopping cheaper for more than 700 million consumers.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU’s executive branch, portrayed the deal as a bulwark against the disruptive policies of the Trump administration.“It reflects a clear and deliberate choice: We choose fair trade over tariffs. We choose a productive long-term partnership over isolation,” von der Leyen declared in an veiled rebuke of Trump at the ceremony, which got underway as Trump announced 10% tariffs on eight European nations over their opposition to American control of Greenland.“We will join forces like never before, because we believe that this is the best way to make our people and our countries prosper.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a long-time advocate for the EU-Mercocsur deal as negotiations lumbered through his three nonconsecutive terms, hailed the agreement as force for global cooperation.“At a time when unilateralism isolates markets and protectionism inhibits global growth, two regions that share democratic values and a commitment to multilateralism choose a different path,\" Lula said in an X post.But the decision by the deal's champion to skip the ceremony signaled simmering tensions between the trading blocs.“It leaves a bitter taste,” Paraguayan President Santiago Peña said of Lula's absence Saturday as he praised the Brazilian president's advocacy at a press conference.Brazil, which held the rotating presidency of Mercosur last year, was gearing up to host the signing ceremony last month when European countries called it off, demanding more concessions to farmers scared of a surge in cheap South American agricultural imports.Robbed of his spotlight, Lula was outraged at what was widely seen in South America as the latest example of the EU's bureaucratic intrusiveness.One of the main reasons the deal took so long to clinch was Brussels' attempts to manage South American agricultural production processes, from standards on deforestation regulation to plastic packaging, as European farmers complained they couldn't compete if their South American counterparts were held to lower standards for pesticide use and animal welfare.“The EU’s maximalist wish lists of demands from developing economies willing to sign free trade agreements are often perceived as patronizing,” said Agathe Demarais, a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations.After the accord incorporated environmental regulations, strict quotas on farm imports like beef and sugar and staggered timelines for tariff reductions, the EU sweetened the deal further for its farmers with a promise of hefty subsidies. That pushed agricultural powerhouse Italy across the line earlier this month.But even as the ink dried on Saturday, powerful protectionist lobbies in Europe were still hoping to prevent the agreement from clearing its main final hurdle: ratification by the European Parliament.France remains opposed to the accord, with President Emmanuel Macron worrying that farmers’ frustration with the EU could drive more voters to the country’s far right in the 2027 presidential election.In an interview, EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said he'd start lobbying Monday to get European Parliament members on board with the deal in hopes of seeing it passed in the first half of this year.“We'll have very intense communication with all the members on a group level, on an individual level,” Šefčovič told The Associated Press, expressing confidence that “everyone will do the procedures as quickly as possible so we can benefit from this historic achievement.”He didn't name Trump but, remarking on Saturday's coincidence between the U.S. president's latest tariff threats and the trade deal's signing, Šefčovič said the EU-Mercosur accord sent the message “that if someone prefers and believes in high tariffs and power politics, Mercosur and European countries representing more than 700 million people clearly believe in ... international law, predictability, certainty and the removing of trade barriers.”The deal is a sign of the bloc's revived relevance after years in which it was embroiled in political spats, undermined by economic crises and constrained by protectionist governments.Perhaps most striking is the enthusaism of Argentine President Javier Milei, a radical libertarian and admirer of Trump who shares the U.S. leader's contempt for global institutions like the United Nations. Milei came to office in late 2023 with nothing but scorn for Mercosur, trashing it as a “prison,” threatening to withdraw and skipping the 2024 summit.But his enthusiasm for free trade overcame any skepticism of the bloc at Saturday's ceremony.“Argentina understands firsthand that closure and protectionism, sheltered by rhetoric rather than results, are the greatest causes of economic stagnation,” he said before signing.","summary":"The EU and Mercosur signed a free trade agreement, creating one of the world&#39;s largest trade zones, after 25 years of negotiations, expected to boost trade and counter protectionism.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/eu-and-south-american-countries-sign-historic-free-trade-agreement-after-25-years","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/eu-and-south-american-countries-sign-historic-free-trade-agreement-after-25-years-1768698678285-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 01:11:25","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.536},{"id":393937216,"title":"Morning Digest: DGCA slaps ₹22.2 crore penalty on IndiGo; Trump announces tariffs on European allies to acquire Greenland, and more","text":"DGCA slaps ₹22.2 crore penalty on IndiGo\n\nAviation safety regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Saturday (January 17, 2026) imposed a penalty of ₹22.2 crore on IndiGo airline for flight disruptions in December 2025, citing the overstretching of flight crew as the key factor behind the airline’s operational meltdown.\n\nTrump announces 10% tariff on eight European countries for opposing U.S. control of Greenland\n\nIn the latest of a series of moves to acquire Greenland, U.S. President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on European and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) allies, despite having negotiated trade deals with the U.K. and the European Union in 2025.

Witnesses and human rights groups have described government forces opening fire on protesters in the streets and from rooftops. More than 3,000 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA). CNN cannot independently verify this figure. In his televised address Saturday, Khamenei said the “rioters” involved in the unrest fell under two categories: people supported, funded and trained by the US and Israel, and young people influenced by them. The latter, he said, were “naive individuals whom the ringleaders manipulated.” He said those young people damaged power industry facilities, mosques, educational institutes, banks, medical facilities and grocery stores. The Iranian government has often blamed “foreign” agents for the deadly protests in the country, without providing evidence. “By harming the people, they (the ‘rioters’) killed several thousand of them,” Khamenei said. “Some were killed with a force that was inhuman … completely savagely,” the Iranian leader continued. “These actions were part of the sedition’s pre-prepared blueprint.” Earlier in the week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi pushed back against the reported death toll of “thousands,” telling Fox News’ Bret Baier that the number was actually in the hundreds and that suggestions otherwise were part of a “misinformation campaign.” In his Saturday speech, Khamenei declared that “the US must be held accountable.” During the unrest, Trump encouraged protesters to keep up the demonstrations and “take over” the country’s institutions, assuring them that “help is on its way.” “We consider the US President a criminal, both for the casualties and damage, and for the slander he leveled against the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said, according to a translation of speech excerpts on his website. ‘A sick man’ Trump responded swiftly, calling for new leadership in Iran and referring to Khamenei as a “sick man” who should “run his country properly and stop killing people.” In a Saturday morning interview with Politico, Trump said Khamenei is guilty, “as the leader of a country,” of “the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before.” “In order to keep the country functioning — even though that function is a very low level — the leadership should focus on running his country properly, like I do with the United States, and not killing people by the thousands in order to keep control,” Trump said. The supreme leader recognized in his speech that Iran’s economic situation is “truly difficult” but called for people to unite “in defending the Islamic system and beloved Iran.” He called on government officials to redouble their efforts in supplying essential goods, livestock feed and other essential commodities. Citing Monday’s pro-government rallies across Iran, Khamenei claimed Saturday that the protests have been “extinguished.” State of the Internet Amid the protests that were met with a violent crackdown by security forces, the Iranian government shut off internet connections on January 8. But on Saturday morning, there was a “slight rise” in connectivity, according to cybersecurity watchdog NetBlocks. “Overall connectivity remains at (about) 2% of ordinary levels and there is no indication of a significant return,” NetBlocks added in a statement on X. Iran’s semi-official Mehr News Agency reported Saturday that the internet has been restored to “some subscribers,” saying the shutdown was enacted due to what it described as “terrorist unrest” and to “ensure the security of the country and its citizens.” Some international landline calls and local text messages also appeared to be working again, a Tehran resident told CNN on Saturday. Internet connection itself remains patchy in the country, the resident said. Fate of the protesters In the Saturday address, Iran’s supreme leader vowed consequences for those who took part in the “riots” but did not elaborate on what their punishments would be. “We will not lead the country into war, but we will not let go of the domestic criminals and — more importantly — the international criminals,” he said. “This matter must be pursued using our own methods and the correct approach.” More than 24,000 protesters have been arrested, according to HRANA. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. But fears mounted for the fate of some protesters after Tehran’s prosecutor said last week that some of them could face the death penalty for their actions, according to semi-official Tasnim News Agency. Earlier in the week, the State Department said Iranian authorities planned to execute one protester, Erfan Soltani. His family later said his execution was postponed, and Trump said he had received assurances that there was no plan for executions in Iran. Iran’s judiciary, though, said Soltani had not been sentenced to death. In his interview with Fox News, Iran’s foreign minister also indicated that there were no plans to hang protesters. “The best decision he ever made was not hanging more than 800 people two days ago,” Trump said of Khamenei on Saturday when asked by Politico about the potential for a US military operation in Iran. In response to Trump’s comments, Tehran Prosecutor Ali Salehi neither confirmed nor denied an intention to execute that many people. “Our response is firm, deterrent and swift,” he told Iranian state media. “At present, a large number of cases have resulted in indictments and have been referred to the courts,” he said.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/17/middleeast/iran-supreme-leader-khamenei-protests-criminal-trump-intl-latam","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-2026-01-17t122406z-2004617012-rc203ja0yluo-rtrmadp-3-iran-economy-protests.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:59:12","author":"Hira Humayun","authors":["Hira Humayun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.541},{"id":393938598,"title":"World News | Smog Chokes Pakistan's Punjab as Air Quality Slips to 'very Unhealty' Level","text":"Lahore [Pakistan], January 18 (ANI): A thick blanket of smog continued to envelop large parts of Punjab, pushing air quality to hazardous levels in several districts and heightening public health concerns amid persistent fog and cold weather, the Express Tribune reported. According to data released by the Punjab Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the province recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 200 during the morning-to-afternoon monitoring period, placing overall air quality in the 'unhealthy' category.\nAlso Read | James Opande Trending Video: Clip of Intoxicated Woman from Nairobi Nightclub Sparks Consent Debate.\nSeveral districts reported worse conditions. Muzaffargarh recorded the highest AQI at 291, followed by Rahim Yar Khan at 279 and Lahore at 274, all categorised as 'very unhealthy'. Other major cities also reported elevated pollution levels, with Gujrat recording an AQI of 214 and Khanewal at 204. Narowal, Faisalabad, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Bahawalpur remained in the upper 'unhealthy' range.\nIn Lahore, air quality varied across locations but remained alarming overall.

It forecast partly cloudy weather with chances of light rain and snowfall at isolated locations in upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, while cold and dry conditions are expected to prevail across Punjab. Moderate to dense fog is likely over Punjab, upper Sindh and the plains of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa during morning and night hours.\nOver the past 24 hours, cold and dry weather dominated most parts of the country, with very cold conditions in hilly areas.

Minimum temperatures dropped sharply, with Leh recording minus 8 degrees Celsius, Gupis minus 7 and Bagrote minus 6, the Express Tribune reported. Health experts have advised residents in smog-hit areas to limit outdoor activity, wear protective masks and keep windows closed during peak pollution hours. Environmental officials reiterated calls for stricter enforcement against smoke-emitting vehicles, industrial emissions and crop residue burning, warning that air quality is unlikely to improve in the coming days without sustained intervention.

The charter reportedly reveals that Trump would serve as the inaugural chairman and would decide on who's invited to be members. The draft charter says that member states would serve three-year terms subject to renewal by the chairman, but this term limit would not apply to countries contributing more than $1 billion in cash funds within the first year. Newsweek has reached out the White House via email on Saturday for comment. Why It Matters Some critics and leaders are concerned that Trump is attempting to build an alternative or rival to the United Nations (U.N.), which he has long criticized. The proposal raises questions about international governance structures and how diplomatic influence could be shaped by financial contributions. Many rights experts and advocates have previously said Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's governance resembled a colonial structure, Reuters reported. The Board of Peace's role in Gaza comes as the territory continues to see deadly violence despite a fragile ceasefire that went into effect in October. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted in Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. Gaza’s health ministry says more than 71,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its military campaign—figures that do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Since the ceasefire took effect, Gaza’s health ministry has reported more than 450 people killed in Israeli strikes, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups. What To Know The Board of Peace is described in the charter as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,“ according to Bloomberg's report. The organization would become official once three member states agree to the charter. On Friday, the White House announced the executive panel for the Board of Peace that will supervise the temporary governance of Gaza that would include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, with Trump serving as chair. The board also includes private equity executive and billionaire Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, Trump adviser Robert Gabriel, and former U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov as high representative for Gaza. According to the draft obtained by Bloomberg, decisions would be taken by majority vote, with each member state present getting one vote, but all would be subject to the chairman's approval. Trump would also be responsible for approving the group's official seal. The draft charter's provisions give Trump extensive control over the organization. Trump would have the power to remove a member, subject to a veto by a two-thirds majority of member states. The charter also reportedly states that “the Chairman shall at all times designate a successor for the role of Chairman,“ according to Bloomberg. The draft appears to suggest Trump himself would control the money, something that would be considered unacceptable to most countries who could have potentially joined the board, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to Bloomberg on condition of anonymity. Israel and Hamas signed off in October on Trump's plan, which says a Palestinian technocratic body will be overseen by the international Board of Peace meant to supervise Gaza's governance for a transitional period. A U.N. Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorized the Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish an International Stabilization Force in Gaza, commanded by Major General Jasper Jeffers, a former U.S. special operations commander.

(Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU / AFP) (Photo by CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images) What People Are Saying Board of Peace draft, viewed by Bloomberg, reportedly states: “Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.“ President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on January 15: “As Chairman of the Board of Peace, I am backing a newly appointed Palestinian Technocratic Government, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, supported by the Board's High Representative, to govern Gaza during its transition.“ U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff wrote on X on January 14: “On behalf of President Trump, we are announcing the launch of Phase Two of the President’s 20-Point Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction. Phase Two establishes a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), and begins the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel.“ Fox News political analyst Guy Benson wrote on X on Saturday: “Love the idea of a counter to the corrupt and often despicable UN. An entry fee that Trump himself would control?? If that detail is true, all potential members would be right to say no way.“ What Happens Next Trump has invited several world leaders, including Argentina's President Javier Milei and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, a branch of his Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported, something that drew criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said the details hadn’t been coordinated with his country. The organization's implementation will depend on whether three member states agree to the charter and how nations respond to the proposed financial requirements and governance structure.","summary":"The charter reportedly reveals that Trump would serve as the inaugural chairman and would decide on who&#039;s invited to be members.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-seeks-1b-from-nations-for-board-of-peace-permanent-membership-report-11377686","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2233612529.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:55:32","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.064},{"id":393936504,"title":"Iranian leader Khamenei accuses Trump of inciting deadly protests","text":"Dubai - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for weeks of demonstrations that rights groups said have led to more than 3,000 deaths.'We consider the U.S. president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation,' Khamenei said, according to Iranian state media.The protests erupted on Dec. 28 over economic hardship and swelled into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule in the Islamic Republic.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/01/18/world/khamenei-trump-iran-protests/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/01/18/517582.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:54:47","author":"The Japan Times","authors":["The Japan Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-1},{"id":393935296,"title":"EU unable to rebuff US on Greenland as long as it remains hostile towards Russia — expert","text":"WASHINGTON, January 18. /TASS/.

As he stressed, from June 1, the rate of these duties will increase to 25%. Furthermore, Trump criticized Europe's intention to send its forces to Greenland, calling it \"a very dangerous game.\" He argued that possession of Greenland is necessary to strengthen US national security and the effective deployment of the American Golden Dome missile defense system. Finally, the US leader expressed the opinion that the United States \"for many years\" subsidized \"Denmark and all [other] countries of the European Union.\"\n\nGreenland is part of Denmark as an autonomous territory.

He warned the rate would rise to 25 per cent on June 1 and remain in place until a deal is reached for the \"complete and total purchase\" of Greenland, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nNordic leaders were among the first to push back, stressing that disputes between allies should be handled through dialogue rather than pressure.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he was surprised by the tariff threat and noted Denmark was in close contact with the European Commission, according to Ritzau.\n\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store called the threats \"unacceptable\" in comments to national news agency NTB, saying threats have no place among allies and reiterating Norway's support for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nFinnish President Alexander Stubb said issues among allies are best resolved through discussion, not pressure, warning that tariffs could harm transatlantic relations and trigger a dangerous downward spiral.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson rejected the tariff as \"blackmail,\" saying Sweden \"will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed\" and arguing the matter should be handled at EU level.\n\nOther European leaders also signaled a tougher posture should Washington move ahead with the measures.\n\nCalling the tariff threat \"unacceptable,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said Europeans would respond in a united and coordinated manner should the measures be confirmed.\n\nHe said France's participation in a Denmark-organized exercise in Greenland reflects France's commitment to national sovereignty and independence, stressing that \"no intimidation or threat will influence us.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said it was \"completely wrong\" to apply tariffs on allies for pursuing collective security within NATO, adding that Britain would raise the issue directly with the US administration and reiterating that Greenland's future should be decided by Greenlanders and Danes.\n\nThe German government said it was coordinating closely with European partners and that an appropriate response would be decided jointly in due course.\n\nAt the EU level, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa warned in a joint statement that tariffs linked to Greenland would undermine transatlantic ties and risk a \"dangerous downward spiral.\"\n\nThey underlined that territorial integrity and sovereignty are fundamental principles of international law, and said Europe would remain \"united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.\"\n\nThe episode has also reignited debate over whether the EU should activate stronger defensive trade tools, including the bloc's so-called \"bazooka,\" the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), and has further complicated the politics surrounding EU-US trade arrangements in the European Parliament.\n\nBernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, urged the European Commission to launch the ACI immediately, calling Trump's tariff threat \"unbelievable\" and \"a new dimension\" in the use of tariffs as a political weapon.\n\nLange said the US step would amount to another breach of the political EU-US tariff and trade deal agreed in Scotland in July 2025, adding that the European Parliament would revisit the issue with political groups next week.\n\nHe said he could not imagine \"business as usual\" continuing and expected parliamentary work on the file to be suspended.\n\nManfred Weber, chair of the European People's Party, the largest group in the European Parliament, said that, given Trump's threats over Greenland, approval of the EU-US trade deal was \"not possible\" at this stage and that any move toward zero tariffs on US products should be put on hold.\n\nCyprus, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said late Saturday it had called an emergency meeting for Sunday, with ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states set to convene to coordinate next steps.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Brussels, Jan 18 (SocialNews.XYZ) US President Donald Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on eight European countries unless

The shooting happened in broad daylight and was captured on video, which spread online and raised serious questions about what exactly took place in the moments before the fatal shots were fired.,The ICE agent involved in the shooting has been identified as Jonathan Ross. Soon after the incident, the Donald Trump administration publicly defended the agent. Officials claimed that Renee Good tried to hit Ross with her vehicle, forcing him to fire his weapon in self-defense. These claims were repeated by several high-ranking officials and supporters of the administration., ,Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem went even further, calling Renee Good a “domestic terrorist,” a statement that shocked many and intensified public outrage. ,Vice President JD Vance also posted on X, saying that Good attempted to run over the ICE agent, leaving him no choice but to open fire. ,Did Renee Good Try To Hit The ICE Agent?,A new video analysis by The New York Times now showcases a different version of events. The newspaper reviewed multiple video clips, including footage recorded from the ICE agent’s own cellphone, as well as videos taken by bystanders near the scene.,According to The New York Times, the video does not clearly show Renee Good trying to run over the agent. The analysis focused on the exact positioning of the agent and Good’s SUV in the moments before the shooting. ,While the footage shows the vehicle backing up and then moving forward slightly, the paper said there is no clear visual evidence that Ross was struck or about to be struck by the car.,In one widely circulated clip, the agent can be heard saying “woah” before firing several shots.

Also Read | Donald Trump Says 8 European Countries Will Be Charged 10% Tariff for Opposing US Control of Greenland.\n\"The likelihood of a U.S. military attack has become much weaker, and the Iranian government's restraint regarding the execution of detained individuals gave the U.S. president the opportunity to rule out, at least at this stage, a second strike,\" he said. The veteran negotiator claimed that Washington's approach of attempting to destabilise Iran through internal unrest has proven unsuccessful, with \"billions of dollars\" spent on what he termed a failed strategy. He suggested that efforts to create an exile-based alternative leadership had similarly come to nothing.\n\"Washington has become disappointed with--or at least deeply doubtful about--the \"strategy of collapsing Iran through organising unrest, instability, and civil war inside the country. Billions of dollars spent to make this strategy succeed were wasted, and the illusion of creating an exile-based alternative to lead protests inside Iran also failed,\" he added. Noting that tension with the US remains Iran's \"greatest challenge\", Mousavian said that Washington's military actions can \"intensify hostility\" and endanger the stability of the whole region. He urged both nations to practice dialogue and diplomacy. On the prospect of US military intervention, Mousavian was unequivocal: limited strikes would only intensify hostility, whilst large-scale action would threaten stability across the Middle East and endanger American partners in the region.\n\"A limited, targeted U.S. military strike would have no result other than intensifying hostility, and a large-scale military action against Iran would certainly endanger the stability of the entire region and threaten U.S. partners across the Middle East. Therefore, the U.S. should remove military options from the table, as they carry high costs and risks for the U.S., Iran, and the whole region,\" he said. The former diplomat identified US-Iran tensions as the greatest challenge to Iran's foreign policy and national security, whilst suggesting President Trump faces similar complexity in managing relations with Tehran.\n\"Diplomacy is the only path to peace. Washington and Tehran need direct, meaningful, and comprehensive dialogue, provided that its outcome is dignified and face-saving for both capitals,\" he added. Speaking about the recent de-escalation of protests, Mousavian said that Iran's leadership needs to take necessary measures to stabilise the country. \"Iran's domestic situation is calm, security forces have taken control of the country, and people's lives have relatively returned to normal,\" Seyed Hossein Mousavian told ANI. \"The current return of relative calm is an opportunity for Iran's leadership to take fundamental steps to resolve structural problems and improve governance, including improving economic conditions, eliminating poverty, corruption, and unemployment, and removing incompetent or infiltrated authorities,\" he added. The protests began at Tehran's Grand Bazaar on December 28 over the Iranian rial's record fall in value and later spread into nationwide demonstrations. The decline in the currency followed multiple crises, including unprecedented water shortages, power outages, rising unemployment and surging inflation.

This was mainly influenced by a two per cent increase in the index for the ‘food and non-alcoholic beverages’ division.\n\nAccording to STATIN, this movement was due primarily to a 4.5 per cent increase in the index of the ‘vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses’ class, and a 5.6 per cent increase in the index of the ‘fruits and nuts’ class.\n\n“These increases were attributable to the continued increase in the prices of some agricultural produce that were impacted by Huricane Melissa,” said STATIN in its latest monthly update on price movements.\n\nIt said that additionally, the index for the ‘housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ division increased by 2.6 per cent, largely influenced by higher electricity rates and rental cost. \n\nThepoint-to-point inflation rate as at December 2025 was 4.5 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the All-Jamaica CPI point-to-point inflation for the period December 2024 to December 2025 stood at 4.5 per cent.\n\nThe divisions contributing most to this increase were: ‘food and non-alcoholic beverages’ (7.1 per cent); ‘housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ (3.5 per cent); and ‘restaurants and accommodation services’ (3.9 per cent). \n\nOf note is that all classes within the ‘food and non-alcoholic beverages’ division recorded increases over the point-to-point period. The ‘vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses’ category registered the largest impact, with its index rising by 8.4 per cent. This resulted from higher prices for agricultural produce such as yam, Irish potato, tomato, carrot, cabbage and pumpkin.Additionally, there was an 8.4 per cent increase inthe ‘fish and other seafood’ category, primarily due to higher prices for salted fish, sardines, mackerel and sliced fish.\n\nSTATIN said the main contributor to the rise in the index for the ‘housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ division was a 5.1 per cent increase in the index for the group ‘imputed rentals for housing’. Added to that was a 3.7 per cent increase in the index of the ‘water supply and miscellaneous services’ relating to the ‘dwelling’ group. This was largely due to higher water supply and sewage rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Consumer Price Index CPI food prices Inflation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Europe with tariffs over Greenland as protesters rally \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n PALM BEACH, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday escalated his quest to acquire Greenland, threatening multiple... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n UK-Caribbean Healthcare Mission strengthens UK-Jamaica partnership \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United Kingdom (UK) and Jamaica have strengthened their partnership in healthcare and regulatory cooperation following Jamaica... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manchester farmer charged following shooting incident \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 17, 2026 \n\n\n MANCHESTER, Jamaica — A farmer has been charged following a shooting incident in Mandeville, Manchester, on Tuesday, January 6.

But I also think the Trump administration is making a massive mistake in the expectations game. \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent went on Fox Business with Larry Kudlow on Friday and boldly predicted the economy could surge by as much as 8% GDP growth. That number alone was enough to make economists sit up straight. \n\n“I think GDP is gonna surprise on the upside,” Bessent said. “But the important thing is, it’s gonna be non-inflationary, disinflationary growth, back to the ‘90s, and we, we could have kind of a seven, 8% nominal GDP number.” \n\nWow, the Democrats are going to HATE this.Scott Bessent confirms GDP could hit 7-8%! Explosive growth with lower inflation. Trump's back and America's economy is roaring again! pic.twitter.com/WlwO8BRagj— Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) January 17, 2026\n\nI don’t care who you are: That’s an ambitious forecast. \n\nAnd while I have plenty of confidence in Donald Trump’s economic instincts — the man has a proven track record — it’s hard not to feel a little nervous when the administration starts putting sky-high numbers out there. Eight percent GDP growth would be tremendous, no question. But by setting expectations that high, they risk turning a strong performance into a perceived disappointment if the numbers “only” come in at 4% or 5%—both of which would still be solid.\n\nSorry, Libs, Obstruction and Rioting Are Not Peaceful Protest\n\nTrump’s team needs to remember that voters have been conditioned over decades to expect grand promises followed by excuses and delays. Presidents of both parties have done it, and both parties have paid the price for it.\n\nFrom George H.W. Bush’s “read my lips, no new taxes,” to Barack Obama’s promises of $2,500 savings from Obamacare, and even Joe Biden promising that inflation would be transitory, and we all know how that worked out.\n\nIn politics, expectations are everything. If you set modest expectations for economic growth and it ends up booming, it feels like a huge win. If you promise the moon and deliver a strong but ordinary recovery, it looks like you came up short, and you’ve given the opposition ammunition.\n\nThis isn’t an issue of how the media can spin it; it’s human psychology. People judge performance relative to what they were told to expect. You set high expectations; anything short of that will disappoint.\n\nIt’s bugged me for a long time now, the way the Trump administration plays the expectations game. It would be wise to underpromise and then overdeliver. That’s how you build credibility. It’s how you earn trust, especially in a cynical age where voters look for any excuse to be disappointed.\n\nAnd honestly, it’s a lesson Trump should have learned by now.\n\nHis overpromising about the release of the Epstein files during the 2024 campaign has become a lingering talking point for critics. That kind of thing sticks.\n\nYou can still believe in Trump’s ability to deliver real results while recognizing that setting expectations sky-high is a strategic mistake. A strong economy will speak for itself if given enough time. Inflation continues to ease, energy prices are stabilizing, and job creation is trending up. Those are the kinds of metrics that win elections, not wild speculation about hitting 8% GDP.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2026/01/17/the-trump-administration-must-stop-making-this-crucial-error-n4948430","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/251/3efbc9f9-61d1-46ec-89d7-32d4ecec70b9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:40:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":393938638,"title":"World News | Israel Objects to White House Selection of Candidates for Gaza 'Board of Peace'","text":"Tel Aviv [Israel], January 18 (ANI): Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu-led government has objected to US President Donald Trump's selection of candidates for Gaza 'Board of Peace', stating that the appointments were not made in coordination with Israel and \"run contrary to its policy.\" PM Netanyahu has directed Foreign Affairs Minister Gideon Sa'ar to express Israel's concerns to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\nThe rare criticism from Israel of its close ally in Washington said the Gaza executive committee \"was not coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy,\" without details. Saturday's statement also said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the foreign ministry to contact Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe committee announced by the White House on Friday includes no Israeli official but has an Israeli businessman, billionaire Yakir Gabay. Other members announced so far include two of U.S. President Donald Trump's closest confidants, a former British prime minister, a U.S. general and representatives of several Middle Eastern governments.\n\nThe White House has said the executive committee will carry out the vision of a Trump-led \"Board of Peace,\" whose members have not yet been named. The White House also announced the members of a new Palestinian committee to run Gaza's day to day affairs, with oversight from the executive committee. The Palestinian committee met for the first time on Thursday in Cairo.\n\nThe executive committee's members include Rubio, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga and Trump's Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gabriel.\n\nCommittee members also include a diplomat from Qatar, an intelligence chief from Egypt and Turkey's foreign minister — all countries have been ceasefire mediators — as well as a Cabinet minister for the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTurkey has a strained relationship with Israel but good relations with Hamas and could play an important role in persuading the group to yield power and disarm. Hamas has said it will dissolve its government in Gaza once the new Palestinian committee takes office, but it has shown no sign that it will dismantle its military wing or security forces.\n\nNetanyahu's office didn't respond Saturday to questions about its objections regarding the executive committee.\n\nMinutes after its statement, Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir in a statement backed Netanyahu and urged him to order the military to prepare to return to war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right Netanyahu ally, said on social media that \"the countries that kept Hamas alive cannot be the ones that replace it.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Gaza's second-largest militant group after Hamas, in a statement Saturday also expressed dissatisfaction with the makeup of the Gaza executive committee and claimed it reflected Israeli \"specifications.\"\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday said the U.S.-drafted ceasefire plan for Gaza was now moving into its second phase, which includes the new Palestinian committee in Gaza, deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-battered territory.\n\nThe last hostage, Ran Gvili in Gaza, was killed during the attack that sparked the war. On Saturday his parents, Talik and Itzik Gvili, said in a statement they were \"deeply concerned by moves toward the rehabilitation of Gaza\" while Hamas had not fulfilled its obligation to return everyone.\n\nThe ceasefire in the deadliest war ever fought between Israel and Hamas took effect on Oct. 10. The first phase focused on the return of all remaining hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees, along with a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza.\n\nThe war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took over 250 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 71,400 Palestinians, including over 460 since this ceasefire began, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nThe ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/18/israel-objects-to-us-announcement-of-leaders-who-will-help-oversee-next-steps-in-gaza","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/global_files/default_meta_image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:38:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.064},{"id":393938612,"title":"World News | Pakistan: Three Killed as Massive Fire Engulfs Gul Plaza Mall in Karachi","text":"Karachi [Pakistan], January 18 (ANI): At least three people were killed and several others injured after a massive fire broke out at the Gul Plaza shopping mall on MA Jinnah Road in Karachi late Saturday night, Dawn reported, citing officials.\nDr Sabir Memon, Executive Director of the trauma centre at Civil Hospital Karachi, said three bodies were brought to the facility.

We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nAlthough Washington has been ratcheting up pressure over its plans for Greenland, US reports suggest the countries were given no notice of what was coming.\n\nSweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country was having “intensive discussions” with the other European countries to decide on a coordinated response, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he would hold talks with European partners.\n\nEarlier this week, the UK confirmed it had sent a military officer to Greenland as Denmark stepped up its military presence in the Arctic and High North.\n\nDowning Street said they were sent at Denmark’s request to join a reconnaissance group ahead of a planned Arctic endurance exercise, but denied it amounted to a “deployment”.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Mr Trump said: “These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\n\n“Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”\n\nMr Trump said the US was “immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades”.\n\nHe said it was “time for Denmark to give back”, adding: “China and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it.”\n\nEU leaders said the Danish exercise “poses no threat to anyone” and warned tariffs would risk a “dangerous downward spiral” in transatlantic relations.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa said: “The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. Dialogue remains essential, and we are committed to building on the process begun already last week between the Kingdom of Denmark and the US.\n\n“Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.”\n\nMr Macron said he would not bow to “intimidation”, while Mr Kristersson insisted “we will not let ourselves be blackmailed” and Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said tariffs would be in “no-one’s interest”.\n\nNorway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store wrote on social media: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief said tariffs could make the US and EU poorer and boost China and Russia.\n\nFormer Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said on social media: “China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among Allies.\n\n“If Greenland’s security is at risk, we can address this inside Nato.\n\n“Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.”\n\nMr Trump’s move prompted criticism across the board from UK politicians who fear for their impact on the economy.\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch said Mr Trump was “completely wrong” to impose tariffs over Greenland, adding they would be a “burden for businesses across our country”.\n\nReform leader Nigel Farage said the tariffs would “hurt” the UK, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Mr Trump was “punishing” the UK.\n\nHundreds of people in Greenland’s capital Nuuk attended a rally on Saturday in support of self-governance.\n\nThousands also took part in rallies across Denmark on Saturday opposing any US takeover of Greenland.\n\nSince the US began openly discussing the annexation of Greenland at the start of 2026, the UK has stepped up discussions on Arctic security with Sir Keir raising the issue in calls with Mr Trump, the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce said Mr Trump’s proposed tariffs over Greenland will have a “greater impact” on UK exports if they are stacked on existing tariffs.\n\nWilliam Bain, its head of trade policy, told the Press Association: “If there’s stacking of these duties and that is how the US government intends to implement this statement tonight, then these tariffs would have a greater impact upon UK goods exports to the US than even the Rose Garden statement of April 2 had last year.”","summary":"Donald Trump’s move also prompted criticism across the board from UK politicians who fear for their impact on the economy.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/greenland-keir-starmer-washington-european-countries-b1266989.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2026/01/18/00/f21e52d0041472107645232992f64a88Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzY4NzgxMDA4-2.81659643.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:35:48","author":"Dave Clark","authors":["Dave Clark"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":393938392,"title":"Israel repudia el anuncio de la Junta Ejecutiva de Paz para Gaza y pide explicaciones a EE.

Entre los miembros de esta junta, figuran el secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio; el asesor de Trump para Oriente Próximo, Steve Witkoff; y, muy en particular para los intereses israelíes, altos responsables de Turquía, como su ministro de Exteriores, Hakan Fidan, o el director de los servicios de Inteligencia egipcios, Hasan Rashad.\n\nEn este sentido, Netanyahu ha dado orden a su ministro de Exteriores, Gideon Saar, para que se ponga en contacto con Rubio “sobre esta cuestión”.\n\nTrump invita a homólogos a formar parte de la Junta de Paz para Gaza\n\nTrump extendió una invitación a sus homólogos turco, egipcio y argentino, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Abdelfatá al Sisi y Javier Milei, respectivamente, a formar parte de su flamante Junta de Paz para Gaza, el organismo que será encargado de garantizar la seguridad y la reconstrucción durante la posguerra en el enclave palestino.\n\nLa presidencia turca y el ministro de Exteriores egipcio, Badr Abdellaty, han confirmado respectivamente que han recibido las invitaciones de Trump.\n\n“El 16 de enero de 2026, el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, en su calidad de presidente fundador del Consejo de Paz, envió una carta invitando a nuestro presidente, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a participar como miembro fundador de la Junta de Paz”, dijo el portavoz de la presidencia turca, Burhanettin Duran, en declaraciones recogidas por la agencia oficial de noticias Anadolu.\n\nAbdelatty, por su parte, ha confirmado la recepción de la invitación y explicado que el Gobierno “está estudiando el asunto y los documentos recibidos” antes de dar una respuesta, ha hecho saber en rueda de prensa recogida por Al Arabiya.\n\nLa invitación a Milei ha sido confirmada por el propio presidente argentino en sus redes sociales.\n\n“Es un honor para mí haber recibido esta noche la invitación para que la Argentina integre, como Miembro Fundador, el Board of Peace, una organización creada por el Presidente Trump para promover una paz duradera en regiones afectadas por conflictos, empezando por la Franja de Gaza”, indicó.\n\n“Argentina siempre estará del lado de los países que luchan de frente contra el terrorismo, que defienden la vida y la propiedad, y que promueven la paz y la libertad. Es un honor para nosotros acompañarlos en tamaña responsabilidad”, añadió.\n\nLos gobiernos de Paraguay y Canadá también han informado de que Trump ha invitado a sus respectivos jefes de Estado y de Gobierno a participar en este nuevo organismo.\n\nEn el caso del presidente paraguayo, Santiago Peña, este manifestó su disposición a asumir “con honor la responsabilidad”. \n\nEl primer ministro canadiense, Mark Carney, también tiene intención de aceptar la invitación de Trump a sumarse a esta Junta de Paz, según fuentes citadas por la televisión canadiense CTV. La invitación llegó el viernes y todavía no ha habido un anuncio formal al respecto por parte de las autoridades canadienses.\n\nTrump anunció este pasado viernes la composición de esta junta, en la que participarán entre otros el ex primer ministro británico Tony Blair; Rubio; el enviado especial de Trump, Steve Witkoff; Jared Kushner, yerno del presidente; Robert Gabriel, asesor adjunto de Seguridad Nacional. También participará el multimillonario estadounidense Marc Rowan, consejero delegado de Apollo Global Management, y el empresario indio-estadounidense Ajay Banga.","url":"https://puertoricotribune.com/israel-repudia-el-anuncio-de-la-junta-ejecutiva-de-paz-para-gaza-y-pide-explicaciones-a-ee-uu/","image":"https://puertoricotribune.com/app/uploads/2026/01/U5I6IZ4I2FE3FOSALWCH4TKNY4-MFOSON.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:35:14","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pr","sentiment":0.639},{"id":393933716,"title":"Thousands rally in Greenland against US annexation plans (VIDEOS)","text":"Thousands of people marched through Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, on Saturday to protest against US plans to annex the self-governing Danish territory.

Florida-based controversial influencer, political activist dragged and kicked during Minneapolis protest chaos","text":"Some shocking videos have surfaced on social media, where Jake Lang, a controversial Florida Senate candidate and pardoned participant in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, is seen surrounded by a huge crowd on Sunday. Following this, he is seen climbing onto a vehicle and being driven away. The incident unfolded amid intense protests over the recent killing of 37-year-old mother Renee Nicole Good by a federal ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agent identified as Jonathan Ross. Amid the widely circulating videos, let's find out who Jake Lang is.According to , Lang had organised a rally called the \"March Against Minnesota Fraud\", which set out from near Minneapolis City Hall. As the demonstration began, a counter-protest organised by the People's Action Coalition Against Trump formed nearby, and tensions between the two sides quickly escalated. While videos shared online appear to show Lang on the ground, bleeding from his head, other members of the opposing crowd dragged him away. On the other hand, some clips posted on X (formerly called Twitter) show him being kicked and pulled as he tried to exit the area amid the clashes. According to a post shared on X, \"Pardoned J6 conservative Jake Lang is BLEEDING from the head after being MOBBED and assaulted by a violent crowd in Minneapolis. Agitators scream \"F*CK YOU NAZI!\" as chaos erupts. Someone is going to get seriously hurt — where are the police? Total anarchy right now.\"While another post read, \"After getting chased and hit during an anti-Islam protest, Jake Lang had to escape by car, bleeding from the head.The mob attacked his vehicle and tried to force their way in. Not a single cop showed up. Not one.\"As soon as the posts surfaced on social media, they quickly went viral and sparked debate. One X user asked, \"Where are the police?\"To which one replied, saying, \"They police are knowingly, deliberately allowing all of this to happen. They consider it a feature, not a bug, because they want to blame it on ICE.\"\"These people are no better than street gangs, and they remind me of a feral pack of dogs,\" one said.\"Because he intended to. This is a military psyop against Americans.\"\"Enough is enough\" Jake Lang is a Florida-based influencer, political activist and candidate for the Florida State Senate. He is best known for his role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, an offence for which he was later pardoned by President Donald Trump. Lang was one of more than 1,500 people granted pardons related to the Capitol riot. Following his release, he has continued to play a visible role in far-right political circles and has regularly organised and participated in protests and demonstrations nationwide.Jake was later seen with blood visible on the back of his head before entering the hotel, though the cause of his injury was not immediately clear. Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, has since voiced support for Lang. In a detailed post on X, Tarrio acknowledged that he has had disagreements with Lang in the past but said the incident in Minneapolis was unjustifiable. “I’m tired of hearing the ‘I hate Jake Lang, so I won’t defend what happened to him’ crowd…“You can hate everything about Jake Lang. You can call him an agitator a fed…whatever you want…,” he continued. Tarrio then heaped praise on Lang, saying he had ‘more balls’ than most,\" he said.","url":"https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/who-is-jake-lang-florida-based-controversial-influencer-political-activist-dragged-and-kicked-during-minneapolis-protest-chaos/articleshow/126633670.html","image":"https://staticimg.publishstory.co/thumb/126633787.cms?imgsize=54138&width=1280&height=720&resizemode=8","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:31:43","author":"Sneha Kumari","authors":["Sneha Kumari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":393937084,"title":"Israel Rejects US Announcement On Gaza Executive Committee","text":"Jerusalem: Israel’s government is objecting to the White House announcement of leaders who will play a role in overseeing next steps in Gaza as the ceasefire moves into its challenging second phase.The rare criticism from Israel of its close ally in Washington said the Gaza executive committee “was not coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy,” without details. Saturday's statement also said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the foreign ministry to contact Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The committee announced by the White House on Friday includes no Israeli official but has an Israeli businessman, billionaire Yakir Gabay. Other members announced so far include two of U.S. President Donald Trump’s closest confidants, a former British prime minister, a U.S. general and representatives of several Middle Eastern governments.The White House has said the executive committee will carry out the vision of a Trump-led “Board of Peace,” whose members have not yet been named. The White House also announced the members of a new Palestinian committee to run Gaza’s day to day affairs, with oversight from the executive committee. The Palestinian committee met for the first time on Thursday in Cairo.The executive committee’s members include Rubio, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga and Trump’s Deputy National Security Adviser Robert Gabriel.Committee members also include a diplomat from Qatar, an intelligence chief from Egypt and Turkey’s foreign minister — all countries have been ceasefire mediators — as well as a Cabinet minister for the United Arab Emirates.Turkey has a strained relationship with Israel but good relations with Hamas and could play an important role in persuading the group to yield power and disarm. Hamas has said it will dissolve its government in Gaza once the new Palestinian committee takes office, but it has shown no sign that it will dismantle its military wing or security forces.Netanyahu's office didn't respond Saturday to questions about its objections regarding the executive committee.Minutes after its statement, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir in a statement backed Netanyahu and urged him to order the military to prepare to return to war. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right Netanyahu ally, said on social media that “the countries that kept Hamas alive cannot be the ones that replace it.\"The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Gaza’s second-largest militant group after Hamas, in a statement Saturday also expressed dissatisfaction with the makeup of the Gaza executive committee and claimed it reflected Israeli “specifications.”The Trump administration on Wednesday said the U.S.-drafted ceasefire plan for Gaza was now moving into its second phase, which includes the new Palestinian committee in Gaza, deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-battered territory.The last hostage, Ran Gvili in Gaza, was killed during the attack that sparked the war. On Saturday his parents, Talik and Itzik Gvili, said in a statement they were “deeply concerned by moves toward the rehabilitation of Gaza” while Hamas had not fulfilled its obligation to return everyone.The ceasefire in the deadliest war ever fought between Israel and Hamas took effect on Oct. 10. The first phase focused on the return of all remaining hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian detainees, along with a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces in Gaza.The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took over 250 hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 71,400 Palestinians, including over 460 since this ceasefire began, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.","summary":"Israel&#39;s government rejects the US announcement of leaders overseeing Gaza&#39;s next steps, saying the Gaza executive committee wasn&#39;t coordinated with Israel and contradicts its policy.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/israel-rejects-us-announcement-on-gaza-executive-committee","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/israel-will-take-back-thousends-of-indian-jews-bnei-menashe-benjamin-netanyahu-given-approval-1764147302986-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:31:02","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.062},{"id":393931878,"title":"Trump seeks $1 billion buy-in for permanent seats on Board of Peace for Gaza, report says","text":"United States president Donald Trump is seeking to assemble a powerful new international body under his personal chairmanship, inviting governments to join a “Board of Peace” whose draft charter links long-term membership to a cash contribution of more than $1 billion. While conceived within a United Nations–endorsed framework for Gaza’s reconstruction, the body’s design suggests ambitions that extend far beyond the Palestinian enclave.What does the Draft Charter on Gaza Peace Board read? According to a draft charter for the proposed group seen by Bloomberg, President Donald Trump would serve as its inaugural chairman and would decide on who is invited to be members. Decisions would be taken by a majority, with each member state present getting one vote, but all would be subject to the chairman’s approval.“Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman. The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force,” the draft says.A global body with a price of entryLetters of invitation have been sent by Donald Trump to selected heads of government, asking them to participate in the proposed Board of Peace. Although the initiative was initially envisaged as part of a UN-backed effort to oversee post-war reconstruction and transitional governance in Gaza, a draft charter reviewed by Bloomberg indicates that the board would have a far wider, potentially global remit.Under the charter, member states would ordinarily serve renewable three-year terms at the discretion of the chairman. However, an explicit exemption applies to those willing to underwrite the institution at scale. As the document states:“The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.”The language, dense with legal formality, leaves little doubt that financial commitment is central to institutional permanence.Governance by invitation — and approvalThe proposed structure places exceptional authority in the hands of the chairman. According to the draft, Trump would serve as the board’s inaugural leader, determine invitations to membership, and retain final approval over decisions taken by majority vote. Each participating state would hold a single vote when present, but outcomes would remain subject to the chairman’s assent.While the charter outlines how funds are to be raised, it offers scant detail on how they will be deployed. Its finance clause merely notes:“Funding for the expenses of the Board of Peace shall be through voluntary funding from Member States, other States, organizations, or other sources.”This absence of specificity is likely to raise questions among potential contributors about oversight, accountability and end use.From Gaza mechanism to UN rival?The Board of Peace was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November as one component of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Yet the charter itself makes no reference to Gaza, despite the UN resolution granting the board a two-year mandate, extendable to December 2027.Instead, the preamble hints at a broader philosophical departure from existing multilateral frameworks. It declares that “durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common-sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed,” before calling for “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body.” The language echoes Trump’s long-standing criticism of the UN as cumbersome and ineffectual.Oversight of Gaza’s transitionOperational responsibility for Gaza remains central to the board’s immediate purpose. Following months of fragile ceasefire, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff announced the launch of phase two of the administration’s plan: “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza,” alongside the creation of “a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration.”The board was formally constituted the following day, Trump confirmed on Truth Social.Day-to-day management of Gaza would fall to a separate panel of Palestinian technocrats, led by former Palestinian Authority official Ali Sha’ath, operating under the board’s supervision.An executive board of global figuresThe White House has already named the seven initial members of the Board of Peace’s executive board, effectively its operating committee. They include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank president Ajay Banga, financier Marc Rowan, deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel, and Witkoff himself.Further announcements are expected at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which begins on Monday. Trump has said the board will include the “most important leaders of the most important nations.”Invitations and early responsesTrump’s invitation letters underscore the uniqueness he ascribes to the project. In one letter shared publicly by Javier Milei, the US president wrote:“This Board will be one of a kind, there has never been anything like it!”Invitations have also been sent to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, with Ottawa confirming Carney’s acceptance.A long-term visionIf the Board of Peace is intended as a counterweight — or even an alternative — to the UN, it would align with Trump’s history of open scepticism towards multilateral institutions. Addressing the General Assembly in September, Donald Trump had asked: “What is the purpose of the United Nations?” arguing that while the organisation possessed “tremendous potential”, it was “not even close to living up to” it, and asserting that he had intervened to resolve conflicts the UN was “too weak to handle”.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/world/donald-trump-s-board-of-peace-for-gaza-comes-with-a-price-1-billion-for-long-term-membership-11768694641020.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/18/1600x900/logo/USA-FED-COOK-COURT-0_1768694694075_1768694714952.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:28:56","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.079},{"id":393936332,"title":"Trump wants nations to pay USD 1 billion to stay on his peace board: Report","text":"p>The Trump administration wants nations ​to pay USD 1 billion to ‌stay on his ⁠peace board, ‌Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing a draft charter.United States President Donald Trump would ​serve as its inaugural chairman and each member state shall serve a ‌term ‌of no more than three years from ⁠this charter's entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman, the ⁠report said..Trump vows tariffs on eight European nations over Greenland.Reuters ⁠could not immediately verify ‌the report.The US ‌State Department responded to Reuters' question on the matter by ‍referring to previous social media posts about the board by Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff, which did not mention the number.</p","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/world/trump-wants-nations-to-pay-usd-1-billion-to-stay-on-his-peace-board-report-3866113","image":"https://media.assettype.com/deccanherald/2026-01-18/735g6wkr/deccanherald2026-01-14cfg6ql3a2026-01-13T232723Z2097717714RC2L0JAV4SAGRTRMADP5USA-TRUMP-AFFORDABILITY.avif?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:28:24","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.549},{"id":393934868,"title":"Does Trump Want Countries to Shell Out $1 Billion for Permanent Spots on His 'Board of Peace'?","text":"The Trump administration has put forward an odd requirement for any nation wanting a lasting role in a new international group called the Board of Peace: fork over at least $1 billion in cash contributions right away.

During that period, the US President repeatedly raised the possibility of military action and urged Iranians to continue protesting. ,On Tuesday, Trump called on protesters to \"take over institutions,\" saying that \"help is on its way\". He shifted his tone the following day, however, saying he had been informed that the killings had stopped., ,\"The best decision he ever made was not hanging more than 800 people two days ago,\" Trump said on Saturday, when asked about the potential scale of US military involvement. ,Trump's comments came shortly after Ayatollah Khamenei posted a series of messages on X criticising the US President and accusing him of responsibility for violence in Iran. ,\"We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,\" Khamenei wrote.

Kennedy Jr. that suggested otherwise.\n\n The study undertaken by a team of seven researchers from across Europe noted that taking acetaminophen — a common over-the-counter medication used for pain relief like Tylenol and Paracetamol — while pregnant does not increase the risk of a child being born with autism, ADHD or an intellectual disability.\n\n Experts reviewed 43 studies “with the highest quality and most rigorous research methods” and compared the results of mothers who had taken Paracetamol while pregnant compared to pregnancies where they had not. Their data included over 262,000 children assessed for autism, over 335,000 for ADHD and over 406,000 for an intellectual disability.\n\n “The message is clear: paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,” said lead researcher Asma Khalil, who is a Professor of Obstetrics and Maternal Fetal Medicine at St George's Hospital, University of London.\n\n “This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms,” she added.\n\n This comes a few months after President Trump shared during a press conference in September that \"taking Tylenol is not good,\" and that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will no longer recommend Tylenol during pregnancy — only in cases where a women can't \"tough it out.”\n\n Following Trump’s comments, the FDA announced that it initiated the process “for a label change for acetaminophen” to “reflect evidence suggesting that the use of acetaminophen by pregnant women may be associated with an increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children.”\n\n However, several experts across the field pushed back, including Dr. Karam Radwan, Director of the UChicago Medicine Neurodevelopmental Clinic, who told PEOPLE, \"People have been taking Tylenol since 1960, and there's a very long history of safety here.”\n\n Dr. Sindhu Srinivas, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, also told Today, “The science is very clear that there’s really no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism in children.\"\n\n Tylenol’s parent company Kenvue also defended the use of the medication in pregnancy, telling PEOPLE in a statement in September, “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy,” they added. “Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.”\n\n Kenvue concluded the statement noting, \"We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.”","summary":"Pregnant women “should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms,” said the study’s lead researcher","url":"https://people.com/taking-acetaminophen-during-pregnancy-doesn-t-increase-autism-risk-new-study-finds-11887865","image":"https://people.com/thmb/SrYesNMRhqw_rWi94P6B-hz-aIU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(756x162:758x164)/pregnant-woman-and-tylenol-092225-8f98a3d9fece4d01a6737c7bb0b9a18e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:22:15","author":"Kimberlee Speakman","authors":["Kimberlee Speakman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":393936400,"title":"Trump vows tariffs on 8 European nations over Greenland","text":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark’s vast Arctic island.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on Feb. 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — all already subject to tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\nThose tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and would continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote.\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll of U.S. residents this week found that less than one in five respondents support the idea of acquiring Greenland.\n\nThe president has repeatedly said Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large mineral deposits, and has not ruled out using force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark’s request.\n\n“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump wrote. Protesters in Denmark and Greenland demonstrated today against Trump’s demands and called for the territory to be left to determine its own future.\n\nThe countries named by Trump today have backed Denmark, warning that the U.S. military seizure of a territory in NATO could collapse the military alliance that Washington leads.\n\n“The president’s announcement comes as a surprise,” Denmark’s Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer was unusually blunt in condemning Trump’s threat, saying on X that his country would raise the issue directly with Washington.\n\n“Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,” Starmer said.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa said in separate but identical posts on X that the European Union stood in “full solidarity” with Denmark and Greenland.\n\n“Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty,” they said.\n\nOfficials from Norway, Sweden, France and Germany reiterated support for Denmark today and said tariffs should not be part of Greenland discussions.\n\nCyprus, which currently holds the EU presidency, said it has called for an emergency meeting of ambassadors from the union’s 27 countries on Sunday.\n\nToday’s threat could derail tentative deals Trump struck last year with the European Union and Great Britain. The deals included baseline levies of 15% on imports from Europe and 10% on most British goods.\n\n“The biggest danger, it seems to me, is his decision to treat some EU countries different from others,” said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I’m not surprised … It may well convince the European Parliament that it is pointless to approve the trade agreement with the U.S., since Trump is already bypassing it.”\n\nTrump floated the general idea of tariffs over Greenland on Friday, without citing a legal basis for doing so. Tariffs have become his weapon of choice in seeking to compel American adversaries and allies alike to meet his demands.\n\nHe said this week he would put 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran as that country suppressed anti-government protests, though there has been no official documentation from the White House of the policy on its website, nor information about the legal authority Trump would use.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has heard arguments on the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and any decision by the top U.S. judicial body would have major implications on the global economy and U.S. presidential powers.\n\nThe encroaching presence of China and Russia makes Greenland vital to U.S. security interests, Trump has said. Danish and other European officials have pointed out that Greenland is already covered by NATO’s collective security pact.\n\nA U.S. military base, Pituffik Space Base, is already in Greenland, with around 200 personnel, and a 1951 agreement allows the United States to deploy as many forces as it wants in the Danish territory.\n\nThat has led many European officials to conclude that Trump is motivated more by a desire to expand U.S. territory than by security concerns.\n\n“China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on X in response to Trump’s threat.\n\nSome U.S. senators also pushed back. “Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America’s allies,” Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Thom Tillis, bipartisan co-chairs of the Senate NATO Observer Group, said in a statement.\n\nEuropeans should not react hastily to Trump’s tariff threat, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research.\n\n“Just ignore it and wait and see,” Brzeski told Reuters. “Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.”","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark&#8217;s vast Arctic island.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2026/01/17/breaking-news/trump-vows-tariffs-on-8-european-nations-over-greenland/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_2026-01-17T175343Z_1032320531_RC223JAPF25M_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 00:21:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056}]}
