Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under Trump's order. The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows non-citizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.

Trump repeatedly hinted during his campaign that he would declare extraordinary powers to confront illegal immigration and laid additional groundwork in a slew of executive orders on January 20. His proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. US District Judge James E Boasberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, blocked anyone from being deported under Trump's proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.

In 1798, with the US preparing for what it believed would be a war with France, Congress passed a series of laws that increased the federal government's reach. Worried that immigrants could sympathise with the French, the Alien Enemies Act was created to give the president wide powers to imprison and deport non-citizens in time of war. Since then, the act has been used just three times: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. During World War II, with anti-foreigner fears sweeping the country, it was part of the legal rationale for mass internment in the US of people of German, Italian and especially Japanese ancestry. An estimated 1.2 lakh people with Japanese heritage, including those with US citizenship, were incarcerated during the war. What brought this to a head on a Saturday? The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward preemptively sued Trump late on Friday in federal court in Washington, DC, saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention centre in Raymondville, Texas, were at \"imminent risk of removal\" under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg blocked their deportation, prompting an immediate appeal from the Justice Department. Almost simultaneously, the Trump administration agreed to pay El Salvador USD 6 million to imprison about 300 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang for one year. The agreement with El Salvador followed discussions between that country's president, Nayib Bukele, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio about housing migrants in El Salvador's notorious prisons. Bukele's government has arrested more than 84,000 people, sometimes without due process, since 2022 in a crackdown on gang violence. ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said two flights on Saturday may have carried people deported under Trump's proclamation, one to El Salvador and one possibly to Honduras. Boasberg said any such flights would have to be returned midair to the United States. The US is not at war, is it? For years, Trump and his allies have argued that America is facing an \"invasion\" of people arriving illegally. Arrests on the US border with Mexico topped 2 million (20 lakh) a year for two straight years for the first time under President Joe Biden, with many released into the US to pursue asylum. After hitting an all-time monthly high of 2.5 lakh in December 2023, they plunged to less than 8,400 this February -- the lowest levels since the 1960s. The act, Trump said in his inaugural address, would be a key tool in his immigration crackdown. \"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil,\" he said. \"As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions.\" Critics say Trump is wrongly using the act to target non-state actors, not foreign governments. \"Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse,\" the Brennan Centre for Justice wrote, calling it \"at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice\". \"Summary detentions and deportations under the law conflict with contemporary understandings of equal protection and due process,\" the Brennan Centre said. Does illegal immigration constitute an invasion? It is a new and untested argument. Trump has warned of the power of Latin American criminal gangs in the US, but only a tiny percentage of the people living illegally in the US are criminals. Trump, in his wartime declaration on Saturday, said Tren de Aragua \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion of predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\". He said the gang was engaged in \"irregular warfare\" against the United States at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Last month, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua and seven other Latin American crime organisations as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", upping pressure on cartels operating in the US and on anyone aiding them. Congress' research arm said in a report last month officials may use the foreign terrorist designations to argue the gang's activities in the US amount to a limited invasion. \"This theory appears to be unprecedented and has not been subject to judicial review,\" the Congressional Research Service said. The Venezuelan government has not typically taken its people back from the US, except on a few occasions. Over the past few weeks, about 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:28 GMT, 16 March 2025 | Updated: 00:48 GMT, 16 March 2025\n\nWorkers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are said to be completely 'paralyzed' in the middle of tax season as chaos reigns supreme following the arrival of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe tax-collecting agency that has long been a target for Republicans, is planning to eliminate 20% to 25% of its workforce by May 15, according to a person briefed on the agency's plans. \n\nThe agency has been thrown into turmoil with inside sources saying the future of America's tax collection itself is teetering on the edge of collapse. \n\nThe IRS had about 100,000 workers when Trump took office, meaning up to 25,000 are set to lose their jobs.\n\nThe 20% to 25% target includes the roughly 5,000 IRS employees who took a buyout last month and potentially 7,000 probationary workers who were fired, though court rulings could lead to the reinstatement of probationary staff, the person said.\n\n'They just randomly drop by people's offices, demanding access to systems; they're bullying us and there's no discipline in what they are doing, which really worries me,' one IRS employee said during a hushed phone call with CNN. \n\n'It's a clusterf***, and I can't believe no one is stepping in to do anything.'\n\nIt all began quietly on a gray morning in mid-February when Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-old tech wiz who was seemingly plucked straight from a Silicon Valley coding bootcamp.\n\nWorkers at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are said to be completely 'paralyzed' in the middle of tax season as chaos reigns supreme following the arrival of Elon Musk's DOGE\n\nElon Musk heads President Donald Trump's DOGE which has been slashing government costs\n\nDemonstrators from the Indivisible Project gather outside a Tesla facility in Arizona on Friday, calling for Elon Musk's removal from government influence\n\nKliger marched into the IRS headquarters in Washington DC without so much as a security escort. \n\nStunned staffers say his mission was to seize control of the IRS's tax administration systems.\n\nWithin minutes, Kliger was reportedly demanding access to databases holding the sensitive financial data of millions of American taxpayers. That data is protected under some of the strictest confidentiality laws in the federal government.\n\n'He just walked in like he owned the place as if decades of taxpayer trust, laws, and protections didn't matter,' a veteran IRS manager recalled.\n\nKliger was soon joined by Sam Corcos, a 36-year-old entrepreneur whose past achievements include designing diet apps. \n\nCorcos was there to trim the fat off the IRS with 'delete' quickly becoming his favorite word.\n\nStaffers say he looked to terminate almost all IRS programs funded for the current fiscal year — programs specifically designed to modernize the tax filing process and improve customer service for millions of Americans.\n\n'They'll come in and say we're going to delete that initiative - 'delete' is one of their favorite terms,' an IRS employee said. '\n\nGavin Kliger, 25, is one of six baby-faced boys with little-to-no government experience handpicked by Elon Musk to sow havoc in the civil service\n\nKliger was soon joined by Sam Corcos, a 36-year-old entrepreneur whose past achievements include designing diet apps\n\nProtesters hold signs denouncing Musk's leadership and urging Tesla owners to divest as part of a broader movement\n\nThe rally is one of many nationwide, with organizers citing threats to democracy and public services\n\nSo far, Elon Musk, has stayed quiet when it comes to the IRS\n\n'So, we are scrambling to figure out: Does Sam have that authority? Does Gavin have that authority? Did Treasury give them that authority?'\n\nAs the DOGE operatives dug in, the casualties began to mount. \n\nBy March, thousands of IRS employees had already been fired - everyone from from auditors to customer service reps - as DOGE pushed a sweeping plan to eliminate nearly 20% of the workforce before the May 15 deadline.\n\nMore than 110 taxpayer assistance offices are set to close, leaving vast swaths of the country without in-person help during the busiest tax season of the year.\n\nAn atmosphere of despair has now taken hold within the walls of IRS offices.\n\n'It's now routine to see people crying in the office,' said one union leader outside Washington. 'Managers are walking around apologizing for firings they had no decision in.'\n\nAnother source put it more bluntly: 'We are paralyzed.'\n\nVeteran tax experts are sounding the alarm about what they see as a deliberate gutting of the IRS, with profound consequences for the entire US government. \n\nNina Olson, who spent nearly two decades as the independent National Taxpayer Advocate, described the cuts as 'basically gutting the agency.'\n\n'You've got a lot of new blood getting fired, that's supposed to be the future of the workforce,' Olson said to CNN.\n\nElon Musk and his son son X follow President Trump and board Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on Friday in Maryland. Trump is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort\n\nThe IRS had about 100,000 workers when Trump took office, meaning up to 25,000 are set to lose their jobs\n\n'Then you've got the most skilled people, at the height of their institutional knowledge, leaving through retirement. None of this bodes well for the taxpayers.'\n\nWith processing returns and issuing refunds continuing on autopilot for now the real danger lies just beyond in the near future with crippling delays, skyrocketing customer service wait times, and a tax system more vulnerable to fraud and abuse.\n\nThe IRS's once-improving customer service stats are set to reverse as a result of the cut. \n\nThe average phone wait time, which had been brought down from 28 minutes in 2022 to just three minutes last year, will likely spiral back to pre-reform chaos.\n\n'In many cases, those long wait times ended with a courtesy disconnect,' an IRS employee lamented. 'They just hung up on you - so we are going back to those days.'\n\nThe IRS leadership is itself in also in freefall. \n\nAfter Biden-appointed commissioner Danny Werfel resigned on Inauguration Day, without waiting for the end of his five-year term, chaos reigned. \n\nHis acting successor retired mere weeks later, and Trump's nominee, former GOP Congressman Billy Long, still awaits Senate confirmation. \n\nMelanie Krause, now acting head of the agency, has only three-and-a-half years of IRS experience under her belt.\n\nSo far, Elon Musk, has stayed quiet. GOP Rep. Pete Sessions brushed off Musk's role, saying Musk is 'trying to get the astronauts back from space' and is more interested in White House 'photo opportunities' than running the IRS - but the fingerprints of Musk's budget-busting ideology are everywhere.\n\nIn a Bloomberg op-ed, Werfel likened DOGE's brazen demands to 'the CEO of a bank walking into a branch and demanding access to all of the customers' safe-deposit boxes.'\n\nMost chilling of all are allegations that DOGE's true mission may extend far beyond slashing budgets - toward weaponizing tax data against undocumented immigrants.\n\nFederal workers shout chants during a rally across the street from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters, in support of the civil service in the wake of mass firings\n\nSaturday's rally in support of the civil service comes in the wake of mass firings and organized by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) in Kansas City, Missouri\n\nAccording to sources, DHS has circulated a memo asking the IRS for sweeping amounts of data on immigrants who used individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) to pay taxes. \n\nThese include home addresses and employment information - data strictly protected under federal law.\n\nTwo IRS insiders say DOGE operatives are already searching for ways to facilitate these handovers - a move immigrant-rights advocates warn would lead to mass arrests and deportations, in violation of decades-old taxpayer privacy protections.\n\nTwo immigrant rights groups have sued the IRS and Treasury, warning that if DOGE succeeds, their members could face 'harm in the form of the arrest, detention, or other deprivations of liberty associated with the Trump Administration's stated intention to engage in mass actions against immigrants.'\n\nAs Americans rush to file taxes, most remain unaware that behind the scenes, the very agency responsible for funding the government is being dismantled before their eyes.\n\nCNNElon Musk\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nIRS workers 'paralyzed' by DOGE's massive cuts claim Elon Musk's budget busters are reshaping the agency\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has stormed into the IRS, slashing thousands of jobs, shutting down taxpayer assistance centers, and demanding access to sensitive taxpayer data.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14503235/IRS-workers-paralyzed-DOGEs-massive-cuts-claim-Elon-Musks-budget-busters-reshaping-agency.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/15/23/96232233-0-image-m-31_1742083087382.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/05/7861680328058031047/1024x576_MP4_7861680328058031047.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-16 00:48:48","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":300608828,"title":"US sacks SA envoy; brands him a 'hater'","text":"WASHINGTON/JOHANNESBURG: The US is expelling South Africa's ambassador, secretary of state Marco Rubio said, calling the envoy a \"race-baiting politician\" who hates President Donald Trump.Ties have slumped since Trump cut US financial aid to South Africa, citing disapproval of its land policy and its genocide case against Washington's ally Israel at the International Court of Justice. \"South Africa's Ambassador to the United States is no longer welcome in our great country,\" Rubio said on Friday in a post on X about the rare barring of a nation's top diplomat. \"Ebrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @Potus (Trump).\"In statements from its presidency and international relations department, South Africa called the move regrettable but said it remained committed to building mutually beneficial relations and would address the matter via diplomatic channels.Rubio reposted an article from right-wing website Breitbart that quoted the envoy as saying that Trump was leading a white supremacist movement.

The US President's allegation was fuelled by SpaceX boss Mr Musk, who spoke of mounting a 'rescue mission'.\n\nNASA dismissed the criticism, insisting it had to maintain crew levels on the space station and needed time both to return the malfunctioning Starliner to Earth unmanned and find a berth for Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams through 'normal astronaut rotation'.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Wilmore also rejected any suggestion of political spin, insisting: 'We came prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short.'\n\nHe added: 'That's what your nation's human spaceflight programme is all about... planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.'\n\nThe astronauts are expected to head back in the SpaceX Crew Dragon on Wednesday, along with NASA's Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.\n\nButch Wilmore (left), 62, and Suni Williams (right), 59, were due to spend just eight days in space piloting Boeing's Starliner on a test mission to the ISS\n\nThe astronauts are expected to head back in the SpaceX Crew Dragon (pictured, launching yesterday) on Wednesday \n\nThe astronauts will return along with NASA's Nick Hague (centre back) and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov (centre front)\n\nUntil then, the ISS will be relatively crowded with 11 crew members on board, including last night's four new arrivals.\n\nWhile unplanned, Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams's nine-month stay is far from the longest experienced by an ISS astronaut.\n\nThat record is held by NASA's Frank Rubio, a former Blackhawk combat helicopter pilot, who was there for 371 days.\n\nTension between SpaceX and NASA has recently centred on successful demands by Mr Trump and Mr Musk to bring the current crew rotation forward from March 26, swapping the planned capsule for one that would be ready sooner. This is said to have affected an established safety and preparation protocol.\n\nNASA's space operations chief Ken Bowersox told reporters that it was hard for his team to keep up with SpaceX, adding: 'We're not quite as agile as they are.

Republican governors and lawmakers across the country had accused then-President Joe Biden of failing to enforce federal immigration law and manage the southern border. Also Read | Famous Birthdays on March 16: Rajpal Yadav, Blake Griffin, James Madison and Alexandra Daddario - Know About Celebrities and Influential Figures Born on March 16. In response, Iowa and Oklahoma enacted similar laws that let state and local officials arrest and charge people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously were removed from or denied admission to the US. Both laws followed one enacted in Texas. The Biden administration sued Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma over the respective laws. Texas' more expansive law was in effect for only a few confusing hours last March before a federal appeals court put it on hold. Also Read | Donald Trump Signs Bill Funding Government for 6 Months, Ending Threat of Partial Government Shutdown. The Iowa and Oklahoma laws have themselves been on hold while courts consider whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal immigration authority. \"The Biden administration's absurd opposition to (Oklahoma's law) was particularly frustrating since it was the White House's gross negligence on border security that had made the state law so necessary in the first place,\" Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement on Friday. Trump ran for office on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the US illegally, promises he acted on with executive orders during his first week in office that conflicted with the prior administration's legal position in the two cases. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird described the Trump administration's move to dismiss a \"major victory\" for Iowans. \"Today, President Trump, again, proved that he has Iowa's back and showcased his commitment to Making America Safe Again by dropping Biden's ridiculous lawsuit,\" Bird said in a statement. An immigrant rights group also sued Iowa last May over its law, but the 8th Circuit US Court of Appeals recently issued a decision that complicates the legal battle now that the Trump administration has withdrawn the federal government's complaint. The appellate court said the lawsuit filed by Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice should be dismissed by the district court judge, arguing the US v. Iowa lawsuit made it moot. Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, said in a statement on Friday they intended to continue fighting to keep Iowa's law from taking effect. \"With today's DOJ filing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to working to keep this harmful law from being enforced in Iowa,\" Bettis Austen said. Lawyers representing Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice in February filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court.

This comes as Britain indicated that planning is progressing towards an active operational stage.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer recently brought together a group of 29 Western countries, including European nations, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, forming a ‘coalition of the willing’ to address the situation in Ukraine. Notably, the United States was not included in this alliance.\n\nMr. Starmer announced that the planning for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine is advancing towards becoming operational. He called for tangible commitments from the gathered nations to provide support to Kyiv and appealed for increased pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n‘We will build up Ukraine’s own defences and armed forces, and be ready to deploy as a ‘coalition of the willing’ in the event of a peace deal, to help secure Ukraine on the land, at sea and in the sky,’ Mr Starmer said. \n\nThe UK PM has said Britain could send peacekeepers to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire deal but has called on Washington to offer a security ‘backstop’. \n\nMr Albanese said it was in the Australian national interest to support Ukraine.\n\n‘Australia is open to considering any requests to contribute to a future peacekeeping effort in support of the just and lasting peace we all want for Ukraine,’ Mr Albanese said.\n\n‘Australia is always open to considering any new proposals to support Ukraine – which we do so based on our capacity and comparative strengths.’\n\nMr Albanese’s comment comes after Moscow warned any push by pro-Ukraine countries to join ‘the coalition of the willing would entail grave consequences’.\n\n‘Once again, Western boots on the ground are unacceptable for Russia, and we will not remain passive observers,’ a statement from the Russian Embassy said.\n\n‘To those inclined to construe the above as a threat: it is not. It is a warning.’\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell said the outcome of the Russo-Ukraine war directly affected Australian interests. \n\n‘It’s Australia’s fight. It is Australia’s fight. It’s in our interest to defend democracy in Ukraine,’ he told Sky News.\n\nMr Farrell went as far as to say that putting Australian troops on the ground in Ukraine as peacekeepers would be ‘the right thing to do’.\n\n‘If we can make a contribution to that peacekeeping effort, then I think we should… Australia supports the Ukrainian fight,’ he said.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton however has dismissed the idea of sending Australian peacekeepers to Ukraine as a ‘thought bubble’.\n\nThe call on Saturday builds on a flurry of diplomacy between European and other Western countries to find ways to help Ukraine after US President Donald Trump up-ended Washington’s previous support and launched peace talks with Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also joined Saturday’s virtual meeting in which leaders pledged to accelerate military support and tighten sanctions against Russia.\n\nMr Starmer said the Kremlin’s ‘dithering and delay’ over Trump’s ceasefire proposal, and Russia’s ‘continued barbaric attacks’ on Ukraine, ‘run entirely counter’ to Putin’s stated desire for peace.\n\nMr Albanese said it was not just a struggle for Ukraine’s national sovereignty. \n\n‘This is a struggle for the international rule of law,’ he said.\n\n‘What happens in the Euro-Atlantic has serious implications for our region – the Indo-Pacific – and vice versa.’\n\nMr Albanese noted that Putin’s regime had ‘imperialist designs, for Ukraine and beyond’. \n\n‘We must ensure Russia’s illegal and immoral actions are not rewarded through any peace process,’ he said.\n\nAustralia has committed $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including $1.3 billion in military support and equipment such as Bushmaster vehicles. It has also helped train Ukrainian soldiers.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDuring a virtual meeting with allied nations, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese restated&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Anthony Albanese stands firm on Ukraine stance despite Russia&#8217;s stark warning. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/anthony-albanese-stands-firm-on-ukraine-stance-despite-russias-stark-warning/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/16/00/96235461-14503455-image-a-26_1742084949996.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-16 00:41:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.003},{"id":300607160,"title":"US tariffs should be a 'wake-up call' for Australia","text":"Camera IconThe coalition wants the prime minister to negotiate directly with Donald Trump on tariffs.

Smith interviews Trump’s border leader about Biden’s immigration policy after criticizing Democrats","text":"Stephen A. Smith’s foray into politics continued on Friday’s podcast, where the ESPN star heard serious allegations against the Biden Administration from President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan.\n\nHoman echoed accusations that Democrats hoped to turn undocumented migrants into a liberal voting block and specifically named Joe Biden’s Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as a bad actor in this scheme.\n\nIntrigued, Smith wanted to know why Biden reversed many Obama-era border policies when he assumed office after beating Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n‘The numbers show, he actually deported more immigrants out of this country than Trump did,’ Smith said of Obama, as quoted by Mediaite.com. ‘Yet Biden comes into office in 2020, and he went completely against what Obama had done. You ever received intel explanation as to why he did that?’\n\nHoman responded with the right’s long-held belief that Biden’s executive order directing census workers to include undocumented immigrants was part of a greater effort to transform migrants into citizens and voters.\n\n‘Now I surmise, I have an opinion, that I think this administration thought these millions of people were gonna be future Democratic voters,’ said Homan. ‘But one of the things Biden also did, in addition to destroying all the programs we put in place to give us the most secure border, he overturned the Trump Census rule, which means millions of people they release in sanctuary cities will be counted in the next Census, which is gonna result in what? More seats in the House for the Dems.\n\n‘They saw a future political benefit with this,’ Homan continued. ‘So both those men knew how we solved that crisis. When it came back in as now the Secretary and the President, what did they do? The complete opposite.’\n\nUS immigration detention hit capacity at 47,600 detainees, a senior official said this week, adding that more bed space will be needed.\n\nHoman said in December 2024 that the Trump administration is seeking 100,000 beds for a mass deportation effort targeting all of immigration violators, regardless of criminal status.\n\nSmith has laughed off claims that he could run for president in 2028, describing rumors of a potential election bid as ‘hilarious’.\n\nThe ESPN host has been flirting with the possibility of running for president after a national survey revealed last month that he would receive more support than several high-profile Democrat hopefuls in three years’ time.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com shortly after the survey was released, Smith left the door open to run if the American people call for it, despite stressing that he has no personal desire to do so.\n\nYet during an appearance on American journalist Karen Hunter’s podcast this week, he expressed disbelief that the public is even considering him as a potential candidate to take on Donald Trump .\n\n‘I’m laughing like… are y’all serious?’ Smith initially said before joking, ‘and then I thought, I’m Stephen A. Smith and I approve this message, and God bless the United States of America!\n\nSmith also talked up his shock emergence as a potential presidential candidate during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last week.\n\nWhen asked by Fallon why he has emerged as a candidate for the Democrats, the sportscaster said on the late-night talk show: ‘Folks are nuts, number one. Number two, the Democratic party… they lost. They had a bad few months, we all know this. \n\n‘And even though there’s a lot of qualified Democrats all over the country from a local perspective, governors, mayors, stuff like that… there’s no real national voice. And to moi… they’ve come to me.’\n\nHe also took aim at the left in the lead-up to Trump’s recent Congressional address. Specifically, Smith eviscerated Senators Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and 19 others for repeating the same scripted White House protest, verbatim, online.\n\n‘Now you see why Stephen A. Smith was in the polls as a presidential candidate?’ Smith asked after showing a clip of Warren, Booker and others’ attempts to correct the President’s record on inflation and other issues.\n\n‘See what I’m talking about?’ the increasingly agitated Smith continued. ‘You see that idiocy right there? You talk about something, people being tone def. Why the hell would 22 Democratic senators be literally echoing the same thing and think that would resonate with the American people. All it shows is that the same fabric of our democracy is unchanging…\n\n‘Do I have to come up to Capitol Hill and give you lessons? Seriously, you don’t get it.’\n\nAmid talk of a shock election run, Smith recently put pen to paper on a staggering $100million contract with ESPN.\n\nThe First Take host, NBA analyst, podcaster and frequent talk show guest has agreed to a five-year deal that will pay an average of $20m annually, according to The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand. He has been making a reported $12 million annually amid months of speculation about his next contract. \n\nPreviously The Wall Street Journal reported Smith rejected an $18m-a-year offer from ESPN. Multiple outlets have since reported he was seeking $25m annually from the network as part of his next deal.\n\nAlthough he will stay on at First Take, his daily daytime show on ESPN, the tireless worker will not be seen quite so extensively on the network, one source told The Athletic. He will no longer be a centerpiece of NBA pregame shows, but might begin making some Monday Night Football appearances. \n\nThis should allow him to do more political commentary away from the network, sources told Marchand.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nStephen A.

She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.\n\n\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"\n\nKim’s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. \n\nZack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.\n\nYears later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.\n\nIn this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. \n\nA compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. \n\nThis Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (£2bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.\n\nAmong the areas covered were parts of New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.\n\nSt Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.

This order blocks the deportation of any non-citizens in custody and facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act for at least 14 days. \n\nThe decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward challenging Trump’s order hours before he signed it.\n\n“I think there’s clearly irreparable harm here given these folks will be deported,” Boasberg said. “A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm.”\n\n“Particularly given the plaintiffs’ information, unrebutted by the government, that flights are actively departing and planning to depart, I do not believe that I’m able to wait any longer,” he added. “Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.”\n\nThe White House was preparing to move some 300 people the administration identified as members of the gang to El Salvador, the Associated Press reports.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Boasberg had issued a preemptive block on the removal of the five Venezuelans identified in the lawsuit who believed they were about to be removed. At that point, Trump had not yet signed the executive order.\n\nTrump issued the executive order on Saturday afternoon, invoking the rarely-used wartime power against members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Trump’s order claims the gang is invading the US, and under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration has new powers to deport members.\n\n“I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,” Trump wrote in his order.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio labeled the gang a foreign terrorist organization last month following an executive order that allowed him to do so.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is intended to be invoked when the country is at war or if a foreign nation has invaded the U.S. or has issued threats that it will. While the administration is pointing to threats from gangs and cartels, legal experts noted that it will be challenging for the administration to use the law when the country isn’t being actively attacked by a foreign government.\n\nBeatriz Lopez, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, said in a statement that “Trump is unearthing one of America’s darkest laws to launch a deportation dragnet unlike anything in modern history.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.","summary":"Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on Saturday via executive order","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-alien-enemies-act-deportations-blocked-b2715900.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/15/18/Trump_36890.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HwRADPDm-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-16 00:14:21","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":300603682,"title":"Prime Minister facing Cabinet revolt over 'Trumpian' plan to take axe to bloated state","text":"Sir Keir Starmer will this week try to face down a revolt from the Labour Left over his 'Trumpian' plan to take an axe to the bloated British state.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband are leading opposition to departmental spending cuts as part of a wider package which could include up to £6 billion being sliced from the welfare budget.\n\nThe Prime Minister has been told that he could face frontbench resignations, with friends of Mr Miliband warning that even he 'would walk' if the £8 billion budget for his beloved GB Energy renewable energy investment body is targeted by Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\n\nMPs on the Right of the party hit back yesterday by saying they would welcome such a move – because the former leader is 'associated with failure' and 'plays badly in the Red Wall seats'. However, last night there were claims that Mr Miliband had 'seen off' dramatic cuts to his budget amid fears that his resignation now would be too damaging to the Government.\n\nThe threat of massive reductions in the welfare bill and deep cuts in other government spending has plunged the Labour movement into turmoil barely seven months into Sir Keir's administration.\n\nIn a stormy Cabinet meeting last week, Ms Rayner and Mr Miliband were joined by other ministers including Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Commons Leader Lucy Powell in forcibly objecting to planned cuts of up to 11 per cent in so-called 'unprotected' departments such as environment, local government and justice.\n\nHowever, the prospect of Ms Reeves taking an axe to budgets or raising taxes in her spring statement later this month only appeared to increase yesterday with the news that the economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.1 per cent in January.\n\nAnd one Cabinet ally of Sir Keir said that the PM had been 'emboldened' by Donald Trump's swift public sector reforms, including savage cuts to the US federal workforce under the oversight of Tesla and X boss Elon Musk.\n\nLast week, Sir Keir appeared to prove that with his out-of-the-blue announcement that he was abolishing the giant quango NHS England, to the shock of its 14,000 staff.\n\nThe minister said: 'You won't see Keir appearing onstage with a chainsaw, like Musk did. But there is no doubt that we feel emboldened by the pace and extent of change in Washington.'\n\nDetails of potentially huge cuts to the welfare system – whose spending Sir Keir has described as 'unsustainable' and 'indefensible' – are due to be unveiled by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall later this week. Ministers are planning to make it harder for people to qualify for personal independence payments.\n\nThe cost of the beneft, designed to help with the living costs of those with physical or mental health conditions or disabilities, has doubled in half a decade.\n\nIn a sign of fury on Labour's Left, veteran MP Diane Abbott angrily complained last week that she and other colleagues were unable to challenge Sir Keir at a meeting on the issue last week because they were told the event was full.\n\nIn an apparent swipe at Sir Keir, she added: 'Keen on dissent in other countries – not so much here.'\n\nYesterday she posted on social media that it would be 'good' if frontbenchers quit over plans to freeze some disability benefits, saying: 'If anyone in Labour came into politics to cut welfare, they joined the wrong party.'\n\nA fellow Labour veteran MP said: 'They can shut Diane out of a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting but they can't shut the Labour rank and file out of this.\n\n'If the cuts are on the scale they're talking about, there's no way Starmer will silence the Party. There will be a huge revolt on the Left.'\n\nHowever, writing in The Mail on Sunday, former Labour Cabinet minister David Blunkett made clear that cutting the benefits bill and getting people back into work 'could not come a moment too soon'.\n\nIn his article, he writes that 'the doubters in my party must see that we cannot help those who need support the most and continue to find billions of pounds in additional welfare payments at the same time. The two things are incompatible.'\n\nHe added: 'That so many of our youth are deemed to be completely inactive is a generational timebomb that stores all sorts of social ills for decades to come.'\n\nSeparately, one Labour MP predicted last night that despite the increasing marginalisation of Mr Miliband's Net Zero green agenda, the former party leader would stay in post because 'he enjoys his Red Box and official car too much'.\n\nThe MP said: 'It's about time Ed did something and made a stand but he won't go.'\n\nHowever, the MP warned that whatever Sir Keir thought, the team around the PM 'hate Ed Miliband', especially Peter Mandelson, now Britain's ambassador to the US. They added: 'Ed represents to Keir's team all the woke issues that they don't like. And they think he is synonymous with defeat.\n\n'Plenty of people in No 10 would be happy for Ed to go because they don't think all this green stuff is working in the Red Wall seats.","summary":"Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband are leading opposition to departmental spending cuts.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14503405/keir-starmer-cabinet-trumpian-state.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/15/23/96234583-0-image-m-100_1742080467162.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/12/9101216496013230215/1024x576_MP4_9101216496013230215.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-16 00:12:43","author":"Brendan Carlin,Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Brendan Carlin","Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":300604274,"title":"World News | EAM Jaishankar Thanks Iranian Counterpart for Wishes on 75 Years of Diplomatic Relations","text":"New Delhi [India], March 16 (ANI): External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar on Saturday thanked his Iranian counterpart Seyed Abbas Araghchi for his \"warm\" wishes on the occasion of 75 years of diplomatic relations between both countries.

It comes as Elon Musk insists America is not a true democracy if judges who attempt to block President Donald Trump ‘s cost-cutting agenda are permitted to keep their spot on the bench.\n\nAnother federal judge ordered probationary government employees laid off in this year’s mass firings be rehired. Trump clarified earlier this month that Musk’s job at DOGE is to recommend areas where the federal government can slash waste and save taxpayers money. The president told his Cabinet officials that they would be in charge of implementing these recommendations at their respective departments and agencies to bring them into compliance with his agenda.\n\nMeanwhile, USPS Postmaster General Louis DeJo signed an agreement with DOGE to cut thousands of jobs and billions of dollars from its budget. DeJoy sent a letter to members of Congress on Thursday informing them of the agreement with DOGE and the General Services Administration (GSA).\n\n‘Fixing a broken organization that had experienced close to $100 billion in losses and was projected to lose another $200 billion, without a bankruptcy proceeding, is a daunting task,’ DeJoy wrote. \n\nHe added: ‘Fixing a heavily legislated and overly regulated organization as massive, important, cherished, misunderstood and debated as the United States Postal Service, with such a broken business model, is even more difficult.’\n\nCourts are trying to stop Musk from continuing his rampage through the federal government as thousands of workers lost their jobs in the last two months. Judge William Alsup, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, has ordered the Trump administration to rehire 30,000 probationary hires who were included in mass, indiscriminate layoffs.\n\n‘Without judicial reform, which means at least the absolute worst judges get impeached, we don’t have real democracy in America,’ Musk wrote in response to a tweet on the judge’s action. Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.) is targeting Judge Paul Engelmayer for halting the ability for DOGE to access Treasury Department systems. And Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) took aim at Judge John McConnell Jr. for pausing federal funding freezes.’\n\nAnd in response to these actions in Congress, Musk wrote on X: ‘Momentum is growing rapidly to impeach activist judges who repeatedly fail to follow the law.’ Last month, Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced articles of impeachment against District Judge John Bates for attempting to block Trump’s executive order calling for the removal of government web pages containing resources for ‘gender-affirming care.’\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Six months previously Leo Varadkar also faced pressure from back home to speak up about Gaza.\n\nAt the time, he said he had to tailor his message to suit the American audience, stating that many in the US had a very different take on what was going on in Palestine. Varadkar did make many speeches on the matter though throughout his US visit. \n\nIt is fair to say that both Fine Gael leaders were heavily criticised for perhaps not being as candid as some back home would have liked. Before they even set foot in Washington DC they also faced calls to boycott the St Patrick’s Day trip. \n\nMartin didn’t come in for the same level of scrutiny\n\nThis year, the level of scrutiny has not been the same for the Fianna Fáil leader. \n\nIt is fair to say, the Trump administration is a very different ball game than that of Biden’s, who could probably be classed as one of the most Irish US presidents we have seen. \n\nThe stakes are higher with Trump, there’s no doubt about that. \n\nThe situation in Gaza has moved on somewhat, with hostages being exchanged and a ceasefire in place. However, the Taoiseach has previously said that it is when the violence stops is when much of the hard work will have to begin.\n\nBut it is clear the focus on Martin’s trip was basically to get out unscathed, with no real pressure put on him to put his head above the parapet, especially when it came to US foreign policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White HouseTasos Katopodis / Government of Ireland\n\nTasos Katopodis / Government of Ireland / Government of Ireland\n\nThe Taoiseach did manage to speak on the matter in front of Trump, after the US President was asked about Ireland’s Occupied Territories Bill. \n\nMartin complimented Trump, stating that he is very clued into the situation in Palestine, stating that Ireland shares the US President’s “unrelenting focus on peace”, highlighting that in his first few days in office Trump went to get a ceasefire.\n\n“We’ve been calling for a ceasefire for a long time. We want to consolidate the peace that is our fundamental and we went to hostages out I’ve been saying it from day one. It is a terrible thing to do, to take someone as a hostage,” said Martin, who told the media in the Oval Office that in the aftermath of 7 October, he travelled to visit the Kibbutz at the centre of the attack, stating that it is something that will never leave him. \n\nHe called for the hostages to be released, for the ceasefire to be consolidated and for a surge in humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\n“There’s too many children and too many people starving. And it’s that humanitarian impulse in what motivates the Irish,” said Martin, who said that it is also Ireland’s long-held view that there should be a two-state solution.\n\n“It’s become much more challenging and difficult as time has moved on,” he added. \n\nLike Varadkar and Harris before him, he juxtaposed the idea of peace in Gaza with that of peace in Northern Ireland.\n\nMartin and taoisigh before him have repeatedly made the point to US presidents that the peace in Northern Ireland is one of the America’s greatest foreign policy achievements. \n\n“We’ve been through some of this, people hating each other, terrible acts of violence carried out on each other. We came through it. It’s our earnest hope that Arab and Jewish people can live side by side,” said the Taoiseach. \n\nUnlike taoisigh that went before him into the Oval Office, Martin was facing a very different situation, one where the unpredictability of Trump would have been at the fore of the Taoiseach’s mind. \n\nTaoiseach Micheál Martin at the US Capitol Building with Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson as part of the annual St Patrick’s Day celebrations.Tasos Katopodis / Government of Ireland\n\nTasos Katopodis / Government of Ireland / Government of Ireland\n\nEarlier this week, he said his number one priority in the White House was to protect Irish jobs.\n\nThe calls to interject in US foreign policy were again, muted, with a much bigger focus on not poking the bear.\n\nTalk of more tariffs\n\nDespite his best efforts, Trump showed clearly that he has a dislike of Europe and just mere hours after Martin left the shamrock ceremony, there was more talk of tariffs.\n\nOn the back of threats of tariffs on Irish whiskey, Harris will now pick up the mantel of protecting business back home, travelling to Philadelphia and New York this weekend.\n\nThe Tánaiste will hold a series of high-level political, Irish community and economic engagements in a bid to highlight the strength of Ireland’s mutually beneficial two-way economic relationship with the United States. \n\nRelated Reads\n\nTrump's US-Ireland trade deficit obsession is part of a wider battle, but how hurt could Ireland get?\n\n‘Don’t hesitate to pick up the phone’ – Donald Trump tells Taoiseach in private White House chat\n\n'Taking back what was stolen': How Trump is selling yesterday's Oval Office meeting to his followers\n\nThe main focus is on global multinationals and Irish companies “cutting their teeth in the US market”, he said. \n\nMuch of Tuesday will be focused on economic engagements and he will speak at a business breakfast co-hosted by Bank of Ireland New York Hub and Digital Irish, where he will meet with a range of senior corporate decision makers.\n\nAmongst those Harris will be meeting are Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies, Irish innovators and the financial services sector.\n\n“It is an important opportunity to highlight the mutually beneficial economic relationship between Ireland and the US,” he said. \n\nThe Tánaiste will tour the recently renovated Irish Arts Centre, attend the traditional breakfast reception hosted by the New York City Mayor in Gracie Mansion before attending Mass at St Patrick’s Cathedral.\n\nHarris will also be marching in the St Patrick’s Day parade along New York’s famous Fifth Avenue.\n\nHe will also join dignitaries including New York State Governor Kathy Hochul and attend a reception hosted by Ireland’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.\n\nThe programme concludes with a Tourism Ireland event promoting the Ryder Cup, which is due to take place in Ireland next year. \n\nUpon his return from the US next week, Harris will take back his knowledge gleaned in the states, and convene a meeting of the Government Trade Forum to discuss recent developments in EU-US trade.\n\nThe Tánaiste has written to members of the trade forum in advance of his visit to the US this weekend. He will update the forum next week on his call earlier this week with Maros Sefcovic, the European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security.\n\nHarris said the call was an important opportunity to hear directly from the Commissioner on EU efforts to work with the US and plans for taking forward counter measures in response to US tariffs on steel and aluminium.\n\nBefore heading stateside, the Tánaiste met with officials to discuss the latest trade developments and his department is now coordinating work across government to consider recent developments and potential further developments in the weeks ahead. \n\nA lot will be riding on this business and trade charm offensive to shore up support for what could be challenging months ahead. \n\nPolitical Editor Christina Finn will be covering the Tánaiste’s St Patrick’s Day trip to New York.

You’ve worked so hard on it.’ \n\nInstead of offering another response, the actress quickly walked towards an awaiting black SUV and hopped inside. \n\nHer latest outing comes after it was revealed the U.K. premiere of Snow White will not take place followed by the Hollywood screening on Saturday also being altered by Disney to avoid anti-woke backlash.\n\nEarlier this week, Disney chose to ‘scale back’ the movie’s premiere in Los Angeles, per Variety.\n\nThe screening is still slated to be held at the El Capitan Theatre with both Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot attending. However, it is reported that ‘coverage will be limited to photographers and a house crew.’\n\nMartin Klebba, who voiced the character of Grumpy, slammed Disney for choosing to scale back on the Hollywood premiere. \n\nTMZ reported that the actor – who is also known for appearing in the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise – is ‘seriously bummed and a bit pissed.’ \n\nHe briefly commented on the controversies surrounding the movie, as well as the political opinions of the leading stars but said it ‘shouldn’t have overshadowed everyone else’s hard work.’ \n\nAnd while talking to The Hollywood Reporter, he further commented on the screening which will take place on Saturday and expressed, ‘It really isn’t going to be a red carpet.\n\n‘It’s going to be at the El Capitan [Theatre], which is cool. But it’s basically going to be a pre-party, watch the movie, and that’s it.’\n\nMartin added, ‘There’s not going to be this whole hoopla of, “Disney’s first f***ing movie they ever made.” Because of all this controversy, they’re afraid of the blowback from different people in society.’ \n\nPeter Dinklage previously hit back at Disney for remaking Snow White which he labeled as a ‘f***ing backward story about seven dwarfs living in a cave together.’ \n\nKlebba said, ‘I don’t usually get into the political stuff, but I [felt], “Dwarfs aren’t going to go away just because you can’t imagine that they’re there.” \n\n‘We’re still going to be walking around. So I didn’t get the whole stuff about not doing the dwarfs. The story’s been around forever, and it’s a classic.’\n\nIt has also been rumored that there is a ‘feud’ behind-the-scenes with Rachel and Gal over their contrasting views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nA source recently told People that the two stars ‘have nothing in common’ and added, ‘On top of that, their political views differ, adding to the tension.’ \n\nA large scale premiere would have also taken place at Leicester Square in London, but an insider informed DailyMail.com earlier this month that a decision was made to not hold one for the upcoming movie.\n\n‘Disney are already anticipating an anti-woke backlash against Snow White and have reduced the media schedule to just a handful of tightly controlled press events,’ the source stated.\n\n‘That is why they have taken the highly unusual step not to host a London premiere for the film and are minimizing the amount of press questions that Rachel Zegler gets.’\n\nRachel has been embroiled in drama following her controversial comments on the Disney animation.\n\nShe sparked backlash after she called the storyline of the film ‘weird’ and also labeled the prince as a ‘stalker.’\n\nIn one past interview, Zegler had revealed that the new film would be going in a different direction and said of the character of Snow White: ‘She’s not going to be saved by the prince and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love.’\n\nThe star also faced backlash when she was first cast as Snow White as a Latina actress.\n\nIn response to the negative reception, Rachel penned in a since-deleted post: ‘yes i am snow white no i am not bleaching my skin for the role (sic).’\n\nIt was also revealed that Disney has ‘zero faith’ in the upcoming film and that the movie bosses simply want to get the movie’s limited promo ‘over with,’ per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nA source said, ‘An advance sales cycle of less than two weeks just screams, “We have zero faith in this thing.” And it couldn’t come at a worse point, when the industry is just trying to limp along to May.’\n\nHowever, insiders for Disney expressed that they, ‘always intended to hold back the film’s big promotional push until the final few weeks, beginning when Zegler and Gadot presented together at the Oscars on March 2.’\n\nOn Wednesday, Rachel made an appearance at a secret premiere for Snow White which was held at a remote castle in Segovia – a city located north west of Madrid.\n\nThe lowkey European event had 100 VIP guests in attendance which included families and content creators.\n\nZegler had the chance to sing Waiting On A Wish for the crowd – but was not joined by any of her other Snow White castmates, such as Gal Gadot.\n\nSources recently informed Page Six that Disney ‘doesn’t know what to do’ with ‘out of control’ Zegler.\n\n‘Disney’s lead actress is out of control. They don’t know what to do,’ an insider told the outlet.\n\n‘She’s an outspoken 20-something and Disney chiefs have called her directly and asked her to tone down her posts. They’ve called her management, but she won’t listen.\n\nThe insider added, ‘It’s been this way the entire way through filming. But it’s the tying of her politics to Snow White that is upsetting.’\n\nLate last year in November, separate sources claimed that Disney bosses viewed Rachel as a ‘loose cannon.’\n\nAt the time, Zegler had slammed Donald Trump voters – but later issued an apology for hoping that ‘Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.’\n\nAn insider told DailyMail.com, ‘They would love to be able to tell her to stop talking, but it is simply too late. They had talked about removing Rachel from the role several times when it was shooting in 2022.\n\n‘She is a loose cannon and caused issues during the production because she didn’t agree with how the film plot strayed from the classic movie’s plot.’\n\nThey added that before filming, Zegler ‘read the script. If she didn’t like it then she should have not taken it. It wasn’t until after the film was wrapped that she really started creating drama.\n\n‘She has been a nightmare but there is nothing they can do to control what she says. Everyone is well-aware of how difficult she is.’\n\nThe source continued, ‘Right now, it is way too late to shelve the film. As much as people think that her recent comments and controversies will hurt the film, it is not likely the case.\n\n‘If anything, it generates more publicity and attention to the film, which leads to increased ticket sales. The film is Snow White, and it could really sell with anyone in the lead.’\n\nWhile talking to Vogue Mexico, Rachel opened up about the backlash that Snow White has received.\n\n‘I interpret peoples’ feelings about this film as a passion for it.

It's not their first","text":"The year is 1976, Paul McCartney's Wings are top of the Billboard charts, and European wine is about to face its biggest fight against America's \"kids from the sticks\".\n\nThe \"Judgement of Paris\" — an event that uprooted the reputation of French wines in favour of Californian underdogs — would shift the wine market between the competing countries.\n\nNow, as European alcohol faces a new threat from a looming Donald Trump tariff war, here's how a blind taste test almost 50 years ago first ignited a rivalry between the United States and Europe.\n\nThe blind taste that changed the game\n\nA Parisian taste test between French wines and their Napa Valley counterparts seemed so ludicrous in 1976 that few journalists even showed up.\n\nThe exception was Time magazine's George Tabar, who viewed the event with skepticism.\n\n\"Everybody knows that French wines are going to win, so why waste a day?\" he recounted in 2016.\n\nAt the time, Napa Valley was barely a burgeoning wine destination.\n\nSome estimates show there were only 330 wineries in California in 1975, and most were considered eons behind their French rivals in Bordeaux and Burgundy.\n\nNot only was Californian wine unpopular overseas, the test's creator, Steven Spurrier, said it \"did not exist\" as far as the French were concerned.\n\nThe British-born Mr Spurrier believed it an unfair assessment and, imbued with a sense of wine justice, he put eight wines from Burgandy and Bordeaux up against 12 Californian rivals.\n\nTo equal out the contest, he made the then-unusual step of hiding the labels.\n\n\"I was an Englishman in Paris, I was already a square peg in a round hole,\" he later explained.\n\n\"And these were very, very good wines. So why don't we do something about it?\"\n\nWhat followed would be called \"a kick in the rear for French wine\".\n\n'Not bad for kids from the sticks'\n\nMr Spurrier's set of judges were nine French wine experts, who Mr Tabar described as an \"oenophile's Who's Who\".\n\nTheir reactions were, on the surface, predictable.\n\n\"Ah, back to France!\" exclaimed one — sipping a Napa Valley Chardonnay.\n\n\"That is definitely California. It has no nose,\" said another, after downing a French label.\n\nThe esteemed panel first awarded top scores to a 1973 chardonnay from a boutique vineyard in Calistoga, California.\n\nMr Taber called Jim Barrett, the part owner of Chateau Montelena, the vineyard that produced the winning white, for a reaction.\n\nReds were to follow and again, a Cabernet from Californian winery Stag's Leap took out the top prize.\n\nDespite French outrage, including from judge Odette Khan who unsuccessfully demanded her scorecard back, the results were undeniable.\n\nThe US wine market was catapulted into the international Zeitgeist, and today, the number of wineries in California is more than 3,000.\n\nNow, decades on, a looming tariff war has unearthed an old rivalry between the US and Europe.\n\nFrance shapes up to 'retaliate' in next big battle\n\nOn Thursday, the US president threatened to impose a 200 per cent tariff on alcohol from the European Union in a tit-for-tat feud after the bloc's planned 50 per cent levy on American bourbon whiskey.\n\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,\" Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.\n\nIn response, French Foreign Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said his country would \"not give in to threats\" and that it was \"determined to retaliate\".\n\nEven after US wine gained global respect, the nation still accounts for 31 per cent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat.\n\nLikewise, the EU accounted for roughly 40 per cent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.\n\nChampagne company Tattinger said a tariff war would mean their bottle prices could rise from $US60 to $US180 ($95 to $285).\n\nBordeaux Wine Council, the advocacy group for Napa Valley's old foes, says the US still remains the top market in terms of value and volume for wines from the region.\n\nAnd unlike 1976, a tariff spat could threaten the US market too.\n\nIn New York, Winestogo Wine & Spirits owner Mario Duta said both parties were \"playing poker\" with consumers.\n\n\"I think they need to act like grown-ups, sit at the table and make things fair,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"It will definitely affect the consumer because most, if not all of those tariffs are going to be passed on to the consumer.\n\n\"We have certain margins that we have to start at in order to keep the door open.\n\n\"And those tariffs, they will go to the consumer. They will be hurt.\n\nAustralia invokes 'buy local' in midst of war\n\nAfter the 1976 revelation, doors were opened to a whole new world of global wine suppliers, including those in Australia.\n\nAs Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' Ted Baseler told Time years later \"that helped other people say, 'Gee, we can too,' whether it was in New Zealand, Australia, Oregon, Washington, Chile\".\n\nAs of 2024, the US remains the third biggest importer of Australian wines, raking in $324.8 million.\n\nThat's more than 100 million litres of Australian produce a year.\n\nIn what could be seen as a potential pre-emptive measure, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spruiked the benefits of buying local and invoked \"Team Australia\" in a flurry of recent media appearances.\n\n\"Australians can have an impact by buying Australian goods,\" he told ABC Melbourne this week.","summary":"Almost 50 years ago, American wine faced its first David vs Goliath moment against Europe.

Israel says four other American hostages died in captivity. \n\nHaving grown up in Tenafly, New Jersey, Alexander decided to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces after he graduated from high school.\n\nHamas’ statement comes as talks continue in Doha to try to broker the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, the first phase of which ended two weeks ago. \n\n‘Yesterday, a Hamas leadership delegation received a proposal from the brotherly mediators to resume negotiations,’ a Hamas spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThe group added its reply ‘included its agreement to release the Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, who holds American citizenship, along with the remains of four others holding dual citizenship.’\n\nHamas official Husam Badran, in a separate statement, reaffirmed what he said was the organization’s commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases, warning that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.\n\nAmerican President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters at the White House early in March that gaining the release of Alexander was a ‘top priority’.\n\nFor weeks, the soldier’s mother Yael Alexander has been watching the release of hostages from Gaza, hoping she soon might see her son’s name on a list of those to be freed.\n\n‘This is a critical time,’ Yael said last month. ‘I know my son is probably in tunnels, so I understand that he’s not seeing sunlight, and the air is very thin underground.’\n\nShe added: ‘It’s very, very difficult for me to even think about it.’\n\nSince his abduction, Alexander’s relatives have divided their time between Israel, Washington, DC, where they meet frequently with politicians, and their New Jersey home. \n\nYael, who has participated in rallies demanding for the hostages to be released, previously said that Trump’s commitment to her son’s release sparked hope.\n\n‘Every time they say Edan’s name, it’s like they didn’t forget. They didn’t forget he’s American, and they’re working on it,’ she said.\n\nThe US, Qatar, and Egypt have been trying to bridge differences between Hamas and Israel to restart negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire deal in order to release the remaining hostages held in Gaza and facilitate the entry of aid into the war-torn enclave.\n\nIsrael is pressing the militant group to accept an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire.\n\nIsrael blocked the entry of aid trucks into Gaza on March 2 as a standoff over the truce escalated, with Hamas calling on Egyptian and Qatari mediators to intervene. \n\nHamas says it wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire’s more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.\n\nFighting in Gaza has been halted since January 19 under the first phase of the three-phase ceasefire accord. \n\nHamas has exchanged 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\n\nThe second phase involves talks over an agreement for the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave. \n\nIsrael demands that Hamas free the remaining hostages without beginning phase two negotiations.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIsrael is prepared to continue ceasefire talks based on a US proposal&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Benjamin Netanyahu is ready to discuss Gaza ceasefire talks following new hostage release suggestions first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/benjamin-netanyahu-is-ready-to-discuss-gaza-ceasefire-talks-following-new-hostage-release-suggestions/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/15/22/96233671-14503365-image-a-9_1742078087635.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 23:52:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":300602306,"title":"‘Not clear’ what Donald Trump wants from Australia, trade minister says","text":"Camera IconTrade Minister Don Farrell says it is “not clear” what the Trump administration wants from the Australia-US trade relationship.

Among the promising contenders is Lightchain AI, which has already raised over $17.3 million at a presale price of $0.006.\n\nWith its unique combination of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is positioned for significant growth in 2025. Alongside it, other altcoins like Polkadot, Cardano, and XRP are showing strong potential. As the market continues to evolve, these altcoins could experience massive gains, offering huge opportunities for investors seeking high returns in the coming years.\n\nBTC Surge Fuels Crypto Hype\n\n​Bitcoin’s recent surge has reignited global interest in cryptocurrencies. On March 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the creation of a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve, incorporating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano. This announcement led to a significant price increase;\n\nBitcoin rose 9% to $93,000, Ethereum jumped 11% to $2,500, Solana surged 20% to $169, XRP advanced 30% to $2.80, and Cardano soared nearly 60% to $1.02. This move underscores the growing institutional acceptance of digital assets.\n\nAnalysts predict Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by 2025, driven by broader adoption and favorable regulatory developments. However, the inherent volatility of the crypto market necessitates cautious and informed investment decisions.​\n\n4 Affordable Altcoins That Could Skyrocket to $100+\n\n​Investors are eyeing altcoins priced under $10 with the potential to surge beyond $100. Lightchain AI (LCAI), currently in its presale at $0.006, integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Analysts predict LCAI could reach $15 to $20 by 2025, with potential to hit $50 to $100 by 2030, driven by its innovative Proof-of-Intelligence consensus mechanism. ​\n\nXRP, trading around $2.39, has bullish forecasts. Some experts anticipate it reaching $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, contingent on regulatory developments and Ripple’s advancements in cross-border payments. ​Barron’s\n\nCardano (ADA), currently priced at $0.35, is recognized for its research-driven approach to blockchain development. While specific price predictions vary, its focus on scalability and security positions it for potential long-term growth.​\n\nPolkadot (DOT), trading around $4.50, offers blockchain interoperability. Its unique parachain technology facilitates communication between different blockchains, making it a strong candidate for substantial appreciation as the crypto ecosystem evolves.​\n\nWhile these altcoins show promise, reaching $100 depends on various factors, including technological advancements, adoption rates, and market dynamics. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider market volatility when making investment decisions.\n\nWhy Lightchain AI (LCAI) is Reshaping Future of Blockchain\n\nLightchain AI (LCAI) is turning heads in the blockchain world, blending the power of artificial intelligence with decentralized technology to build a smarter, more efficient ecosystem. Forget traditional cryptocurrencies—LCAI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a game-changing consensus mechanism that rewards AI-driven computations instead of mining or staking. The result? Unmatched scalability, robust security, and impressive energy efficiency, making LCAI a serious contender in the crypto arena.\n\nBut that’s not all. LCAI’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) takes things to the next level, seamlessly processing AI tasks directly on the blockchain. This opens the door for real-world applications across industries like healthcare, finance, and beyond.\n\nWith AI booming and the demand for decentralized solutions skyrocketing, Lightchain AI isn’t just keeping up—it’s leading the charge. Buckle up, because this is the future of blockchain-powered AI.","summary":"Bitcoin (BTC) began tiny and exploded to new heights—could these four altcoins under $10 follow the same path?

James E Boasberg, chief judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.

The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people -- potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.

Trump's declaration targets Tren de Aragua, contending it is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela's government. The declaration comes the same day that a federal judge in Washington barred the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the expected order, a hint at the legal battle brewing over Trump's move. The judge was scheduled to consider expanding the prohibition on deportation just minutes after Trump's afternoon announcement. \"Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organisations, including TdA,\" Trump's statement reads. \"The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.\" The act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the US illegally and formally designated it a \"foreign terrorist organisation\" last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organisation. Trump pledged to use the Alien Enemies Act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump's declaration even became public. The suit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours. Boasberg, chief judge of the DC Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was \"to preserve the status quo\". Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, \"district courts would have licence to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint,\" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court \"should halt that path in its tracks\", the department argued. The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang. The White House is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador.

A new Ukrainian missile, an accurate strike. The range is a thousand kilometers.” That’s 620 miles.\n\nThe Long Neptune is a longer version of Ukraine’s 17-foot-long Neptune anti-ship cruise missile—the truck-launched weapon that sank the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva in April 2022.\n\nLong Neptune, which is longer and holds more fuel than the 120-mile standard Neptune, has been in development for years. When Zelensky pledged recently that Ukraine would produce 100,000 long-range munitions in 2025, he was partly referring to the Long Neptune—as well as to a host of far-flying explosive drones, the most impressive of which can travel more than 1,000 miles to strike targets deep inside Russia.\n\nA Neptune in testing.\nWikimedia Commons\n\nDeep strikes\n\nThe successful deployment of Long Neptune Zelensky referred to was apparently the March 14 strike on the oil refinery in Tuapse, in Russia around 300 miles from the front line in Ukraine. That Tuapse attack was just the latest in a chain of Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities that depressed production by around 10% last year.\n\nLong Neptune is an important weapon. Striking harder than do-it-yourself attack drones, some of which are modified sport planes, the new missile helps free Ukraine from its partial dependency on the United States and Europe for its best deep-strike munitions. The U.S. under President Donald Trump is, at best, an unreliable ally. And Europe lacks the capacity to produce the large numbers of modern cruise missiles Ukraine needs.\n\nOther made-in-Ukrainian munitions are coming, including air-launched glide bombs and ground-launched ballistic missiles. Even as Trump leans on Ukraine to accept a possible U.S.-brokered ceasefire that would favor Russia, Zelensky’s government is preparing for the war to grind on—and for attacks deep inside Russia to continue … if not escalate.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

US President Donald Trump called journalists who are trying to discredit his administration's attempts to establish contacts with Russia \"sick degenerates\".\n\nHe pointed out that unverified information appeared in the media that his special envoy Steven Witkoff had to wait nine hours before he was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Why can’t they be honest, just for once? Last night I read that President Vladimir Putin of Russia kept my Highly Respected Ambassador and Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff, waiting for over nine hours when, in fact, there was no wait whatsoever,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"The only reason they made up that story is to try and demean, because they are sick degenerates, that have to start reporting the News correctly.

Given Trump’s “character and persistence,” all of them would soon “stand at the master’s feet and gently wag their tails,” the Russian president said.\n\nIn an interview on Friday with Russia 1 TV journalist Pavel Zarubin, Ushakov was asked to comment on European leaders’ recent shift to supporting the US-proposed 30-day ceasefire after years of steady military assistance to Kiev. Everything is turning out as Putin “vividly” portrayed, the presidential aide said.\n\n“He described it as if they would be like affectionate dogs at the feet of their master. This is approximately what is happening now,” Ushakov stated.\n\nFollowing a virtual meeting of European leaders on Friday, France and the UK both demanded that Russia accept the 30-day ceasefire agreed upon by Ukraine and the US during bilateral talks in Saudi Arabia earlier in the week.\n\n“Russia must now accept” the truce deal, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy told the press that Moscow must accept the ceasefire without conditions. “Ukraine has set their position out. It is now for Russia to accept it,” he said.\n\nFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed the ultimatum, telling Britain and Lammy personally to “shove their idea back up the sh*thole it came from, diplomatically speaking.”\n\nThe US and its allies in Europe severed diplomatic ties with Russia soon after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, pledging to support Kiev with financial and military aid “as long as it takes.” Moscow has long characterized the conflict as a Western proxy war against Russia.\n\nTrump has repeatedly signaled his intention to diplomatically wind down the conflict during his reelection campaign. Relations between Washington and Moscow began to thaw following a phone call between Putin and Trump, which was followed by high-level talks in Riyadh last month.\n\nEuropean leaders who severed ties with Moscow can reestablish diplomatic contact whenever they choose, Putin said last month, though he noted they are “deeply entangled with the Kiev regime” and that it would be “very difficult or almost impossible for them to backtrack without losing face.”","summary":"President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov has compared European leaders to puppies \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/614280-putin-aide-eu-leaders-puppies/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67d5fbe82030277b19176037.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-15 23:35:18","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.031},{"id":300604276,"title":"World News | At Least 26 Dead in Massive US Storm After Kansas Reports 8 Fatalities","text":"Oklahoma City (US), Mar 16 (AP) Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the US, wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late on Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County on Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Also Read | Donald Trump Signs Bill Funding Government for 6 Months, Ending Threat of Partial Government Shutdown. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. \"It was unrecognisable as a home. Just a debris field,\" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. \"The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.\" Also Read | Starbucks Ordered To Pay USD 50 Million to Michael Garcia As California Delivery Driver Suffers Severe Burns and Disfigurement After Hot Beverage Spills on Him in Los Angeles. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes on Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. \"It was a very rough deal last night,\" he said on Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. \"It is really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.\" Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. \"We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist,\" Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million (10 crore) people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of three to six inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimetres) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimetres) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Governor Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometres) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it is not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes continued to hit on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the centre said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, levelled buildings and overturned vehicles. \"The amount of damage was catastrophic,\" Dillon said. \"It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over -- everything was destroyed.\" Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. \"Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,\" she said. \"Schools and buildings are just completely gone.\" Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral. Tad Peters and his dad, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, on Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists flee the interstate to park. \"Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it is here. It is here,\" Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. \"Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn....\" His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometres) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometres), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometres) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometres) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than two lakh homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us.

The wartime law, which allows deportation of natives and citizens of an enemy nation without a hearing, has been invoked three times, during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. All Venezuelan citizens 14 years or older who are members of TdA, are within the U.S. and are not naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the U.S. may be apprehended, restrained, secured and removed as \"alien enemies,\" according to a proclamation. 'WEAPONIZED MIGRATION': US FACES DEADLY CONSEQUENCES WITH MADURO IN POWER, VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION WARNS Hours before the act was signed, a lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Democracy Forward and the ACLU of the District of Columbia, claiming the proclamation could be used to deport any Venezuelan in the country, regardless of whether they are a member of TdA. Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg of the D.C. Circuit granted a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation of five Venezuelans already in immigration custody for two weeks. The Trump administration appealed the restraining order, alleging it is improper to delay a presidential act before it is announced, affiliate FOX 32 Chicago reported. A second hearing is scheduled for Saturday afternoon to establish if the order should be broadened to everyone in danger of removal under the act. \"The United States is not at war, nor has it been invaded. The president’s anticipated invocation of wartime authority — which is not needed to conduct lawful immigration enforcement operations — is the latest step in an accelerating authoritarian playbook,\" Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, wrote in a statement. \"From improperly apprehending American citizens to violating the ability of communities to peacefully worship to now improperly trying to invoke a law that is responsible for some of our nation’s most shameful actions, this administration’s immigration agenda is as lawless as it is harmful.\" An in-person hearing on the lawsuit's merits is scheduled for D.C. Monday. The move fulfills a campaign promise made during an October rally, when Trump announced he would use the law to combat Tren de Aragua (TdA) members in the U.S. Tren de Aragua (TdA), designated a foreign terrorist organization Feb. 20 by the Department of State, has thousands of members, many of whom the White House says have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are \"conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\" Colorado officials confirmed TdA occupied entire apartment complexes in Aurora, noting a special task force had to be established to combat its activity. TRUMP TO INVOKE WARTIME ALIEN ENEMIES ACT OF 1798 TO FAST-TRACK DEPORTATIONS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS As of Sept. 11, 2024, the Aurora Police Department linked the gang to nearly a dozen people, resulting in eight arrests. \"Two of the eight individuals who were taken into custody were involved in a July shooting at one of the specific properties in the city that have experienced issues with TdA activity,\" according to a statement. \"In line with these arrests, we can also now confirm that criminal activity, including TdA issues, had significantly affected those properties.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE IMMIGRATION COVERAGE The White House said the gang has continued to engage in mass illegal migration to the U.S. to \"further its objectives of harming United States citizens,\" undermining public safety. TdA operates in conjunction with Cártel de los Soles, the Nicolás Maduro regime-sponsored narco-terrorism enterprise based in Venezuela, and commits brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortion and human, drug, and weapons trafficking, according to the White House.

A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire's second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Israel has said it will not withdraw there, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling.

Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Edan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war. He is the last living US citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead.

Speaking at a protest camp set up last week outside Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"violating the agreement he signed and abandoning the hostages in Gaza\". \"You want to sacrifice our children for the pleasures of power,\" said Itzik Horn, father of hostage Eitan and freed hostage Iair. Netanyahu late on Saturday told negotiators to prepare for the continuation of talks regarding the release of hostages, his office said. Airstrikes kill nine Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Palestinian Journalists' Protection Centre, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone. The Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence. Hamas, in a statement, called the attack a \"serious escalation\" showing Israel's attempts to \"sabotage any opportunity\" to implement the ceasefire agreement. Also on Saturday, Israel's military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers \"will face disciplinary measures\". No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on January 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorised areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce. Israel has cast doubt on Hamas' offer The United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making \"entirely impractical\" demands. Talks continued in Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel. Israel and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza's border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. After the first phase ended early this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new US proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that he held in-depth discussions with the negotiating team and security officials on Saturday evening. Afterward, he told the negotiating team to prepare for continued talks as per the mediator's response to the US proposal, the statement said. Palestinian official says no fuel left for wells For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza's roughly two million (20 lakh) Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal. The southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells. Ahmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to \"suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands\". The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The government workforce, he has repeatedly contended, could not be productive from home. “I happen to be a believer that you have to go to work. I don’t think you can work from home,” Trump said on Feb. 11. “Nobody’s going to work from home, they’re going to be going out, they’re going to play tennis, they’re going to play golf. They’re going to do a lot of things. They’re not working.” Three days later, Trump traveled to his sprawling Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, where he remained for parts of six consecutive days, according to an NBC News tracker. On one of the days, Trump signed two executive orders and a memorandum. He also held an impromptu press conference. In other words, he worked from home. That weekend, he did what he accused federal workers of doing: He went golfing. Between Feb. 14 and Feb. 19, he golfed on four different days. While he is far from the first president to do so, each golfing trip is a cost to taxpayers. Before that, Trump hosted Republican senators at Mar-a-Lago in early February, where he delivered remarks including an update on his administration’s cost-cutting efforts. Some federal workers said Trump’s frequent trips to his luxury estate in Florida — racking up millions of dollars in security and transportation costs — while ordering millions of government employees back to the office, reeked of hypocrisy. “It’s clear and should be to the rest of Americans that it’s never about ‘the rule,’ it’s about who’s making the rules,” said a federal employee with the Department of Education who is also a disabled veteran. “This all fits in so perfectly to the power dynamics installed by this administration — a dynamic where Trump does what he wants, to who he wants, without repercussions.” “The return-to-office mandate was never about effectiveness, collaboration or cohesion,” the employee added. “It was always about federal employees being ‘traumatically affected,’ as Russell Vought put it.” The White House did not return a request for comment. Vought was a principal author of Project 2025, which came up frequently in the 2024 presidential election. Among the many tenets in the vast conservative governing blueprint is a call to significantly shrink the workforce and expand presidential power, both of which are playing out as central thrusts of the Trump administration so far. Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk, his biggest donor who is also a defense contractor, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to root out what it deems wasteful and unnecessary spending. Trump and Musk have said the federal government is bloated, and the administration has slashed tens of thousands of federal jobs already. Meanwhile, Trump’s agenda would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, budget experts say. At the same time, Trump has hit the links 14 times to date in his second term, with a potential for more rounds expected in the immediate future. Just since January, the cost of Trump’s golf weekends to taxpayers is more than $18 million, according to one analysis. Trump has spent five of his seven weekends as president at Mar-a-Lago, and during a sixth, he overnighted at another Trump property in Miami. This Friday, according to a Federal Aviation Administration notice, the president was back at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s expected to remain until Sunday evening. His motorcade was heading to his golf club Saturday afternoon. That would then be the seventh of eight weekends that he would spend entirely or partly away from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At the same time, since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump and Musk have regularly denigrated the federal workforce as lazy and emblematic of waste and fraud. “I feel very badly, but many of them don’t work at all,” Trump said of fired federal workers on Wednesday while providing no basis for those comments. “Many of them never showed up to work. That’s not good.” A report compiled by the White House budget office said that as of May 2024, 54% of the 2.28 million-strong civilian federal workforce worked in person, while 46.4% were eligible to work remotely. The report said 10% of civilian personnel actually worked in remote-only positions. One Health and Human Services employee panned Trump’s comments as false and argued that critics of federal workers don’t realize that the public is actually getting more work from employees who are based at home and not having to spend time commuting. She also called Trump’s frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago “a bad look” when considering he says he wants to send a message about saving taxpayer money. Another jabbed at Musk’s negative comments toward federal workers in light of a Politico report that, at Musk’s request, a “massive TV” was installed in the billionaire’s office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building so he could play video games. “I personally work my a-- off. I know everyone else is. I routinely work 50 to 60 hours a week,” and longer whenever needed, the HHS employee said. “Who is going to do all this work when they’re done with these cuts? Do people think that the public won’t be affected?” Another worker told of colleagues attempting to quickly sell their homes to move closer to a train stop, while others were struggling to find extended hours of day care to cover the extra time for commuting. Some — including those who were exclusively hired to work remotely — will likely be forced to quit. “Everyone built their lives around these remote positions,” said a Veterans Affairs employee who is on leave with a newborn. “My supervisor lives in [Florida] and was hired as a remote employee. She can’t relocate.” As far as presidents, Trump is not alone in his travels home. As president, Joe Biden frequently traveled to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, on the taxpayer dime. Then-first lady Jill Biden was also called out for a costly trip as she was attempting to be at Hunter Biden’s side during his trial. Amid criticism, Joe Biden at the time said he continued to hold meetings and work while home. One analysis in 2022 found that Biden’s Delaware trips at that point cost taxpayers $11 million. Barack Obama would also travel to Hawaii for vacations, which was far more costly of a journey than Palm Beach would be, said Tom Fitton, president of the legal group Judicial Watch. The group has tracked the costs of presidential travel since Obama’s presidency and calculated that his vacations over eight years cost taxpayers at least $85 million. In an interview, Fitton said that figure may be conservative given that it was not as inclusive of ancillary costs that are often part of calculations today. “That’s a point. It’s not a big one,” Fitton said of Trump working from Mar-a-Lago even though he ordered employees back to the office. “He’s obviously president 24/7. There’s really no comparison between a president golfing on the weekend versus an employee who doesn’t really have to go into the office at all. Or whose job duties and responsibilities are [not] essential to the government,” Fitton said. He also noted: “Presidential golfing is a perennial issue.” Trump had said he wouldn’t golf when president. In his first run for office in 2016, Trump bashed Obama for his golfing habits and repeatedly contended that the public wouldn’t see him on the course if he were president. “I love golf, but if I were in the White House, I don’t think I’d ever see Turnberry again,” he said in February 2016, in a reference to a course he owns in Scotland. “I don’t think I’d ever see Doral again,” he also said, in a reference to his course in Miami. “I don’t ever think I’d see anything — I just want to stay in the White House and work my a-- off.” Already this year he has golfed on the Doral course in Miami that he once said he wouldn’t have time to visit. Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said every president is expected to take days off to recharge while getting Secret Service protection. Bookbinder said the tension, though, is Trump’s current emphasis on cutting waste even while frequently golfing. Bookbinder also pointed to another unusual circumstance involving Trump. “He is not just going to his home. He’s going to the business that he owns. And so every time he makes a trip, that brings money into his business, which puts money in his pockets,” Bookbinder said. “At the same time that he is bemoaning waste and fraud in the federal government, he’s actually through this travel having taxpayers pay his businesses, which makes him richer. That seems problematic and like a real level of irony when there’s so much emphasis on cutting down on government, police, fraud and abuse.”","summary":"One of Trump’s first actions upon entering the White House was to order federal employees to return to the office.

The attendance list for Sir Keir Starmer’s video conference was impressive. The United Kingdom is now at the head of a roll call of 26 nations in support of Ukraine. These included all the larger countries in Europe, including Italy – even if Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, repeated her refusal to put troops into Ukraine under any circumstances. \n\nThe European Union itself was represented, even if not all its members were. So was Nato. And there were the leaders of four countries outside Europe: Canada, Turkey, Australia and New Zealand. The coalition is also backed, Sir Keir said, by Japan. Canada was represented by Mark Carney, its new prime minister, who understands that his nation must stand up to Donald Trump as well as to Vladimir Putin if either threatens it. \n\nSir Keir claimed that “new commitments were put on the table this morning”, which is important for maintaining the sense that international support for Ukraine is strengthening, despite Mr Trump’s vacillations. The prime minister hinted that these new commitments included promises to put “troops on the ground and planes in the sky” in Ukraine to guarantee any peace deal – as well as pledges of higher defence spending for the “collective defence and security of Europe”.\n\nAn operational meeting of military personnel from all the countries of the coalition will take place on Thursday. \n\nThe real test has not come yet but so far, British diplomacy has been exceptional and Sir Keir’s leadership has been exemplary. He has been steady and collegiate in rallying support for Ukraine while remaining engaged with President Trump and his administration even while disagreeing with them. \n\nThe phrase “coalition of the willing” has been born of necessity, given that different countries have differing levels of commitment and, as Sir Keir said, “different capabilities”. But the formula has provided some flexibility, and means, somewhat to the surprise of some opponents of Brexit, that the UK has stepped into a leading role at a time when the EU has neither the political unity nor the defence capability to do so. \n\nThe aims of the coalition are the right ones. As Sir Keir said after today’s meeting: “Ukraine is the party of peace.” Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, repeated his willingness to agree a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. The support of the coalition – and, to be fair to Mr Trump, the resumption of US assistance – means that Ukraine can make this offer from a position of strength. \n\nThat strength must be maintained while Putin plays for time. If Mr Trump will not stand up to Putin, those nations that still believe in the principle of national self-determination and resisting aggression must do so. There will be a price to pay. Indeed, Mr Trump has precipitated this crisis by saying he will not pay it. But there would be a higher price to pay if Ukraine’s other allies threatened to abandon it too. \n\nPutin will make peace in the end if the cost of war becomes too great for Russia to bear. Mr Trump’s alternative strategy, of forcing Ukraine to surrender, will only encourage Putin to keep fighting – and maybe not just in Ukraine. \n\nStanding up to the Russian leader is the way to bring him to the table, and Sir Keir’s leadership of the coalition of the willing is the right way to put pressure on Putin to make peace.","summary":"Editorial: Standing up to the Russian leader is the only way to bring him to the table – unlike Donald Trump’s erratic approach","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/keir-starmer-putin-ukraine-peace-ceasefire-b2715790.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/15/13/SEI243949919-copy.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Oxkagkcf-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-15 23:12:32","author":"Editorial","authors":["Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.253}]}
