Among the posts was a meme from his 2017 inauguration, showing Trump smirking at Obama with the caption, When you see the guy who said youll never be president at your inauguration.Trump also shared a glamorous photo with Melania Trump, who stunned in a glittering white dress. The picture was simply captioned, Merry Christmas 2024, adding a touch of elegance to his otherwise combative posts.

Her message reflected the quieter side of the holiday season, contrasting her husbands more flamboyant style.A Family Affair: Trump Jr.s Meme and MAGA CheerDonald Trump Jr. added to the festive political theatrics with an AI-generated meme depicting his father as Santa Claus at the border.

The post went viral among Trump supporters, blending humor with the familys staunch immigration stance.Meanwhile, other MAGA figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tommy Tuberville chimed in with their own holiday posts.

It's believed to have taken place sometime in early spring. There has never been, nor will there ever be, a figure as polarizing as Jesus. No, not even Donald Trump comes close to generating intense love or hatred in the way that mankind has treated the Son of God for the last 2,000-plus years. The culture war on Christmas that's been ongoing in this country for the last 60 years or so continues, although there might be a bit of a pendulum swing back to faith after Americans witnessed how far progressives pushed during their time in power the last four years. And the pendulum swing begun with a cartoon.Back in the 1965, Charles Schulz had to fight with his producers and CBS executives over A Charlie Brown Christmas, because of one scene. This one. \n\nMerry Christmas everyone. But more than that I hope you have a Blessed Christmas. And if you want to know what that means there’s probably not a better source than Linus.

He stood his ground. For decades, it was the only time during the year on network television The Gospel was told. Not from the book of Lebron, though.On Christmas, Lebron James, shadow ambassador to the CCP, staked his claim for Christmas day ownership on behalf of the National Basketball Association. Set aside the fact that Christmas is technically the Lord's day. Lebron's mediocre team, the Los Angeles Lakers, is a staple playing on Christmas Day, but cannot draw the numbers they once drew, either in the arena or on television, largely because basketball has become unwatchable. \n\nNetflix has 282M Subscribers.

The country reacted to virtually the same ticket - Trump V. Biden/Harris, by moving to the right nationally by about 6 points over the course of four years. Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 by 4.5%. Economics, as is often the case in presidential elections, was the primary driver for Trump turnout. Whether it's grocery bills, gasoline and/or energy prices, or housing unaffordability, inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democratic Party's stimulus spending was the number one issue. Illegal immigration, and the crime that flows from it, ranked right up there as well. But underlying all of the leading hot button issues is the overall sense that things are upside down. We're not normal right now. Everything seems like it's going to hell. Woke culture overreached badly under the Biden administration, being that the country is at least 80/20 against it. Preferred pronouns, men playing in women's sports, DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusivity), especially coming out of the pandemic, caused a lot of people, including many younger Americans, to either discover or rediscover religious faith. They are seeking order and purpose out of the chaos we're currently in, something government has shown clearly it will never be able to provide.The list is mounting of companies that have abandoned DEI programs because of the backlash from the majority of Americans. Ford, Toyota, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, and Starbucks are just a few of the big names on this list. Disney is also walking back off the ledge of woke they found themselves for the last few years. They have removed trans-themed plotlines from their forthcoming Pixar animated film project, and at the theme parks, at least at California's Disneyland, they've removed Pride day from their annual list of \"days\". My wife and I were just at the park a couple weeks ago in order to watch the Candlelight Processional. Disneyland doesn't advertise this, nor does it have to. Thousands of people just know about it, make reservations, and show up to watch. It's glorious to see the true story of Christmas set to orchestration and a several hundred-piece amalgam of local choirs, narrated by a celebrity reading out of Luke, Matthew, and Isaiah. All this is good news. I'm not optimistic that culture will get back to where it morally used to be, but a cessation of decline, even if it's a dead cat bounce, will be quite welcome for the next few years. But that doesn't meant the progressives will stop their anti-God march. They're not about to roll over and give up the ground they believe they've gained.

This, of course, is utter nonsense. If this logic holds, a right to not have to hear something that offends them, I would never have to wait the mandatory 5 seconds before skipping a YouTube commercial interruption of a Goose concert I'm trying to watch. I'd never have to be subjected to a Kamala Harris ad while trying to watch a football game. You have a lot of rights as an American. one of them is not the right to not be talked to. If you wish to live a life where no one talks to you, there are places in the country, and the world, where that can happen. If you're around other people, they're going to talk to you, and then they're going to ask you if you need solar panels on your house. Pronouns are parts of speech in the English language that allow me to refer to other people in a fashion that the vast majority of other English speakers will understand. If you are a he but want to be referred to as a she, I'm calling you a he, because that's how I refer to a male person in the third person. That's my pronouns. I may look at you funny if you refer to me with a pronoun that doesn't make sense, but that's not going to ruin my entire day. Telling me that I cannot say Merry Christmas to someone because they might be offended violates my freedom to practice the religion of my choice. My faith, Evangelical Christianity, holds two basic tenets. I must believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior, and get to know Him through the study of God's Word. Number two, I must tell others about Him and his saving grace. That's it. Those are the big two items on the list. If someone rejects me wishing them Merry Christmas, that's on them, not me. You'll notice that Christians are not calling for a ban on the term 'happy holidays'. When I hear it, I almost reflexively reply with Merry Christmas, because I can, and because it more aptly describes the reason for the season. Take that, Kamala.\n\nKamala Harris wishes you a Merry Christmas! 🤣🎄🎅h/t @mattdizwhitlock pic.twitter.com/zg0rmvA11C— @amuse (@amuse) December 24, 2024\n\nKamala's husband, the second fella, Doug Emhoff, was at a Chanukah party and had this to say to the group. \n\nDon't get me wrong. There are plenty of Jews who are fearful about living openly as Jew. We saw plenty of that at the Ivy League schools over the last few years, and a lot out on the West Coast at UCLA, where activist literally were conducting Jew hunts on campus. All of that is bad, and it's almost exclusively anti-semitism on the ideological hard left right now, because Democrats are appealing to them for their vote. Certainly, the far right certainly has its share of Jew hatred as well, but the party as a whole rejects wholly the antisemitic ugliness we saw during Joe Biden's presidency. Doug Emhoff, however, is not facing that problem, nor is Kamala Harris his protectorate. His premise is a straw man. Of all the things I'm most grateful about after winning the election, right at the top is an assurance that religious liberty will be protected at all levels of government for the foreseeable future. 2020 was billed as a return to normalcy campaign, but 2025 will actually be that return to normalcy, and a healthy respect for religion is what will make that possible.","url":"https://hotair.com/generalissimo/2024/12/26/christmas-day-culture-wars-n3798230","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/356/fe009561-6d0a-4ca4-83ce-3cefff5deff5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:52:24","author":"Duane Patterson","authors":["Duane Patterson"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":276316274,"title":"In Your Face Corruption, Chicago Style","text":"This Hatfield and McCoy feud between Brandon Johnson/Chicago Teachers Union(CTU)/Toadie School Board and now 'fired' Chief Executive Office (aka superintendent) of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system Pedro Martinez/newly-elected but unseated schoolboard members/taxpayers is really getting to be something.\n\nThe cut-throat aspect is more Game of Thrones, while the execution is straight out of Good Fellas.\n\nThe gobsmacking part is it's not playing out on some swampy rutted track buried at the back of the Meadow Lands behind Giant Stadium (traditional mob waste disposal area if a dock on the Hudson was too busy to load 'cargo' in concrete shoes unobtrusively). No, Mayor Brandon Johnson and his handpicked wise guys are brazenly going about their hit business in prime time, with news cameras rolling for everyone to see.\n\nEven better, the local press is helping the viewing public out by ensuring everyone watching keeps all the pieces connected.\n\nI've never seen anything like this before in my life.\n\nOkay, quick Cliff Notes \"on last week's show\" edition for those who missed the earlier episodes.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson, Chicago Teachers' Union (CTU) tool extraordinaire, has been at loggerheads with the CEO of the Chicago Public Schools, Pedro Martinez.

Johnson pressed members to pressure Martinez to either agree to the loan or get him to quit so Johnson could appoint his own toady in the CEO's spot, thereby eliminating the loan obstacle. The mayor's unbridled enthusiasm for exercising pure political muscle on behalf of the CTU annoyed the crap out of the entire school board, they all threatened to resign themselves rather than deal with his horse Schlitz.\n\nAll I know is that Brandon Johnson is the Mayor of Crazytown and is doing his best to prove it with every whackjob word that comes out of his mouth.He's been on a roll.Now, to start, there's some sort of massive feud simmering between the Chicago Board of Education (snort) and Johnson over someone the mayor is trying to force to resign so he can put his own chosen toady in that spot. The entire board has threatened to resign in protest.\n\nIt got to the point where, in what I consider to be a foolhardy and counterproductive move when you're supposedly trying to prevent a wrong from happening, that's precisely what the entire school board did - they walked out.\n\nThis flashy but completely contrary protest enabled Brandon Johnson to appoint a board of nothing but yes men for the couple of months between the walkout and the transition to a new hybrid board of elected (in the November elections) and appointed members who would be taking their seats in January.\n\nDutifully, the mayor's handpicked board of temporary political assassins had one mission, and it wasn't in the interests of the school children of Chicago. It was to rid the mayor and the CTU of that troublesome Chicago Public Schools CEO. Obligingly, they scheduled a meeting to do so last Friday, and whack.\n\nThe axe fell on honest, rational Pedro Martinez in \"The Christmas Massacre,\" as one of the ward alderman and a Martinez supporter called it.\n\nEvery last Johnson toadie voted for it.\n\nBREAKING: Chicago school board unanimously voted to FIRE the CEO of Chicago Public Schools, Pedro Martinez 🚨He was terminated without cause.The vote was 6 to 0.👇🧵 pic.twitter.com/QebZVOhRnb— Corey A.

Teachers' contracts and $300M loan...nah...). \n\nAnd about that appointed board makeup...\n\n...The board consisted of Sean Harden, who was just appointed president of the school board by Johnson last week, Mary Gardner, Olga Bautista, Michilla Blaise, longtime Chicago Teachers Union activist Debby Pope and Frank Niles Thomas.CTU Vice President Jackson Potter posted on social media Monday that board members have joined CTU in labor negotiations. Potter advocated for Martinez’s firing at the board meeting last Friday.“I want to thank this board for lighting a fire and pushing both CPS and the CTU to move with all deliberate speed to come to what will become a historic agreement … and this process must continue to accelerate, because we can’t afford to slow down or stall before [President-elect Donald] Trump’s inauguration,\" Potter said. \"Critics will claim, and have, that the board should not act too soon. We say that you cannot act soon enough.”\n\nYou'd think that was the end of it. \n\nTo their complete shock and well-laid plans horror, not a single one of the protagonists expected what newly 'fired' Martinez sprung on them.\n\nThe first thing they should have done was check the man's contract. It seems it had a rather unique clause in it.\n\nIt stated that should he ever be 'fired,' his contract was in force for six months after the date he was terminated. Martinez is golden until June of 2025 and he was staying ON the job.\n\nAt the school board meeting where he was fired, Martinez threatened to sue if they went through with it, and he filed an immediate injunction against the board.\n\nBREAKING: Pedro Martinez has filed an injunction in Cook County Court seeking to prevent Mayor Brandon Johnson's hand-picked board from firing him.

The morning after the firing, several of Johnson's board members showed up at the meeting for the teachers' union contract talks with the city. They were uninvited.\n\nThey also, according to Mr Martinez, caucused on the union side of the room, not with the Chicago Public School side.\n\nWell...huh. That's pretty blatant.\n\n ...FOX 32 ran into three board members outside of CTU headquarters on Monday. They said they were there to support CPS. Martinez says they hindered the process, choosing instead to caucus with CTU members and pressure CPS staffers to hurry up and come to an agreement.Martinez says the CTU, in collusion with the mayor's office and the board, have repeatedly circumvented his authority on contract negotiations.\"When board members showed up, they went directly to the CTU,\" Martinez said. \"When the representative from the city shows up, she talks to CTU. She doesn't speak with our district. What we have seen, and the message was sent since day one, we are in control, we have the power, so therefore, you're not going to say no, you're gonna say yes in how you're going to do it.\"\n\nMartinez went to court to have the school board completely thrown out of the negotiations, and on Christmas Eve, he won. \n\nDo watch this little report to get a sense of the corruption involved. None of these people are remotely interested in hiding any of it as they work overtime trying to get rid of Martinez. I guarantee it will blow your mind.\n\nThe board may have \"breached\" Martinez's contract...among the other disgraceful things on what appears to be a very long list.\n\nCook County Judge Joel Chupak ruled that Chicago school board members must not meddle in contract negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union and that their actions have kneecapped Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez's ability to do his job on behalf of students and taxpayers.Martinez says Chicago school board members intimidated CPS staffers on Monday, saying, \"We hold all the cards,\" when they showed up during CTU contract talks. A judge issued a temporary restraining order against the board, saying the move caused irreparable harm to Martinez and his ability to bargain on behalf of CPS.\n\nWE HOLD ALL THE CARDS\n\nRemember, Mayor Johnson is the one pushing this at the behest of the Chicago Teachers' Union. It's not like he doesn't have a vested interest...ooohh.\n\nJohnson is deeply involved in contract negotiations that could personally benefit him.And it doesn’t just extend to his employment.Johnson is in line for a $3.8M teacher pension despite working as a teacher for just four years, as @illinoispolicy research shows. https://t.co/bTDRZkA3cI— Austin Berg (@Austin__Berg) December 24, 2024\n\nMerry Christmas, Chicago style.\n\nI hope Martinez has bodyguards and a food taster.","url":"https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2024/12/26/in-your-face-corruption-chicago-style-n3798235","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/127/ef4984ef-27d3-4cf7-b9ba-4d2a02fb5a6a.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:52:24","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":276316272,"title":"In My Little Homan Eye, I Spy Something Beginning With...San Diego","text":"On Monday, I wrote that the woman responsible for passing the San Diego County anti-ICE cooperation resolution and board policy, which unleashed a firestorm...\n\nAt the beginning of December, I wrote a VIP piece about a pretty aggressive move the San Diego Board of Supervisors was contemplating in response to the Trump election and his implementation of announced immigration rejiggering plans, aka mass deportations. Introducing the resolution and leading the charge for passage was the Democratic District 1 supervisor and chairwoman of the board, Nora Vargas. What her proposal would do was ban the use of any county resources - including the county sheriff - from being used to assist ICE and the federal government in removing illegal aliens from San Diego County.\n\n...had done this out of the blue last Friday.\n\n...While the storm that Vargas set in motion was breaking over everyone's head, as well as drawing an unwelcome Tom Homan beady eye on the county, the voluble chairwoman herself suddenly clammed up. She couldn't be reached for comment and blamed her recurring vocal nodule issues.There wasn't a peep out of her until Friday. Then she dropped a bombshell on her staff and the county she'd just pretty well boned with the federal government.\n\nNora Vargas, District 1 supervisor and Chairman of the Board of County Supervisors, didn't even do her own staff the courtesy of a heads up when she released her statement that she would not be continuing in office come January.\n\nScrooge McVargas signing out - Merry Christmas, worker bees.\n\nBoard of Supervisors Chair Nora Vargas, who represents a heavily Hispanic district that stretches to the U.S.-Mexico border, released a statement on social media sharing her decision to “conclude my tenure as County Supervisor, completing my first term this January 6, 2025.”She won reelection in November, taking more than 62 percent of the vote in her race.“Due to personal safety and security reasons, I will not take the oath of office for a second term,” she said, without providing details.As board chair, Vargas received fierce online criticism for backing a measure that sought to prevent county resources from being used to support federal immigration enforcement.\n\nOnce the initial shock of the announcement wore off - and people had the weekend to mull it over as it was a classic Friday dump - \"Why'd she do it?\" speculation started swirling, and there was no shortage of guessing going on. I mentioned a few in my piece - the racial bias lawsuits and ongoing federal investigations into money issues at different projects of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), which Vargas also chaired - but it seems as if the woman was dogged by controversies, self-inflicted or otherwise.\n\n Likewise, her luster within her district had diminished significantly during her first term, and she'd alienated many original supporters in the heavily Hispanic area.\n\n...Though she took office in 2021 with great fanfare as the first Latina on the Board of Supervisors, she proceeded to engage in a series of high-profile disputes with organized labor groups who once supported her and was broadly perceived by residents near the Tijuana River as ineffective in responding to the region’s ongoing sewage crisis.Multiple legal claims accused her and members of her staff of making racist comments about prospective employees and engaging in backroom maneuvers to prevent Michael Vu, a longtime county administrator, from landing a coveted role as the county’s chief administrative officer because, according to a claim filed by Vu, Vargas wanted “a Hispanic or Black” candidate instead. Vargas and members of her staff have denied that they discriminated against potential employees.This year, the board endured a series of high-profile setbacks under Vargas’ leadership, including the abrupt cancellation of a homeless housing project, delays in establishing an aid center for migrants and the collapse of a proposed collaboration with the University of California, San Diego to establish a hub for mental health treatment.Vargas’ resignation was so sudden and apparently unplanned, staff members in her office said they learned about it only moments before an official announcement was emailed to reporters at 11 a.m. Friday. Vargas declined interview requests and staff in her office referred to her resignation statement.\n\nCould this accusation of racism be at the Root of Nora Vargas exit? Could it be Tara Lawson Remer as well? Someone’s on the naughty list!https://t.co/eZdw6Efx6t— Bill Wells (@MayorBillWells) December 23, 2024\n\nThe racial bias claim is pretty fugly and pits three supervisors, former and current, against each other on top of it.\n\n...Michael Vu was appointed to serve as the county’s Registrar of Voters in 2012 before he took on his new role as assistant chief administrative officer in 2021.In a redacted copy of the claim filed by Vu on Wednesday, he alleged that on June 4, the Board of Supervisors bypassed him for the position of chief administrative officer, a seat left vacant due to the retirement of Helen Robbins-Meyer.The claim said Robbins-Meyer had promoted Vu to his current position as her assistant chief administrative officer. However, Vu said he did not receive the promotion to fill her seat due to the actions of other county officials, the claim said.In the claim, Vu accused Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas of not supporting him as CAO because of his racial background. The claim said, during a conversation that occurred between October of 2022 and February of 2023, Robbins-Meyer was discussing her retirement and succession plan and mentioned staying on the job an additional year for the purpose of “assisting Michael Vu in transitioning into the job of CAO.”According to Vu’s claim, Vargas stated, “We need a person of color,” to which Robbins-Meyer reportedly replied, “Michael is a person of color, he is Asian!” The claim reportedly said that Vargas responded, “That doesn’t count, they have opportunities and education. We need a Hispanic of black.”\n\nShe seems like a real peach if any of that is true.\n\nThere's also a bit of a legal question as the quitter has taken all her media accounts dark. As those are technically public records, it would be best if they were only disabled, not deleted.\n\nFormer San Diego County Supervisor Nora Vargas X profile account has either gone dark or been removed.If Vargas deleted her County Supervisor social media account, Would that mean destruction of public records and violation of CPRA? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/l2A4oFZG0v— Allen J. Wilson 🇺🇸 🇮🇹 🇮🇪 (@AllenJWilson) December 23, 2024\n\nBut what frosted everyone's chaps was, of course, turning the county into a Super Sanctuary by fiat... \n\n...The “disastrous” new resolution — which was adopted in a 3-1 vote by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors last week — now forces local cops in the southernmost California county to obtain a warrant signed by a state or federal judge before they can contact ICE over an illegal migrant busted for a crime, according to NewsNation.Local law enforcement was previously restricted from contacting the feds if they found out someone’s immigration status was illegal — and this new law extends that protection to include even those here illegally who are arrested for a crime, unless a warrant is issued.ICE can’t even be notified of an accused criminal illegal migrant’s release from custody under the policy without a warrant.\n\n...and then bailing out of what is sure to be a mess of epic proportions.\n\nThe county is already awash in illegals, inland city mayors were furiously railing against the measure, and the San Diego sheriff said flat-out she wasn't beholden to uphold any of it. \n\nMost assuredly, there would be increased scrutiny from the federal government with a policy so diametrically opposed to goals being set by the incoming Trump administration. Border Czar Tom Homan, aware of it weeks ago when the policy first passed, issued a warning while vowing to thwart the county's efforts.\n\n...Homan, during an interview with The Post on Friday about his recent meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, said the policy is “10 times worse” than California’s existing sanctuary state law.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Daily Caller, Homan said, \"Congratulations, SD County. You just won yourself ICE agents all through your neighborhoods.\" \n\nTheir \"protection\" policy is going to make border and immigration enforcement more intrusive and things worse.\n\n...Homan, who has been tasked with fulfilling President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass apprehensions and deportations of illegal migrants across the United States, blasted the lawmakers involved with the vote and said they can simply expect more ICE agents in their neighborhoods as a result.“Rather than arresting an illegal alien criminal in the safety and security of a county jail where we know he doesn’t have weapons, they’re forcing ICE officers into the streets, into neighborhoods to find these people,” Homan said to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “It’s ridiculous.”\n\nNow, ICE will be on the blocks and in homes instead of picking criminal offenders up at the jail when they get a call.\n\n...“[Sanctuary laws] make it more difficult, but it doesn’t mean we’re not going to do it,” Homan said. “It just means we’ll have more agents in San Diego because rather than one guy arresting a guy in a jail — we have to send a whole team to safely arrest a guy, so they can expect a lot more agents in that jurisdiction.”\n\nEven former CA governor Jerry Brown is murmuring sweet nothings about the law he signed all those years ago, and why there were exceptions for violent crimes committed by illegals left in it.\n\nBecause they were violent criminals? Could be, but I'm just stabbing in the dark here.\n\n... During an interview in December, former Democrat California Gov. Jerry Brown — who signed SB 54 into law in 2017, which prohibits some cooperation between ICE and local authorities — said he believes some cities across the state have now gone “way, way beyond” what he put on the books, and noted that his statewide policy made exceptions for migrants convicted of violent crimes.\n\nWell done, San Diego County! \n\nNot only have you let your worst instincts make your situation worse, but the woman you foolishly let bamboozle you into this touchy-feely, expensively futile gesture is nowhere to be found just as the rubber-faced Homan and his ICE men are about to hit the road.\n\nSeriously. Even a blind man could have seen this coming.\n\nA question now looms for the new board, too - do they take the heat and appoint someone to take Vargas's place or pony up for a special election? Potential candidates are lining up, and the way things are going, voters might very well demand a say in determining the composition of the board.\n\nHow much more blind man's bluff can the SD Board of Supervisors afford to play? \n\nI know the Trump team got game.","url":"https://hotair.com/tree-hugging-sister/2024/12/26/in-my-little-homan-eye-i-spy-something-beginning-withsan-diego-n3798239","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/127/1bf78099-7136-4b23-a4fd-66cbda635013.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:52:24","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":276316262,"title":"If You All Didn't See the Trumps' Christmas Message, Please Watch","text":"unread messages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAccount Settings\r\n\r\nNewsletter Subscriptions\r\nComment Settings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunread messages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAccount Settings\r\n\r\nNewsletter Subscriptions\r\nComment Settings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n Ed Morrissey Show\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTerms & Conditions\r\n\r\n\n\r\nPrivacy Policy\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCalifornia – Do Not Sell (ccpa)\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCalifornia - CCPA Notice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAdvertisement\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nIf You All Didn't See the Trumps' Christmas Message, Please Watch\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nDonald Trump\r\n\r\n6:00 PM | December 26, 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n❄️Merry Christmas pic.twitter.com/4yjBrIdENS— Donald J.

UPDATE: IDF Unloading on Houthis","text":"If so, give them credit for sticking to the bit. The only problem is that Hamas is running out of time for playing games -- and no one's coming to their aid.\n\nAfter the fall of Bashar al-Assad and the retreat of Hezbollah, negotiators in Cairo and Doha claimed that Hamas had suddenly decided to offer concessions on hostage negotiations. The elimination of Yahya Sinwar supposedly opened up new options for the terrorists to exit the conflict while saving some face. Donald Trump's election and subsequent pledge to unleash \"hell\" on anyone holding Americans hostage appeared to change the calculus in Gaza, too. According to negotiators, Hamas no longer conditioned talks or a first exchange of hostages for prisoners on a complete Israeli cease-fire.\n\nAnd then ... Lucy yanked the football for the nth time, predictably as well as predicted:\n\nIsraeli officials charged Wednesday that Hamas had backed away from a softened stance that could have enabled a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Gaza war, and instead returned to a position that is holding up progress toward an agreement. ...In a statement accusing Israel of derailing the talks, Hamas insisted the ceasefire negotiations via Qatari and Egyptian mediators had been proceeding “in a serious manner” and claimed that it had shown “responsibility and flexibility.”\n\nWho to believe in this scenario? Well, this follows Hamas' strategy all along, right down to blaming the Israelis for a breakdown in negotiations while reneging on offered concessions. This pattern has repeated in every round of talks for the past year; even Qatar got sick of it at one point and booted Hamas' billionaire class out of the country for a short period. Hamas uses this strategy to manipulate Western and Arabic media and governments into increasing pressure on Israel to retreat.\n\nAnd that's exactly what they're trying this time, too:\n\nSources have told The Times of Israel that the Qatari negotiators have been asking the Israeli government to be more flexible, with Hamas seeking assurances that Israel won’t return to fighting after the first phase of the deal is implemented.\n\nThat's nonsense. Hamas started this war as the governing body of Gaza and with the support of the Gazans on October 7, 2023. They are now losing it, and badly. If they want an end to the war, they can capitulate and ask for terms. If they want a hostages-for-prisoners exchange, they can negotiate that as a separate issue. But after Hamas violated every one of their previous nine cease-fire agreements with Israel -- including the one in place on October 7 before Hamas massacred 1200 Israelis in a single day -- they have very little standing to demand \"assurances\" on anything from the Israelis.\n\nAnd in about four weeks, that pressure will end when Trump takes office. He'd prefer to have this deal done before his inauguration so as to eliminate a distraction, but Trump may also be looking for an opportunity to remind the region of what an American \"red line\" should look like. Hamas is all alone now in providing An Example To Others, if you know what I mean, and Trump will likely waste little time in driving that point home. \n\nBut what about the end of Yahya Sinwar? Wasn't he the biggest obstacle? Let's just say that nihilistic evil runs in the family:\n\nInformed unnamed sources told the Kan public broadcaster that Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Muhammad Sinwar, is even more intractable in the talks than his brother Yahya, the former terror chief, who was slain by Israel in October.The sources said Hamas was not giving in to pressure to be more accommodating.Officials speaking to the Israel Hayom newspaper said that Hamas was backtracking after initially appearing to soften its position, enabling a renewed push over the past few weeks for an agreement. They also cite Sinwar’s stubbornness as a key factor in the talks stalling.\n\nQuelle surprise. \n\nUpdate: In yet another example of not getting the message, the leader of the Houthis held a press conference to declare victory against Israel. And that's when the IDF showed up:\n\nصور متداولة للقصف الإسرائيلي على عدة مناطق في اليمن#إسرائيل#اليمن#قناة_العربية pic.twitter.com/GEGlb8Nitd— العربية (@AlArabiya) December 26, 2024\n\nIn the middle of a 'victory' speech by Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, Israeli airstrikes hit Sana'a and Hodeidah on Thursday.The strikes targeted Sana'a International Airport's main runway, control tower, and aircraft. Images broadcast by Sky News Arabia show the airport damaged by fire. ... According to Al Hadath, strikes also hit the Haziz power plant, the Hodeidah port, the power plant, and oil refineries.Seven strikes were reported in Sana'a and three in Hodeidah, and dozens of aircraft were spotted in the air.\n\nThis appears to be a large-scale, comprehensive operation by the IDF, which now has a lot of time on its hands. We'll update as developments warrant, but this should be yet another lesson for Iranian proxies about picking fights with Israel ... and prematurely believing that they have the last word. And wait until Donald Trump takes office.","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/12/26/has-hamas-yanked-the-football-yet-again-n3798227","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/332/8a577549-3fb0-47b6-b0cf-a8d4015b3ea8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:52:24","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.668},{"id":276316244,"title":"Leave Syria to the Syrians","text":"In the view of many Washington policymakers, Syria is like the Hotel California: You can check out, but never leave. President-elect Donald Trump should remedy his first-term mistake and withdraw American troops from Syria. \n\nBashar al-Assad, whom successive American administrations sought to oust as Syria’s president, has been swept away with little fight. The Islamic State, or ISIS, the other target of American military action, remains but a bad memory. Washington’s adversaries—especially Russia and Iran—suffered a major geopolitical defeat. There no longer is any excuse for U.S. involvement in Syria. \n\nThe Arab Spring hit Syria in 2011 as demonstrations broke out against Assad, who responded violently, yielding a multi-sided civil war. Although Syria was never a serious American security interest, the Obama administration leaped into the fray, assuming that it could micro-manage a brutal, multi-sided civil war. \n\nWashington sought to oust Assad, discouraging negotiation. Yet its efforts to support moderates foundered. A half-billion-dollar Pentagon program delivered just four or five fighters in the field. The CIA spent a billion dollars with somewhat better results, but extremists ended up dominating the fight, causing U.S. officials to limit aid. According to the New York Times, “the equipment to be provided to the rebel groups would not include antitank rockets or other high-end equipment that could eventually cause serious damage if they fall into the hands of groups that commit acts of terrorism against the United States or its allies.”","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2024/12/26/leave-syria-to-the-syrians-n3798242","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:52:24","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":276316238,"title":"Reaping What Vargas Hath Wrought: Homan Sets His Sights on 'Super Sanctuary' San Diego County","text":"Tom Homan, the incoming border czar for the Trump administration, has a plan to deal with a major jurisdiction that recently doubled down on a statewide sanctuary law.\n\nEarlier in December, the Democrat-controlled San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted to expand on a California sanctuary policy that already limits local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

This victory comes nearly four years after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, where a mob of his supporters stormed Congress in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. The insurrection led to widespread condemnation and legal challenges for Trump, including an impeachment for incitement of insurrection, though he was acquitted by the Senate. Despite these controversies, Trump's 2024 campaign focused on economic issues, persuading voters of his capability to enhance their financial well-being, which played a significant role in his electoral success. ￼What To KnowWho Is Evan Davis and David Schulte? Evan A. Davis and David M. Schulte, two experts with extensive legal experience, wrote an op-ed for The Hill in which they argued that Democrats would be within their rights to block Trump's certification on grounds of \"an oath-breaking insurrection\" that makes Trump \"ineligible to be president.\"Davis is a Columbia Law School-educated lawyer who previously served as the president of the New York City Bar Association and editor of the Columbia Law Review. Schulte works as an investment banker in Chicago, but he clerked for Justice Potter Stewart and was educated at Yale Law School.Schulte is an ardent supporter of President Barack Obama, even renting his Martha's Vineyard home to the Obama family in 2013, and is friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton, according to Chicago Mag.Jan 6 Cited as Cause for Blocking CertificationThe argument both men put forward relies on the 14th Amendment, which says that \"No person shall ... hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\"The authors called evidence of Trump's involvement in the insurrection \"overwhelming\" and, therefore, disqualifying.Davis told Newsweek: \"I think the Dems will consider because there should be some reluctance to set aside the Constitution and because they voted to impeach and convict for inciting insurrection. We wrote the piece to encourage attention to the Constitution either by rejecting electoral votes or by a 2/3 vote to remove the disability.\"Schulte told Newsweek: \"I think members of Congress are becoming more aware of the issue by the hour, and they're duty-bound to consider it as guardians of the Constitution. How they'll react remains to be seen, both Democrats and Republicans. They've all taken the same oath of office.\"We wrote the piece to give voice to the constitutional issue and describe the interrelationship among the events, the official forums that have touched the issues, and the law of the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act.\"Congress will do what it does, and it has the power under section 3 to free Trump of the disability of disqualification by reason of insurrection. The politics are intense though the law is clear. Should Trump be certified, unless the disability is relieved his administration will labor under a cloud of illegitimacy.\"The authors noted that the Supreme Court's decision on Colorado's plan to leave Trump off the primary ballot, which the court rejected, would likely be the main defense that critics of their plan would use.The Colorado Supreme Court had determined that there was \"clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used\" in the 14th Amendment, but the U.S. Supreme Court determined that states lack the power to disqualify candidates for federal office.The authors argued the decision's relation to Trump's certification \"lacks merit\" for, mainly, the fact that the power of certification of Electoral College votes \"is uniquely assigned to Congress by the Constitution.\" Additionally, they note the U.S. Supreme Court decision \"did not address the finding that Trump had engaged in insurrection.\"\"The rejection of the vote on constitutionally specified grounds is a nonreviewable political question,\" Davis and Schulte wrote in their op-ed.The Electoral Count Act that they also cited includes sections on \"Grounds for objections\" and \"Consideration of objections and questions.\" Specifically, they refer to a 2022 amendment to the act that \"provides a detailed mechanism for resolving disputes as to the validity of Electoral College votes.\"\"The act specifies two grounds for objection to an electoral vote: If the electors from a state were not lawfully certified or if the vote of one or more electors was not 'regularly given,'\" the authors wrote.\"A vote for a candidate disqualified by the Constitution is plainly in accordance with the normal use of words 'not regularly given,'\" they continued. \"Disqualification for engaging in insurrection is no different from disqualification based on other constitutional requirements such as age, citizenship from birth and 14 years' residency in the United States.\"The January 6, 2021, effort to block the certification of President Joe Biden has left an indelible mark on the national psyche: Trump's opponents argue that, just as he pushed to block the certification of his rival, the Democrats should look to block him, citing the additional aspect that Trump is a convicted felon.Democrats have spent a year saying they will not block Trump's certification, and some legal experts in March 2024 already floated a few of the strategies that Davis and Schulte suggested.Roll Call wrote about a similar discussion from that time, which followed the Supreme Court's decision on the Colorado primary ballot, citing legal experts who argued that the ruling didn't rule out the Congress using the 12th and 20th amendment powers to enforce \"presidential eligibility requirements.\"But congressional members such as Democrat Senator Gary Peters of Michigan and Democrat Representative Ted Lieu of California said that they were not \"election deniers\" and would only look to resolve \"an actual problem with a particular vote in a particular state.\"\"I don't think people should object just because they don't like the outcome of the election. That's what Republicans do, and that's just called being sore losers,\" Lieu told the outlet.Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democrat, even rejected such a stance in the immediate aftermath of the 2024 election: A fabricated quote attributed to Raskin claimed that Democrats \"won't be certifying the election\" if Trump won, and Raskin set the record straight. In a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, Raskin wrote on November 5 that the quote was \"100% fabricated.\"\"It's one more lie in the stream of right-wing lies designed to undermine our election,\" Raskin said. \"Despite this actionable libel and all the disinformation, America is having a free and fair election and Congress will certify the winner.\"What People Are SayingEric Trump, son of the president-elect, wrote on X: \"You people are sick.\" He included a link to the op-ed, andElon Musk responded to Eric Trump's post: \"Such a crazy thing for them to say. Legacy media is just the propaganda arm of the radical left.\"Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign manager and his pick for White House Communications Director, wrote on X: \"Oh look. Democrats want to steal the election and invalidate the will of the American people. Threat to Democracy.\"Jerry Dunleavy, a reporter formerly of The Washington Examiner, wrote on X: \"The former editors-in-chief of the Columbia Law Review & of the Yale Law Journal want Congress to engage in what would be among the most egregious abuses of power in the history of the republic by overturning a democratic election & blocking a duly-elected president from office.\"What Happens NextCongress will meet on January 6, 2025, to hold a session in which it will review and certify the votes for the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

Critics argue this last-minute decision reflects Biden's reckless foreign policy priorities, prioritizing aid to a foreign conflict over pressing domestic issues. Conservatives have raised concerns about the lack of accountability and the potential for escalating tensions with global adversaries, calling the move an irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars and a questionable legacy to leave behind.\n\nBiden’s order to “continue the surge” came the same day Russia launched a missile attack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in multiple cities, saying its goal was to deprive Ukrainians of access to heat and electricity during the winter months. This left nearly half a million people in the Kharkiv region without heat in freezing temperatures and others with blackouts in Kyiv. \n\n“Let me be clear: the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety, and the United States and the international community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over Russia’s aggression,” Biden stated. “I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in its defense against Russian forces.” \n\nBiden’s commitment to giving more U.S. aid to Ukraine, in addition to the $175 million given to the country, comes less than a month before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. He has previously promised that the U.S. would help Ukraine \"for as long as necessary.” However, Trump vowed to end the three-year war between the foreign nation and Russia “within 24 hours.”\n\nBiden will go down in history as an America last president. Most notably, he refused to help the hurricane victims in North Carolina and those in Hawaii after the horrendous fires, putting a middle finger to Americans. \n\nAccording to a fact sheet published by the White House earlier this month, the U.S. has committed $61.4 billion in security aid to Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale war on February 24, 2022. On December 2, the lame-duck president called for an additional $725 million in a military assistance package that included munitions, surface-to-air missile systems, small arms, spare parts, and demolition equipment. A few days later, on December 7, Biden pledged to send $988 million in military aid. On December 12, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a military aid package to Kyiv worth $500 million, comprising HIMARS ammunition, drones, and armored vehicles. \n\nAfter Trump won the election, Biden has rushed to secure funding for Ukraine and get as much aid to the foreign nation as possible before he leaves office. Biden has about $2.2 billion remaining under the USAI to send to Ukraine.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/26/biden-orders-pentagon-to-deliver-more-weapons-to-ukraine-just-weeks-before-leaving-office-n2649584","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/193/0be63f38-c4f2-4315-8deb-c3a62ce68424.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27

both online and offline in 2024","text":"Elon Musk started 2024 as the controversial owner of a social media platform, but ends it as one of the most powerful individuals in the world and a key adviser to the incoming US president.\n\nThe debate around the billionaire has moved on dramatically over the last 12 months, from whether the way he was running X, formerly Twitter, would be viable or sustainable in the long-term, to whether Mr Musk’s own influence over global politics through his wealth and social media megaphone made him a threat to democracy.\n\nThe biggest story of 2024 around Mr Musk has been has dramatic swing behind the US President-elect Donald Trump ahead of the November election and how Mr Musk effectively reconfigured X into a vehicle to support the Republican candidate, alongside his personal fortune.\n\nThe result of that support has seen the entrepreneur catapulted to the very centre of Mr Trump’s inner circle as a key adviser – jointly leading a new unofficial government department which will focus on efficiency and has proposed cutting up to two trillion dollars – a third – of the US federal budget.\n\nIt means Mr Musk will go into 2025 with more power and influence than ever before, perfectly highlighted by a single post from him about his dislike of a bill to fund the US government, which then suddenly collapsed despite having previously had bipartisan support.\n\nBut this level of influence has also left many concerned about whether or not such power should sit with one private, and not elected, individual.\n\nSome of those fears have also been fuelled by the string of scandals and controversies that Mr Musk has been involved in during the year.\n\nMr Musk started the year with a visit to Auschwitz, in an attempt to shut down accusations of antisemitism on X, with critics accusing the Tesla and SpaceX boss of engaging with and amplifying antisemitic content.\n\nThe visit came as advertisers continued to leave the platform over fears about the types of content that were now being allowed to spread under Mr Musk’s “free speech” mantra.\n\nAnd those concerns continued later in January, when X briefly blocked searches related to Taylor Swift after deepfakes images of the singer began to spread online.\n\nCriticism of the different types of content being allowed to appear and spread on X would continue throughout the year, but reached its peak during the summer riots in the UK.\n\nDisorder broke out on streets across the country following the stabbings in Southport, fuelled by misinformation about the incident spreading on X, including false claims about the suspect.\n\nAs people posting content inciting the riots were arrested and charged, Mr Musk took to X to criticise the UK Government, interact with right-wing figures including Tommy Robinson and suggest the UK was heading for civil war.\n\nSince then, Mr Musk has met Reform UK leader Nigel Farage amid rumours of a possible donation to either Mr Farage or Reform, sparking further debate about external donations into British politics and Mr Musk’s own ability to influence things as he determines.\n\nBut the increased polarisation of Mr Musk’s position has not just helped his rise within right-wing politics, it has also aided his rivals in the social media world.\n\nSince taking over Twitter, as it was then in 2022, user numbers of rival sites have risen steadily, and Meta has launched a direct rival to X in Threads to give users an alternative place to go.\n\nBut in 2024, it has been Bluesky which has emerged as the likely main rival to X.\n\nIn the wake of Mr Trump’s election victory, Bluesky has seen user numbers grow as millions flock to the site, often citing the changing sentiment on X as a key reason for moving elsewhere.\n\nBluesky is still a long way from challenging X’s position in the social media landscape, but Mr Musk’s new partisan approach to politics – despite having previously said X would only thrive if the platform was politically neutral – could drive further growth to Bluesky and others in 2025.\n\nAnd if the balance of power in the social media sector begins to shift, the Tesla boss’s influence in the real world could also be impacted.","summary":"The billionaire’s control of X, formerly Twitter, has helped him expand his impact offline over the last 12

have a Coke and a smile inside his Oval Office.\n\nThe 78-year-old plans to bring back his beloved soda button to his White House office, RadarOnline.com can reveal, as his transition team is currently making plans to ensure his new home looks exactly like it did the day he moved out four years ago – but they'll have to work fast.When Trump moves back in next month, the nearly 100 employees of the White House residency staff will help move Joe Biden out – all in the course of about five hours.\n\nThe staff includes butlers, maids, housekeepers, chefs, cooks, doormen, florists, curators, electricians, plumbers, storekeepers, and engineers among others. \n\nThe employees don't take political sides, and stay on from president to president. However, Trump is expected to replace Robert Downing, the chief usher who oversees the household staff. \n\nDowning was brought on by current resident Biden, and Trump is expected to appoint his own chief.The red button, which was on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, summoned a staffer to bring the thirsty president an ice-cold Diet Coke. It was removed by Biden shortly after he took office in 2021.\n\nThe job of satisfying Trump's thirst previously fell to Walt Nauta, his personal valet. All Trump had to do was push the big red button on his desk and Nauta would bring him a glass of Diet Coke on a silver tray.\n\nOf course, pushing a big red button in the Oval Office ended up frightening some people – especially since the man behind the desk has access to nuclear capabilities. \n\nIt was a fact which Trump enjoyed joking about, as he once said: \"Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button.\"When Donald and Melania walk into their new-again home, they’ll be able to instantly relax. Clothes will be in their closet, the kitchen will be stocked with their favorite treats and they'll even have their preferred soaps and toiletries in the bathroom.\n\nKate Andersen Brower, author of The Residence, said the White House staff is getting off easy this turnaround, as they are already familiar with Trump's wants and needs. \n\nShe told DailyMail.com: \"It’s easier because they’ve lived there before. There aren't any mysteries about what (the Trumps) would like to have for breakfast, how they operate, what kind of shampoo they use. I mean, they know everything already.\"Brower revealed the staff generally get along with whoever occupies the Oval Office – regardless of their political background. Many of them have worked at the White House for years and have served several presidents.\n\nShe says they'll likely welcome Trump back as well - especially since he has a reputation for spreading his wealth. \n\n\"He would, like, tip them cash,\" Brower shared. \"I was told he would hand out $50 bills.\"","summary":"When Biden moves out of the White House next month, and Trump moves in, transition staffers will only have around five hours to switch things up.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/inside-inauguration-day-donald-trump-white-house-oval-office-diet-coke-button/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/9f8mUKiZq/0x0/secrets-of-trump-blueprint-for-mass-deportation-5-1735220106902.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-27 00:00:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.119},{"id":276310144,"title":"Berisha: Rama e lëshoi Veliajn për të mbrojtur veten; për të zhurmuar fundin e tij, thirri Belindin","text":"Lideri i opozitës, Sali Berisha u ndal edhe te hetimet ndaj kryebashkiakut të Tiranës, Erion Veliaj nga ana e SPAK, ku ditën e sotme u mor në pyetje për më shumë se 5 orë në zyrat e prokurorisë së posaçme.\n\n‘Edi Rama e lëshoi Erion Veliajn, e lëshoi për të mbrojtur veten dhe për të zhurmuar fundin politik të Veliajt, thirri Belindin’, theksoi Berisha.\n\nBerisha: Ne kaluam një proces shumë të pamerituar, por e kaluam me sukses atë proces.

His aversion to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is pretty well-known as he’s quite open about it. Trump has also called out Trudeau every now and then and he has done so yet again. \n\nTaking to Truth Social, his platform, the president-elect spoke his mind on issues like subsidies and even came forth with the next candidate to replace Justin Trudeau. Backing his claim, Donald Trump expressed that many Canadians agree with him and want their land to be a part of the States as well. Read further to find out what he said. \n\nDonald Trump posted on December 26 on Truth Social, saying: \n\n“I just left Wayne Gretzky, “The Great One” as he is known in Ice Hockey circles. I said, ‘Wayne, why don’t you run for Prime Minister of Canada, soon to be known as the Governor of Canada – You would win easily, you wouldn’t even have to campaign.’ He had no interest, but I think the people of Canada should start a DRAFT WAYNE GRETZKY Movement. It would be so much fun to watch!”\n\nAs tensions rise between Donald Trump and Trudeau, the tweet comes right after the imposition of 25% tariffs on Canada after they failed to address trade and immigration issues. Following this, the billionaire suggested that Canada should consider becoming a part of the States if the tariff becomes too problematic. \n\nAlmost a week ago, Trump had posted something similar on Truth Social. He wrote,\n\n“No one can answer why we subsidize Canada to the tune of over $100,000,000 a year? Makes no sense! Many Canadians want Canada to become the 51st State. They would save massively on taxes and military protection. I think it is a great idea. 51st State!!!”\n\nMany people responded to Donald Trump’s post as one user wrote, “As a Canadian who is a perm resident in the great USA its a great idea ! Also Pierre Pollivere is wonderful as well. Trudeau is finished”. Another person commented, “As a Canadian I whole heartedly believe Canada becoming the 51st State is an excellent idea. We would be free of communist Trudeau. Our once great country is in such decline – all at the hands of the WEF PM and his WEF Cabinet members and MP’s.”\n\nJustin Trudeau had previously met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago to relieve trade tensions. Reportedly, the long-time Canadian PM tried to explain to the president-elect that the 25% tariff would crumble Canada’s economy. To this, Trump reportedly asked, “So your country can’t survive unless it’s ripping off the US to the tune of $100 billion?” \n\nTrump has taken repeated digs at the Canadian PM’s post as he once called him “the Governor of the Great State of Canada”. Canada has been under the microscope for quite some time now and Trudeau is in the thick of it as he has been criticized by disgruntled Canadians over the housing crisis and living costs which are sailing through the roof. To worsen the plot, people from within and outside his party are calling for his resignation.","summary":"Donald Trump is all set to take office in January 2025, and it looks like he has an agenda already.

But current events and a few personal matters left me questioning everything. \n\nRelated: Sad News: Ellen DeGeneres Has Left the Building\n\nAt the time, I was becoming disillusioned with what was going on around me. Another Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden election was on the horizon, and I was ready to elect new people (though, before anyone lectures me I have since changed my mind on Trump — I now think he's the right person to lead our country at this time). \n\nI tried tuning out the news, but it seemed like everyone in charge wanted to tax this and regulate that and take away my freedom. Outside of Washington, D.C., it felt like we were on the verge of another Civil War. The country is and was divided, but it felt like we had gotten to the point where you couldn't be friends with your neighbors if you didn't vote alike. We'd just dealt with everything from riots to a pandemic (to which the response was carried way too far). \n\nThe place where I live just outside of Atlanta has changed so much that I don't recognize it. Our local government is a corrupt joke these days. I was sick of watching the news and knowing what was going on 24/7. And I was sick of just, well, stuff. I remember going into a Sam's Club around Christmas and seeing rows and rows of these tacky plastic decorations and wondering why we need all this stuff. On a personal note, I'd lost my mom to whom I was a caregiver for years and felt sort of lost in general, so I'm sure that played a big role in my newfound apathy. But something had to change. \n\nRelated: A New Twist on 'I'm Leaving the Country'\n\nI've wanted to visit Costa Rica — a country that I knew had a large expat community — for years, and after my mom died, a friend suggested we visit. In March 2023, we spent about eight days there, and I don't think I'd ever felt so healthy and relaxed. It wasn't just that I was on vacation. It was that I felt a world away from all that was going on in the United States. Life moves a little slower down there, and for the most part, the people are much kinder. \n\nOver the next year and a half, I'd go back many times, exploring almost every inch of the country, looking for answers I suppose. What would it be like to live there? Could I give up some of the luxuries I have in the United States? There are no same-day Amazon deliveries there, nor are there any sprawling suburban towns with big box stores and fast food joints on every corner, but I was okay with that. I wanted to get away from it and simplify my life. \n\nAs I type this, I'm sitting in my Atlanta-area home, so obviously, I never took the plunge. I didn't rule it out for the future, but I did come back down to earth — or the U.S. — a little bit. I re-engaged in what was going on here, and as I said, I came to realize that Trump was who we need in charge right now. I even made a career change that saw me going from writing marketing junk to writing news and politics again (which is how I started my writing career in the first place). \n\nHowever, I'm witnessing a new phenomenon in our country that has me re-thinking it all again: a disregard for human life. \n\nI consider myself a very pro-life person. Yes, that starts with abortion. Life begins at conception — most scientists agree — and I think ignoring that is akin to playing God. But it extends far beyond that. Pro-life means being in favor of life from conception to death in my opinion. And the support I'm seeing for a murderer named Luigi Mangione is absolutely disgusting. \n\nMangione is, of course, the guy who killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. I'm sure you all know the story by now, so I won't rehash it. Initially, the people who were cheering him on seemed like a fringe thing. A few quadruple-vaxxed \"they/them\" gals and guys on X with blue hair and piercings in places that look decidedly painful — the ones who spend their days posting about defunding the police and attending anti-Israel protests, the ones who think Trump will put them in concentration camps — were calling him everything from a hero to a thirst trap. They were calling for the deaths of CEOs, and not just the ones who ran insurance companies, but also those across many other industries. I supposed I expect nothing less from that crowd though. \n\nBut admittedly, it wasn't just the fringe far left. Over time, I heard people I know and love make similar comments. Christians. Conservatives. People who claim to be pro-life as well. \"Given what I've gone through with my own health insurance, I'm not surprised that no one cares that this man was killed.\" \"I work in the healthcare industry, and I can totally understand why this guy committed murder and won't be shocked when more people in the industry are killed.\" \n\nI started to argue when friends posted things like this on social media or even said it to my face. One lady's husband works in construction. \"How would you feel if the house he built crumbled under the next tornado that flies through Georgia, and the residents came and killed him over it?\" I wanted to say. What happens when someone in a bad mood goes to a restaurant and they're served a scalding hot meal and burn themselves on it? Is that an excuse to take out a gun and shoot the waiter? Your daughter teaches horseback riding lessons. What if one of her students falls off a horse, and the parent of the child shoots her over it? What if I write an article someone doesn't like, and they hunt me down and kill me over it? \n\nBut I bit my tongue. Honestly, if people feel that murder is in any way justified, what's the point? What's going to convince them otherwise? Are we at that point of no return? Are we just accepting vigilante behavior now? Are we heading towards a state of complete lawlessness? \n\nAnd it seems like it's getting worse. I was on Instagram the other day, and a local news site I follow posted about how a local power company would be raising prices in January. The first three comments with hundreds of likes were \"Who's the CEO? Where's Luigi?\" \"These CEOs haven't learned???,\" and \"Who's the CEO? Asking for a friend.\" I was shocked. I actually tried reporting them for inciting violence, but my response from Meta was that these comments didn't go against community standards. Meanwhile, another lady I follow who owns a local farm was reported and banned for slaughtering chickens for food (and she didn't even show the gory parts on Instagram). \n\nSince then, I've seen memes pop up across social media, only to receive hundreds of thousands of likes. \n\nAnd a friend just sent me an advertisement from a business for a sweatshirt with Mangione represented as Time's \"Person of the Year\" on the front. It's like we're just normalizing murder now. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong. I know the insurance industry is an absolute mess. I know our healthcare system is a mess. I lived it for a decade while taking care of my very sick mother. But murdering someone's father and son is not the way to fix it, especially when government regulations and the fallout from Obamacare are far more to blame than any private company (and I don't advocate murdering government officials either, just so we're clear). But this is a topic for another day. \n\nBecause the disregard for life doesn't just extend to the murder of Thompson. Maybe I'm naïve, but during the last election cycle, I never understood how people would vote to secure their right to have an abortion on demand over topics like national security. You can put a baby you don't want up for adoption. You can prevent pregnancy in any number of ways. If a terrorist crosses the border and kills you, none of that matters. \n\nAnd then there's the case of Joe Biden's recent pardons. He commuted the death sentences of some murderers on death row, but not some of the most notorious ones like the Boston Marathon bomber or the guy in Charleston who shot up the AME church. How do you draw that line? You're either for or against the death penalty. When you start picking and choosing, particularly for political reasons, you're playing God, just like the people who justify their actions by saying life doesn't begin at conception or the CEO didn't give me what I wanted. \n\nErick Erickson posted on his Substack earlier this week, \"It is no surprise that in Western societies that have increasingly devalued life, there is a move to end the death penalty for murderers while concurrently expanding it to babies, the infirm, and the elderly. Our society has devalued life and is led by those who do not respect life.\" \n\nWhile I haven't agreed with a lot of what Erickson has said lately, he's spot-on with this. And that's what scares me more than anything else we've experienced in the 21st century so far. People feel they have the right to choose who lives and dies. And that's what has got me rethinking a move to Costa Rica at some point down the line. \n\nI'm not sure I want to live in a world where people don't take the most sacred thing we have more seriously. Not to say that Costa Rica — or anywhere else for that matter — is perfect, but whether it's their limited abortion laws or the respect they have for their elders, things are different there, at least for now. And I'd be willing to give up many American luxuries for that, I think.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/sarah-anderson/2024/12/26/is-a-disregard-for-life-the-real-reason-to-leave-the-country-n4935318","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/pj/images/up/2024/355/58ad4e9b-f8a7-43dd-855a-2806e0977c4a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:51:24","author":"Sarah Anderson","authors":["Sarah Anderson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":276309158,"title":"Is Donald Trump Actually a Conservative?","text":"For conservatives “of a certain age” — i.e. those of us who can remember the Reagan years firsthand — conservatism is as much a life philosophy as a political movement. It was one of the key distinctions between the two parties: Republicans were guided by a specific belief system — conservatism — whereas the Democrats were more of a hodgepodge blend of various demographics.\n\nBack then, the Democratic Party was a coalition party. Really, the only thing a union worker in Pittsburgh and a vegan environmentalist in Berkley had in common was that they both expected the Democratic Party to help ‘em grab a bigger piece of the pie. Their “north star” wasn’t any kind of ideology but a general desire to endlessly expand the size of government, until each segment of their coalition could gorge at the trough.\n\nIt was pure, unadulterated greed masquerading as compassion and altruism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans didn’t rely on coalitions. Sure, some GOP voters hailed from the religious right, and the evangelicals didn’t always see eye-to-eye with the economic conservatives, but for the most part, the Republican Party was the party of conservatism: If you agreed with the philosophy, welcome to the party! And if you don’t, find a different party. (Except on Election Day.)\n\nAnd that’s how it was until 2008. The election of Barack Obama changed everything.\n\nIt’s impossible to understand the rise of MAGA without studying the strange ascension of a little-known Illinois state senator who rose to the presidency. Obama won a pair of national elections — both by a landslide! — by building a coalition of classic liberals, college-educated moderates, minorities, urban citizens, women, and young voters. The size of his coalition was so large and so vast that if the correlation between voting patterns and demographics stayed constant, it was now functionally impossible for the Republican Party to ever win again.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative philosophy had lost its Midas touch. The Iraq War was deeply unpopular, and the mortgage crisis (and subsequent recession) seemed to have discredited the entire belief system. And not just among moderates and liberals: Even in the GOP, it was no longer good enough for a candidate to promise he or she was the most conservative guy on the stage and thus deserved the nomination.\n\nEnter Donald J. Trump.\n\nIn 2016, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Jeb Bush (and others) argued that they were the most conservative candidates running — and each of them had a point. If this were the Reagan years, all three of them would’ve been worthwhile flagbearers.\n\nBut along with the Iraq war and the economic meltdown, one of George W. Bush’s lasting legacies was a complete inability to defend himself from the insults, barbs, and lies of the left. President Bush felt it was “beneath the dignity of the office” to respond to political attacks. \n\nHe was magnanimous to a fault.\n\nSpoiler Alert: Donald Trump is NOT magnanimous to a fault! Instead, he’s a rabid wolverine who’ll gouge eyeballs and break thumbs to get his way.\n\nAnd after the kind, benevolent, genteel George W. Bush was pulverized into dust by the media, a rabid wolverine like Donald Trump was exactly what GOP voters wanted.\n\nSome of Trump’s core beliefs are conservative. Instinctively, he loathes unchecked immigration. Because of his vast business experience, he despises high taxes and stupid, senseless regulations. And since he’s mostly indifferent to judicial policies (aside from hating lawfare), he has no problem appointing conservative judges.\n\nBut he’s not defined by conservatism. He doesn’t give a crap about its philosophical worldview.\n\nInstead, he’s a nationalist, a smug, unrepentant nationalist who’s 100% dedicated to elevating the United States of America. Where and when conservative policies — such as at the border or with taxes — can give America a competitive edge, Trump is a booster: He’ll be as conservative as you want.\n\nBut if he thinks it’s in America’s national interest to grow the size of government, annex Canada, or somehow seize Greenland, he’ll do that, too.\n\nBecause, more than conservatism, what defines Donald Trump is being a fighter. And it turns out, that’s exactly what GOP voters were yearning for: They’d rather have a right-leaning nationalist who’ll fight like hell for our country than a “pure” conservative who floats like a butterfly and stings like a butterfly. \n\nPolitics is a full-contact sport. Trump might not be a conservative, but he’s a helluva fighter.

Though the levy is paid by the importer, much of the tax is ultimately handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nResearch conducted by the National Retail Federation (NRF) examined the impact of the proposed tariffs on apparel, furniture, household appliances, footwear, travel goods, and toys.\n\nThe NRF found that the tariffs would reduce the American consumer’s spending power by up to $78 billion every year the tariffs are in place.\n\nThey would be paying $8.8 billion to $14.2 billion more for toys, according to the NRF data. This may have serious consequences for independent toy sellers.\n\nJennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City’s West Side Kids told CBS News that about 90 percent of the toys she sells are made in China. She said that having to drive her prices up may result in a loss of customers and business that would cause her to close her doors.\n\n\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can’t really imagine not being here.\"\n\nExperts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics have similarly warned that a 60 percent tariff on Chinese exports would be a “major shock to international goods markets” – and the toy market specifically.\n\n\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they wrote in a blog post earlier this month.","summary":"Nearly 80 percent of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, one of the countries the president-elect has threatened to target with immediate charges on imports","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/toy-stores-tariffs-donald-trump-china-b2670344.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/26/23/newFile.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CtTm2xEK-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:50:04","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":276310734,"title":"Ministers Joly, LeBlanc travel to Florida to meet with Trump's team","text":"MORE POLITICS NEWS \n\n Ministers Joly, LeBlanc travel to Florida to meet with Trump's team\n\n India alleges widespread trafficking of international students through Canada to U.S.\n\n Nova Scotia premier tones down rhetoric toward Ottawa in end of year interview\n\n Canada condemns China's steps against Canadian institutions over Uyghurs, Tibet\n\n Trudeau could stay or go.

That's what the gang that assaulted the Capitol on January 6 want – ANOTHER massive attack like [2021's] could be on the horizon.\"\n\nU.S. Homeland Security has estimated about 11 million illegal immigrants are currently living in America. Now, Republican Trump – who dusted Democratic challenger Kamala Harris by a 3 million-vote margin and won control of both houses of Congress is raring to leverage his success to toss the lawbreakers out en masse. \n\nThe 78-year-old commander-in-sweep has pledged to use the obscure 1798 Alien Enemies Act to aggressively hunt down and expel illegal residents.\n\nHe dubbed the massive initiative Operation Aurora, naming it after the Colorado town taken over by gun-toting Venezuelan gangs.\n\n\"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, then kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible,\" the incoming president declared.Ahead of Trump's inauguration, some state lawmakers are banging the war drums by calling the policies \"inhumane,\" and vowing to block the feds.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta, who came to the U.S. from the Philippines as a child with his parents, insisted: \"My office will continue to use the full force of the law and every tool at our disposal to protect the rights of California's immigrants.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker warned that if the feds come to his state to \"take away the freedom\" of immigrants, they will have a brawl on their hands.\n\nUsing street-corner fighting words, Pritzker bellowed: \"You come for my people, you come through me.\"\n\nHoman, the former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first presidential term, fanned the battle flames by ordering sanctuary city officials in Illinois and elsewhere to follow Trump's plan – or else.New York City Mayor Eric Adams has already agreed to map out a plan to deport criminal migrants. However, Homan – referring to Windy City Hizzoner Brandon Johnson and Gov. Pritzker – said: \"Chicago's in trouble because your mayor sucks and your governor sucks. If [Johnson] doesn't want to help, get the hell out of the way.\"\n\nAside from criminals, Trump plans to track down 1.4 million fugitive migrants ordered deported by federal judges while swiftly shipping out the 13,000 illegals currently held in ICE prisons and county jails.\n\nTexas has offered Trump a 1,400-acre tract in the Rio Grande Valley near the Mexican border to stage the massive operation – which is estimated to carry an annual price tag of $88 billion. \n\nThe Lone Star State's Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said of the proposed lease and facility: \"We'll figure it out once they have their strategic plan set – and we'll get it done.\"Yet San Diego County is digging in its heels and voted to further block the municipality's cooperation with federal authorities. \n\nWhile the feds only have 41,000 immigration prison beds available, Trump seeks to build – or find – detention centers near cities with large migrant populations, such as Miami, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles, as well as America's Northeast corridor.\n\nWhile willing to overlook Dreamers – illegals who earned college degrees – Trump is taking a hard get out stance against anchor babies – children born on American soil to parents who unlawfully entered the country.\n\n\"We have to end it. It's ridiculous\", Trump said. \"I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"Trump has been told he would need a constitutional amendment to remove the status of birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

This contract outlined that States United would help the Attorney General’s office develop legal strategies to ensure secure elections. It required full cooperation from Mayes’ office and allowed the group to destroy certain internal materials at their discretion.\n\nThe contract stipulates relevant communications, “internal administrative material,” and “research notes” — “other than those with you or opposing counsel” — can be “destroyed in our sole discretion and consistent with our document preservation policies.” \n\nOn July 27, 2023, States United sent a memo suggesting legal actions against Trump supporters. The memo argued that creating alternate slates of electors could be considered criminal, describing such actions as \"a deliberate attempt to undermine legitimate election outcomes\" and recommending charges such as conspiracy, forgery, and fraud. These recommendations were later reflected in an April indictment against 18 Trump supporters, including Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows.\n\nAZ Judge Recuses Himself From 'Fake Electors' Case After Emails Surface Demanding Judges Defend Kamala\n\nStates United also advised further investigations into Trump, Giuliani, Meadows, lawyer John Eastman, then-RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, and election integrity advocate Cleta Mitchell, highlighting potential legal issues.\n\n The recommendation stated:\n\n \"The coordinated efforts to subvert the 2020 election results require thorough examination and accountability.\" \n\nThe group’s memo referenced at least six individuals under direct scrutiny, providing a detailed framework for potential charges. The group has a history of efforts to influence election-related policies and legal actions under the guise of promoting democracy.\n\nA notable figure tied to this effort is Norm Eisen, a key adviser to States United Democracy Center and a prominent advocate for progressive election strategies. Eisen co-authored \"The Democracy Playbook: Preventing and Reversing Democratic Backsliding,\" a handbook outlining strategies often linked to the principles of \"color revolution\" tactics. \n\nThe handbook includes a section on Ukraine's Orange Revolution. Color revolutions are often seen as externally orchestrated efforts aimed at destabilizing sovereign governments under the guise of promoting democracy. These movements are viewed as utilizing non-military means to effect regime change and align target nations with the strategic interests of external powers. \n\nEisen has a history of promoting legal and political maneuvers aimed at challenging political opponents and reshaping electoral systems. His involvement brings a cloud of controversy along with it. \n\nThe States United Democracy Center’s involvement in Arizona's legal strategies is part of a larger pattern of coordination to weaponize legal systems against political opponents. The efforts to prosecute Trump and his allies under the guise of ensuring \"election integrity\" demonstrate the erosion of impartial justice and the normalization of using lawfare as a political weapon in America. It's a troubling trend that needs to end.","url":"https://redstate.com/brutalbrittany/2024/12/26/arizona-ag-n2183627","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/rs/images/up/2024/219/eed19b14-471f-4569-9710-e9fae6dc6db7.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:40:24","author":"Brittany Sheehan","authors":["Brittany Sheehan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":276310204,"title":"Editorial: ​The loss of control of immigration has been at the heart of Nigel Farage’s success","text":"Nigel Farage is gloating that his new political party is now the real opposition in the UK. ​The Reform Party has more members than the Conservative Party, he says, with its membership numbers greater than the 131,680 figure given by the Conservatives this year. It would be unwise to write off the Tories: they have been around in one form or another for more than 300 years and are among the great survivors of politics. Also, it is one thing to have more members than the Conservatives, quite another to outpoll them. Rishi Sunak’s party won almost seven million votes in the July general election, despite it being one of the most disastrous results for the Tories in a century. Mr Farage’s Reform was far behind, on four million votes. Even so, it was a remarkable achievement by Reform. There are a number of reasons for the success, including a public backlash against woke extremism, a desire for lower taxes, tougher law and order and ongoing euroscepticism. But the biggest reason for their success is likely to be immigration, and the way in which Britain has lost control of it. It isn’t alone: Donald Trump, who not only won a surprise presidential victory in America last month but did so decisively, thinks immigration was the most important matter for US voters, even though surveys suggest it was the economy. In the UK, voters said the economy was more important but YouGov found that a mammoth 26% of voters across all parties and none thought immigration the top concern. Reform voters would think that far more than most. They are right be appalled. As the brave English academic Matt Goodwin has been saying for years, the numbers of people coming into the UK are vast, putting huge cultural and infrastructural pressure on the nation. The Tories are as, if not more, to blame than Labour for the scale of the influx.","summary":"News Letter editorial on Monday December 26 2024:","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/editorial-the-loss-of-control-of-immigration-has-been-at-the-heart-of-nigel-farages-success-4923288","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjJhMDljNGFhLTY1NGYtNDdlZi1hOWYyLWQ3NDU0OTcwYTk4Yjo5MjdhNWQ3My0xNWI4LTRkNWItOWQxNS04ZGUyZTdiNWJmOTA=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:35:48","author":"Editorial","authors":["Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":276307812,"title":"‘Canal is Panamanian’: Panama’s president rejects Trump threats","text":"The Panamanian president has rejected threats by US President-elect Donald Trump that the United States could reassert control over the Panama Canal, saying “there’s nothing to talk about.”\n\nPresident Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday also rejected the possibility of reducing canal tolls for US vessels and denied that China had any influence over the vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n\n“If there is an intention to talk, then there’s nothing to talk about,” Mulino said during a weekly news conference.\n\n“The canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians. There’s no possibility of opening any kind of conversation around this reality, which has cost the country blood, sweat and tears.”\n\nThe president’s comments come days after Trump, who takes office next month, threatened to take back control of the Panama Canal over what he said were “ridiculous” fees being charged by the Panamanian authorities.\n\nThe US exerted administrative control of the canal for decades before handing it to Panama in 1999.\n\nIn a series of social media posts over the past week, Trump accused the Central American country, with whom Washington has had diplomatic relations since 1903, of “ripping off” the US on the Panama Canal.\n\n“Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.\n\n“The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the US. This complete ‘rip-off’ of our Country will immediately stop.”\n\nTrump also claimed that Chinese soldiers were “lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal”.\n\nThat claim was rejected on Thursday by the Panamanian president, who said China has no role in the administration of the canal.\n\n“There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal for the love of God, the world is free to visit the canal,” Mulino told reporters.\n\nChina does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed two ports located on the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump on Wednesday named Miami-Dade County Commissioner Kevin Marino Cabrera as his envoy to Panama.\n\nDescribing Cabrera as “a fierce fighter for America First principles”, Trump said in a social media post that he “will do a FANTASTIC job representing our Nation’s interests in Panama!”\n\nEarlier this week, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the US embassy in Panama City in anger over Trump’s Panama Canal comments.\n\nThe protesters chanted “Trump, animal, leave the canal alone!” and burned a picture of the incoming US

2024","text":"Protests in the streets, turmoil at City Hall, corruption trials galore, historically bad baseball and a massive influx of buzzing arthropods unlike any seen since the 1800s.\n\nNo wonder so many Chicagoans sought peace at the sidewalk altar of a once-airborne rodent that imprinted itself into a slab of concrete — and into the city’s heart.\n\nIn a year that had the national spotlight squared on Chicago, the Sun-Times saw it all. Here’s how we’ll remember 2024.\n\nChicago shines for DNC\n\nEven Chicago’s famously mercurial weather cooperated through all four days of the Democratic National Convention, which went off without a hitch despite weeks of intraparty uncertainty heading into the spectacle.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson earned high marks for shepherding a smooth week for thousands of delegates and media from around the world, while Chicago Police Supt. Larry Snelling enjoyed rave reviews for keeping a reasonable lid on massive protests that mostly focused on the war in Gaza.\n\nThe made-for-TV pep rally took on heightened excitement following President Joe Biden’s late withdrawal from the race, while some local flair was injected into the national conversation. The party’s new nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, vetted Gov. JB Pritzker as her potential running mate.\n\nPritzker fell short of the ticket and Harris fell short of the White House, leaving Democrats scratching their heads — just like some local business owners, who felt left out of the convention’s much ballyhooed economic boost.\n\nBrandon Johnson’s sophomore slump\n\nThe DNC provided a rare highlight for the first-term mayor, who could warrant his own top-10 list for bad news cycles in 2024.\n\nFault lines started showing early in the year when voters rejected Johnson’s Bring Chicago Home referendum, nixing higher taxes on expensive real estate transactions — money that would have been used to help shelter the city’s unhoused population — and delivering the first major roadblock to his progressive agenda.\n\nJohnson saw his City Council support erode as he moved to shut down the city’s controversial ShotSpotter gunshot detection system, and again when he had to defend elevating a top aide with “a history of calling the police “f---ing pigs.”\n\nA revolving door on the fifth floor of City Hall included Johnson’s firing of a longtime confidant and spokesman accused of sexual harassment and antisemitism. And don’t forget Johnson’s pick for school board president who lasted all of one week before a troubling history of social media posts — inexplicably missed by Johnson’s office during the hiring process — led to a swift ouster.\n\nThe political chaos came to a crescendo late in the year as an emboldened Council, by a stunning 50-0 vote, shot down the $300 million property tax hike Johnson had included in his proposed 2025 budget — breaking a campaign promise not to raise them. After a series of budget concessions, Johnson scrapped any property tax hike to win Council approval for a budget that relies heavily on one-time revenues and nickel-and-dime fee increases.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson worked for months to force Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez out of his post, installing an entire school board that voted Dec. 21 to fire him — before the city’s first-ever elected board members had a chance to weigh in. The move raised fresh questions about the overwhelming influence of the Chicago Teachers Union.\n\nPreparing for Trump’s return\n\nDonald Trump’s resounding victory to retake the White House put officials on notice in Democratic-dominated Illinois, where the Republican president-elect saw a marginal uptick in voter support.\n\nAdvocates for Illinois’ thousands of undocumented residents braced for the wave of legal questions raised by Trump’s promise of mass deportations, as the incoming administration’s border czar declared Chicago ground zero immigration enforcement raids.\n\nThe city’s LGBTQ community grappled with similar concerns about the effect of a second Trump term on marriage and parental rights, while health care providers prepared for Illinois to take on an even greater role as the Midwest’s main island of abortion rights.\n\nOfficials also raced to lock up key federal transit funding for an extension of the CTA Red Line, the type of assistance from Washington that Democrats say Trump may be keen on withholding from the city that has served as his preferred political punching bag.\n\nLandmark corruption cases\n\nOne multi-generational poster boy of Chicago politics saw his federal corruption case come to a head while the fate of another hung in the balance to close out 2024.\n\nEd Burke reported to a downstate prison to begin serving his two-year sentence for racketeering, bribery and attempted extortion convictions, tied to the longtime 14th Ward alderman’s strong-arming of developers to hire his private law firm.\n\nMike Madigan spent weeks in a courtroom listening to federal prosecutors map out his sprawling web of influence as speaker of the Illinois House for jurors who will soon be tasked with deciding if Madigan wielded it to squeeze companies for payments to his political cronies.\n\nNatural wonders\n\nCicadas and tornadoes and geomagnetic storms, oh my!\n\nMother Nature kept things interesting for Chicagoans with the first dual-emergence of periodical broods of cicadas in more than 200 years, inundating some parts of the area with the very noisy, mostly harmless and debatably tasty insects.\n\nThey crawled out of the ground shortly after the latest solar eclipse bedazzled the Midwest, drawing thousands of people to the path of totality that just narrowly missed the city.\n\nSome of the freshly unearthed cicadas were still around for the first in a series of rare aurora borealis displays powered by intense solar storms, igniting the northern lights over Lake Michigan even downtown.\n\nBut the natural marvels weren’t all friendly. Thirty-one Chicago-area tornadoes in July set a new record as more frequent bouts of heavy rain and flooding provided a sobering reminder of the looming impacts of climate change.\n\nUp-and-down year for CPD\n\nIt was a mixed bag for Snelling in his first full year at the helm of the Chicago Police Department.\n\nOverseeing a seamless DNC earned the freshman superintendent a growing drumbeat of support from Council members across the political spectrum, especially with his department on pace for fewer than 600 homicides, the lowest yearly toll since before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut the killing of 26-year-old Dexter Reed in a hail of 96 bullets during a traffic stop raised new questions about the use of force in the ranks, and a federal monitor last month reminded officials that the department is far behind in its long-running reform effort, reaching full compliance with just 9% of the steps laid out in a consent decree.\n\nDomestic violence questions\n\nHorrific murder cases put officials’ handling of domestic violence under the microscope, highlighting issues that advocates say have persisted for decades.\n\nAfter 11-year-old Jayden Perkins was killed while defending his mother from an ex-boyfriend who’d been released on parole a day earlier, Gov.

And it’s not Russia","text":"medium116681357There were a lot of raised eyebrows and quiet chuckles this month when US President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to Washington for his inauguration. Foreign leaders don’t attend our inaugurations, of course, but I think Trump’s idea was actually a good one. Having just returned from a trip to China, I can tell you that if I were drawing a picture of relations between our two countries today, it would be two elephants looking at each other through a straw.That is not good. Because suddenly the US and China have a lot more to talk about than just trade and Taiwan — and who’s the undisputed heavyweight champion of the 21st century.The world today faces three epochal challenges right now: runaway artificial intelligence (AI), climate change and spreading disorder from collapsing states. The US and China are the world’s AI superpowers. They are the world’s two leading carbon emitters. And they have the world’s two biggest naval forces, capable of projecting power globally.America and China are the only two powers, in other words, that together can offer any hope of managing superintelligence, superstorms and superempowered small groups of angry men in failed states — not to mention superviruses — at a time when the world has become superfused.Which is why we need an updated Shanghai Communique, the document that set out parameters for normalising US-China relations when Richard Nixon went to China and met Mao Zedong in 1972. Right now, unfortunately, we are denormalising. Our two countries are drifting farther and farther apart at all levels. In the three decades I have been visiting Beijing and Shanghai, I had never felt what I felt on this trip — as if I were the only American in China.Of course I wasn’t, but the American accents you would usually hear at a big Shanghai train station or Beijing hotel lobby were notably absent. Chinese parents say that many families no longer want their kids to go to the US for schooling, because they fear it’s becoming dangerous — the FBI might follow them while they are in America, and their own government might suspect them when they return home.The same is now true for US students in China. A professor in China who works with foreign students told me that some Americans don’t want to study there anymore for semesters abroad, in part because they don’t relish competing against superintense Chinese undergraduates and in part because, these days, having studied or worked in China can raise security suspicions with future potential US employers. medium nocaptionhttps://youtu.be/3ZL_fld_uBM?si=jtGhNhG45gD8y39KTrue, underneath all the talk of the new China-US cold war, there are still over 270,000 Chinese students studying in America, according to the US Embassy in Beijing, but there are now only about 1,100 American college students studying in China. That is down from around 15,000 a decade ago — but up from a few hundred in 2022, not long after Covid peaked. If these trends continue, where will the next generation of Chinese-speaking American scholars and diplomats come from and, similarly, Chinese who will understand America?A new Shanghai Communique could help govern the new realities that both countries and the world face. The first is that US and Chinese tech firms are racing towards artificial general intelligence; theirs is more focused on enhancing industrial production and surveillance and ours on a broad array of uses, from writing movie scripts to designing new drugs. Even if artificial general intelligence — a sentient machine — is five or seven years away, Beijing and Washington need to be collaborating on a set of rules that we will both use to govern AI and that the rest of the world must follow.That would be to embed into all AI systems algorithms that ensure that the system cannot be used for destructive purposes by bad actors and cannot go off on its own to destroy the humans who built it.In a little-noticed event, President Joe Biden and Xi took the first steps towards building such a regime when they agreed at their recent Peru summit on a declaration stating that “the two leaders affirmed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons”. That means no decision to fire a nuclear weapon can be made by an AI bot alone. There always has to be a human in the loop.US officials told me that those 17 words took months to negotiate. They must not be the last when it comes to erecting guardrails around the use of AI.On managing climate change, China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon and the US, the second largest, need to agree on a set of strategies to get the world to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 — to reduce the ruinous health, economic and extreme weather challenges wrought by climate change, which are going to create increasing disorder in failing states.As I tried to explain to my Chinese interlocutors on this trip: You think we are each other’s enemy. We might be, but we also now have a big common enemy, just as we did in 1972. Only this time it is not Russia. It’s disorder. More and more nation-states are falling apart — into disorder — and hemorrhaging their people as migrants scrambling to get to zones of order. medium nocaptionhttps://youtu.be/ue_PaW3PahQ?si=mZwitJVU3K33YzQGIt’s not only Libya, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria and Somalia in West Asia racked by disorder; it’s also some of China’s best friends in the global south, like Venezuela and Zimbabwe and Myanmar.And more than a few participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative to which China has lent billions are struggling — including Sri Lanka, Argentina, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Montenegro and Tanzania. Beijing is now starting to demand its money back from them and has throttled down new lending. But that is just making the crises worse in some of these countries.Only the US and China working together with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank will have the resources, power and influence to stem some of this disorder, which is why I repeatedly challenged my Chinese interlocutors: Why are you hanging around with losers like Vladimir Putin’s Russia and Iran? How could you be neutral between Hamas and Israel?China went from an impoverished isolated country to an industrial giant with a rising middle class in a world in which the rules of the game — on trade and geopolitics — were largely set by the US after World War II for the benefit and stability of all.The idea that China can thrive in a world shaped by the values of a murderous thief like Putin, who is an agent of disorder, or by fundamentalist Iran, another promoter of disorder and the next country likely to fracture, or by the global south — or by China alone — is crazy.If I were Trump, I’d explore a “Nixon goes to China” move — a rapprochement between the US and China that totally isolates Russia and Iran. That’s how you end the Ukraine war, shrink Iran’s influence in West Asia and defuse tensions with Beijing in one move. Trump is unpredictable enough to try it.Either way, China and America are compelled to work together if there is going to be a stable 21st century. If competition and collaboration give way entirely to confrontation, a disorderly 21st century awaits us both.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/international/us-and-china-have-a-big-common-enemy-now-and-its-not-russia/articleshow/116681063.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116681131/116681131.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:27:24","author":"Thomas L Friedman","authors":["Thomas L Friedman"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":276307008,"title":"In 2024, US deported one desi every 6 hours: Report","text":"AHMEDABAD: This year, one Indian was deported every six hours from the US, according to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report released on Dec 19.The number of Indians deported has grown by 400% between 2021 (292 out of total 59,011 deported) and 2024 (1,529 out of 2,71,484).

That was the last time the U.S. stock market closed out a second straight year with a leap of at least 20%, something the S&P 500 is on track to do again this year. The index has climbed 24.3% so far this year, not including dividends, following last year’s spurt of 24.2%.\n\nThe number of all-time highs the S&P 500 has set so far this year. The first came early, on Jan. 19, when the index capped a two-year comeback from the swoon caused by high inflation and worries that high interest rates instituted by the Federal Reserve to combat it would create a recession. But the index was methodical through the rest of the year, setting a record in every month outside of April and August, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The latest came on Dec. 6.\n\nThe number of times the Federal Reserve has cut its main interest rate this year from a two-decade high, offering some relief to the economy. Expectations for those cuts, along with hopes for more in 2025, were a big reason the U.S. stock market has been so successful this year. The 1 percentage point of cuts, though, is still short of the 1.5 percentage points that many traders were forecasting for 2024 at the start of the year. The Fed disappointed investors in December when it said it may cut rates just two more times in 2025, fewer than it had earlier expected.\n\nThat's how many points the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by the day after Election Day, as investors made bets on what Donald Trump's return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. The more widely followed S&P 500 soared 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. Aside from bitcoin, stocks of banks and smaller winners were also perceived to be big winners. The bump has since diminished amid worries that Trump's policies could also send inflation higher.\n\nThe level that bitcoin topped to set a record above $108,000 this past month. It’s been climbing as interest rates come down, and it got a particularly big boost following Trump’s election. He’s turned around and become a fan of crypto, and he’s named a former regulator who's seen as friendly to digital currencies as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, replacing someone who critics said was overly aggressive in his oversight. Bitcoin was below $17,000 just two years ago following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.","url":"https://news.net/news/how-the-stock-market-defied-expectations-again-this-year-by-the-numbers/","image":"https://dymlcaxjpm5z9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/19233504/Financial_Markets_Wall_Street_08775-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:26:24","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":276306672,"title":"Required Indiana U.

Our Ivory Tower “academic” types realize that without DEI, their existence is useless. So they’re desperate to keep it on life support. \n\nThat appears to be the reason why Indiana University is teaching its students they’re automatically either oppressors or victims based on their race, sex, religion, class and any other “identity” they can come up with. \n\nA mandatory course, titled “Understanding Diversity in a Pluralistic Society” instructs none other than Social Work majors “about differences and similarities in the experiences, needs, and beliefs of selected minority groups and their relation to the majority group,” according to its description. \n\nColleen Rose, the social worker who teaches the course, seems to make students adopt Multiple Personality Disorder by writing an “in-depth reflection of two parts of [their] identity: one subordinate identity and one dominant identity,” according to the Washington Free Beacon. \n\nHow do students know which part of their identity is the bad, oppressive one? By taking a look at a chart provided, of course! Who’s listed as the most problematic? \n\nRelated: Progressive Radio Hosts Claims Racism Is Why America Doesn't Have Socialist Healthcare\n\nYou guessed it! Straight, White Men! (Along with the entire Middle Class and “Able-bodied” people.)\n\n“I’m being punished through an assignment for my identity as a person,” one student complained in an interview with the Beacon, calling it “very rich that in a class where we are supposed to be talking about identity and not suppressing identity, I’m forced to suppress my own identity.”\n\nHe claims the racially divisive exercise forced him to “make something up” about who he is as a person in order to complete the task.\n\n“I have to suppress myself because I’m presumed to be some privileged, horrible human being that didn’t grow up without food,” the student added, calling it “insane.” \n\nBut Rose’s assignment goes further.\n\nAfter marking themselves on the chart of intersectional evils, students must renounce their bad identities and basically apologize for existing.\n\n\"You will gain insight into your experiences of identity in the U.S., including both advantages and disadvantages you have experienced related to these identities,\" the instructions continued.\n\n\"Self-awareness of identity, as well as experiences of privilege and oppression, serve as the basis for understanding the complexity of identity and how you can address issues of oppression,” they continued. \n\nStudents who subject themselves to this course in re-education will fulfill their \"social and historical studies\" requirement toward obtaining their college degree. Still– As woke as her syllabus is, Rose’s class does not satisfy a second degree requirement, titled “diversity in the United States.” \n\nStudents must choose between courses like \"Black Women in the Diaspora,\" \"American Ethnic Diversity,\" and \"Sexual Diversity” in order to earn that mandatory badge on their Budenovka (I mean, graduation cap.) \n\nFollow MRCTV on X!\n\nJill Biden corrected

unwarranted fatal shooting of three men on Tuesday.\n\nResidents took to the streets on Boxing Day and blocked three different sections of the Orange main road to showcase their feelings on the matter in which three men, who have been identified as Alex Medley, Rojay Duncan and one only as Max, were killed.\n\nAccording to a police report, officers had gone into the community to execute a search warrant for a person of interest in relation to a flare up of violence in Rose Heights, St James. \n\nViolence has contributed to several murders and shootings in the parish, including the death of social media influencer, Marlon Samuels otherwise called “41 Busshead.” \n\nThe police said they came under gunfire and when the fire was returned, three men were found to have been fatally wounded and three firearms seized following that confrontation.\n\nHowever, residents have disputed that account of events, declaring that the men had peacefully surrendered to the police when they were approached in the early morning.\n\nThis led to the roadblock on Thursday with residents using a variety of objects to obstruct vehicular traffic on sections of the roadway.\n\nRoadblock in Orange St

Donald Trump nominates Miami-Dade official as US ambassador to Panama","text":"Kevin Marino Cabrera, a former Florida state director, was nominated US ambassador to Panama by US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday. According to Trump, Kevin will promote US interests in Panama in a \"FANTASTIC\" manner. It was announced on Trump's 'Truth Social' platform. In a statement released on Truth Social, Trump said, \"I am pleased to announce that Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a country that is ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dreams.\" \"Kevin is a fierce fighter for America First principles,\" he added. At the moment, Kevin Marino Cabrera is a commissioner for Miami-Dade County. In addition, he is the International Trade Consortium's vice chairman. Cabrera, a Miami native, represents District Six on the Miami-Dade County Commission, which includes the cities of Miami, Hialeah, Coral Gables, Miami Springs, Virginia Gardens, and West Miami in addition to the rural portions of the county. During Trump's first term as president, Kevin served as the state director of Florida. \"Kevin is a fierce fighter for America First principles. As a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, and Vice Chairman of the International Trade Consortium, he has been instrumental in driving Economic growth, and fostering International partnerships. In 2020, Kevin did an incredible job as my Florida State Director and, this year, advanced our MAGA Agenda as a Member of the RNC Platform Committee,\" Trump added. Trump thinks Cabrera's understanding of Latin American politics qualifies him for the position. \"Few understand Latin American politics as well as Kevin - He will do a FANTASTIC job representing our Nation’s interests in Panama!\" he said.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-who-is-kevin-marino-cabrera-donald-trump-nominates-miami-dade-official-as-us-ambassador-to-panama-3124216","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/12/26/2668720-image-88.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:23:24","author":"Sonali Sharma","authors":["Sonali Sharma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.84},{"id":276306474,"title":"Donald Trump's AI head Sriram Krishnan’s views on H1B visas, green cards","text":"Incoming US President Donald Trump recently appointed Sriram Krishnan as his Senior Advisor on Artificial Intelligence. Chennai born techie Sriram Krishnan has vast experience and has been a general partner of the American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz since 2021. He began his career with Microsoft, after which he joined Facebook. Till 2019, Sriram Krishnan worked for Twitter (now X) and closely worked with Elon Musk who will be co-heading DOGE (Department for Government efficiency) While announcing his appointment, Trump in a post on X said: “Sriram Krishnan will serve as Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy…Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology” In his post, Trump also mentioned Krishnan’s rich experience and the fact that he began his career with Microsoft. Interestingly, Sriram Krishnan has spoken in favour of expanding the H1B program and expediting the green card for individuals belonging to certain professions. He has also been in favour of removing the country cap on H1-B visas and Green cards. Several Trump supporters were critical of his appointment pointing to his stance on H1B and Green cards. Far-right American activist Laura Loomer said that Sriram Krishnan’s views on immigration are diametrically opposite to those of Trump and go against the “America First” agenda of Donald Trump. She also dubbed the Indian origin entrepreneur as a “career leftist”. David Sacks, Incoming White House A.I. & Crypto Czar and Elon Musk came to Sriram Krishan’s defense. Sacks highlighted the point that Sriram Krishnan does not want to remove all caps, but country-based ones. Said Sacks “Sriram still supports skills-based criteria for receiving a green card, not making the program unlimited. He wants to make the program entirely merit-based”.. Elon Musk also said that the criticism of Sriram Krishnan lacked merit and was based on the ‘fixed-pie’ fallacy. Said Musk in a post on X: “The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!” The appointment of Sriram Krishnan points to the possible divide within the upcoming Trump administration regarding immigration policies. It is not just Sriram Krishnan, even Elon Musk himself has repeatedly highlighted the fact that the US should be open to welcoming talented individuals who contribute towards the country’s economy. Here it would be pertinent to point out that Trump himself has spoken about the need for US to welcome and retain talent. During an interview, the incoming president had said that international students who graduate from US colleges should be granted Green cards. It remains to be seen if Trump actually implements this proposal. In conclusion, it remains to be seen if Trump and his team go ahead with some of the tough policy reforms pertaining to immigration while also focusing on retaining international students with skills and qualifications. There could be divisions in the upcoming administration on the issue of immigration. Certain members of his team would not be opposed to an immigration policy which is merit-based, while others may favour an approach which is driven more by political interests and aimed at appealing to certain constituencies. While course-corrections in the realm of immigration policies are taking place across the Anglosphere – UK, Canada and Australia – some changes under Trump 2.0 can not be ruled out. At the same time an excessively insular immigration policy which discourages students and professionals would be counter productive for the US.

Not coincidentally, President Joe Biden had been in office for just over a year. He then boasted that the economic sanctions that he was imposing upon Russia would cripple them.\n\nThis appears to be just another failure of Biden’s administration. Campaigning in the 2020 election, he said that Vladimir Putin knew better than to mess with him. Well, we see where that has gone.\n\nIt’s gone the failure route of Biden’s economic policy, his border policy, etc. Biden’s faux tough-guy demeanor has fooled no one, especially the international community.\n\nYes, now it’s time to turn the page.\n\nHere’s hoping for international peace at least for the next four years.\n\nGreg McLaughlin, Belle Mead\n\nThe wolf, the sheep, and the value of victims\n\nTo paraphrase George Orwell, in this “Animal Farm” — the one called America — all animals are created equal but, as bitter experience has taught us, some animals are more equal than others.\n\nA case in point is the extraordinary lengths to which authorities went tracking down the alleged killer of insurance executive Brian Thompson, in essence, a “wolf” who made money for his company by denying the “sheep” access to life-saving medical care.\n\nThere were hundreds of cops on the case, extensive use of surveillance cameras to track suspect Luigi Mangione’s movements, high-level press conferences, front-page headlines, and ultimately, simultaneous state and federal charges leveled against him.\n\nThen, we see a minor writeup: “N.J. man sentenced man to 15 years for beating 18-year-old man to death in city street,” about an aggravated manslaughter case from 2020 in Paterson.\n\nThe 40-year-old man was convicted last year of beating his victim — one of the “sheep” — Nicolas Reyes, for 11 long minutes. For this, the killer, Tyheem Jones, recently received a 15-year sentence. That’s fewer than the number of years his victim lived. And, Jones will be eligible for parole after serving 85% of the sentence, less than 13 years.\n\nSo much attention is given to the wolf, while the sheep’s life is treated as if it were nothing.\n\nIf only the sheep realized how vastly they outnumber the wolves.\n\nJohn Woodmaska, Kearny \n\nStar-Ledger needs self-examination\n\nThe Star-Ledger’s Jerry Izenberg is a swell guy and a terrific sports columnist.\n\nBut, his recent piece, “The crazy story of an N.J. college that never existed…,” about a prank involving phoning in phony football scores to newspaper sports departments many years ago, lacked awareness and class. The article repeatedly mocked The New York Times for falling victim to the scam by publishing the fake score, but never acknowledging the error.\n\nOne could fill a book with examples of how The Star-Ledger has become a pathetic relic of a real newspaper, but I’ll cite just one from the Dec. 26 print sports section: The story on the New York Knicks’ annual Christmas Day basketball game at Madison Square Garden was sourced from the Associated Press wire service.\n\nApparently, Manhattan is too distant a destination for a Star-Ledger sportswriter.\n\nSo, before the Star-Ledger publishes columns that mock other newspapers, maybe it should look at its own.\n\nEd Marks, Millburn\n\nThey’re still gaga for Gaetz\n\nConcerning former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whose conduct a just-released House ethics committee report strongly criticized:\n\nAlthough he had won re-election, Gaetz resigned from Congress in mid-November, after he was forced to withdraw as President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general.\n\nIt should be of interest that on Election Day, 66% of the voters in his district voted for him over a Democratic challenger.\n\nEither these voters didn’t know about Gaetz’s behavior, or they didn’t care about it.\n\nWhat does this say about the state of politics?\n\nCarl Singer, Passaic\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

There's no possibility of opening any kind of conversation around this reality, which has cost the country blood, sweat and tears,\" he added.The canal, inaugurated in 1914, was built by the United States but handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-US president Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos.Trump on Saturday slammed what he called \"ridiculous\" fees for US ships passing through the canal and hinted at China's growing influence.\"It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!\"If Panama could not ensure \"the secure, efficient and reliable operation\" of the channel, \"then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question,\" he said.An estimated five percent of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the US East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.The United States is its main user, accounting for 74 percent of cargo, followed by China with 21 percent.Mulino said the canal's usage fees were \"not set at the whim of the president or the administrator\" of the interoceanic waterway, but under a long-established \"public and open process.\"\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference or participation in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" Mulino said.On Wednesday, Trump wrote on Truth Social alleged, without evidence, that Chinese soldiers were \"lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal.\" Mulino denied that allegation, too.\"There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God,\" he added.Panama established diplomatic relations with China in 2017, after breaking off ties with Taiwan -- a decision criticized by Trump's first administration.On Tuesday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the US embassy in Panama City chanting \"Trump, animal, leave the canal alone\" and burning an image of the incoming US president.","summary":"Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday ruled out negotiations with US President-elect Donald Trump over control of the Panama Canal, denying that China was interfering in its operation.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/panama-president-rules-out-talks-trump-over-canal-threat-3756989","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4571630/cargo-ship-passes-through-miraflores-locks-panama-canal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:06:25","author":"Juan Jose Rodriguez","authors":["Juan Jose Rodriguez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.466},{"id":276304646,"title":"BUCHOLTZ: Focus on Canada-U.S. border security is a long time coming","text":"On Dec. 17, the federal government announced more details about its plans to spend an additional $1.3 billion on border security and associated issues. \n\nIn ordinary circumstances, the current government would not have even bothered opening up this file. For decades, successive governments have mostly ignored border security and potential threats from other countries. \n\nCanadians have seen this not just at the border, or with immigration enforcement, but also with the decline in personnel and equipment for the Canadian military.\n\nGovernments since the 1960s have mostly ignored these essential elements of nationhood. \n\nHowever, November’s election of Donald Trump as the incoming U.S. president has changed that thinking. Trump has threatened 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports to the U.S., starting in January — unless Canada gets serious about border issues and cuts the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. \n\nSurrey and Delta have three border crossings. The two in Surrey are among the busiest in the country, while the Delta crossing goes to the isolated area of Point Roberts. While the federal government has invested in new facilities at the crossings and hired more staff, the way it deals with border issues hasn’t changed in decades. \n\nCustoms officers (now known as Canada Border Services Agency officers) have no power to deal with any issue that does not occur at an official port of entry. It is up to the RCMP to patrol the rest of the border. In fact, it is rare for RCMP to actually patrol the border. High-tech devices — heat sensors, drones, cameras and other technology — are rarely used, unlike the wide variety of devices the U.S. Border Patrol uses. \n\nMany of the incidents involving police or CBSA along the border come as a result of tips from U.S. officers. \n\nAt one time, Customs officers did have the power to patrol beyond border crossings. Customs officer Clifford Adams was actually shot and killed in Surrey in 1914 when he confronted a suspected U.S. bank robber, away from the border crossing. That power was taken away in 1932. Things have changed since then.\n\nMore and more people come to Canada from other countries to try and get into the U.S., as was the case with 29 people found inside a rail car of plastic pellets. They were found by U.S. border officials using X-rays in Blaine in August 2023.\n\nTrump has raised issues about drug smuggling. While official statistics suggest that drug smuggling from Canada to the U.S. isn’t much of an issue, the reality is that most smugglers aren’t caught. Drugs are smuggled into Canada in containers at ports such as Deltaport, where there is virtually no enforcement, and are then distributed all across Canada and to other parts of the world, including the U.S. \n\nThe new measures announced Dec. 17 include helicopter surveillance of the border (the RCMP already have a helicopter based in Langley), more use of drones, more dog sniffing teams, and a proposal to the U.S. to jointly set up a North American Joint Strike Force to deal with drug and people smuggling across the border. Maybe it could also deal with guns, routinely smuggled into Canada for use by criminals. \n\nThere was no word about hiring any more staff, either for CBSA or the RCMP. Nor was there any word about allowing CBSA officers to work outside official entry points, as has been suggested by the union representing CBSA officers. \n\nIf Canada is serious about border security, it would seem that making maximum use of existing border protection staff would be a good place to start. \n\nFrank Bucholtz writes twice monthly on political issues for Black Press Media publications.","url":"https://www.peacearchnews.com/opinion/bucholtz-focus-on-canada-us-border-security-is-a-long-time-coming-7716723","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/peacearch/2024-december/borer-lineup-peace-arch.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:05:24","author":"Frank Bucholtz","authors":["Frank Bucholtz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.02},{"id":276312518,"title":"The Weird New Normal of Donald Trump in 2024","text":"A year ago, a Trump victory was far from inconceivable—the grimly anti-incumbent mood of the American electorate, and the former President’s almost comically easy dispatch of a host of G.O.P. primary challengers who were, for the most part, afraid to criticize him, suggested that it was not only a possible outcome but even a likely one. Yet it is also true that, as 2024 began, Trump’s win was far from inevitable—an alternate reality that, like the half of the country that could not countenance his return to office, has been erased from the Trumpian narrative about his “unprecedented and powerful mandate.” In the weeks since Election Day, it’s been as if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and all the polite technocratic debates of their polite, technocratic Administration have vanished into the mists of time—were the past four years in Washington all some strange dream sequence, like that entire season of “Dallas” back in the nineteen-eighties?\nRadical revisionism—by Trump and on his behalf—is a strong contender for the theme of this disruptive year, in which some unique property of political alchemy managed to transform a defeated and disgraced ex-President facing four criminal indictments into a perfectly electable Republican candidate with a quirky communications style, a host of more or less legitimate grievances, and a plan to Make America Great Again by empowering his billionaire sidekicks and rolling back laws, regulations, geopolitical trends, and social norms that he and his voters don’t like. Rewriting history, relitigating old fights, plain old revanchism—these worked for Trump in 2024, and it’s a safe bet that, along with revenge and retribution, they will be the themes of the new Trump Administration that takes office on January 20th.\nWhether it’s peremptory attacks on a 1977 Panama Canal treaty whose terms he now wants to reject or the resurrection of nineteenth-century economic protectionism or the fantastical reimagining of the January 6th rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol as innocent martyrs, Trump is a conservative in an entirely different sense than the one we have come to know: he is not a Republican who sticks to the status quo but instead a would-be strongman whose attachment to a past of his own imagining will now, once again, become the country’s governing ideology.\nThis strikes me as more important than ever in 2024, after an election year in which tapping into the American capacity for collective forgetting proved to be one of Trump’s superpowers. Many of the year’s signal events were so dramatic that they don’t need much recounting now: Trump’s unprecedented criminal trial and his thirty-four felony convictions in a New York state court last May; the incoherent June 27th debate that effectively ended Biden’s career; the attempted assassination of Trump as he spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13th, and the remarkable images of him thrusting his fist in the air and mouthing “Fight!” immediately after a bullet grazed his ear but spared his life. It was just a few days later that Biden dropped out of the race, reinvigorating Democrats with sudden hope that they might beat Trump, after all—only to have Harris, despite a surge of joyous online memes and more than a billion dollars in campaign contributions, suffer an even bigger defeat to Trump than Hillary Clinton’s shocking loss to him in 2016.\nEven the subsidiary plotlines of 2024 were epic, from the spectre of the world’s richest man leaping around Trump’s rallies like an overheated schoolboy to the scorching success of a Republican ad campaign that portrayed America as a dangerous hellscape of invading illegal immigrants, rampant inflation, and intolerant leftists eager to force transgender surgery on your children. Soon after the election, Trump tried to appoint Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, even knowing that the Florida Republican had been investigated by his own congressional colleagues for paying a minor for sex—a choice that resulted in one of the fastest implosions of a Cabinet selection in modern history.\nWe will not soon forget all that. Where Trump benefits more from this failure to remember is in the common practice, among his allies and detractors alike, of disregarding much of what he says and does, whether it is his vow to close the U.S. border and begin the largest mass deportations in American history on the first day of his Presidency, to end the war in Ukraine in twenty-four hours, or to nullify the Constitution’s guarantee of birthright citizenship. So that’s what I’m most hoping does not get lost in this apathetic moment, when his enemies are averting their gaze and his allies are so confident in the imminent arrival of a MAGA utopia that they have little need to sweat the details. (A new Associated Press / NORC poll, released Thursday, says sixty-five per cent of American adults now feel the need to limit their consumption of news about politics and the government—the Great Tune-Out is real.)\nHeading into 2025, I do not believe that warnings about the dangers of an unchecked Trump are overstated. Instead, it is the creeping sense that Trump is entering office largely unopposed that more and more worries me. It is a major warning sign, among many, that the ideological policing of Trump’s adversaries as shrill, hysterical, and hypocritical has been so very effective. I am bracing for impact, and not only fearing but expecting the worst.\nBut while Trump may now believe himself so powerful that he can rewrite history on his own behalf, it’s also fair to anticipate that his past will serve not only as prologue but as precedent for 2025. If neither the American voters nor the Republican Party could stop Trump, his many personal weaknesses just might. Presidents, especially second-term Presidents, often stumble. Many occupants of the White House find themselves bogged down in scandal and infighting, victims of their own overreach, hubris, or just sheer incompetence. This was the story of the first Trump Administration, and there is plenty of reason to believe that it will be what happens in his second term, too. Should one root for the failure of an American President? Half of the country, Trump’s half, did this, to great effect, in 2024; in 2025, it will be everybody else’s turn. ♦","summary":"Radical revisionism is a strong contender for the theme of this disruptive year, in which some unique property of political alchemy managed to transform a defeated and disgraced ex-President into a perfectly electable Republican candidate.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2024-in-review/the-weird-new-normal-of-donald-trump-in-2024","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/675c887de3bc16c4dac43218/16:9/w_2800,h_1575,c_limit/20241211_new%20yorker_YIR03_politics.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-26 23:03:33","author":"Susan B.
