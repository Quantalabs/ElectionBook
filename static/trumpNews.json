Don Davis, one of the state's three Black members of Congress.\n\nThis followed a committee meeting where public speakers sharply accused Republican lawmakers in the ninth-largest state of bowing to President Trump. The plan's chief author was direct about the intent to help his party in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n\"The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular - draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the North Carolina congressional delegation,\" said GOP Sen. Ralph Hise. If Democrats otherwise take back the House, Hise added, they will \"torpedo President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nThe Republican legislative leaders announced plans a week ago to rework the map as a mid-decade redistricting fight escalates between Democrats and Republicans nationwide. Democrats need to gain just three more seats to seize control of the House, and the president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections.\n\nUnder the 2024 election map, Republicans won 10 of North Carolina's 14 U.S. House seats in a state where statewide races are often close. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022. Based on past statewide elections, Republicans would stand a decent chance of winning an 11th seat in 2026 should the latest proposal be implemented.\n\nAfter a Senate procedural vote Tuesday, the proposal will head to the House for expected final General Assembly approval later this week. The state Democratic Party plans an outdoor rally Tuesday to oppose it. But Democrats are the minority in both chambers, and state law prevents Democratic Gov. Josh Stein from using his veto stamp on redistricting action. Litigation challenging the map over allegations it dilutes Black voting power is likely.\n\n\"This is an attack on Black voters,\" Sen. Kandie Smith, an African American legislator representing a county in Davis' current district, said during Senate floor debate. \"It's about stealing elections by design, so that the outcomes are predetermined and accountability becomes optional.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, Davis' current 1st District — the state's only swing seat — would shift to the right as mapmakers remove inland counties, including Davis' home county, and replace them with several from the coast. Counties removed from the 1st District are placed in a retooled 3rd District held by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy. Election results indicate the 3rd would remain favorable for Murphy.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans, equipped with recent legal rulings that permit partisan advantage in drawing boundaries, last redrew the map in 2023, leading to three incumbent Democrats deciding against running in 2024 because lines had shifted rightward. Those changes helped Republicans retain their House majority entering 2025.\n\nTrump is also asking other red states for more seats. He encouraged North Carolina Republican legislators last Friday on Truth Social \"to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS.\"\n\nSenate Democrats and their allies also blasted North Carolina GOP legislative leaders for acting on a partisan map while they are still over three months late passing a state budget.\n\n\"They are wasting precious time and taxpayer dollars bending the knee to Donald Trump and ripping away the voice of the voters. It is shameful, it is pathetic,\" 19-year-old college student Eric Willoughby told the committee.\n\nThe national redistricting battle began over the summer when Trump urged Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts. After Texas lawmakers acted, California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own plan, which still needs voter approval in November.\n\nVoters within versions of the 1st District have elected African Americans to the seat continuously since 1992. Some counties in the current version have majority Black populations.\n\nThe proposed map is \"not merely a political act — it is a moral regression,\" said former 1st District Reps. Eva Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, both Black Democrats, in a news release. \"It weakens the representation of Black North Carolinians and undermines the promise of equal voice and fair elections that so many have fought to secure.\"\n\nHise said there's nothing unlawfully discriminatory about the map. He said race-based data wasn't used to retool boundaries and the lack of significant evidence of racially polarized voting in the region would make it unconstitutional to draw lines with a chief goal of helping Black voters elect their favored candidates.","summary":"Democrats need to gain just three more seats to seize control of the House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/north-carolina-congressional-map-vote-b2848935.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/10/10/north-carolina.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/UqcJ0xS7-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-21 01:11:06","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":371073658,"title":"Trump Vows to Wipe out Hamas if Gaza Deal Broken","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump warned Hamas Monday it would be \"eradicated\" if it breaches the Gaza deal with Israel, but said he would give the Palestinian militant group a chance to honor the truce. Vice President JD Vance headed to Israel shortly after Trump's comments, joining two top US envoys after weekend violence threatened to wreck the fragile ceasefire. \"We made a deal with Hamas that they're going to be very good, they're going to behave, they're going to be nice,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. \"And if they're not, we're going to go and we're going to eradicate them, if we have to. They'll be eradicated, and they know that.\" Trump helped broker the Gaza deal nearly two weeks ago but it has repeatedly come under threat as Israel accuses Hamas of stalling on handing over dead hostages, and of launching attacks. The US president has also warned the militant group to stop public executions of rivals and alleged collaborators as it seeks to reestablish its grip on the devastated territory. Trump, however, insisted that American forces would not be involved against Hamas, saying dozens of countries that have agreed to join an international stabilization forces for Gaza would \"love to go in.\" \"In addition, you have Israel would go in in two minutes, if I asked them to go in,\" Trump said. \"But right now, we haven't said that. We're going to give it a little chance, and hopefully there will be a little less violence. But right now, you know, they're violent people,\" he added. \"They got very rambunctious, and they did things that they shouldn't be doing, and if they keep doing it, then we're going to go in and straighten it out, and it'll happen very quickly and pretty violently.\" Trump said that Hamas was now far weaker, especially as regional backer Iran was now unlikely to step in on its behalf following US and Israeli strikes this year. \"They don't have the backing of really anybody anymore. They have to be good, and if they're not good, they'll be eradicated,\" Trump stressed. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser son-in-law Jared Kushner met Netanyahu on Monday to discuss \"developments and updates in the region\", a spokesman for the prime minister's office said. Vance and his wife Usha later left Washington for Israel without commenting to reporters.

The US President had claimed the new suite, designed to host state dinners and other formal occasions, \"wouldn't interfere with the current building\". Yet, the bulk of the East Wing was yesterday being torn down as part of the scheme. Heavy machinery was spotted ripping through the once-immaculate structure that has been part of the White House for over 100 years, witnessing every moment of the American century of global ascendancy. Hammering and crashing echoed across the vicinity, whilst reporters observed construction equipment gouging massive pieces from the walls. When video footage of the demolition was posted on X last night, Mr Trump, 79, once more justified the work. He shared on Truth Social: \"Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernised as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete.\" His statement mirrors earlier remarks from his press secretary Karoline Leavitt who, when directly questioned whether the East Wing would be demolished during the plan's announcement, said the East Wing will be \"modernised\". However, it appears to be almost entirely gone, alongside proposals for Mr Trump to construct a magnificent, 25,000 square feet ballroom. He unveiled the concept in July, declaring any alterations would \"pay total respect to the existing building\". Yet other garish alterations to his official residence since then have been dubbed \"Versailles meets Vegas\" - featuring golden cherubs, tacky umbrellas, 100ft flagpoles, and enormous paintings of himself displayed throughout the grand building. The new ballroom, however, is meant to be privately funded, with Mr Trump contributing himself. Contributors include Silicon Valley giants Apple and Google, defence contractor Lockheed Martin, and telecommunications company T-Mobile. Built in 1902 during President Theodore Roosevelt's administration, the East Wing was originally designed as a modest structure serving as the public entrance. It has since undergone expansion and alterations, particularly with a second storey added in 1942 to house offices for First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her team. However, last month, whilst revealing the construction site, Mr Trump informed some donors: \"It will be demolished. Everything out there is coming down and it will be replaced by the most beautiful ballroom.\" On Monday, as building work commenced, the gold curtains in the East Room stayed drawn to muffle any disturbance, though the president mentioned the project whilst welcoming two Louisiana State baseball teams to the White House.","summary":"A portion of the White House building is being demolished by Donald Trump for a huge new ballroom","url":"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/trump-knocks-down-white-house-36104755","image":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/article36104752.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_White-House-East-Room-Demolition-Begins-For-Trump-Ballroom-Construction.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 01:08:34","author":"Bradley Jolly,William Morgan","authors":["Bradley Jolly","William Morgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.089},{"id":371073804,"title":"Oil prices slip on oversupply concerns; US-China tensions weigh on demand outlook","text":"Oil prices fell on Tuesday on concerns about excess supply and risks to demand stemming from tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's top two oil consumers, even as President Donald Trump said he expected to reach a trade deal. Brent crude futures fell 14 cents, or 0.2%, at $60.87 a barrel at 0005 GMT. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) contract for November delivery, set to expire on Tuesday, eased 0.1% to $57.45. The more-active December contract was down 13 cents, or 0.2%, at $56.89. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he expects to reach a fair trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Disputes over tariffs, technology and market access remain unresolved ahead of their planned meeting in South Korea next week. \"I think we'll end up with a very strong trade deal. Both of us will be happy,\" Trump said. Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note that the near-term trading stance on crude remains bearish, favoring selling into price advances rather than buying pullbacks.Live Events \"But, we also feel that enough geopolitical uncertainty remains to occasionally offset oil balances that are becoming more negative with each passing week,\" they added. U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely rose last week, a preliminary Reuters poll on Monday showed, ahead of weekly reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the Energy Information Administration. In Russia, Rosneft-controlled Novokuibyshevsk refinery in the Volga region halted primary crude processing on Sunday following a drone attack. Separately, a strike on the Orenburg gas plant forced neighboring Kazakhstan to cut output at its Karachaganak oil and gas condensate field by 25% to 30%. Ambiguity around Russian oil supply persists, as Trump reiterated that India could face \"massive\" tariffs unless it halts purchases of Russian crude. India has become the leading buyer of discounted Russian oil following Western sanctions on Moscow. Oil prices have been falling partly due to a bearish outlook last week from the International Energy Agency, which projected the global oil market could face a surplus of nearly 4 million barrels per day in 2026, as OPEC+ producers and rivals ramp up output while demand remains sluggish.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onoil pricessupply concernstrade dealtariffsgeopolitical uncertaintyRitterbusch and AssociatesAmerican Petroleum InstituteEnergy Information AdministrationRosneftOrenburg gas plant\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

They are paying tremendous amounts of money to us in the form of tariffs. As you know, they are paying 55 per cent; that's a lot of money,” Trump said.The president added that previous administrations had allowed other countries to exploit the US on trade, but insisted such an era was over.“A lot of countries took advantage of the US and they are not able to take advantage anymore. China's paying 55 per cent and a potential 155 per cent come November 1st unless we make a deal,” he said.Live Events— ANI (@ANI) Trump eyes meeting with Xi in South KoreaTrump confirmed that he is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea within the next few weeks, describing their relationship as “very good” and expressing hope that the two sides could reach a balanced trade arrangement.“I am meeting with President Xi. We have a very good relationship; we are going to be meeting in South Korea in a couple of weeks... I think we are going to work out something which is good for both the countries,” he noted.Looking ahead to the meeting, Trump said he expected that a “fair and great trade deal” could be achieved once discussions conclude.“I think when we finish our meetings in South Korea, China and I will have a really fair and really great trade deal together. I want them to buy soybeans... It's going to be fantastic for both countries, and it's going to be fantastic for the entire world,” he added.Trump’s comments came during his Oval Office discussions with Albanese, where the two leaders unveiled an USD 8.5 billion agreement to boost cooperation on critical minerals and defence technology. The deal, finalised after months of negotiation, aims to reinforce supply chain resilience and enhance security collaboration between the US and Australia.“USD 8.5 billion is in the pipeline,” Albanese said, highlighting the scale of the new projects that will strengthen the long-standing alliance.Tariff escalation and export controlsEarlier in the day, Trump had posted on Truth Social announcing his intention to add another 100 per cent tariff on Chinese goods—“over and above” existing duties—starting November 1. The move, he said, followed what he described as an “extraordinarily aggressive” position from Beijing after the Chinese government allegedly circulated “an extremely hostile letter to the world.”“Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the USA, and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software,” Trump wrote.In his post, Trump accused China of preparing sweeping export controls that would affect “virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them,” calling the move “a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations.”“It has just been learnt that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on trade... This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago,” he said.Plans for a 2026 visit to ChinaDespite his criticism, Trump revealed that he had accepted an invitation to visit China early next year, suggesting that dialogue between the two governments would continue even amid rising tensions.“I've been invited to go to China. And I'm going to be doing that sometime fairly early next year,” he said.Trump’s remarks come as Washington and Beijing brace for another high-stakes round of negotiations that could reshape global trade flows.

Albanese stated that the deal was “just taking” the relationship between the U.S. and Australia “to the next level.”\n\nThis development follows Beijing's recent announcement that foreign companies will now require Chinese government approval to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials originating from China or produced with its technology. Trump's Republican administration views this as granting China extensive control over the global economy by dominating the technology supply chain.\n\n“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters on Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.\n\nHassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources.

I’d like to know what Sellers does for the Black community,” he said, referencing the CNN commentator’s similar dig at Smith. “And yet CNN pays him money to go on and do this stuff.”\n\nThe host of “No Spin News” then defended Smith’s comments about Crockett, where Smith criticized the congresswoman for speaking out against President Donald Trump but not backing up her words with actions.\n\n“He said that Congresswoman Crockett is a phony,” O’Reilly said. “And it’s true. She’s in it for self-aggrandizement, a lot like [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez.”\n\nO’Reilly said that he has since spoken with the sports and political commentator, suggesting to him that Sellers is “jealous because you have far more African Americans who respect you.”\n\nThe origins of this drama started when Sellers joined the “Native Land” podcast with Angela Rye, Tiffany Cross and Andrew Gillum. The group discussed Smith’s Crockett criticism, and Sellers called Smith a “charlatan.”\n\nSellers doubled down on his comment in an Instagram video Friday, saying that the sports and political commentator cares more about prominent political figures’ perspectives on his ideas than the Black community.\n\n“While you’re appreciating the gaze of those individuals in the White House, the gaze of people like Sean Hannity, Bill O’Reilly, you’re quiet as a church mouse pissing on cotton when Donald Trump is out here trying to take away our voting rights, when he’s putting police and National Guard in our American cities, taking Black and Brown people out of their homes,” Sellers said in an Instagram video.\n\n“What you hear in my voice is not resentment. It’s disappointment,” Sellers added. “I know you stand on the shoulders of strong Black men, and you are disappointing us every time you continue to chop down those people, who are doing that real work.”\n\nO’Reilly, in his response, hit back at this notion, too. “Nobody’s trying to take away the voting rights of African Americans. That’s just BS,” he said. “There’s just no evidence of that…It’s just the usual progressive blather.”\n\nThough, the TV personality did note that Sellers is welcome to come on his show any time and debate him if he so chooses, adding that he doubts he will take him up on it.\n\nWatch O’Reilly’s full response above.","summary":"The conservative news host calls out Bakari Sellers after the CNN commentator says Smith is a \"charlatan\"\n\n\nThe post Bill O’Reilly Defends Stephen A.

life","text":"Australia and the US have inked a deal on rare earths and critical minerals.\n\nThe critical minerals deal will see about $US8.5 billion invested into various projects over the next six months.\n\nPrior to the meeting, President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One, \"I don't want to play the rare earths game with China\", referencing export controls on a range of critical minerals China hit the US with in April, and expanded recently.\n\nAs Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, put it last month: \"Australia more or less equals the periodic table, geology has been kind to us.\"\n\nBut being able to mine the raw materials, and having the capacity to process them into something useful, represent two separate challenges.\n\nAustralian companies have mostly solved the latter part by selling to China.\n\nEarlier this month China placed strict export controls on holmium, europium, ytterbium, thulium, erbium. \n\nIn April it slapped similar controls on samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium.\n\nChina's position as the world's factory over the past decades, combined with its successful position as the world's dominant miner and processor of rare earths, nickel, lithium and cobalt among others, has seen these minerals move into a massive amount of mundane household items, from vacuum cleaners to headphones.\n\nBut elements on this list are also being used in cutting edge nanotechnology and materials research.\n\nSome have also proven to be essential in the advancement of life-saving cancer treatments, powerful medical diagnostics and imaging tools, as well as more undetectable weapons and sharper military intelligence gathering.\n\nThe AI boom\n\nThe expansion in artificial intelligence (AI)'s capacity is underpinned by the rollout of data centres and high-powered Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).\n\nFor example, one of the steps in manufacturing a semi-conductor is polishing the wafer, and cerium oxide has proven to be an effective material in that process.\n\nOther rare earth elements can also improve the manufacturing process.\n\n\"Doping rare earth elements in semiconductor materials can adsorb impurities, thereby effectively improving the purity and integrity of semiconductor materials,\" according to US-based Stanford Advanced Materials.\n\nAs chips have become smaller and more powerful, lanthanum oxide has been identified as a better material than silicon dioxide as a component in transistors.\n\nMedical diagnostics\n\nOne heavy rare earth element, gadolinium, has become crucial for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\nIt's one of the most magnetic elements on the periodic table, and that's made it a useful part of MRI contrast injections.\n\nGadolinium is paramagnetic, which means it's attracted by an external magnetic force.\n\nSo when you're injected with a gadolinium-based contrast, it allows the MRI scanner to produce higher resolution and more accurate images.\n\nIn a 2019 paper, South Korean scientists found that adding a range of rare earth elements to CT scan contrast agents, including ytterbrium and gadolinium, provided much better results when compared with an iodine-based contrast agent.\n\n\"Doping\" an yttrium aluminium garnet with neodymium created the Nd:YAG laser, commonly used in cosmetic medicine as an ablative laser for the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles, tattoo and hair removal.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nThe magnetic properties of heavy rare earths like neodymium, dysprosium and praseodymium have made them essential in manufacturing of high-performance permanent magnets.\n\nIn direct-drive wind turbines, like the ones at the Mt Millar Wind Farm on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula for example, use of these magnets improves efficiency at low wind speeds.\n\nAnd since they don't have a gearbox, there are fewer moving parts that require maintenance, which lowers running costs. \n\n\"The increased demand for wind turbine components and rise in manufacturing capacity for wind energy will drive higher demand for specific materials, including [rare earth elements] such as neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium, as well as critical materials like copper, nickel and zinc,\" the Global Wind Energy Council said in its 2024 Global Wind Report.\n\nThey're also vital components of the electric motors and battery chemistry that power EVs, which is tipped to be a key driver of growth in rare earth element demand over coming years.\n\nDefence applications\n\nA decade ago, David S Abraham's book The Elements of Power: Gadgets, Guns, and the Struggle for a Sustainable Future in the Rare Metal Age described the F-35 jet as a \"flying periodic table\".\n\n\"The nuts and bolts that hold the plane together are made from beryllium … gallium helps amplify the radar's signal … tantalum sits in the capacitors needed for laser targeting, controls, and cockpit displays',\" Mr Abrahams wrote.\n\nElements like yttrium, gadolinium, dysprosium and terbium have been incorporated into ceramics, alloys and coatings to improve the stealth of military aircraft, missiles and vehicles. \n\nEuropium and yttrium are used in night-vision goggles and rare earths have improved heads up displays.","summary":"Many of Australia's critical minerals can be found in a

Breaks Down What ‘No Kings’ Reveals About Politics Today","text":"Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume said Monday that the recent “No Kings” rallies reveal how American politics remains centered around President Donald Trump.\n\nSaturday’s string of anti-Trump “No Kings” protests united left-wing groups that have defended authoritarian regimes while accusing Trump of acting like one. During an appearance on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier,” Hume noted that while the demonstrations highlighted a deeper reality about modern political identity.\n\n“If you looked at it, you might have thought it was a cross between the faculty lounge and the retirement home. But nonetheless, they’re all voters. They count. And the fact that they turned out tells you something. And what I think it tells you is just how our politics has turned out over the last eight or nine years,” Hume told host Bret Baier. “It is all about Trump. It is about resistance to Trump. And it is about support for Trump. Support prevailed in 2016. Resistance prevailed in 2020. And his support prevailed again in 2024. And it’s still going on.”\n\nHume said that this ongoing clash defines the nation’s political reality.\n\n“Same battle. Same guy. You know, I’ve called in the political classes of our time. But he is the issue. Everything else is secondary. Everything. And that’s what these rallies suggest,” Hume added.\n\nWhen asked about the rallies’ branding, Hume dismissed the “No Kings” label as “kind of ridiculous” and “absurd.”\n\n“We don’t have a king, as the president said, and if we did, it’s not clear that protests like the No Kings rally would be permitted,” Hume noted.\n\nHume pointed out that Trump, like any other U.S. president, came to power through elections and governed under the constraints of the Constitution. (RELATED: Brit Hume Predicts Which Party Will Get Blamed For Government Shutdown)\n\n“This president, remember, came to power by running for election three times. His major program was put into place by a vote of democratically elected members of Congress. Kings don’t have to worry about things like that, nor do they have to worry about the courts restraining them. So, it’s an absurd name,” Hume explained.\n\nDozens of protests erupted nationwide Saturday targeting Trump and his administration’s policies. Throughout the 2022 midterms and the 2024 presidential race, Democrats repeatedly portrayed Trump and other Republicans as fascists or threats to democracy.\n\nOrganizers of the “No Kings” protests claimed that 7 million Americans joined 2,700 demonstrations across major U.S. cities to reject what they called “authoritarianism” and to affirm that the nation “does not belong to a king,” according to the movement’s website. The group declared that the United States “will not be ruled by fear, force, or one man’s power grab.”\n\nSome demonstrators used violent rhetoric during the rallies. In Seattle, a protester said he wanted to kill White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, calling him a Nazi.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, a woman told a reporter that reading Trump’s obituary would make for a “wonderful birthday present.” In Chicago, another protester appeared to make a “neck shot” gesture toward counter-protesters displaying a flag honoring Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot in the neck on Sept. 10.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But in her original ruling granting the stay, US District Judge Karin Immergut dismissed his comments as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"\nAlthough the city has seen scattered attacks on federal officers and property, the Trump administration failed to demonstrate \"that those episodes of violence were part of an organised attempt to overthrow the government as a whole,\" Immergut wrote.\nProtests in Portland did not pose a \"danger of rebellion\" and \"regular law enforcement forces\" could handle such incidents, Immergut said.\nCircuit Judge Susan Graber, dissenting from the ruling released Monday, said the administration's seizing of Oregon's National Guard - a force usually under the control of the state's governor - was a dangerous erosion of constitutional rights.\n\"Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" she wrote.\n\"But today’s decision is not merely absurd.

We are on a dangerous path in America,\" he said.\nGovernor Tina Kotek said she wanted to hear from Trump exactly what he expected National Guard troops to do in a city where people protest peacefully.\n\"The Trump Administration is being dishonest, and these actions to deploy troops are a gross, un-American abuse of power,\" she said.","summary":"The ruling escalates the clash between the White House and liberal states opposing a creeping militarisation of US society.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/21/us-appeals-court-says-trump-can-deploy-soldiers-in-portland","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/25398609-us-national-guard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 00:09:00","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.085},{"id":371069322,"title":"New push to lower Australia's speed limit to 30km/h to improve safety for cyclists","text":"New push to lower Australia's speed limit to 30km/h to improve safety for cyclists\n\nResearch backs calls for lower speed limits \n\nREAD MORE: Fed up 'Karen' confronts teen cyclists \n\nBy NICHOLAS WILSON, NEWS REPORTER, AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:54 BST, 21 October 2025 | Updated: 01:07 BST, 21 October 2025\n\nNew research suggesting lower speed limits could improve cyclist safety has reignited debate over controversial road rules in Victoria.\n\nA study by RMIT University found that cutting the limit from 50 km/h to 30 km/h on residential roads would more than double the use of 'low-stress' cycling routes.\n\nResearchers said the change would have 'barely any impact' on driving times when applied only to smaller neighbourhood streets, not major arterial roads.\n\nThe findings strengthen the case for the Allan government's new speed-limit reforms, which allow councils to propose 30 km/h limits in school zones and local streets.\n\nBut the idea has divided Victorians, with some motorists taking to social media to vent their concerns that slower limits will frustrate drivers and worsen congestion.\n\n'Over the years we've seen speed limits reduced in more and more areas - often in the name of safety,' one man wrote.\n\n'But are these changes really making our roads safer, or just more frustrating for everyday drivers?' He added: 'At this rate, I might be better off riding a horse to work.'\n\nLibertarian Leader David Limbrick told the Daily Mail the lower speed limit was 'ridiculous', adding: 'At this rate, cyclists themselves will be speeding.'\n\nRMIT researcher Dr Afshin Jafari (pictured above) said the lower speed limit on residential streets would have minimal impact on car trips \n\nThe Victorian Government will allow councils to propose 30km/h in school zones and on local streets.

The card maker said in a statement Monday that it could not disclose the terms, and SpaceX did not return email and telephone messages left with the company and its Texas lawyer seeking comment.\n\nCards Against Humanity, which is headquartered in Chicago, originally purchased the plot of land in 2017 as part of what it said was a stunt to oppose President Donald Trump’s efforts to build a border wall.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Cards Against Humanity alleges SpaceX essentially treated the game company’s property — located in Cameron County in far south Texas — as its own for at least six months.\n\nThe lawsuit said SpaceX, which had previously acquired other plots of land near the property, had placed construction materials, such as gravel, and other debris on the land without asking for permission to do so.\n\nCards Against Humanity said in an email Monday to The Associated Press that SpaceX admitted during the discovery phase of the case to trespassing on its property. The company said a trial “would have cost more than what we were likely to win from SpaceX.”\n\n“The upside is that SpaceX has removed their construction equipment from our land and we’re able to work with a local landscaping company to restore the land to its natural state: devoid of space garbage and pointless border walls.”\n\nThe company has previously said 150,000 people had each contributed $15 toward helping purchase the land in Texas and that they had hoped to pay back those donors with proceeds from a settlement.\n\nOver the years, Cards Against Humanity says the land has been maintained in its natural state. It also says it displayed a “no trespassing” sign to warn people they were about to step on private property.\n\nThe company was asking for $15 million in damages, which it says includes a loss of vegetation on the land.\n\n“Were we hoping to be able to pay all our fans? Sure.

Harris joined liberal journalist Kara Swisher at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., to discuss her new book, \"107 Days,\" which details her whirlwind experience in the 2024 election. During the interview, Harris touted her own credentials, comparing them to those of the Trump administration and said, \"Some people have actually said I was the most qualified candidate ever to run for president.\" \"I like the ‘some people say,’ very nice, but go ahead,\" Swisher joked in response. The phrases \"some people say\" and \"many people are saying\" are often considered to be some of Trump’s common phrases typically used before he touts the accomplishments of himself and his administration. KAMALA HARRIS HINTS AT POSSIBLE 2028 RUN, SAYS SOME CALL HER 'MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE EVER' \"She was on stage with Kara Swisher, and Kara Swisher was kind of like ragging on her a little bit. She was like, 'Uh, you know, uh, a lot of — some people said that I was the most qualified person to ever run for president' Like, who said that? And Kara's like, 'Some people said that?' Like, who said that?\" Rogan said. \"You are literally running against a guy who was already president. So, if you're going based on your resume, you're not more qualified than Biden. Biden was the vice president of the United States for eight years!\" Schulz responded on how the GOP is using Harris' book tout to show why she lost the election. \"When she went away for a while, I think you could be like, you could pretend about what she was and what she stood for,\" Schulz said before highlighting how on her book tour she ignited controversy about why she couldn't pick Pete Buttigieg as her running mate. BILL MAHER RIPS KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, SAYS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED, 'EVERYONE SUCKS BUT ME' Rogan pointed to a 2021 Harris' Columbus Day message that recently resurfaced.

The US President had said the new suite, which will accommodate state dinners and other formal events, \"wouldn't interfere with the current building\". However, the majority of the East Wing was yesterday being demolished as part of the project. Machinery was seen ripping into the once-pristine structure which has formed part of the White House for more than one century. Banging and crashing were heard throughout the area, as journalists watched construction equipment tear chunks out of the walls. When footage of the work was shared on X, formerly Twitter , last night, Mr Trump, 79, again defended the work. He posted on Truth Social: \"Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernised as part of this process, and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete.\" His post reflects comments previously made by his press secretary Karoline Leavitt who, when asked point-blank if the East Wing would be demolished when the plans were rolled out, said the East Wing will be \"modernised\". But it looks to be nearly gone entirely, amid plans Mr Trump wants to build a grand, 25,000 square feet ballroom. He announced the vision in July, stating any changes would \"pay total respect to the existing building\". Yet other brash amendments to his the official residence since then have been branded as \"Versailles meets Vegas\" - with golden cherubs, tacky umbrellas to 100ft flagpoles, and giant paintings of himself put up inside the grand building. The new ballroom, though, is supposed to be privately funded, with Mr Trump chipping in himself. Donors include Silicon Valley titans, Apple and Google , defense behemoth Lockheed Martin, and telecom provider, T-Mobile. Constructed in 1902 during President Theodore Roosevelt's tenure, the East Wing, in its original form, was designed initially as a small structure to serve as the public entrance. It has since been expanded and modified, notably with the addition of a second story in 1942 to provide offices for First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her staff. But last month, unveiling the construction site. Mr Trump told some of the donors: \"It will be demolished. Everything out there is coming down and it will be replaced by the most beautiful ballroom.\" On Monday, once construction started, the gold curtains in the East Room remained closed to drown out any noise, but the president referenced the project as he hosted two Louisiana State baseball teams at the White House.","summary":"Donald Trump is having part of the East Wing demolished so he can have a grand, 25,000 square feet ballroom to accommodate state dinners and other formal events","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-demolishes-part-white-36104726","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36104739.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_White-House-East-Room-Demolition-Begins-For-Trump-Ballroom-Construction.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-21 00:00:10","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":371073352,"title":"Karoline Leavitt defends her ‘your mom’ text response to reporter’s question","text":"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt publicly justified her response of 'your mom' to a reporter's question by sharing a screenshot of their text exchange and labelling him a 'left-wing hack'. \n\nThe exchange began when HuffPost White House correspondent S.V.

The suspects fled when they spotted a police officer nearby.\n\nThe attack on Coristine fueled President Donald Trump’s decision to flood Washington with a surge of patrols by federal agents and National Guard members.\n\nCotton-Powell and Taylor also are accused of participating in a separate attack and robbery of a man at a gas station shortly before they assaulted Coristine, Pirro said.\n\nCotton-Powell was arrested last Thursday. Taylor was arrested last Friday. Both are charged in D.C. Superior Court with attempted unarmed carjacking, robbery and assault with intent to commit a robbery.\n\nLast Tuesday, a federal judge sentenced the two 15-year-old suspects to probation after they pleaded guilty to assaulting Coristine. Trump said it was a “terrible” decision not to incarcerate the teens.\n\n“I think the judge should be ashamed of himself,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance.","summary":"Two 15-year-old suspects from Maryland previously were charged with Coristine’s beating.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/20/doge-employee-attack-charges/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DC_Federal_Intervention_92345_aaa4d5-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:52:42","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":371073356,"title":"Biden completes a round of radiation therapy as part of his prostate cancer treatment","text":"Former President Joe Biden on Monday completed a round of radiation therapy treatment for the aggressive form of prostate cancer he was diagnosed with after leaving office, a spokesperson said. \n\nBiden had been receiving treatment at Penn Medicine Radiation Oncology in Philadelphia, said aide Kelly Scully. \n\nThe 82-year-old Democrat left office in January, six months after he dropped his bid for reelection following a disastrous debate against Republican Donald Trump amid concerns about Biden's age, health and mental fitness.

ROBERTSON\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina’s legislature formally began redrawing the state’s congressional district map Monday, plainly stating their intent to help Republicans gain another U.S. House seat under President Donald Trump’s push to retain his party’s grip on Congress next year.\n\nThe state Senate gave initial approval along party lines to enact new boundaries for two eastern North Carolina districts in a move aimed to thwart the reelection of Democratic Rep. Don Davis, one of the state’s three Black members of Congress. That followed a committee meeting in which dozens of speakers from the public sharply accused Republican lawmakers in the ninth-largest state of bowing to Trump.\n\nThe plan’s chief author was direct about the map’s intent to help his party in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\n“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular — draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the North Carolina congressional delegation,” said GOP Sen. Ralph Hise, who shepherded it through his chamber. If Democrats otherwise take back the House, Hise added, they will “torpedo President Trump’s agenda.”\n\nThe Republican legislative leaders announced plans a week ago to rework the map, stepping into the fray over mid-decade redistricting that has Democrats and Republicans battling for electoral advantages coast to coast, including Texas and California. Democrats need just three more seats to seize control of the House, and the president’s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections.\n\nUnder the map used in the 2024 elections, Republicans won 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House seats in a state where statewide races are often close. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022. Based on past statewide elections, Republicans would stand a decent chance to win an 11th seat in 2026 should the proposed map be implemented.\n\nFinal vote expected this week, veto can’t block map\n\nAfter a Senate procedural vote Tuesday, the proposed map will head to the House, which is expected to give it final General Assembly approval later this week. The state Democratic Party plans an outdoor rally Tuesday to oppose it. But Democrats are the minority in both chambers, and state law prevents Democratic Gov. Josh Stein from using his veto stamp on redistricting action. Litigation challenging the map is almost certain, with allegations of harming the voting power of Black residents likely.\n\n“This is an attack on Black voters,” Sen. Kandie Smith, an African American legislator who represents a county in Davis’ current district, said during Senate floor debate. “It’s about stealing elections by design, so that the outcomes are predetermined and accountability becomes optional.”\n\nCounties added, removed to make district lean more to right\n\nUnder the proposal, Davis’ current 1st District — the state’s only swing seat — would shift to the right as mapmakers remove inland counties, including Davis’ home county, and replace them with several from the coast. Counties removed from the 1st District are placed in a retooled 3rd District held by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy. Election results indicate the 3rd would remain favorable for Murphy.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans, equipped with recent legal rulings that permit partisan advantage in drawing boundaries, last redrew the map in 2023, leading to three incumbent Democrats deciding against running in 2024 because lines had shifted rightward. Those changes helped Republicans maintain their House majority entering 2025.\n\nTrump is also asking other red states for more seats. Apparently pleased with North Carolina’s action, he encouraged Republican legislators last Friday on Truth Social “to work as hard as they can to pass this new Map so that we can continue our incredible Record of SUCCESS.”\n\nSenate Democrats and their allies blasted North Carolina GOP legislative leaders for acting on a partisan map while they are still over three months late passing a state budget.\n\n“They are wasting precious time and taxpayer dollars bending the knee to Donald Trump and ripping away the voice of the voters. It is shameful, it is pathetic,” Eric Willoughby, a 19-year-old college student, told the committee.\n\nThe national redistricting battle began over the summer when Trump urged Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts. After Texas lawmakers acted, California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own plan that still needs voter approval in November.\n\nFormer 1st District reps call proposal “a moral regression”\n\nThe current 1st District covers a region that has elected African Americans for over 30 years and where some counties have majority Black populations.\n\nThe proposed map is “not merely a political act — it is a moral regression,” said former 1st District representatives Eva Clayton and G.K. Butterfield, both Black Democrats, in a news release. “It weakens the representation of Black North Carolinians and undermines the promise of equal voice and fair elections that so many have fought to secure.”\n\nHise said there’s nothing unlawfully discriminatory about the map — race-based data wasn’t used to create the proposal and said the lack of evidence of racially polarized voting in the region would make it unconstitutional to draw lines with the chief goal of helping Black voters elect their favored candidates.","summary":"The state Senate voted Monday along party lines for new boundaries for two eastern districts.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/20/election-2026-redistricting-north-carolina/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/North-Carolina-Redistricting_05890-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:39:10","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":371069562,"title":"US begins sending nuke workers home as shutdown drags","text":"The US maintained 5,177 nuclear warheads, with CNN reporting that the initial furloughs would hit assembly facilities.

The protest marked at least the second time \"No Kings\" rallies have been organized across the country in major cities, including Washington, New York City and Los Angeles, since Trump took office for the second time, and organizers claim the protests are in opposition to his authoritarian policies. Meanwhile, Trump pushed back on the description of \"king,\" as he and other Republicans poked fun at the millions participating in the rallies.

That’s all it is. I’m not a king at all.\" Trump also characterized the protests as inconsequential, and said that those who participated didn’t accurately reflect the people who make up the U.S. \"The demonstrations were very small, very ineffective and the people were whacked out,\" Trump said Sunday. \"When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country.\" Despite Trump’s rejection of being labeled a king, the official White House social media accounts previously posted an image in February of Trump wearing a crown with a caption claiming \"long live the king.\" Trump also reposted an AI-generated video that Vice President JD Vance originally shared, depicting Trump placing a crown on his head and drawing a sword. Additionally, Trump shared another AI-generated video of him donning a crown in a fighter jet over New York City, unloading what appeared to be feces on the protesters.

Chuck Schumer has — needs cover right now. He’s closed the government down because he needs political cover, and this was a part of it.\" However, Democrats said the protests were an opportunity to stand up for democracy. For example, Schumer said that there are \"no dictators\" in the U.S., and that \"we won’t allow Trump to keep eroding our democracy.\" \"Dictators evolve when good people of all different beliefs and backgrounds stay silent,\" Schumer said in a social media post on Saturday. \"This No Kings Day says we will not stay silent.\" Additionally, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi shared a video clip of her dismantling a plastic crown, appearing to harken back to when she ripped Trump’s State of the Union address in 2020. \"We’re gonna tear up the crown!\" Pelosi said in the brief clip, which she shared on social media with the caption: \"No crown. #NoKings!\" NATIONWIDE UNREST LOOMS AS ‘NO KINGS’ DEMONSTRATORS BEGIN TO GATHER IN MAJOR US CITIES Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also weighed in, claiming \"we said ‘hell no’ to kings, and reminded the nation and the world what patriotism looks like.\" \"From our nation's capitol to cities across California, millions stood shoulder to shoulder to say that our democracy is worth fighting for, that our voices will not be silent, and that we will not sit back and let a wannabe king take our freedoms,\" Schiff said Saturday to accompany several photos of himself at the protest in Washington. \"Proud to stand with you.\" Additionally, Sen.

That's nearly as many as in the entire Biden presidency — although still lower as a percentage of the total number of people detained.\n\nExperts say the massive increase in detentions under Trump has increased the risk of unsafe conditions at ICE detention centers, which have already faced allegations, including sexual abuse, medical neglect, and even forced sterilization, dating back long before 2025.\n\n\"Compared to the population that is traditionally seen in the immigration system, the level of trauma and psychological distress of those caught up in this new abduction machine will be much greater,” Jonathan White, a former U.S. Public Health Service Corps commander who worked with detainees during Trump’s first term and is now running for Congress as a Democrat, told Politico.\n\n\"These people are proportionally much more likely to have the most severe psychological reaction to being removed, because they have many years in this country, roots in their communities, and U.S. national children who they’re being separated from.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has previously denied accusations of medical neglect.\n\n“Any claim there are 'inhumane' conditions at ICE detention centers are false,\" she said last month. \"All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. \n\n\"It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.\"\n\nNearly 60,000 people were being detained by ICE or its sister agency CBP as of September 21, according to the detention tracking service TRAC. That same month, Trump's border czar Tom Homan told reporters the system was \"almost at capacity\".\n\nMany of those people have been held at impromptu detention complexes such as Texas's Fort Bliss or Florida's notorious 'Alligator Alcatraz', both of which have been accused of inhumane conditions.\n\nAt the latter, detainees are kept packed together in metal cages inside gigantic heavy-duty tents in the midst of the sweltering Everglades swamp. Detainees and their families have reported worm-infested food, routine medical neglect, unreliable air conditioning, and inadequate toilets that overflow and cover the floor with feces.\n\nDetention centers in multiple states have sometimes refused to allow unannounced inspections by members of Congress and their staffers, which Democrats contend is illegal under federal law. \n\nIn some cases, legislators or local officials have even been arrested while trying to inspect detention centers or monitor immigration courts.\n\nLast month, Trump also laid off hundreds of federal workers responsible for overseeing detention conditions. \"More people are going to die in custody as a result, because there are not going to be the same level of checks and balances internally,\" one former worker told NPR.","summary":"The agency is seeking doctors, nurses, and pharmacists as unprecedented numbers of people swept up in Donald Trump’s ‘mass deportation’ drive","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-detention-medical-care-conditions-b2848886.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/07/22/45/US-POLITICS-JUSTICE-IMMIGRATION-PRISON-02rbsi83.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cADtgsd2-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:31:47","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":371069112,"title":"Trump's immigration crackdown is setting deadly records","text":"Since taking office, President Donald Trump has put up some truly big numbers, increasing the number of immigrant detainees from 39,000 to 60,000.

Well, according to the Department of Homeland Security, they need a whopping 40 new health care professionals, total. That includes doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists and administrators, so … eight of each? \n\nThat seems like a downright paltry amount, one that won’t fix the fact that almost as many detainees have died in custody since Trump took office in January as those who died during the entirety of President Joe Biden’s term. \n\nThe administration’s official numbers show that 20 people have died while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody this year. Under Biden, there were 24 deaths total. Trump is managing to put up numbers that are even worse than deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nRelated | Florida Democrats file lawsuit for being denied entrance to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’\n\nThis isn’t surprising when the administration is putting people in places like Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily-constructed tent city where detainees went days without showering and toilets didn’t flush. Or the Massachusetts ICE office that packed 35 men into one room with one toilet. Or the notorious Krome Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where detainees were only given a glass of water and a cup of rice per day. Multiple facilities have detainees with tuberculosis. \n\nTwenty deaths in custody is the official number—but we know that may bear no relation whatsoever to actual numbers, because the administration is making a comprehensive effort to hide ICE’s actions. The agency’s online database tracking where detainees are located is a mess, at times so much so that attorneys can’t even find their clients. \n\nThe administration has also restricted congressional oversight of the facilities, which is super against the law, but no one is stopping them as they continue to block elected officials from visiting the Broadview detention center in Illinois. \n\nmeanwhile, at least one-quarter of detention facilities are above their contractual capacity.\n\nThese are just the official detention centers, of course, as ICE is also holding people at hotels, military bases, and short-term holding centers that have been magically repurposed as regular detention centers.\n\nDHS also shut down its oversight office back in March, kicking over 500 civil rights complaints to the curb and making it impossible to file anything new. They were later ordered by a court to restore that office, but after doing so, the administration laid off hundreds of staffers anyway.\n\nSo let’s not pretend that the hiring of a paltry 40 more people is genuinely intended to address concerns about detainees dying in custody. After all, the administration’s platonic ideal of a prison is CECOT, El Salvador’s notoriously brutal Terrorism Confinement Center. \n\nRelated | Democrats rip Trump over scheme to hide ICE operations from the public\n\nAfter deporting hundreds of immigrants there in violation of a court order, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem went to CECOT to do some content creation, which is a totally cool and normal thing to do at a prison, right? Especially one that crams 156 inmates into a cell with only two toilets where lights blaze 24 hours a day. Unless you’re in solitary confinement, and then it’s pitch black. Hundreds of people have died in Salvadoran prisons and are routinely denied food and medicine. \n\nThat’s what the Trump administration wants. That’s what it is trying to achieve. They want mass incarceration and they want it cheap and they want it brutal, so they don’t really care at all if people die.","summary":"Since taking office, President Donald Trump has put up some truly big numbers, increasing the number of immigrant detainees from 39,000 to 60,000.

BART is a vital part of the Bay Area; it reduces traffic, lowers emissions, and connects people to work and school. However, the BART system is flawed with many concerns about safety, cleanliness and delays.\n\nMany stations are poorly maintained, leaving people feeling uneasy with the lack of security and cleanliness. This discourages people from using public transportation, pushing them back toward driving, worsening traffic.\n\nDelays also create major issues for commuters and can often cause them to be late while on their way to work. While many delays are caused by the weather, plenty of delays are caused by BART’s computer system.\n\nImproving security, updating equipment and ensuring more consistent service would restore the public’s trust in BART, a system the Bay Area depends on.\n\nMaddux Ligon\n\nYes on Prop. 50 will\nbreak GOP stranglehold\n\nMy opinion is that having Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans in charge is a very, very bad thing for our country and our world.\n\nIf you agree with me on that, then I hope you will also agree with me on this: Vote for Proposition 50. Support it with your work, dollars, yard signs, etc.\n\nMost of us agree that gerrymandering is a bad idea in general. MAGA Republicans are pushing gerrymandering to its limits in the red states to maintain their control — effectively rigging elections against the majority — so unfortunately, we need to gerrymander California as well. If we lose this election, we will have virtually no chance of winning back the House.\n\nIt’s a temporary measure; it will expire in 2030.\n\nPlease ignore all the slick marketing materials coming from the MAGA crowd, and make sure you vote yes on Proposition 50.\n\nSticking it to Trump\nis no way to legislate\n\nI’m guessing Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50 will pass without Tom Steyer’s embarrassing “Stick It To Trump” TV ads.\n\nHowever, it does lead me to ask the leaders of the Democratic Party how sticking it to Donald Trump will make California a more affordable place to raise a family and run a business. How will sticking it to Trump reduce our state taxes, keep companies from leaving, including insurance companies and health care providers? How does sticking it to Trump make our streets safer, ensure only citizens vote and receive the benefits only citizens deserve? How does sticking it to Trump make California streets safer and improve school scores?\n\nThe Democratic Party’s solution is to always blame the other team for their failures while sticking it to us taxpayers to pay the bill. Maybe next year we start telling our career politicians where to stick it and vote them out of office.\n\nNo legal obligation\nfor CSU to give names\n\nRe: “Faculty file suit against leaders” (Page A1, Oct. 17).\n\nThe article quotes someone in the CSU administration saying that they are obligated to follow federal law as the excuse for handing over the phone numbers and email addresses for all of their faculty to President Donald Trump.\n\nThere is no federal law that requires submitting such information.

While more than a dozen communities reported damage from the remnants of Halong earlier this month, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were devastated by storm surge and water levels that reached record highs. \n\nHomes were swept away, some with people inside. Winds in the region shook and tossed buildings like toys. First responders recounted rescuing people from rooftops. One person died, and two remain missing. \n\nInitial estimates suggest 90% of buildings were destroyed in Kipnuk, with the fresh water supply seemingly contaminated by fuel and sewage, according to a report released Monday by Alaska’s emergency management division. About 35% of buildings in Kwigillingok were destroyed, the report states.\n\n An Alaska Native organization seeks additional action \n\nThe Alaska Federation of Natives passed a resolution during its annual convention that ended Saturday in support of expansive, urgent and ongoing help for the region. \n\nThe group is the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, and its meeting in Anchorage coincided with the temporary relocation last week of hundreds of people to shelters in the city, which is Alaska's largest and about 500 miles (804.7 kilometers) from some of the tiny villages where residents rely heavily on hunting and fishing as part of their culture.\n\nThe resolution, among other things, urges the state and federal governments “to make sustained investments in permanent Alaska Arctic infrastructure and protective measures” and to strengthen ties with tribes “to ensure a consistent federal presence and equitable access to resources for remote communities across the Bering Sea and Arctic regions.”\n\nFunds for community resilience or aimed at mitigating disaster risks have been called into question by President Donald Trump's administration, with efforts to cancel them being challenged in court. Alaska's U.S. senators, Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, have said they would make the case for the importance of such funds in Alaska, where numerous rural communities face threats from coastal erosion and thawing permafrost that require significant infrastructure updates — and in some cases, relocation. \n\nThe Alaska Federation of Natives' resolution also urged the federal government to establish a regional response hub in the southwest Alaska community of Bethel and to provide funds for village public safety officers to aid in response efforts. And it asks governments at all levels to discourage “any barriers that would inhibit hunting and fishing practices” to replenish fish, moose meat and other subsistence and traditional foods that Native people lost in the storm. \n\nThe remoteness of the region requires goods to be shipped in by barge or brought in by air. Hunting and fishing helps supplement food available at local groceries that can be limited and often expensive.\n\n Anchorage welcoming displaced students \n\nMore than 25 students had been registered with the Anchorage School District and were expected to begin classes as early as Monday, according to the state report.

Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWho Is Funding The Ballroom?\n\nTrump, who hosted a dinner for the ballroom’s donors last week, will help fund the construction of the ballroom, using at least $22 million in settlement money gained from his recent censorship lawsuit against YouTube. Donors at the dinner included billionaires like Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and oil executive Harold G. Hamm, according to The New York Times, which cited a guest list provided by a White House official that also included large companies like Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, HP, Meta, Microsoft, Palantir and T-Mobile.\n\nKey Background\n\nRenderings of the ballroom were released in July and showed coffered ceilings, chandeliers and floor-to-ceiling arched windows within the large structure. The building will be separate from the White House but its \"theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,” the White House has said. It is not clear when construction will be completed on the ballroom, as the White House has only noted it will be constructed “long before the end of President Trump’s term.” The White House has traditionally hosted larger events on the South Lawn, which would at times be outfitted with tents that featured flooring and lighting. Several state dinners hosted during the Obama and Biden administrations were held in tents, something Trump has taken issue with during both of his terms.\n\nTrump last week announced his administration plans to build an apparently massive triumphal arch in Arlington, Virginia, similar in style to Paris’ Arc de Triomphe. Details of the project, including the cost and a construction timeline, have not been released, but a rendering of the arch shared by the president suggests it will be taller than the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump’s $200 Million Ballroom Addition Is Larger Than The Existing White House: What We Know (With Photos) (Forbes)\n\nYouTube Settles Trump Lawsuit—With $22 Million Going Toward White House Ballroom (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Cell phone and surveillance videos captured the Oct. 3 incident outside the Rico Fresh grocery store, steps from the school, and neighbors were furious that the clash unfolded in front of kids. “I can’t believe this is the United States of America,” said volunteer Tania Kadakia, who rushed to the school to help families navigate the chaos.\n\nFirst-grade teacher Maria Heavener described Funston as a sanctuary, then watched that promise dissolve in a cloud of chemical irritant. “A 6-year-old should not have to know what a tear gas canister is,” she told reporters, adding that her students were “scared and worried” after seeing agents deploy gas across from their playground. The school moved recess indoors, and volunteers formed a ring at dismissal to make sure children could get home safely.\n\nCBS reported that after an agent tossed the canister from an SUV, the officers drove off, leaving residents coughing in the street. The principal told parents that operations on campus continued safely but acknowledged the shock. City officials, including Mayor Brandon Johnson, condemned the tactics near school grounds.\n\nThe episode collided with a broader political fight over federal force in Democratic-led cities. President Donald Trump has framed Chicago as an urban war zone and is in court seeking authority to deploy National Guard troops, even as public data undercuts the narrative of spiraling violence. A WBEZ analysis found Chicago had its fewest summer homicides in 60 years, and overall violent crime remains near a four-decade low.\n\nThe price tag for Trump’s proposed show of force is staggering. Independent budget analysts estimate a National Guard deployment could cost about $1.6 million per day depending on troop levels, a figure that dwarfs the city’s struggling school budgets. Meanwhile, Trump’s July spending bill funneled nearly $30 billion to ICE, almost three times the $10 billion budget for the entire Chicago Public Schools system.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon leadership have leaned into martial rhetoric. At a September address to senior military officials, Trump urged using U.S. cities as “training grounds” to confront what he called an “enemy from within,” while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth talked about unleashing “overwhelming and punishing violence on the enemy.” The comments drew swift condemnation from state leaders and civil rights groups, who warned that normalizing combat-style language for domestic operations invites excess and error — exactly what parents saw outside Funston.\n\nWhat happened on Oct. 3 is now part of a grim pattern. In the same week, local outlets documented the forcible detention of U.S. citizens during immigration operations, including minors, stoking accusations that federal agencies are spinning or downplaying what the videos show. The Department of Homeland Security has defended its officers, while lawmakers have demanded full transparency and body camera footage.\n\nInside Heavener’s classroom, the fallout is immediate and intimate. Younger children are learning new vocabulary they should never need, and older ones are asking if their families will still be there at pickup. Teachers say they are improvising trauma care while counting inhalers and planning indoor days.","summary":"A tear gas canister lands near an elementary school, and Chicago families get a front-row seat.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/teachers-panic-as-ice-fires-tear-gas-outside-chicago-elementary-school","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2025-10-16T170331.868.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:23:57","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":371070938,"title":"University of Arizona declines to sign onto Trump administration 'compact' - Reuters","text":"NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The University of Arizona on Monday cited academic freedom as it became the seventh elite college to decline to sign onto a Trump administration proposal that offered nine of them preferential consideration for federal funding in exchange for agreeing to a set of policies.\n\nVanderbilt University and the University of Texas at Austin have yet to announce whether they will sign the proposal, for which the administration gave a Monday deadline.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe proposal has been rejected by Brown University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Southern California, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Virginia, and Dartmouth College.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, his White House has targeted what it deems liberal-leaning institutions in various fields and tried to withhold funding from colleges and universities over issues such as pro-Palestinian protests against U.S. ally Israel's war in Gaza, transgender policies, climate initiatives and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe administration has canceled federal contracts worth millions of dollars with numerous schools to pressure them to drastically change their admissions and hiring policies, among other issues.

And today's agreement on critical minerals and rare earths is just taking it to the next level, seizing those opportunities which are before us, to take our relationship to that next level,” Albanese said.The White House says the governments will invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects. The framework calls for countries to provide at least $1 billion in financing projects within six months, which Australia noted investments will go towards an $8.5 billion pipeline in priority critical mineral projects.According to the White House it will “unleash the potential of our abundant natural resources—a model for supply-chain cooperation globally.”“We've been working on that for quite a while. In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them. They'll be worth about $2” Trump said of the deal.According to the Prime Minister’s office, projects include a gallium recovery project in Western Australia with investment from the United States, that it says will provide up to 10 percent of the global gallium supply.RELATED STORY | China warns of ‘resolute measures’ if US pushes ahead with 100% tariffAs the countries focus on defense cooperation, the White House announced Australia will buy more than $1 billion in unmanned underwater vehicles and that the countries would work to develop a technology deal.Trump also appeared to offer support for a multi-billion-dollar trilateral security partnership between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., dubbed ‘AUKUS,’ finalized under the Biden administration.“It was made a while ago, and nobody did anything about it, and it was going too slowly. We do actually have a lot of submarines. We have the best submarines in the world, anywhere in the world, and we're building a few more, currently under construction, and now we're starting we have it all set with Anthony. We've worked on this long and hard, and we're starting that process right now. And I think it's really moving along very rapidly, very well” Trump said while speaking about the trilateral partnership.The initiative has been under review in the Trump administration, “ensuring that this initiative of the previous Administration is aligned with the President’s America First agenda,” a defense official stated in June. An official noted it is “still under review.”The deal allows the provision of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia and for the countries to partner on developing technology including quantum technology, artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles, electric warfare and advanced cybersecurity.“Australia is a very important ally of ours in the Indo Pacific since World War One, and they've always been side by side. The facility that they're building Southwest is critical from very important to our ability to project power in the Indo Pacific, and work with our allies. So we're working very closely. I think what we're really trying to do is take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for all three parties, and make it better and clarify so that the ambiguity that was in the prior agreement. So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Secretary of the U.S. Navy John Phelan said.Discussions about the agreement come as both nations are looking to counter China in the Indo-Pacific region. While President Trump agreed that he sees AUKUS as a deterrent, he said “I don't think we're going to need it. I think we'll be just fine with China.”Trump has threatened an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese goods if the US and China do not reach a trade deal by November 1st, following China’s steps to restrict critical mineral exports. He indicated he still plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jingping.“I'm meeting with President Xi, we have a very good relationship. We're going to be meeting in South Korea in a couple of weeks, and we'll see what we can do. We have a very good relationship with China, but, you know, it's been, it's been probably a little bit like your relationship with China. They try and take advantage,” Trump said.The U.S. currently levies a 10% baseline tariff against Australian imports, as well as additional tariffs on steel, aluminum, trucks, furniture and other goods.“We're the hottest country anywhere in the world. We're dead. A year and a half ago, we were a dead country. Now we're the hottest country in the world economically and otherwise so. But I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs,” Trump said when pressed on the trade relationship between the allies.The visit marked Albanese’s first visit to the White House during Trump’s second term in office.","summary":"President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House Monday to increase access to critical rare earth minerals.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/us-and-australia-ink-rare-earth-mineral-agreement","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3660a95/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F82%2F6598a3b9408eaeead6a6c5b0fb76%2Fap25293750021015.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:18:50","author":"Haley Bull,Jacob Gardenswartz,Miguel Pineda","authors":["Haley Bull","Jacob Gardenswartz","Miguel Pineda"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.264},{"id":371070500,"title":"Jeffries hints at imminent decision on Mamdani endorsement after dodging questions for weeks","text":"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to imminently weigh in on the New York City mayoral race after dodging the question for weeks. The top House Democrat, who represents part of Brooklyn, has faced scrutiny in the press for repeatedly side-stepping reporters when asked whether he will endorse fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, for mayor. Asked during his Monday press conference whether he will make his thoughts on the race clear before early voting begins in New York City on Saturday, Oct. 25, Jeffries said, \"Yes, that's my intention.\" It could mean Jeffries endorses Mamdani before Election Day rolls around — or he could sidestep backing anyone in the race altogether. TRUMP WANTS ‘2 PEOPLE TO DROP OUT’ TO SET UP A ‘1-ON-1’ MAYORAL RACE WITH MAMDANI IN NYC The remark was similar to comments he gave Fox News Digital on Friday, the day after the mayoral debate. Jeffries said then, however, that he had not yet watched the debate at that point. \"I do expect to speak to the Democratic nominee, Zohran, at some point before early voting,\" he added when asked how long he was waiting to endorse. He also dodged the question of why he has not yet endorsed Mamdani during an appearance on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"As I've indicated, I expect to have a conversation with him at some point this week in advance of early voting, which begins next weekend in New York City. And we'll certainly have more to say about the mayors' race and about our Democratic nominee prior to early voting beginning,\" Jeffries said instead. BILL ACKMAN JUMPS INTO NYC MAYORAL FIGHT, SAYS SLIWA MUST DROP OR ‘WE ARE TOAST' Mamdani is currently the presumed frontrunner in the race against Republican Curtis Sliwa and Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, the former governor of New York. Jeffries' counterpart in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has repeatedly denounced Mamdani as a \"Marxist.\" And Mamdani's candidacy has caused somewhat of a rift between Democrats in Washington. He's been endorsed by progressive stars within the Democratic Party like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but both Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have been silent. Reps. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., moderates representing the suburbs outside of New York City, have denounced Mamdani's candidacy. Jeffries appears to have been deliberately unclear about his moves, but Republicans have accused him and Schumer of prolonging the current government shutdown over fear of a progressive revolt led by New York Democrats like Mamdani. Jeffries made his brief remarks on Monday during a press conference on day 20 of the shutdown, with Republicans and Democrats appearing no closer to an agreement on a path forward. At another point in the press conference, Jeffries demanded that President Donald Trump take a more active role in negotiations on ending the shutdown. \"Donald Trump definitively needs to get involved. He needs to get off the sidelines, get off the golf course and actually decide to end the shutdown that he's created, that he has allowed to happen,\" Jeffries said. \"We know that House and Senate Republicans don't do anything without getting permission from their boss, Donald J. Trump, and the reason why there have been no negotiations, zero negotiations, since Republicans shut the government.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Republican leaders in Congress have repeatedly insisted that they have nothing to negotiate after offering a straightforward, seven-week extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels. The measure, called a continuing resolution (CR), is aimed at giving congressional appropriators more time to strike a longer-term deal on FY2026 funding. The House passed the bill on Sept. 19. But in the Senate, where at least eight Democrats are needed to break a filibuster if all GOP lawmakers supported it, the bill has failed to advance twelve times. Democratic leaders are demanding any funding bill be paired with an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.","summary":"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he will weigh in on the New York City mayoral race, where Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani is running, before early voting begins Saturday.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jeffries-hints-imminent-decision-mamdani-endorsement-after-dodging-questions-weeks","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/jeffries-mamdani.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:16:51","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":371073802,"title":"Trump begins demolition of White House East Wing for $200 million ballroom construction","text":"ReutersOngoing construction on the East Wing of the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed ballroom is being built, in Washington, D.C., October 20, 2025.

We made a deal with Hamas that, they gonna be very good. They’re going to behave, they’re going to be nice, and if they’re not… we’re going to eradicate them if we have to. They’ll be eradicated — and they know that,” the US President said.He accused Hamas of past violence and suggested the group no longer enjoys significant external backing, particularly from Iran.“They went in and killed a lot of people. They’re violent people. Hamas has been very violent. But they don’t have the backing of Iran anymore. They don’t have the backing of really anybody anymore. They have to be good, and if they’re not good, they’ll be eradicated,” Trump added.The US President also stressed that Washington would not deploy troops for this purpose, stating that there would be ‘no involvement of US forces’.Trump’s remarks came during his meeting with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the Oval Office, where both leaders signed a multi-billion dollar agreement on critical minerals and defence cooperation.Earlier on Sunday, Israel stated that it has announced a “renewed enforcement” of the ceasefire agreement following a series of air strikes in Gaza, launched in retaliation for what it claims to be attacks on its forces by Hamas.Following this, top White House officials US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, as reported by the Times of Israel.Meanwhile, US Vice-President JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, are also set to visit the country on Tuesday.In a post on X on Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) stated, “In accordance with the directive of the political echelon, and following a series of significant strikes in response to Hamas’ violations, the IDF has begun the renewed enforcement of the ceasefire, in line with the terms of the agreement. The IDF will continue to uphold the ceasefire agreement and will respond firmly to any violation of it.”The IDF reported that it had carried out air strikes targeting dozens of Hamas-linked sites across Gaza. These included weapons storage facilities, firing positions, terrorist cells, and approximately 6 kilometres of underground tunnels allegedly used for planning attacks against Israel.The strikes follow an escalation by Hamas militants in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, as claimed by the IDF, where the defence forces claim that an anti-tank missile and gunfire were directed at IDF troops operating to dismantle terror infrastructure, in accordance with the ceasefire terms.Till Sunday, the Gaza Media Office reported that 97 people have been killed and 230 others injured since the ceasefire came into effect on October 10.In a statement posted on Telegram, the office accused the Israeli military of carrying out 80 violations since October 10, calling them “blatant and clear breaches” of the ceasefire agreement and international humanitarian law.According to Al Jazeera, citing hospital sources in Gaza, at least 42 Palestinians were killed by Israeli military fire in multiple areas across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, marking one of the deadliest days since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect.

(RELATED: KJP Reveals How She Learned Biden Was Dropping Out Of The Race)\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t know,” Axelrod said. “I mean, you know, people have said different things and, you know, the public witnessed what it witnessed.”\n\n“But even if, even if, he, even if he [Biden] was functioning in an impeccable way, then if you want to accept that, the idea that we knew how he was going to be when he was 83 and 84 and 85 and 86, I think is farfetched,” Axelrod added. “And that was what was irresponsible.”\n\nFollowing Biden’s disastrous debate against President Donald Trump in June 2024, White House logs reviewed by the New York Post reportedly showed a top Washington, D.C. neurologist had met with former White House physician Kevin O’Connor earlier that year. During the debate, Biden could be seen struggling to finish his arguments and freezing mid-sentence at one point.\n\nCalls for the former president to withdraw from the race quickly came from Democrats and media pundits who had once urged him to run. By July 21, 2024, Biden announced he would step down from the race and instead endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nFor years, Democrats downplayed Biden’s mental decline, with lawmakers calling him “sharp” and aides dismissing videos of him stumbling or misspeaking as “cheap fakes.” Republicans had long warned about signs of Biden’s fading mental acuity prior to his 2020 campaign, but many Democrats continued to defend him until the debate.\n\nNow, with Republicans investigating Biden’s mental fitness during his time in office, both O’Connor and former Jill Biden chief of staff Anthony Bernal have pleaded the Fifth before lawmakers, refusing to answer questions about their time in the White House and the former president’s cognitive health.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Airports in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix, Seattle and some others have also refused to play the video, citing company policies that prohibit content with political messaging.\n\n“In Long Beach, we come together and we don’t play that,” Mayor Rex Richardson said in a video statement on Wednesday, Oct. 15. “While Washington shuts down, we’re stepping up, keeping our services running, protecting our residents and supporting our workers. What we need from our federal government right now is cooperation, not division.”\n\nIn the video, Noem says that it is TSA’s “top priority” to make travel pleasant and efficient while keeping passengers safe.\n\n“However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,” Noem says in the video. “We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”\n\nNoem is the Homeland Security department chief for President Donald Trump, whose Republican Party also controls the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, though without enough members in the upper chamber to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to pass a budget bill. Democratic Party leadership has said they won’t support the bill unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at year’s end. Some medical insurance premiums would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31, leaders have said.\n\nSince the shutdown began on Oct. 1, John Wayne Airport leaders have said they don’t “anticipate noticeable disruptions for our traveling guests.”\n\n“John Wayne Airport is closely monitoring the federal government shutdown and its potential impacts on airport operations,” officials said. “While staffing levels and resources are determined at the federal level, we remain in close communication with our federal partners to support their efforts and mitigate any potential impacts to travelers at John Wayne Airport.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"The Orange County airport said it's reviewing a verbal request to play a video featuring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/20/john-wayne-airport-reviewing-dhs-request-to-play-video-on-shutdown-impact/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-Kristi-Noem-13.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:11:08","author":"Christina Merino,Claire Wang","authors":["Christina Merino","Claire Wang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":371069302,"title":"Obama ridiculed over latest comments about his 'eyesore' presidential library as first pics show inside hulking monolith","text":"Barack Obama is facing backlash for his $850 million presidential library in Chicago that will feature a basketball court, large art installations and a museum.\n\nScheduled to open in 2026, the Obama Presidential Center consists of several buildings sprawled across a 19.3 acre campus within Chicago's historic Jackson Park.\n\nThe main sites at the center include a towering grey monolith-like museum building, the forum auditorium, a branch of the Chicago public library, a garden pavilion and the home court - an NBA-size basketball court.\n\nObama recently told The New York Times, he wanted the center to be 'a living, breathing, dynamic cultural and gathering space.'\n\n'I'm not interested in a mausoleum, and I'm not really that interested in just, you know, a celebration of my presidency,' he said.\n\n'I'm more interested in, how can we use this space to activate people and get them to feel inspired about making a difference in their own communities? \n\nHowever, some social media users mocked Obama for the center's design and called him out for building on a park.\n\n'They say it’s \"a new home for hope.\" Yet it’s built over a park that locals used to call home. Costs doubled. Promises faded. The community left out. Funny how every \"living, breathing\" project starts by taking someone else’s air,' one person said.\n\n'A \"living, breathing, dynamic cultural\" cement outhouse on steroids? Ugly design,' said another.\n\nOthers were excited about the building and getting a sneak peak at the interior of the massive project. \n\n'Sounds like a cool place for some top-tier speeches and maybe a few dad jokes. Can't wait to see how it turns out,' one person said.\n\n'That's amazing! The Obama Presidential Center sounds like it's going to be a truly inspiring space. I love the idea of it being dynamic and welcoming to all. Can't wait to see how it contributes to the community and beyond,' a second person said. \n\nThe eight-story museum is made of granite and stands at 225 feet tall, featuring four floors of exhibits from the Obama presidency and a Sky Room observation deck.\n\nLarge art installations will line the interior of the tower, including a including an 83-foot-tall abstract glass work collage inspired by African and American history and art history created by Julie Mehretu. \n\nThe exterior of the museum building will feature words taken from President Obama’s speech marking the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the building's form was inspired by the idea of four hands joining together, reaching skyward.\n\nThe forum building is a long, low space with a 299-seat auditorium, two studios for visitors to record music and podcasts, classrooms, a cafe and the foundation's offices.\n\nAt the end of plaza is a branch of the Chicago Public Library, which will have a fruit and vegetable garden.\n\nInternet users likened the looming, concrete and granite building to something seen in the Star Wars cinematic universe and a cartoon lair after the former president shared footage of its construction online.\n\nAn X thread making fun of the building's unusual façade was started by none other than Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\n'Locating the Death Star to Chicago was a bold move,' he joked, referring to Darth Vader's space lair.\n\nOthers agreed, saying, 'This concrete eyesore, $200 million over budget and years late, screams mismanagement—just like his presidency.'\n\nWhile many people agreed they did not like the center's aesthetics, they still expressed their support for the former president.\n\n'Much better than a ballroom!' one person said, referencing Donald Trump's ballroom renovations to the White House.\n\n'Now, that is a Special President and wife. Giving back...love them,' said another. 'This is one place I'm determined to go to. I can't wait,' added a third.","summary":"Barack Obama is facing backlash for his $850 million presidential library in Chicago that will feature a basketball court, large art installations and a museum.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15209147/barack-obama-presidential-library-interior-eyesore.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/20/21/103154289-0-image-m-16_1760990499209.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-20 23:09:22","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.419}]}
