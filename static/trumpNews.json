Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner huddled into the early hours with Putin in the Kremlin but reached no breakthrough on halting Europe's worst conflict since World War II. The Kremlin said afterward it found parts of the US plan to end the war unacceptable, even though the proposal includes Ukraine ceding parts of the eastern Donbas region it still holds nearly four years after Russia's invasion. \"I can tell you that they had a reasonably good meeting with President Putin,\" Trump said when an AFP reporter asked him about the talks, adding afterwards that the talks were \"very good.\" Trump said it was too soon to tell what would happen \"because it does take two to tango.\" Pressed on whether Witkoff and Kushner got any sense that Putin genuinely wanted to halt Russia's nearly four-year-old invasion, Trump replied: \"He would like to end the war. That was their impression.\" Trump added that Ukraine \"pretty well\" backed the US proposal, although he added that Kyiv should have done so earlier when he had a notoriously heated meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval office in February. Witkoff and Kushner were now due to meet top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Florida on Thursday, two US officials told AFP, to follow up on the Kremlin talks. 'Successes of the Russian army' But while the White House had voiced optimism ahead of the Kremlin talks, Moscow said that the two sides had failed to reach a compromise and that more work was needed. The Kremlin added Wednesday that its army's recent battlefield successes in Ukraine had bolstered its position and that Kyiv's ties to NATO remained a key question. Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine gathered pace last month and Putin has said in recent days that Moscow is ready to fight on to seize the rest of the land it claims if Kyiv does not surrender it. \"The progress and nature of the negotiations were influenced by the successes of the Russian army on the battlefield in recent weeks,\" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who took part in the US-Russia talks, told reporters, including AFP. Moscow insisted it was incorrect to say Putin rejected the plan in its entirety. It also said Russia was still committed to diplomacy, despite Putin's stark warning earlier this week that Moscow was prepared to fight Europe if it wanted war. \"We are still ready to meet as many times as is needed to reach a peace settlement,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 'Opportunity to end the war' In Kyiv, Zelensky said that though a window of opportunity for peace has opened, it must be accompanied by pressure on Moscow. \"The world now clearly feels that there is an opportunity to end the war, and the current activity in negotiations must be supported by pressure on Russia,\" he said in a regular evening address. The fresh talks come as NATO pledges to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of US arms for Kyiv. NATO chief Mark Rutte said it was positive that peace talks were ongoing, but that the alliance should make sure that \"Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to keep the fight going\". Russian troops have been grinding forward across the front line against outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian forces. Earlier this week, Moscow claimed to have captured the important stronghold of Pokrovsk, but a Ukrainian army unit fighting in the city said urban combat was still ongoing. European countries have expressed fears Washington and Moscow will reach agreements without them and have spent the last weeks trying to amend the US plan so that it does not force Kyiv to capitulate.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-says-putin-wants-to-end-ukraine-war-despite-inconclusive-talks-in-moscow-1921509","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/12/04/1985875-aa-6044640.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 01:16:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":384795882,"title":"'No problem': Trump backs release of alleged drug boat strike footage; repeats warning of land strikes in Venezuela","text":"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would support the release of any footage of the multiple strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat from September 2, while backing the “decision to knock out the boats.” The Trump administration and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth in particular have been under scrutiny in recent days after The Washington Post reported that the US military carried out a subsequent strike on a boat in the Caribbean despite there apparently being survivors. CBS News has not independently confirmed the existence of survivors, but the White House has confirmed the boat was struck more than once on September 2. “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’ll certainly release, no problem,” the president said of any strike footage. A reporter asked the president in the Oval Office if Hegseth, Adm. Frank Bradley or others should be punished if survivors were indeed clinging to the boat. The administration has suggested that Bradley, the commander of the operation, gave the order for the second strike and was within his rights to do so. The president responded, “I think you’re going to find that this is war,” saying drugs smuggled into the United States have killed millions. “I think you’re going to find that there’s a very receptive ear to doing exactly what they’re doing, taking out those boats,” Trump added. When pressed again on whether he supported a decision to kill survivors, the president said, “No, I support the decision to knock out the boats.” On Sunday, the president told reporters on Air Force One that he “wouldn’t have wanted” a second strike on the boat. Since then, the administration has defended Hegseth and his leadership. The president on Wednesday also repeated an earlier threat that land strikes in Venezuela could begin soon as tensions with President Nicolás Maduro run high. “Very soon, we’re going to start doing it on land, too,” he said. “You know, the land is much easier … And we know the routes they take. We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we’re going to start that very soon, too.” Trump has hinted for months that he may broaden his administration’s sea-based strikes to include accused drug targets on land, telling reporters in October that he is “totally prepared” to carry out land strikes. If the president orders strikes on targets within Latin American countries, it would significantly expand the Trump administration’s anti-drug trafficking operations, which have hit upward of 20 alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people. The boat strikes are already controversial. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have argued Trump is acting without legal authority and hasn’t provided enough evidence that the boats are carrying drugs. The administration has said the US is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist groups.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-problem-trump-backs-release-of-alleged-drug-boat-strike-footage-repeats-warning-of-land-strikes-in-venezuela/articleshow/125755685.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125755683/125755683.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 01:08:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":384795966,"title":"Trump is fighting the Institute of Peace in court.

Several nations have conducted trade with the US for decades. They have voiced their concerns regarding tariffs being imposed on them too as evident in the case of India. As experts have begun to warn that Americas increased tariffs could possibly cause a large ripple effect through the global economy the issue of tariffs has quickly developed into one of the most contentious subjects in the field of economics and international trade.\nWhat is the India–US significant defence deal all about?\nIn recent months India-US relations have taken a turn for the worse. Recently US President Donald Trump imposed whopping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods including 25 per cent levies for India’s purchase of Russian crude oil. Lately Trump has been praising Pakistans top leaders as “good leaders good guys.” It is to be noted that India and Pakistan were engaged in a war which later resulted in Operation Sindoor. Despite these escalating tensions Trump has signed a significant deal with India. What is this deal all about? Check details here.\nIt seems India and the US relations are going to improve as the United States announced a significant step in defence cooperation with India after New Delhi signed a sustainment package for the Indian Navys MH-60R Seahawk helicopter fleet. According to the news agency ANI report Indias Ministry of Defence has approved a contract worth approximately Rs 7995 crore (about USD 946 million) to support 24 MH-60R helicopters produced by Lockheed Martin.\nSharing a post on X(previously Twitter) the US State Department said Great news in our defence relationship with India. Indias Ministry of Defence signed a sustainment package for its 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters developed by Lockheed Martin. This 946 million dollar package will enhance the Indian Navys maritime capabilities build interoperability with the U.S. and regional partners and make both our nations safer and more prosperous.\nThe Ministry of Defence has established a five-year agreement with the US in which the US will assist the Indian Navy in the design production and maintenance of 24 MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopter systems for its operations and readiness for future missions. Both nations signed the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for this agreement which will be valid for a period of 2025 to 2030.\nThe signing of the contract came amid some strain in ties between the two countries after US President Donald Trump slapped a whopping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods in late August.\nThe agreement that exists between the United States and India is an example of a Follow-On Support contract. Through this contract the United States will provide both spare parts and support equipment for the Seahawk helicopters as well as training for pilots and crew members and technical support.\nLockheed Martin produces the 24 MH-60R helicopters. The agreement aims to improve long-term operational readiness strengthen interoperability with US forces and enhance maritime security in the Indian Ocean region. These helicopters are capable of performing under all types of weather conditions. The United States provided India with these helicopters as part of the agreements which were entered into by both countries in 2020.\nWhich capabilities make the MH-60R one of the world’s deadliest naval helicopters?\nSpeaking about its features the MH-60R Seahawk is a multi-role maritime helicopter capable of anti-submarine warfare anti-surface missions search-and-rescue surveillance and ship-based operations. The sustainment package is expected to increase helicopter availability and reduce maintenance time enabling operations from coastal facilities and naval ships. It will also help India establish local maintenance infrastructure reduce reliance on foreign service providers and integrate helicopters more effectively into maritime operations. It is equipped with long-range sensors and compatible weapons the MH-60R enhances Indias ability to detect submarines protect sea lanes support carrier groups and respond to maritime threats.\nWhich technologies provided by the US will boost India’s anti-submarine warfare strength?\nIt was inducted into the Indian Navy in 2021 with deliveries beginning and the first squadron INAS 334 was commissioned at INS Garuda in Kochi.For surface missions the helicopter can carry AGM-114 Hellfire missiles lightweight torpedoes and machine guns supported by advanced radar and electro-optical systems to identify and engage hostile surface targets. Its anti-submarine warfare systems include dipping sonar sonobuoys multi-mode radar and the Mk-54 torpedo.Often called the Romeo the MH-60R Seahawk is used by the US Navy and partner nations worldwide serving as a versatile platform for surveillance search-and-rescue medical evacuation and warship-based missions.","summary":"The Ministry of Defence has established a five-year agreement with the US, in which the US will assist the Indian Navy in the design, production, and maintenance of 24 MH-60R Seahawk Romeo helicopter systems for its operations and readiness.","url":"https://www.india.com/news/world/rs-79950000000-amid-tariff-tussle-us-signs-major-sustainment-deal-with-india-to-support-24-deadly-mh-60r-seahawk-helicopters-produced-lockheed-martin-maritime-security-in-indian-ocean-to-get-enhanced-8213318/","image":"https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/title-2025-12-04T062826.627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 01:01:58","author":"Sumaila Zaman","authors":["Sumaila Zaman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.146},{"id":384792802,"title":"Maduro confirms Trump phone call was cordial as US pressure campaign intensifies","text":"Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro has confirmed he held a \"respectful and cordial\" phone conversation with US President Donald Trump roughly ten days ago, casting the exchange as a possible path toward fresh push to end tensions.Speaking during a televised event in Caracas, Maduro said the conversation lasted several minutes and centred on the potential for direct engagement between the two governments. He said that any move toward \"respectful dialogue\" would be welcomed by his administration.He made similar remarks in earlier interviews, insisting the tone of the exchange reflected \"respect and cordiality\" despite the fraught state of relations.

After He Was Accused of Having Sex with a Minor","text":"Former congressman Matt Gaetz turned heads – and stomachs – with a creepy comment about a bikini-clad Karoline Leavitt, RadarOnline.com can report. \n\nDonald Trump's original pick for Attorney General famously resigned from office amid allegations he once paid a 17-year-old girl for sex.Gaetz, who has stepped away from politics to take a role with the far-right network One America News, decided to weigh in on an online debate over an old, resurfaced photo of the press secretary at the beach in a revealing bikini. \n\nAn X account shared the pic of Leavitt, 28, with an unnamed friend posing on the beach, each in a two-piece swimsuit, with the caption: \"Is this photo suitable for someone serving as White House Press Secretary?\"\n\nGaetz, 43, reshared the post, answering with a declarative \"Yes\" and a \"100 emoji\". Under his response, the reaction was not approving.\"Calm down, Matt. She’s too old for you,\" one person blasted.\n\nAnother dredged up his past, commenting: \"Yes, from a man accused of paying for sex with underage girls. Now that's funny!\"\n\nWhile a third person wondered: \"On a scale of 1 to 100, how creepy is Matt Gaetz?\"Gaetz Faces ChargesLast year, a House Ethics Committee report on the former Florida Representative painted a picture of someone who seemed ready and willing to pay for sexual favors.\n\nRadar read the full report, which concluded there is substantial evidence that Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, and illicit drug use.\n\nAccording to the report, Gaetz was a client on the website \"SeekingArrangement.com,\" which advertised itself as a \"sugar dating\" website that \"primarily connected older men and younger women seeking 'mutually beneficial relationships.'\"\n\nIt added: \"The website was generally understood by many of the women interviewed by the Committee to involve, at minimum, an exchange of companionship for money.\"'Expectation of Sex'The report also detailed: \"Many of the women interviewed by the Committee were clear that there was a general expectation of sex.\n\n\"One woman who was paid more than $5,000 by Representative Gaetz between 2018 and 2019 told the Committee that '99 percent of the time that (Representative Gaetz and I) were hanging out, there was sex involved.'\"\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nIn one section of the report, text messages obtained by the committee reveal Gaetz’s then-girlfriend informed some of the women who were typically paid for sex that \"the guys wanted me to share that they are a little limited in their cash flow this weekend . . .

And every year, the music streaming app adds new features, like back in 2023, when it assigned people a Sound Town, meaning a city that supposedly matched their listening style. Spotify Wrapped was released on Wednesday, and the new features this year include a multiplayer game, Wrapped Party, and a listening age.\n\nMy actual age is 57. According to Spotify, my listening age is 79.\n\nSEVENTY-NINE.\n\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush are 79. Liza Minnelli is 79. Cher -- well, she's ageless, but technically, she's 79.\n\nLook, I'm no teenybopper, I get it. I'm a proud Atari Wave Gen Xer. So it's not like I was 18 and was then told I was listening to AARP tunes. But does Spotify realize how it sounds to be hit with a listening age that's 22 years older than I really am?\n\nWhat's my age again?\n\nI'm not the only one Spotify is aging up. My 18-year-old daughter was told she was 37, maybe because of her love of 1990s emo. Some people get aged down -- my colleague Corinne Reichert's 73-year-old mom was labeled 21. (\"She listens to a lot of K-pop,\" her daughter says.)\n\nSpotify pegged my colleague Jon Skillings as an octogenarian, with a listening age of 86, \"since you were into music from the late '50s.\" Blame that on his passion for jazz and a healthy dose of Miles Davis and Duke Ellington in his sonic excursions. At least Spotify had the good taste to play Count Basie's 1957 version of April in Paris when it delivered the news.\n\n\"I won't lie. That 86 did sting a little,\" Skillings says. \"I really thought I was mixing in a lot more tunes from this century.\"For the record, Spotify did flag a 2024 release from the contemporary jazz pianist Vijay Iyer as his top album. \"See?\" he says. \"I can keep up with the times.\"\n\nBut Skillings looks like a spring chicken next to CNET's Ty Pendlebury, who wrote our Spotify Wrapped article and revealed that Spotify bluntly told him he was 100.\n\nI may be old, but I got to see all the cool bands\n\nI know 79 isn't old to many people. I lost my sister Claudia last December at 78, and her ghost will haunt me forever if I get snippy about an age she never even got the chance to complain about. But there's something jolting about seeing an age that's 22 years older than you are, especially relating to music, where the industry is always riding on the back of some hot new young singer.\n\nDo I really care? Maybe I shouldn't. There's a T-shirt that says something like, \"I may be old, but I got to see all the cool bands.\" It's probably made for Baby Boomers, but as an Xer who saw Prince live in his hometown of Minneapolis in his best decade, the 1980s, I proudly identify with that remark. \n\nI've seen some oldsters in concert, yeah, can't deny it. A couple of years ago, I saw Steely Dan at an outdoor amphitheater near Seattle. (No static at all.) I saw folk legend Pete Seeger perform with Arlo Guthrie at the University of Minnesota one year. My mom, born in the 1920s, and my brother, a 1944-born baby, were with me, and we were all rapt. There were kids bouncing on their parents' laps at that show. Pete and Arlo's music knew no age. And as an 1980s concert-goer, I've seen bands like The Pet Shop Boys, REM, U2, Redd Kross, The Church and Pixies.\n\nBut as mom of a teenage daughter, I've also been flooded with more modern music, and I love it, too. Thanks to her, I've seen Panic! at the Disco, Alex G, Car Seat Headrest, Melanie Martinez and Slaughter Beach, Dog. And she isn't easy to categorize, either, either. She's in an emo groove these days, and saw My Chemical Romance kick off their Long Live The Black Parade tour, where they performed their 2006 album The Black Parade in its entirety.\n\nHow does Spotify determine your listening age?\n\nSpotify claims my listening age is 79, not because I sit around watching Lawrence Welk Show reruns, but because I \"was into music from the early '60s.\" \n\nI think my Spotify musical age has a lot to do with me watching the recent Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown and suddenly deciding Spotify was the perfect way to catch up on Dylan's music. I was just a little too early for his heyday, although I lived just off the famous Highway 61, where God said to Abraham, kill me a son. OK, so I saw the movie, and I mainlined me some Dylan. \n\nSo why not hand me a decade instead of an age? I was born in the '60s, so dubbing me a '60s baby would be just fine by me. (My birth year is 6-7, which should be a popular year with Gen Z and Alpha.) I grew into my musical tastes in Minneapolis in the 1980s, with Prince, The Replacements, Husker Du and The Suburbs, so call me an '80s child and I will put that sucker on a T-shirt and flaunt it. \n\nI've decided I'm going to wear my Spotify age proudly. Nobody should be shoved into a musical pigeonhole; there are great tunes from every decade, if you're open enough to listen, and an 80-year-old can listen to whoever they choose. I'm proud that my musical tastes aren't narrowly defined by my birth year, but instead, are open and vast. \n\nSo you'll excuse me if I look at Spotify calling me 79 and quote an iconic song from those Gen X gurus, Nirvana:\n\nOh well, whatever, never mind.","summary":"I may be old, in Spotify's opinion, but I got to see Prince live in Minneapolis in the 1980s, so I can live with that.","url":"https://www.cnet.com/culture/spotify-wrapped-says-i-have-the-music-taste-of-a-79-year-old-is-that-bad/","image":"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/934e08da33ac50f1a5096325c195e5465a3f5aae/hub/2025/12/03/bba237d6-6c80-47d8-bcb1-fd9780bf25d7/age-1.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:43:34","author":"Gael Cooper","authors":["Gael Cooper"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.185},{"id":384795956,"title":"A vocal Jeffrey Epstein accuser is urging judges to unseal his court records","text":"By MICHAEL R.

Pentagon faces allegations it approved 2nd Caribbean boat strike with full knowledge","text":"The Pentagon was aware that survivors remained in the water after a September US military strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel in the Caribbean Sea, yet a second strike was still authorised to sink the boat, according Associated Press report quoting two individuals familiar with the incident.What did the Pentagon know before the second strike?According tothe two people with direct knowledge of the operation, US officials understood there were individuals still alive after the initial 2 September strike. Nevertheless, a follow-on attack was launched to destroy the vessel.The Trump administration has maintained that all 11 people on board died in the first strike. What remains “unclear was who ordered the strikes and whether Secretary of War Pete Hegseth was involved,” one official was quoted by AP, adding that the chain of command is now a central focus of congressional oversight.The knowledge of survivors, and the rationale offered for proceeding regardless, “was not presented to lawmakers during a classified briefing in September.” It emerged only later and has been deemed “broadly unsatisfactory” by members of the national security committees.How has Pete Hegseth responded to allegations he saw survivors?US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth addressed the incident publicly on Tuesday, insisting he did not personally witness any survivors clinging to the wreckage between the two US strikes.“I did not personally see survivors,” he told reporters, explaining that “the thing was on fire. It exploded, there’s fire, there’s smoke.”“This is called the fog of war,” he added.He later defended the commander who authorised the second strike, Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, stating Bradley “made the right call” and “had complete authority to do” so. Hegseth also acknowledged he “didn’t stick around” for the remainder of the mission.Why is Congress investigating the incident?Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have launched investigations — a rare bipartisan move — as legal experts and lawmakers question whether the US acted lawfully.Critics argue that striking survivors in the water during peacetime operations could violate international humanitarian law and human rights conventions. The Trump administration has asserted that the United States is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, despite Congress never authorising military force in the region.Adm. Bradley, who the administration says ordered the second strike, is scheduled to brief the committees’ Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members behind closed doors on Thursday.What wider concerns does US boat strike in the Caribbean raise?The 2 September strike was the first in what the Trump administration describes as an expanding counter-narcotics campaign spanning the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The operation has now grown to more than 20 known strikes, resulting in over 80 deaths.A separate strike on 15 September has already triggered a formal human rights challenge. The family of Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian fisherman, has petitioned the Inter-American human rights system, arguing his death was an extrajudicial killing after the US military bombed his small fishing vessel.These combined incidents have heightened pressure on the Pentagon to clarify legal grounds, rules of engagement, and oversight mechanisms governing lethal operations far from conventional theatres of war.Will the video of the boat strike be released?Responding to questions on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he was open to releasing video footage of the follow-on strike, as multiple Democratic lawmakers have demanded.“I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release. No problem,” he told reporters.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/pentagon-knew-caribbean-boat-strike-left-survivors-but-still-ordered-second-attack-pete-hegseth-fog-of-war-11764807000589.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/04/1600x900/logo/US-VENEZUELA-CONFLICT-DIPLOMACY-0_1764807541452_1764807567377.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:37:09","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":384796444,"title":"Trump Goes On Another Xenophobic Rant Against Somali Immigrants","text":"President Donald Trump couldn’t help but add a scoop of racism to Wednesday’s Oval Office press conference, which was meant to be about the auto industry. \n\nA reporter asked Trump about recent comments by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said he’s proud to have the largest Somali community in the U.S. — a community Trump reportedly plans to target.\n\n“I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian― look at their nation,” Trump snapped before going on a hateful tirade. “Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. These Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. They have destroyed Minnesota.”\n\nTrump’s remarks later grew even more bizarre. “You have to have people come in that are going to love our country, cherish our country, they want to kiss our country goodnight,” he said, perplexingly. “They talk about our country, we want them to pray for our country. This is not the people living in Minnesota.”\n\nTrump has previously referred to Haiti and other countries with large Black and brown populations as “shithole” countries. During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump called Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) “garbage” while insulting her birthplace, Somalia.\n\n“Somalia, which is barely a country, they have no anything, they just run around killing each other,” said Trump, adding: “And when I see somebody like Ilhan Omar who, I don’t know at all, but I always watch her, for years I’ve watched her complain about our Constitution.” (Actually, Trump has previously griped that Omar is too committed to upholding the Constitution.)\n\nOmar acknowledged Trump’s “obsession” with her in a Tuesday social media post.\n\n“His obsession with me is creepy,” she wrote. “I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.”\n\nTrump has dialed up his attacks on immigrants from what he has disparagingly called “Third World Countries” since the shooting of two National Guard members in D.C. last week. On Thursday, he seized on the identity of the suspected perpetrator, an Afghan national, to go after immigrants from different countries, including Somalia.\n\n“Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,” Trump claimed in a Thursday Truth Social post. “Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.”\n\nIn addition to the repeated verbal attacks, the Trump administration is also reportedly targeting the Somali community as part of a surge in immigration enforcement this week. \n\nAccording to multiple media reports, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is descending on Minneapolis and St. Paul in an operation focused on apprehending undocumented Somali immigrants in the region.\n\nLocal leaders have denounced the Trump administration’s agenda and warned that immigration agents are poised to racially profile people regardless of their immigration status. \n\n“They’re not just targeting so-called undocumented immigrants. They target all Somalis. Somali citizens have been stopped on the street, asked to provide documentation,” Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman told CNN in a Wednesday interview. “Let me just educate people. Ninety-five percent of the Somali residents in Minnesota are U.S. citizens. ...So there’s a small number that are looking for asylum that are awaiting their asylum court date. And those folks are also in danger.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-somali-immigrants_n_6930aed3e4b02cf3b175e5ee?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6930ad83190000d7076a0e8b.jpeg?cache=93qeJyJZee&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:36:11","author":"Li Zhou,Sebastian Murdock","authors":["Li Zhou","Sebastian Murdock"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":384790468,"title":"Trump&#039;s Net Approval Rating Dips to Second-Term Low: Conservative Pollster","text":"President Donald Trump’s net approval rating has dropped to a second-term low, according to a daily presidential tracking poll from Rasmussen Reports on Wednesday.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nTrump’s overall approval rating has reached the lowest point of his second term, according to a series of national polls released in late 2025. The downturn in approval occurs as the administration contends with persistent economic concerns, ongoing controversy over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and a shifting political climate ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nPresidential approval ratings are closely watched indicators of public sentiment and can influence party strategy, legislative momentum and the prospects of candidates in upcoming elections.\n\nWhat To Know \n\nAccording to Rasmussen Reports, the president’s approval rating is 44 percent, and his disapproval rating is 55 percent, making his net approval rating -11 percent. The poll surveyed 1,500 likely voters and has a margin of error of 2.5 percent. Rasmussen’s daily tracking poll surveys 300 likely voters per night, then reports the results on a five-day rolling average basis, the pollster says.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president’s net approval rating with the pollster was -9 percent, and -7 percent on Monday. The closest the president’s net approval was to reaching -11 percent was on November 14, when Trump had a 44 percent approval rating versus a 54 percent disapproval rating, making his net approval -10 percent.\n\nPresident Donald Trump discusses the country’s fuel economy standards in the Oval Office at the White House on Wednesday in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nColumbia University professor Robert Y. Shapiro, to Newsweek via email on Wednesday: “That even Rasmussen has his ratings falling shows the mounting effects of more bad news than good news on the economy, the Epstein scandal, the disruption that ICE has caused and its overreach nationwide, and the defeats that his party has had in the off-year elections. This does not bode well for Republicans in the midterm congressional elections, which is very bad news for Trump who may have to deal with a Democratic controlled House of Representatives and possibly Senate, which will not only thwart any partisan policy initiatives but could lead to painful investigations of him and his administration.”\n\nTrump, last month on Truth Social: “I HAVE JUST GOTTEN THE HIGHEST POLL NUMBERS OF MY ‘POLITICAL CAREER.’ While my great work on the Economy has not yet been fully appreciated, it will be! Things are really Rockin’. Stopping WARS and Foreign Relations seems to be a strong suit. Also great, The Border and Stopping Crime. I predict that the Economy, with the already HIGHEST STOCK MARKET, EVER, and prices coming sharply down from the Biden disaster, will soon be at the top of the list. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s persistently low approval ratings could present challenges for Republicans as they prepare for the 2026 midterm elections. A drop in support among independents and core demographics could also affect party strategies, particularly in swing districts.","summary":"Presidential approval ratings are closely watched indicators of public sentiment and could influence party strategy.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-net-approval-rating-dips-to-second-term-low-conservative-pollster-11152446","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249834651.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:35:43","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.509},{"id":384790446,"title":"Donald Trump’s Name Added to US Institute of Peace Building","text":"The former headquarters of the U.S. Institute of Peace now bears a new name: Donald J.

His remarks have drawn support from several voices in right-wing and evangelical Christian circles in the US.In a social media post on Friday, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said he met Nigeria's National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu and his team a day earlier. He said their talks focused on what he described as \"the horrific violence against Christians in their country.\"According to Reuters, Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been battling Islamist insurgent groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) for over 15 years.

But there's a bigger and much deeper conversation to all of that,” Erika Kirk said. \n\nCharlie Kirk, 31, the architect of the Arizona-based conservative behemoth Turning Point USA, was a staunch defender of the Second Amendment during his life. After he was shot and killed Sept. 10, his past comments that some gun deaths were worth enduring to protect gun rights went viral online.\n\nInterviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Erika Kirk if she shared her late husband’s view on guns after his death. After stating her support for the Second Amendment, Erika Kirk pointed to mental health challenges among young people, such as anxiety and depression. \n\n“What Charlie knew, and he was trying to explain to students on campus, was that you, you have to understand that brain health is so important. How you eat, how you take care of yourself, how you nourish yourself, how you rest,” Erika Kirk said. “To him, it was much more, deeper and intricate.” \n\nCharlie Kirk was killed Sept. 10 at a Turning Point event on the Utah Valley University campus. Utah man Tyler Robinson, 22, was charged with his murder. \n\nErika Kirk took over her late husband’s political organization as the Turning Point chair and CEO after his death. \n\n“What I've realized through all of this is that you can have individuals that will always resort to violence. And what I'm afraid of is that we are living in a day and age where they think violence is the solution to them not wanting to hear a different point of view,” Erika Kirk said. “That's not a gun problem. That's, that's a human, deeply human problem. That is a soul problem.”\n\nBefore he died, Charlie Kirk had been slated to appear at the DealBook Summit, Sorkin said. The pair had begun talking and debating issues over the past year. \n\nDuring their 38-minute interview, Erika Kirk addressed her late husband’s political beliefs, her view of fractures in the GOP and her organization's intent to support Vice President JD Vance in the 2028 presidential race. \n\nShe called Charlie Kirk a “peacemaker” because he was known for engaging with people he disagreed with. \n\nShe also pointed to Charlie Kirk’s public memorial in Glendale, where President Donald Trump and ex-Trump adviser and billionaire Elon Musk set aside their feud to honor him. Charlie Kirk had prayed that Trump and Musk would become friends again, Erika Kirk said. \n\n“He was so sad when Elon and President Trump weren't friends,” Erika Kirk said. “Unfortunately it took him being murdered. But I'll never forget seeing the photo of Elon and the president shaking hands, and Elon, them putting on X, ‘For Charlie.’” \n\nSorkin pointed out that Charlie Kirk was also known as being a “disruptor.” He asked Erika Kirk whether she agrees with her late husband’s controversial comment that the Civil Rights Act was a “mistake.” \n\n“A lot of people took things that my husband said out of context. When you listen fully, and you understand fully where he was coming from, that disagreement in our country is what democracy is all about. My husband, just because he would make certain statements, did not mean that he was trying to rile up a certain part of people,” Erika Kirk said. “He was trying to, again, go after ideas, not people. He was trying to get people to think a little bit differently.”\n\nErika Kirk encouraged political discourse later in the interview when she addressed fractures on the right, which she said have grown deeper after Charlie Kirk died. She referenced political leaders and influencers, but did not name any specific person. \n\n“There is a lot of uprising,” Erika Kirk said. “I truly believe that the Lord uses everything. And so for me, what I see that as, is opportunity for really getting back to the basics of what our party stands for.”\n\nErika Kirk also addressed the vitriol she’s faced online, noting she’s taken social media and news apps off her phone. She has someone else post and siphon through comments on her behalf. \n\n“I get called so many names. I genuinely don't care. I really don't. I told you this before, when you kiss the bloody dead body of the person that you love, it pales in comparison to being called X-Y-Z,” Erika Kirk said. \n\nErika Kirk also reiterated her support for Vance if he runs for president in 2028, but she said she’s focusing on enjoying Trump’s 2024 victory and second term. Vance will speak later in December at Turning Point’s AmericaFest conference in Phoenix. \n\nCharlie Kirk supported Vance when he ran for Senate in Ohio in 2022 and encouraged Trump to choose him as his running mate last year. Turning Point was credited with boosting turnout for Trump and Vance in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“We adore JD, and my husband was very vocal about endorsing him,” Erika Kirk said. “But I do have to preface this from the standpoint of we have a tendency, as humans, to look past. … I think it would behoove us to appreciate that hard work and enjoy the fact that we do have a president in office that we voted for.” \n\nStephanie Murray covers national politics and the Trump administration for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

When push came to shove, they chose sanity over stagecraft and common sense over calumny. Despite all the leftist cacophony and media blather surrounding his opponent, Democrat candidate Aftyn Behn, Van Epps managed to rise above the fray and get his message out. \n\nVan Epps was ahead but within the margin of error in the latter stages of the race, but he won by a comfortable margin — or at least, a sizeable enough one to avoid a recount. So, while this special election was by no means a squeaker, for a red state where President Donald Trump won the district by 22 points in 2024, it was too close for comfort and too close for complacency. \n\nTeam Sanity and Team Reality won out in the end, but as a precursor to the 2026 midterms, the Republican Party should neither be taking victory laps nor resting on its laurels. Van Epps won in spite of the party, not because of it. \n\nPart 1 of the lesson Republicans must learn: the GOP cannot continue to be cavalier about the value inherent in varied and timely media exposure, strongly articulating a platform over talking points, and then connecting the dots to the issues that matter to their constituencies. \n\nAs my RedState colleague Rusty Weiss wrote, \n\nVan Epps, however, won going away. By nearly 9 points. Not the two-point difference being suggested ahead of election day. Democrats wanted a close race so they could claim a participation trophy. To claim they were the ones with momentum and a mandate. But they didn't even get close.Does this mean Republicans should rest easy heading into the midterms? Of course not. \n\nRead More: Breaking: Winner Declared in TN-07 Special Election\n\nPart 2 of the lesson: There is no such thing as a \"safe district.\" Aftyn Behn was a caboose full of crazy and had a TON of bad opposition against her, which she refused to address. Yet she still got within nine points of a win when, if this was such a reliably red district, Van Epps should have run away with it. \n\nDespite Behn's spoken hatred of Nashville, in Davidson County, Behn ran away with 32,933 of the vote versus Van Epps' 9,135. While Republicans shared and repeated Behn's awful remarks, what did they do to try and reach that segment of voters with facts, listen to their concerns, and offer solutions? Van Epps may have given a preview of why this segment of voters remained untouched in his victory speech. \n\nIt sounds like someone tried to push Van Epps to be more nuanced and to distance himself from Trump and his policies. I hand it to Van Epps for rejecting this advice and standing 10 toes down on his support for the president's agenda. We have enough squishes in Congress, and no one, especially Southerners, likes them. Van Epps understood that the people of Tennessee voted for President Trump by huge margins, and they expected their representatives to help forward that agenda for their state and the American people. \n\nPart 3 of the lesson: Van Epps was given short shrift when it came to media exposure and opportunities. Trump credits part of his presidential victory to reaching out to Gen Z on the platforms, podcasts, and streaming media where they hang out. The party should have had Van Epps doing media MONTHS before this special election across the spectrum of media, and the Republican stars who came out at the last minute to support his candidacy could have been amplifying Van Epps' media appearances early and often.\n\nMore face time and more name recognition mean that more people will pay attention, and that attention may translate to votes. The misfortune of this election is that Aftyn Behn had the media exposure, and it was only because Van Epps needed to get out and challenge her leftist agenda and progressive concepts that we were even able to hear and know him as a candidate. \n\nSadly, Van Epps was thrust into the sea of crazy without a life preserver. But he exhibited his quality in rising to the top and winning the day.\n\nYou could tell with each additional appearance by Van Epps that he became more comfortable with articulating his platform and addressing Tennesseans. The Republican Party is fortunate that Van Epps was a quality candidate as well as a quick study — but time, exposure, and the opportunity to hammer home one's platform, as well as gain comfortability on a larger stage, is an essential part of not just gaining voter recognition, but achieving a modicum of their trust. \n\nWhile this was a special election with shorter windows and less ground time, Republicans have NO excuse heading into the 2026 midterms. The time to queue their incumbent and competitor candidates on all forms of media was yesterday, and if there is media out there that strengthens the candidacy, it needs to be put into digestible sound bites and promoted by the party elders. \n\nPart 4 of this lesson: Aftyn Behn and candidates like her are not going away. The Democrat Socialist radicals are the new face of the party, and will become more and more emboldened with each election — especially if Republicans keep thinking districts are safe and rattle off agenda items, rather than speak plainly to the heart of what matters to voters. \n\nThese progressive candidates know how to animate and rally their base, but many Republicans still haven't gotten that part down. While Democrats floss, fluff, and rouse their base into action, the GOP latches on to victories like the one in TN-07 and slips into complacency mode rather than a work mode which fights for every vote — especially the votes that they are conditioned to think they cannot win.\n\nShe knows her audience and the people who support her vacuous message. Does @matt4tn? Here's my take: If Van Epps does manage to eke out a win, then the Republicans will continue to be complacent about actually campaigning and speaking to issues that matter to their constituencies. If he loses, Democrat Socialists will become even more emboldened to push these candidates who are terrible, but they know how to market and rally their base, as well as lull the @GOP into a complacent slumber where they do not fight for every vote. Neither option is good. There are lessons to be learned here. Will they be heeded before it's too late?\n\nSo many lessons, so little time. With 335 days until the midterms, the GOP should heed them and launch into action. If not, expect to be taken to the cleaners and lose the majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nPlease help us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

It’s been demolished and replaced with a Ginger, part of the Indian Hotels Co stable, and run on a lease and revenue share model.

Smith has been summoned for a closed-door interview later this month.\n\nOne of the federal indictments that Smith led related to Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and his actions on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the US Capitol.\n\nThe second pertained to his hoarding of classified documents at his Florida resort.\n\nBoth cases were dropped after Trump’s re-election in November 2024. Longstanding Justice Department policy bars the prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nTrump has portrayed the indictments as part of a coordinated, politically motivated “witch-hunt”.\n\nPeter Koski, one of Smith’s lawyers, criticised the private nature of the planned deposition in a statement.\n\n“We are disappointed that offer was rejected, and that the American people will be denied the opportunity to hear directly from Jack on these topics,” Koski said.\n\n“Jack looks forward to meeting with the committee later this month to discuss his work and clarify the various misconceptions about his investigation.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Republicans in Congress have focused on revelations that Smith’s team analysed phone records of some lawmakers around the time of the January 6 riot.\n\nSmith’s legal team has maintained the records showed only basic information about outgoing and incoming calls: their time, date and duration, but not the contents of the telephone conversations.\n\n“Mr Smith’s actions as Special Counsel were consistent with the decisions of a prosecutor who has devoted his career to following the facts and the law, without fear or favor and without regard for the political consequences,” Smith’s lawyers wrote to lawmakers in October.\n\n“His investigative decisions were similarly motivated, and the subpoena for toll records was entirely proper, lawful, and consistent with established Department of Justice policy.

The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.\n\nThe move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.\n\nThe rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.\n\nAutomakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change\n\nThe action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nAutomakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”\n\n“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.\n\nStellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.\n\nEnvironmentalists decried the rollback.\n\n“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’’ said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”\n\n‘People want the gasoline car’\n\nTrump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nTrump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”\n\nNo federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.\n\nThe new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.\n\nUnder Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.\n\nThe 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds going into the air in coming years.\n\nMileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.\n\n“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,’’ said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.\n\nThe action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.\n\nGM CEO skips White House event\n\nNotably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.\n\nLike Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.","summary":"The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/12/trump-proposal-would-weaken-vehicle-mileage-rules-that-limit-air-pollution.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/O2BKGHLTO5EUNCGCVSFGSPKPIM.jpg?auth=dc837565ac326ba9b41795144734ef1446b736e2881222b3a5dd10bfce69cd54&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:20:02","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":384788022,"title":"Trump praises Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang after discussion about export controls","text":"WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump said on Dec 3 he had visited with Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang and said the chip giant executive was aware of where he stood on export controls.\n\n“Smart man,” Mr Trump said about Mr Huang when asked about the meeting.

As a result of the encounter, five soldiers were injured.”\n\n“In response to the violation, the IDF, guided by IDF intelligence and the ISA, struck a Hamas terrorist in the southern Gaza Strip.”\n\nThis information could also not initially be independently verified.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously warned that Israel would not tolerate its soldiers being harmed and would respond accordingly.\n\nSince the ceasefire began on October 10, there have been repeated isolated incidents resulting in deaths in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers have also been killed since then.\n\nEarlier, Israel received a body that Hamas said is one of the last two deceased hostages in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe body has been transferred by the Red Cross to the Israeli military and will undergo forensic identification, a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said.\n\nHamas also handed over remains on Tuesday, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office later said were not of any hostage.\n\nThe handover of the last hostages’ bodies in the Gaza Strip would complete a key condition of the initial part of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the two-year war, which also provides for the Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt to open in both directions.\n\nIsrael has kept the crossing shut since the ceasefire came into effect in October, saying Hamas must abide by the agreement to return all hostages still in the Gaza Strip, living and deceased.\n\n“The crossing will be opened both ways when all of our hostages have been returned,” Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters.\n\nSince the fragile truce started, Hamas has returned all 20 living hostages and 26 bodies in exchange for about 2000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners but two more deceased captives – an Israeli police officer and a Thai agricultural worker – are still in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe armed wing of the Hamas-allied Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, the al-Quds Brigades, said it had found a hostage body after conducting a search in the north of the enclave, along with a team from the Red Cross.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad said they had handed over the body to the Red Cross late on Wednesday afternoon.

The plan, expected to be finalised next year, would sharply scale back fuel-economy gains through the 2031 model year and reduce required fleetwide averages for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 miles per gallon. Under Biden-era vehicle mileage rules, automakers would have been required to reach about 50.4 mpg by the same year.Trump argued that loosening the standards will lower sticker prices and broaden consumer choices, claiming the shift will save buyers about USD 1,000 on new vehicles. .preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Automakers, who have long warned that previous rules were difficult and costly to meet, praised the rollback. Executives from Ford and Stellantis called the updated standards more aligned with market conditions and customer demand, saying they will still allow progress on emissions without forcing expensive technology into every model.The announcement marks the latest step in a larger push by the Trump administration to dismantle Biden-era climate policies, including rules promoting electric vehicles and federal EV purchase incentives. Trump again criticized Democratic support for EV adoption, saying Americans prefer gasoline-powered cars. While no federal EV sales mandate exists, several states—led by California—have adopted future zero-emission requirements, many of which have been blocked by Trump and congressional Republicans.Environmental groups condemned the proposed standards, warning that weakened mileage rules will increase U.S. gasoline consumption, raise climate-warming emissions, and worsen air pollution. Critics pointed to federal projections showing that the rollback will result in billions more gallons of gasoline burned by mid-century, along with higher levels of soot and smog-forming pollution. Advocates for clean transportation also argued that the change undermines automakers that have invested heavily in EV manufacturing and workforce expansion.Mileage rules have been in place since the 1970s, steadily improving vehicle efficiency. Opponents of the rollback say reversing this trajectory will leave consumers paying more at the pump and slow the transition to cleaner transportation.- EndsWith inputs from Associated PressPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Dec 4, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/trump-plans-to-weaken-biden-era-vehicle-mileage-rules-that-limit-air-pollution-glbs-2830363-2025-12-04","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/trump-040557292-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=87dyoKa7TnOL76BPIR3XaljejqtAdmUw?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:16:12","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":384796316,"title":"Llega a Venezuela avión con deportados de EEUU tras comentarios de Trump sobre cierre espacio aéreo","text":"CARACAS (AP) — Un vuelo con 266 migrantes venezolanos deportados desde Estados Unidos arribó el miércoles a Caracas en un avión de una aerolínea estadounidense luego de los comentarios del presidente Donald Trump sobre que el espacio aéreo de Venezuela debe considerarse cerrado.\n\n“El gobierno de los Estados Unidos, como lo informó nuestra autoridad aeronáutica”, solicitó la reanudación de los vuelos de repatriación al presidente Nicolás Maduro” y este “de manera inmediata” lo aprobó después que Washington unilateralmente “habían suspendido de manera verbal” esos traslados aéreos, declaró el canciller Yván Gil a periodistas en el aeropuerto que sirve la ciudad de Caracas momentos antes de la llegada de la aeronave.\n\nGil destacó que hace un par de días, sin embargo, el gobierno estadounidense nuevamente solicitó permisos para los vuelos con deportados, directamente desde territorio estadounidense, y Maduro “sin dilaciones aprobó para que retornaran felices a la patria”.\n\nGil indicó que desde Estados Unidos han retornado 14.407 venezolanos deportados en 76 vuelos.\n\nEl avión de la empresa Eastern Airlines llegó al aeropuerto internacional Simón Bolívar, a unos 20 kilómetros al norte de Caracas, procedente de Estados Unidos.\n\nEl arribo se produjo después de que el sábado pasado el mandatario estadounidense dijo que el espacio aéreo “sobre y alrededor” de Venezuela debería considerarse “cerrado en su totalidad” y en medio de la afectación de los vuelos comerciales generada por la decisión de más de una decena de empresas aéreas locales e internacionales de suspender sus operaciones en el país sudamericano tras la advertencia de la Administración Federal de Aviación de Estados Unidos sobre los presuntos riesgos de volar en el espacio aéreo venezolano.\n\nLos vuelos de retorno de migrantes deportados desde Estados Unidos se han regularizado desde fines de marzo por ambos países como parte de los traslados acordados a fines de marzo por los gobiernos de Caracas y Washington.

While British officials publicly downplay the immediacy of the threat, the underlying tone suggests that governments are bracing for the worst.Kremlin Rhetoric vs Western PreparednessWes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, has dismissed the Russian President's latest comments as the 'same old sabre-rattling', a tactic often employed to unsettle Western alliances. However, he conceded that despite the dismissal, the warning is being taken 'seriously' behind closed doors. This cautious stance aligns with France's recent move to announce conscription efforts, a clear signal that European powers are preparing for potential danger on their doorstep.Diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation have so far proved futile. Talks held on Tuesday between Putin and US representatives, including special envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, ended without a breakthrough. Although the Kremlin insisted 'it wouldn't be correct' to say Putin rejected US proposals outright, the lack of progress is palpable. Russia has also dismissed Europe's 28-point peace proposal, responding instead with a deadly aerial strike on Ukraine that claimed four lives last week.Global Flashpoints Fuel WW3 FearsEurope is not the only theatre of potential conflict causing alarm. Tensions in the Western Hemisphere are escalating, with reports suggesting President Trump may be planning to invade Venezuela. Operation Southern Spear, led by General Dan Caine, has deployed warships to the region to stem the flow of drugs, resulting in fatal strikes on alleged 'narco' boats. With Venezuela's airspace closed and President Nicolas Maduro accusing the US of 'fabricating a new eternal war', the risk of a broader clash remains high.Meanwhile, the Middle East remains a powder keg. Although a ceasefire between Iran and Israel on June 24 and a truce between Israel and Hamas on October 9 have provided a brief respite, these agreements appear 'fragile'. Putin has previously lowered the bar for a potential nuclear strike, a move analysts interpret as a direct threat to nations like the UK and US for allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied missiles.Antarctica Offers The Ultimate Nuclear ShieldIf the worst happens, geography might just be the best defence mechanism we have left. Sitting right at the bottom of the globe, Antarctica is arguably the safest place to dodge the immediate impact of a nuclear exchange. The continent covers 14 million square kilometres of nothingness, meaning there are essentially zero strategic targets for warheads to hit.The sheer distance between those ice sheets and the world's major powers creates a natural, massive buffer zone. However, surviving the blast is one thing; surviving the environment is another. You might be safe from detonation, but the freezing climate would make long-term habitation a brutal struggle for anyone seeking refuge.Iceland's Historical Peace And IsolationIceland has never bothered with a full-scale war, earning it a well-deserved reputation as one of the most peaceful nations on Earth. Its spot in the North Atlantic is a huge advantage, physically removing it from the likely battlegrounds of a European conflict. It is just far enough away to make a conventional invasion pointless.The government has played a careful game, signing agreements with Ukraine that stick to financing and transport rather than lethal weapons. While drifting fallout from the mainland could still reach its shores, it remains one of the few places where direct conflict is highly unlikely.New Zealand's Natural Fortress Against ConflictThere is a reason survivalists often look to New Zealand; it sits second on the Global Peace Index and takes a neutral stance on most global drama. The country is a natural fortress of mountains, and its location in the Southern Hemisphere keeps it well out of the firing line of a potential Russia-NATO clash.Even though the Kiwi government has backed Ukraine financially and supported legal moves against Russia, nobody really expects missiles to head toward Auckland. Its self-sufficiency and distance make it a robust option for riding out the storm.Swiss Neutrality Remains The Gold StandardSwitzerland literally defines political neutrality; they managed to stay out of World War Two, after all. The nation is effectively a fortress of difficult terrain and landlocked geography, backed up by an extensive network of nuclear shelters.Interestingly, Switzerland is one of the few European neighbours that hasn't sent military aid to Ukraine. This refusal—which includes blocking other countries from sending Swiss-made weapons—has sparked accusations that they are favouring Russia, but it likely keeps them off Putin's target list.Remote Islands And Southern SanctuariesFor those looking to truly disappear, Greenland is a strong contender. As the world's largest island, it is politically neutral, geographically isolated, and has a population of just 56,000, making it a pointless target for a superpower. Tuvalu, deep in the Pacific, is in a similar boat; with weak infrastructure and no resources to steal, invaders have no reason to go there.Neutrality is also the shield for Indonesia and Fiji. Indonesia sticks to a 'free and active' foreign policy that refuses to pick a side, while Fiji is protected by thousands of miles of ocean and dense forest. In South America, Chile and Argentina stand out for a different reason: food. Argentina is particularly notable because its massive wheat crops mean the population could likely survive the famine that follows a nuclear winter.Rounding out the list are South Africa and Bhutan.

That was their impression.”\n\nMr. Trump added that Ukraine “pretty well” backed the U.S. proposal, although he added that Kyiv should have done so earlier when he had a notoriously heated meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval office in February.\n\nMr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner were now due to meet top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Florida on Thursday (December 4), two US officials told AFP, to follow up on the Kremlin talks.\n\n‘Successes of the Russian army’\n\nBut while the White House had voiced optimism ahead of the Kremlin talks, Moscow said that the two sides had failed to reach a compromise and that more work was needed.\n\nThe Kremlin added Wednesday (December 3) that its army’s recent battlefield successes in Ukraine had bolstered its position and that Kyiv’s ties to NATO remained a key question.\n\nRussia’s advance in eastern Ukraine gathered pace last month and Putin has said in recent days that Moscow is ready to fight on to seize the rest of the land it claims if Kyiv does not surrender it.\n\n“The progress and nature of the negotiations were influenced by the successes of the Russian army on the battlefield in recent weeks,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, who took part in the U.S.-Russia talks, told reporters, including AFP.\n\nMoscow insisted it was incorrect to say Mr. Putin rejected the plan in its entirety.\n\nIt also said Russia was still committed to diplomacy, despite Mr. Putin’s stark warning earlier this week that Moscow was prepared to fight Europe if it wanted war.\n\n“We are still ready to meet as many times as is needed to reach a peace settlement,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n‘Opportunity to end the war’\n\nIn Kyiv, Mr. Zelenskyy said that though a window of opportunity for peace has opened, it must be accompanied by pressure on Moscow.\n\n“The world now clearly feels that there is an opportunity to end the war, and the current activity in negotiations must be supported by pressure on Russia,” he said in a regular evening address.\n\nThe fresh talks come as NATO pledges to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of U.S. arms for Kyiv.\n\nNATO chief Mark Rutte said it was positive that peace talks were ongoing, but that the alliance should make sure that “Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to keep the fight going”.\n\nRussian troops have been grinding forward across the front line against outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainian forces.\n\nEarlier this week, Moscow claimed to have captured the important stronghold of Pokrovsk, but a Ukrainian army unit fighting in the city said urban combat was still ongoing.\n\nEuropean countries have expressed fears that Washington and Moscow will reach agreements without them and have spent the last weeks trying to amend the U.S. plan so that it does not force Kyiv to capitulate.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-putin-wants-to-end-war-us-to-hold-new-talks-with-ukraine/article70355964.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1l7ldi/article70355965.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-12-04T000522Z_646243459_RC2K8IARO15D_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ACCOUNTS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:11:20","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.349},{"id":384787720,"title":"Hegseth risked US troops by sharing strike details on Signal, Pentagon watchdog finds","text":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is back in the political hot seat as the Pentagon’s watchdog alleged he put American personnel and missions at risk by using the Signal messaging app to share sensitive details about a strike targeting Yemen’s Houthi militants.Trump administration officials used the encrypted app Signal to coordinate sensitive military strikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants in March — and the group chat accidentally included a journalist. Then–national security adviser Mike Waltz set up the chat with several of Trump’s top Cabinet officials but mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.And later, The Atlantic published additional text messages from the Signal group chat, underscoring a massive breach in operational security as specific sensitive information about the Houthi attack was shared in the chat before it was carried out.Sources familiar with the classified report — now parked with the Senate Armed Services Committee — say Hegseth blasted out minute-by-minute updates such as “1215 ET: F-18s LAUNCH” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target” in a Signal chat. The inspector general’s probe — launched in April at lawmakers’ request — examined whether Hegseth sidestepped secure communications and ignored records rules. A redacted public version is expected Thursday, as bipartisan critics argue Hegseth’s real-time “declassification by group chat” put troops at risk, AP news agency reported. Signal blunder puts OPSEC under the microscope Hegseth told the group “We are currently clean on OPSEC” after strikes, celebrating the collapse of a building housing a top Houthi missile commander. But the IG faulted him for using a personal device in violation of policy, noting that even if he had authority to declassify, details remained sensitive while pilots were en route. Critics, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, said those launch-time sequences were “inherently classified” and could have gotten aviators killed if intercepted. Waltz later admitted the accidental add and even sought help from Elon Musk for digital forensics.According to the one of the sources said Hegseth technically has the authority to declassify information, and the review didn’t conclude that he mishandled classified material. But it did find that he violated Pentagon policy by conducting official business from a personal device and recommended better training for Defense Department officials. Hegseth refused an in-person interview with the inspector general, instead submitting a written statement, the person said. He argued that he was allowed to declassify information and only shared details he believed would not jeopardize operations.Caribbean strike controversy The early conclusions intensify pressure on the former Fox News host, as lawmakers had already demanded an independent investigation into his use of the commercial app. Members of Congress are also probing a separate report that a follow-up strike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean in September killed survivors after Hegseth allegedly ordered forces to “kill everybody.” Hegseth defended that strike as part of the “fog of war,” saying he did not see any survivors but also “didn’t stick around,” and that the admiral in charge “made the right call” in ordering the second attack. He denied any wrongdoing related to the Signal chats, insisting the material was unclassified. “The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement. “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.” President Donald Trump “stands by” Hegseth, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, noting the review confirmed that “no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.” Rooted in US campaign against Houthis Houthi rebels began firing missiles and drones at commercial and naval ships in late 2023, saying the attacks were aimed at ending Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. Those assaults sharply reduced traffic through the Red Sea, which normally handles about $1 trillion in yearly trade. The US-led response in 2024 became the most sustained naval fight since World War II. A ceasefire in Israel and Gaza began in January but fell apart in March. The US then launched a broad assault on Houthi targets, which ended weeks later after Trump said the group agreed to stop targeting ships. Another Gaza ceasefire took effect in October. After it became public that Hegseth’s Signal chat included The Atlantic’s editor, the magazine published the entire thread in March. The messages showed Hegseth laying out strike windows, target locations, timing elements, and which aircraft and weapons would be used. He also noted the US was “currently clean” on operational security. Hegseth told Fox News in April that what he shared over Signal was “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things.”","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-risked-us-troops-by-sharing-strike-details-on-signal-pentagon-watchdog-finds/articleshow/125755329.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125755416/125755416.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:11:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":384791306,"title":"New images of Epstein&apos;s private island released","text":"Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released 14 photos and videos of Jeffrey Epstein&apos;s private island in the US Virgin Islands, showing empty courtyards, a bedroom and other rooms from his villa. Congress is pressing the Trump administration to release all of its case files on the sex trafficking investigation into the disgraced late financier. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said he was releasing the images \"to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein&apos;s horrific crimes.\" The visuals from the luxury estate on Little St James Island provide a glimpse of the opulent residence where Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly trafficked girls for sex with his friends and guests. The Department of Justice has until mid-December to comply with legislation passed by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump to publicly release many of its documents on Epstein. Among the images are bedrooms and bathrooms inside the main residence, as well as a room containing a dentist&apos;s chair and masks hanging on the wall. One picture shows a blackboard in a large study with words including \"power\" and \"deception\" written on it, as well as several other words that are redacted. Another depicts a room with a dentist&apos;s chair, with masks of men&apos;s faces hanging on the wall. Garcia said the Committee also received documents from J.P.

Darrell Issa said he’s ‘not going anywhere.’ Now he says he might run for Congress in Texas.","text":"After voters backed a redraw of California congressional maps, Republican U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa faces what could be the most competitive race in his more than two decades in Congress — if he stays in San Diego County.\n\nWith a real challenge from Democrats on his hands, Issa is considering leaving to run for a congressional seat in Texas, where Republican redistricting has created newly competitive seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“I have to go where I can be of the most use,” he told a Dallas-area radio show on Wednesday. He added that he would be meeting with President Donald Trump later in the day.\n\n“The decision to come to Texas is going to be a combination of the president’s leadership and a willingness to take two chances,” he said. “Right now we are a united party under a great president, and we’re going to do everything we can to keep it that way after the midterms.”\n\nThe congressman’s consideration of a Texas run was first reported by Punchbowl News.\n\nNeither Issa nor his staff responded to requests for comment. Monday is Texas’ deadline for candidates to file to run.\n\nMeanwhile, Texas’ redraw of its congressional maps — the first in an ongoing gerrymandering arms race around the country — is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The court is expected to rule on Texas’ new maps soon.\n\nSince he was first elected to Congress in 2000, Issa has represented San Diego County’s more conservative bastions, interrupted by a two-year period after he opted not to run for re-election in 2018’s “blue wave.”\n\nBut last month, California voters overwhelmingly voted to enact Proposition 50, Democrats’ redistricting effort to flip up to five congressional seats in their favor. The 48th Congressional District was one of their chief targets.\n\nIssa’s current district spans most of East San Diego County. The redrawn seat will lose many rural areas and pick up less conservative areas including San Marcos, Vista and the Democratic stronghold of Palm Springs in Riverside County — changes that give Democrats a 4-point registration advantage.\n\nOn election night, Issa made a defiant statement where he vowed he was “not quitting on California.”\n\n“I’m not going anywhere,” he said.\n\nBut Issa is now introducing himself to voters nearly 1,400 miles away, telling north Texas radio listeners Wednesday that he considers his current district the “east Texas of California,” noting its many rodeos and conservative culture.\n\nHe said a Republican colleague had urged him to consider running in Texas’ 32nd Congressional District, which now covers the northeastern Dallas suburbs and is represented by Julie Johnson, a Democrat.\n\nUnder Texas’ new map, however, the district picks up a long finger of more rural northeast Texas, shifting from a 22-point Democratic registration advantage to a 17-point Republican advantage.\n\n“One of my colleagues from Texas called me and told me, ‘We don’t have a good candidate. I understand your district has been made pretty close to impossible. But we’ve got TX-32 — would you look at it?’” he told radio host Mark Davis on Wednesday.\n\n“They encouraged me to look at it,” he added. “I have looked at it. It does represent the values and the voting that I’m used to.”\n\nAnna Elsasser, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, called his consideration of such a jump “cowardice at its finest” and proof that “he only wants to stay in power to enrich himself.”\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nStiffer competition has prompted Issa to step away from a congressional race before.\n\nIn 2018, he did not seek reelection ahead of expectations that Democrats could flip what was then the 49th Congressional District. Democrat Mike Levin later won that race with 56% of the vote, and Issa returned to Congress after winning the neighboring 48th two years later.\n\nThis year, even before Prop. 50 passed, the prospect of a more competitive race in the 48th prompted a crowded field of Democrats to seek to unseat Issa.\n\nCurrent candidates include San Diego County Councilmember Marni von Wilpert, Vista City Councilmember Corrina Contreras, Riverside County businessman Brandon Riker and former congressional candidate Ammar Campa-Najjar, who lost to Issa in 2020.","summary":"'I have to go where I can be of the most use,' he told a Dallas-area radio show Wednesday.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/12/03/after-prop-50-rep-darrell-issa-said-hes-not-going-anywhere-now-he-says-he-might-run-for-congress-in-texas/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SUT-L-border-hearing-0907-5.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:08:28","author":"Lucas Robinson","authors":["Lucas Robinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":384789420,"title":"Royal Navy ships hunting Russian submarines have terrifying subsonic 'STRATUS' missiles","text":"Royal Navy ships out hunting Russian submarines have been kitted out with terrifying subsonic \"STRATUS\" long-range missiles.

STRATUS missiles are a subsonic, low-observable cruise-strike weapon that is designed for long-range engagements against targets on land or at sea. British Type 26 frigates will patrol seas between Greenland, Iceland and the UK in a bid to counter the rising threat from Vladimir Putin . There has been a 30 per cent surge in Russian ships that have been spotted entering UK waters in the past two years. A particular sinister encounter occurred recently when the Russian spy ship, the Yantar, shone lasers at RAF pilots when it was spotted north of Scotland , triggering a warning from the Defence Secretary John Healey that the UK would strike back if it travelled south. Tensions have continued to escalate after mad Vladimir Putin bluntly rejected Donald Trump's peace proposal to bring an end to the war in Ukraine . Putin threatened Russia was ready to go to war with NATO, seemingly wanting to provoke a fiery response. He said: \"We are not planning to go to war with Europe, but if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now. They are on the side of war.\" The UK and its allies have grown increasingly alarmed at the threat posed by Moscow to vital undersea cables and pipelines. Attacks on this vital infrastructure could cause \"catastrophic disruption\" to financial and communications systems, the National Security Strategy Committee warned in September. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “At this time of profound global instability, as more Russian ships are being detected in our waters, we must work with international partners to protect our national security. This historic agreement with Norway strengthens our ability to protect our borders and the critical infrastructure our nations depend on.\" Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"In this new era of threat and with increasing Russian activity in the North Atlantic, our strength comes from hard power and strong alliances. When our critical infrastructure and waters are threatened, we step up. \"For over 75 years, the UK and Norway have stood shoulder-to-shoulder on NATO’s northern flank, defending Europe and keeping our people safe. This partnership takes us further, making our nations more secure at home and strong abroad.\" Responding to a question from Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, Defence Minister Luke Pollard said the Royal Navy has “a requirement called the Future Offensive Surface Weapon (FoSUW) which will provide a long range anti-ship strike weapon with land attack capabilities, compatible with the Mk41 Vertical Launch System.” He stated that this requirement “will be met through the Future Cruise Anti-Ship Weapon (FCASW) programme, which comprises two concept solutions, STRATUS LO and STRATUS RS.” The stealth-optimised STRATUS LO is a subsonic, low-observable cruise-strike weapon designed for long-range engagements, while the high-speed STRATUS RS is focused on rapid supersonic engagements. Both are intended for deployment across air and maritime platforms.","summary":"In the past two years there has been a 30 per cent surge in Russian ships approaching British waters - sparking a strong response from officials keen to face down Vladimir Putin","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/royal-navy-ships-hunting-russian-36348048","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36348460.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Screenshot-2025-12-03-at-171602.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:07:41","author":"Anders Anglesey","authors":["Anders Anglesey"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.082},{"id":384790450,"title":"Epstein Files: Congressman Reveals &#039;Biggest Thing&#039; Coming After New Release","text":"California Democratic Representative and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Robert Garcia said bank and financial records are the next “biggest thing” in the release of case files related to the federal sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nGarcia appeared on MS NOW’s Chris Jansing Reports after the release of photos and videos from Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Wednesday. \n\n“The biggest thing that we’re going to learn is actually what’s ahead of us in the next few days as it relates to all of the bank and financial records. We received in total last night about 5,000 pages of photos, videos, some of which we have seen today, and then a substantial amount of bank records. And so those, we are going through, and we believe are really important to our investigation and the case,” Garcia said. \n\nRep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., right, speaks as Rep. Morrison Kelly, left, listens during a news conference on the Epstein files Tuesday, Nov. 18, 2025, in Washington.\n\nThe committee obtained records from J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank. House Oversight Democrats say they plan to release the documents to the public after completing their review in the coming days. \n\nWhy It Matters \n\nEpstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead at New York’s Metropolitan Correctional Center in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. \n\nEpstein had social connections with many prominent individuals, including President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with Trump saying his relationship with the financier ended years before his death. \n\nTrump signed legislation last month that compels his administration to release files on Epstein. \n\nWhat To Know \n\nGarcia told MS NOW that the bank and financial records are “very important to understand the money that was transferred from these incredibly wealthy and powerful men to Jeffrey Epstein, how Jeffrey Epstein obtained his wealth, where was the money coming from.” \n\nHe said the records are only a “batch” of documents, and they expect more in the weeks and months ahead. \n\n“It’s also important to note that these are only two banks. We have actually tried to get a subpoena on over 20 banks that we believe have critical information,” Garcia said. “Republicans have only joined us to get information on these two, but we have asked Chairman Comer and the committee to ensure that we get the full information from all 20 of the institutions where we believe money has moved in and out in this sex trafficking ring and the abuse of women and girls.” \n\nGarcia added, “It’s incredibly important for us to be very careful to redact information that could put survivors and victims in any sort of danger. But we’re grateful to the banks for getting us information, and we’re reviewing them right now as we speak.” \n\nPhotos and videos shared by House Oversight Democrats depict empty courtyards, a bedroom and other interior rooms of his villa. \n\nThe photos also show a space with a chair resembling one used in dental offices, with decorative masks hanging on the wall. One picture shows what appears to be a study, where a chalkboard says words like “power,” “deception,” “plots” and “political.” \n\n“These are just disturbing images and never-seen-before images of what Jeffrey’s island and the estate actually look like. You see some of — the dentist chair and the weird masks. You obviously are seeing some video of some of the bedrooms and areas where so many of these horrific crimes happened,” Garcia told MS NOW. \n\nJames O’Keefe, founder of Project Veritas, said on X, “Actually @OKeefeMedia broke these photos in May.” \n\nThe House Oversight Committee reposted O’Keefe’s post and accused Democrats of “chasing headlines again.” \n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nCalifornia Democratic Representative and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Robert Garcia, during an appearance on MS NOW’s “Chris Jansing Reports” on Wednesday: “We know that so many girls, in some cases, children and women were raped, were abused in these spaces. And so what’s important for Democrats is, when we get information, we are going to put it out to the public. And I think that the images speak for themselves. It’s so important at this moment that the president and the Department of Justice release the full Epstein files that they are required to do.” \n\nHouse Oversight Committee, on X: “@OversightDems rushed to release cherry-picked docs provided to the committee, slapped on the phrase ‘never-before-seen,’ and the Legacy Media ran with it as if it were breaking news. They are not serious about this investigation.”","summary":"House Oversight Democrats say they plan to release the documents to the public after completing their review in the coming days. ","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/epstein-files-congressman-reveals-biggest-thing-coming-after-new-release-11152643","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25322655071991.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:07:01","author":"Jenna Sundel","authors":["Jenna Sundel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":384792128,"title":"Trump's 'mental decline' put on display with 'creepy obsession': House lawmaker","text":"WASHINGTON — A pair of top Democrats in the House of Representatives slammed President Donald Trump's \"deranged obsession\" with attacking Somali-Americans on Wednesday. \n\nOn Tuesday, Trump said he does not want Somalis in the United States because \"they contribute nothing,\" the AP reported.

It’s gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. By failing to secure new pledges for a cut in fossil fuels, Cop achieved less than nothing. The venue caught fire, the air conditioning malfunctioned – and delegates were told on arrival not to flush toilet paper. Bill Gates’s recent apologia, in which he conceded that global warming ‘will not lead to humanity’s demise’ after he closed the policy and advocacy office of his climate philanthropy group, is just the latest nail in the coffin.\n\nIn October, the Net Zero Banking Alliance shut down after JPMorgan Chase, Citi-group, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs led a stampede of banks out of the door. Shell and BP have returned to being oil companies, to the delight of their shareholders. Ford is about to cease production of electric pick-ups that nobody wants. Hundreds of other companies are dropping their climate targets. Australia has backed out of hosting next year’s climate conference.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Washington Post, in the US it is not just the Republicans who have given up on climate change: the Democrat party has stopped talking about it, hardly mentioning it during Kamala Harris’s campaign for president. The topic has dropped to the bottom half of a table of 23 concerns among Swedish youths. Even the European parliament has now voted to exempt many companies from reporting rules that require them to state how they are helping to fight climate change.\n\nIt has been a long, lucrative ride. Predicting the eco-apocalypse has always been a profitable business, spawning subsidies, salaries, consulting fees, air miles, bestsellers and research grants. Different themes took turns as the scare du jour: overpopulation, oil spills, pollution, desertification, mass extinction, acid rain, the ozone layer, nuclear winter, falling sperm counts. Each faded as the evidence became more equivocal, the public grew bored or, in some cases, the problem was resolved by a change in law or practice.\n\nBut no scare grew as big or lasted as long as global warming. I first wrote a doom–laden article for the Economist about carbon dioxide emissions trapping heat in the air in 1987, nearly 40 years ago. I soon realised the effect was real but the alarm was overdone, that feedback effects were exaggerated in the models. The greenhouse effect was likely to be a moderate inconvenience rather than an existential threat. For this blasphemy I was abused, cancelled, blacklisted, called a ‘denier’ and generally deemed evil. In 2010 in the pages of the Wall Street Journal I debated Gates, who poured scorn on my argument that global warming was not likely to be a catastrophe – so it is welcome to see him come round to my view.\n\nThe activists who took over the climate debate, often with minimal understanding of climate science, competed for attention by painting ever more catastrophic pictures of future greenhouse warming. They altered the name to ‘climate change’ so they could blame it for blizzards as well as heatwaves. Then they inflated the language to ‘climate emergency’ and ‘climate crisis’, even as projections of future warming came down.\n\n‘I’m talking about the slaughter, death and starvation of six billion people this century. That’s what the science predicts,’ said Roger Hallam, founder of Extinction Rebellion, in 2019, though the science says no such thing. ‘A top climate scientist is warning climate change will wipe out humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years,’ tweeted Greta Thunberg in 2018. Five years later she deleted her tweet and shortly after decided that Palestine was a more promising way of staying in the limelight.\n\nScientists knew that pronouncements like this were nonsense but they turned a blind eye because the alarm kept the grant money coming. Journalists always love exaggeration. Capitalists were happy to cash in. Politicians welcomed the chance to blame others: if a wildfire or a flood devastates your town, point the finger at the changing climate rather than your own failure to prepare. Almost nobody had an incentive to downplay the alarm.\n\nUnlike previous scares, climate fear has the valuable feature that it can always be presented in the future tense. No matter how mild the change in the weather proves to be today, you can always promise Armageddon tomorrow. So it was that for four long decades, climate change alarm went on a protracted march through the institutions, capturing newsrooms, classrooms and boardrooms. By 2020 no meeting, even of a town council or a sports team, was complete without a hand-wringing discussion of carbon footprints.\n\nThe other factor that kept the climate scare alive was that emissions reduction proved impossibly difficult. This was a feature, not a bug: if it had been easy, the green gravy train would have ground to a halt. Reducing sulphur emissions to stop acid rain proved fairly easy, as did banning chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone layer. But decade after decade, carbon dioxide emissions just kept on rising no matter how much money and research was thrown at the problem. Cheers!\n\nSwitching to renewable energy made no difference – literally. Here’s the data: the world added 9,000 terawatt-hours of energy consumption from wind and solar in the past decade, but 13,000 from fossil fuels. Not that wind and solar save much carbon dioxide anyway, their machinery being made with coal and their intermittency being backed up by fossil fuels.\n\nDespite trillions of dollars in subsidies, these two ‘unreliables’ still provide just 6 per cent of the world’s energy. Their low-density, high-cost, intermittent power output is of no use to data centres or electric grids, let alone transport and heating, and effectively poisons the economics of building and running new nuclear and gas generation by preventing continuous operation. Quite why it became mandatory among those concerned about climate change to support these unreliables so obsessively is hard to fathom. Subsidy–addiction has a lot to do with it, combined with a general ignorance of thermodynamics.\n\nNow the climate scare is fading, a scramble for the exits is beginning among the big environmental groups. Donations are drying up. Some will switch seamlessly to trying to panic us about artificial intelligence; others will follow Gates and insist that they never said it was the end of the world, just a problem to be solved; a few will even try declaring victory, claiming unconvincingly that promises made at the Paris conference a decade ago have slowed down emissions enough to save the climate.\n\nOf course, Al Gore, the former US vice–president who did more than anybody else to alarm the world about climate change and made a $300 million fortune from it, has been at the recent conference in the Brazilian jungle – the one where they felled a forest to build the access road. As he railed against Gates last month for abandoning the cause and accused him of being bullied by Donald Trump, he sounded like one of those Japanese soldiers emerging from the jungle who did not know the second world war was over.\n\nPerhaps Gore might now regret his exaggerated preachings of hellfire and damnation. In his 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth, for which he shared a Nobel prize, he predicted a sea-level rise of up to 20 feet ‘in the near future’ – out by around 19 feet and nine inches. In 2009 he said there was a 75 per cent chance all the ice in the Arctic Ocean would disappear by 2014. In that year there were five million square kilometres of the stuff at its lowest point – about the same as in 2009. This year there were 4.7 million square kilometres. At the film’s showing at the Sundance Festival, Gore said that unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases were taken within ten years, the world would reach a point of no return. Yet here we are 19 years later.\n\nGore is correct that fear of retribution from the Trump administration drives some of the corporate retreats. President Trump has already cancelled $300 billion of green infrastructure funding and purged government websites of climate rhetoric. But even if the Republicans lose the White House in 2028, it will be hard to reflate the climate balloon. The proportion of Americans greatly worried about climate change is dropping. If Trump takes America out of the 1992 treaty that set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change it would require an unlikely two-thirds vote of the Senate to rejoin.\n\nBjorn Lomborg, the Danish economist who is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and has fought a lonely battle against climate exaggeration for decades, recently explained the shift in public opinion: ‘The shrillness of climate doom also wears down voters. While climate change is a real and man-made problem, constant end-of-the-world proclamations from media and campaigners massively overstate the situation.’\n\nA key figure in the collapse of the climatocracy is Chris Wright, the pioneer of extracting shale gas by hydraulic fracturing who was appointed by Trump as energy secretary this year. Wright commissioned a review of climate science by five distinguished academics that set out just how non-frightening the facts of climate change are: slowly rising temperatures, mainly at night in winter and in the north, correspondingly less in daytime in summer and in the tropics where most people live, accompanied by a very slow rise in sea level showing no definite acceleration, minimal if any measurable change in the average frequency and ferocity of storms, droughts and floods – and record low levels of deaths from such causes. Plus a general increase in green vegetation, caused by the extra carbon dioxide.\n\nIndoor air pollution caused by poor people cooking over wood fires because they lack access to gas and electricity kills three million a year. So yes, Gates, influenced by Lomborg and Wright, is correct to say that getting cheap, reliable, clean energy to the poor is by far the more urgent priority.\n\nSources tell me that Wright is treated like a rock star at international conferences: his fellow ministers, especially those from Africa and Asia, are thrilled to talk about the need to get energy to people instead of being hectored about emissions. Only a few western European ministers sneer, but even some of them (the British being an exception) quietly admit that they need to find a way to climb down off their green high horses.\n\nFortunately, they now have convenient cover for doing so: artificial intelligence. We would love to go on subsidising wind and solar, say the Germans privately, but if we are to have data centres, we need lots more reliable and affordable power, so we will build gas turbines and maybe even some nuclear.\n\nLikewise, throughout the tech world of the American west coast, emoting about climate suddenly seems like a luxury belief compared with the need to sign contracts with power suppliers mostly burning natural gas – or get left behind in the AI race. The world’s gas glut is impossible to overstate: thanks to fracking, we have centuries’ worth of cheap gas. The tech bros are piling into nuclear, too, but that won’t address the needs for extra power until well into the next decade, and the need is now.\n\nThe climatastrophe has been a terrible mistake. It diverted attention from real environmental problems, cost a fortune, impoverished consumers, perpetuated indoor pollution and poverty, frightened young people into infertility, wasted years of our time, undermined democracy and corrupted science. Time to bury the parrot.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-great-climate-climbdown-is-finally-here/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PepFa_NOBG.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:05:00","author":"Matt Ridley","authors":["Matt Ridley"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":384791846,"title":"Why British diplomacy needs the royals","text":"Watching David Dimbleby watching the royal family, I am instantly reminded of the BBC’s other royal David. It is pure Attenborough as he examines the exotic plumage and rituals of rex Windsorianus in its natural habitat.\n\nIn this week’s first episode of What’s the Monarchy For?, a three-part study of the sovereign for BBC1, Dimbleby examines royal power, engagingly prodding and poking fun at both sides. However, it ends as it starts, with our host still scratching his head.\n\nPerhaps we will have an answer by the end of the final episode. For those who do not have three hours to spare, however, I would point to the scene on Windsor high street this week as a very simple answer to Dimbleby’s question. I happened to be there, talking to another arm of the BBC, as we watched the monarchy doing what it does best. The whole town was flying British and German flags. A respectable crowd had turned out to watch the Household Cavalry escorting the royal procession through the town and up to the castle. There was the King, accompanied by Queen Camilla plus the Prince and Princess of Wales. But who was that sitting next to him?\n\nA random straw poll of members of the public revealed a recognition factor of precisely zero. None of those I met in the crowd was able to identify the jovial, bespectacled 69-year-old figure as Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a former foreign minister who has been head of state for more than twice as long as Charles III. To which my German friends might well observe that Mr Steinmeier is a very well-respected Bundespraesident. That is true but it is not the point. Two years ago, I was in Berlin for the reverse exercise as the King paid a state visit (the first of his reign) to Germany. On that occasion, every single person in the – substantially larger – crowds knew exactly who the state visitor was.\n\nBritain is a nation undergoing a slow but steady diminution of its economic, military and geopolitical significance, yet it has one unarguable diplomatic asset. That is not my diagnosis but that of the man who invented and defined soft power, Professor Joseph Nye of Harvard University. I interviewed him for my biography of the late Queen and he told me that Britain will always be at or near the top in soft power terms for two reasons: the English language and the monarchy. In short, the world would rather meet British royalty than anyone else we might park on a red carpet. More than that, repeated international surveys show that the monarchy is the first thing much of the world thinks about when it thinks about Britain.\n\nDimbleby accepts that this can be of immense value, pointing to the late Queen’s 2011 state visit to Ireland and her subsequent handshake with ex-IRA capo Martin McGuinness as ‘a masterstroke of soft power’. But Dimbleby also suggests that this soft power is shamelessly transactional. He links the current government’s use of the monarchy to schmooze Donald Trump – ‘laying it on with a trowel’ – to the way in which previous governments used the Windsors to seal deals with ‘tyrants’ such as Robert Mugabe and Nicolae Ceausescu. Isn’t that rather the point, though?\n\nThe programme is less clear when it seeks to define the domestic power of the monarchy. At times, we are watching a subjective personal appraisal by D. Dimbleby (‘I seem to have been reporting on the monarchy for ever’). At others, it feels like Panorama as former politicians, courtiers and commentators are grilled on the extent to which the King may have overstepped the constitutional mark in comparison with his neutral late mother. Her role in Boris Johnson’s subsequently unlawful 2019 prorogation gets some flak – even if the arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve accepts she had no choice. The shouty fringe group Republic also has its moment, claiming that the royals are ‘intrinsically harmful’ and ‘symbolise feudalism’.\n\nThe main charge is that Prince Charles indulged in ‘industrial-level lobbying’ of ministers many years ago. We see plenty of old Charles speeches and Dimbleby reads out a princely letter to then-prime minister Tony Blair nudging him on everything from beef farming to helicopters and signed ‘Yours ever, Charles’ (he can’t resist a dig at the royal signature – ‘It looks like “Mary”’).\n\nAt one point, I heard my own voice. It was a clip from a BBC film for Prince Charles’s 60th, when I asked him if he could still champion big causes once he was King. ‘I don’t know. Probably not,’ he replied.\n\nDimbleby then fast-forwards 17 years and points sternly at shots of the King escorting Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner, around the Duchy of Cornwall’s Nansledan new town near Newquay. This moment is painted as both back-tracking and regal arm-twisting. We are told no one can find ‘any other instance where a reigning monarch has actually been on an official visit with a Prime Minister’. He adds: ‘This is unprecedented.’ It feels a bit of a stretch. Aside from the fact that the King has handed on the duchy to his son and that Starmer and Rayner are not fools, I seem to recall that Downing Street had expressed an interest in a trip at a time when Labour was making a lot of noise about housing. Who was using whom? As for the idea that PMs don’t go on official trips with monarchs, I can think of a few, not least David Cameron hitching a ride on the late Queen’s state visits to Ireland and Germany.\n\nThe programme seems surprised that each monarch is different. Yet the King, unlike his mother, came to the throne with a 50-year track record as a charitable entrepreneur, a reservoir of experience which politicians can tap into or ignore.\n\nAsked at one point if he himself is pro-monarchy, Dimbleby replies: ‘I am pro–television series about the monarchy.’ Amen to that. Yet the main challenge to any series with a title like this one is best summed in the words of former Labour special adviser Paul Richards: ‘There’s something deeply irrational about our constitution.’ Until a majority of the UK would prefer to have someone like nice Frank-Walter Steinmeier in charge, that’s just the way it should be.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-british-diplomacy-needs-the-royals/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RobertHardman-GettyImages-2208884055.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:05:00","author":"Queen Camilla","authors":["Queen Camilla"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.112},{"id":384793792,"title":"Oklahoma university instructor on leave after failing Bible-based essay on gender","text":"An instructor at the University of Oklahoma has been placed on leave after a student complained that she received a failing grade on a paper that cited the Bible to assert that the “belief in multiple genders” was “demonic.\"\n\nSamantha Fulnecky, 20, filed a complaint with the administration, the latest flashpoint in the ongoing debate over academic freedom on college campuses amid President Donald Trump’s push to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and restrict how campuses discuss issues of race, gender and sexuality.\n\n“OU remains firmly committed to fairness, respect and protecting every student's right to express sincerely held religious beliefs,” the university wrote in an email on Wednesday.\n\nThe school added that the failing grade — which was supposed to account for 3% of Fulnecky's final grade — would not affect the junior's academic standing. An investigation into Fulnecky's discrimination complaint is still ongoing.\n\nThe assignment was for a psychology class about lifespan development. Students were asked to write a 650-word response to an academic study that examined whether conformity with gender norms was associated with popularity or bullying among middle school students. \n\nFulnecky wrote that she was frustrated by the premise of the article because she doesn't believe that there are more than two genders based on her understanding of the Bible, according to a copy of her essay provided to The Oklahoman. \n\n“Society pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,” she wrote. \n\nShe argued that promoting the belief in multiple genders would lead society to move “farther from God’s original plan for humans.”\n\nThe essays were graded out of 25 points, broken down by whether the student demonstrated an understanding of the article and addressed a specific aspect of the argument put forth. Fulnecky received zero points for her work.\n\n“Please note that I am not deducting points because you have certain beliefs,\" the instructor wrote in feedback obtained by The Oklahoman. Instead, the instructor said the paper did \"not answer the questions for the assignment.”\n\nThe paper “contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive\" the criticism went on. \n\nA contact for the instructor, whose name has not been confirmed by the university, was not immediately available. \n\nFulnecky's complaint to the administration soon went viral after the school's chapter of Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September, posted about Fulnecky's experience on the social media site X. \n\n“Professors like this are the very reason conservatives can’t voice their beliefs in the classroom,” the group posted. \n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt appeared to affirm that perspective, posting on X that the situation was “deeply concerning.” \n\n“I’m calling on the OU regents to review the results of the investigation & ensure other students aren’t unfairly penalized for their beliefs,” he wrote. \n\nThe firestorm comes after a professor at Texas A&M was fired earlier this year after a video where a student confronted the instructor over her teaching of issues related to gender identity in a class on children’s literature went viral. A university committee in late November ruled that the firing was without good cause, and flouted formal procedure. \n\nSince Trump took office, student affinity groups have shuttered campus offices and professors have altered curriculums. The president has also threatened federal funding for schools who don’t comply with standards for teaching, admissions and gender in sports supported by the administration. Both supporters and opponents of the Trump administration’s campaign say that freedom of speech is at stake.","summary":"A University of Oklahoma instructor has been placed on leave after a student complained about receiving a failing grade on a paper","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-university-of-oklahoma-kevin-stitt-oklahoma-society-b2877720.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/04/00/Oklahoma_Bible_Essay_38600.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-04 00:04:18","author":"Safiyah Riddle","authors":["Safiyah Riddle"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.491},{"id":384791264,"title":"Trump commits to releasing video of deadly strikes on alleged drug boat (Video)","text":"International\n\nSouth Cinema\n\nSocial News XYZ Reviews\n\nMovie Schedules\n\nMovies News\n\nLive Events\n\nMotorsports\n\nOther Sports\n\nScience/Tech\n\nBusiness Wire India\n\nEnvironment\n\nHome » Videos » Trump commits to releasing video of deadly strikes on alleged drug boat (Video) \n\nTrump commits to releasing video of deadly strikes on alleged drug boat (Video)\n\nPosted By: Social News XYZ\nDecember 3, 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday reaffirmed his defense of the Pentagons deadly strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in September and committed to releasing video of the operation.\n\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\n\nRead more: https://apnews.com\n\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home\n\nFacebook Comments\n\nAbout SocialNewsXYZ\nAn Indo-American News website.It covers Gossips, Politics, Movies, Technolgy, and Sports News and Photo Galleries and Live Coverage of Events via Youtube.\nThe website is established in 2015 and is owned by AGK FIRE INC.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nTrump commits to releasing video of deadly strikes on alleged drug boat (Video)\nDescription\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday reaffirmed his defense of the Pentagons deadly strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in September and committed to releasing video of the operation.\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nRead more: https://apnews.com\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home\n\nPrevious post\n\nBerhampore: MP Yusuf Pathan Visits Khadi Fair #Gallery\n\nCoimbatore: Thousand Lamps Lit on Noyyal River #Gallery\n\nMumbai: Celebrities Attend 25th ITA Awards #Gallery\n\nStockholm: Gyanesh Kumar Assumes Chairship of International IDEA Council #Gallery\n\nShashi Ranjan, Anu Ranjan, Rohit Roy, And Other Celebs For The ITA 25th Awards IITS In Juhu In Mumbai – Gallery\n\nJaideep Ahlawat, Agastya Nanda, And Other Celebs For The ITA 25th Awards IITS In Juhu In Mumbai – Gallery\n\nNoida: Unity Cup 2025 Wheelchair Basketball Tournament #Gallery\n\nThiruvananthapuram: Kerala Raj Bhavan Renamed Lok Bhavan #Gallery\n\nLudhiana: Women Visit Chrysanthemum Show #Gallery\n\nMalda: Mamata Banerjee Leads Rally Against SIR #Gallery\n\nTop Stories\n\nCEC Gyanesh Kumar highlights India’s democratic legacy as he accepts Chairship of IDEA 2026\n\nIndia assumes Chairship of International IDEA for 2026\n\nIndian Navy ‘guardian of the seas and beacon of humanity’, says President Murmu\n\n‘Are you unhappy with Punjab CM?’: Union Minister’s riposte to Raghav Chadha on water issue\n\nIndia to update base year for national accounts data to 2022–23: FM Sitharaman\n\n1,232 IndiGo flights cancelled, DGCA steps in to sort out issues (Lead)\n\nInnovation and efficiency key to strengthening India’s manufacturing sector: Piyush Goyal\n\nImran Khan-Asim Munir tussle highlights structural problems within Pakistan\n\nIndiGo forced to cancel scores of flights due to crew shortage\n\nPM Modi asks Bengal BJP MPs to intensify outreach on Special Intensive Revision of voters’ list\n\nArchives Archives\n\nCopyright 2025 | AGK FIRE INC|\nTerms of Service / Privacy Policy | Contact Us","summary":"President Donald Trump on Wednesday reaffirmed his defense of the Pentagons deadly strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in September and committed to releasing video of the operation.

Trump hired her to do: Clean out a failed education bureaucracy, return power to states and parents, and put students” first, applauds Jorge Martinez at RealClearPolitics. Yet Sen. Elizabeth Warren is “attacking her” — “defending Washington’s control at all costs.” Bad move: “America has spent more per student than any major developed nation,” yet test scores keep falling. “Entire generations of students have cycled through a system in which the federal government grows larger, costs rise, and academic performance declines.” Warren’s “panic” suggests “someone is finally challenging the system” that politicians like her “rely on for power.” But if “we care about our children’s futures,” we should defend McMahon’s mission, “not tear it down for political points.”\n\nHealth watch: AI Is Erasing Hearing Loss\n\n“Thanks to artificial intelligence, the subjective experience of people with profound hearing loss is increasingly indistinguishable from those with normal hearing,” cheers Richard Vigilante at The Free Press. “The Mayo Clinic surgeon I spoke with before my operation” (cochlear implants) “had a little screen about the size of an iPhone hanging from his neck that transcribed his speech into text accurately and immediately.” “Thanks to artificial intelligence, the live captions from Google Meet, Zoom, or FaceTime” are equally good. Plus, tools like Xander eyeglasses can carry a speech-to-text “transcription in the lenses so you can maintain eye contact and catch every spoken word.” “In a world in which speech to text is immediate, nearly flawless, and increasingly universal, my hearing, after degenerating for 30 years, gets better every day.”\n\nMedia watch: Sing Along With Democrats\n\n“The world was ending four weeks ago,” cracks The Wall Street Journal’s Matthew Hennessey, or so Democrats and the media were singing “from the shutdown hymnal” — “Democrats call the tune and the media plays it.” Their new song: “Pete Hegseth Will Be Tried at the Hague.” “Seemingly out of nowhere” Dems warned service members “not to follow what they called ‘unlawful orders.’” And, “serendipity be blessed,” The Washington Post then ran a laughably-sourced story “all but accusing Mr. Hegseth of issuing illegal orders to kill helpless, probably surrendering drug runners hanging off the sides of burning boats.” Yet President Trump “is immune to the narrative-shaping power” of the “Democratic-media” narrative, and his supporters aren’t “dummies,” either.\n\nTech beat: Freedom Wins The AI Race\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts China will “win the AI race,” unless the United States “wins developers worldwide.” But Huang’s “lament” raises “a deeper question,” explains Derek Levine at The Hill: “What kind of system ultimately breeds innovation — one built on control, or one built on freedom?” “Modern Chinese industrial policy” is aims to “absorb, replicate, indigenize,” but Bejing’s system stifles “innovation” and “curiosity.” In America, the ability “to defy authority is democracy’s creative engine.” The AI race “is about which system can nurture human imagination and foster innovation.” And while “speed matters” in winning this race, “freedom remains the true engine of genius.”\n\nConservative: Why Dems Are Losing Latinos\n\n“Hispanics are no longer a reliable Democratic constituency” as evidenced by Donald Trump winning 48% “of the Hispanic vote, just three points shy of Kamala Harris’s share,” hails Daniel Di Martino at City Journal. “Even more striking, he carried 51 percent of foreign-born, naturalized Hispanic immigrants.” It’s further proof that “Hispanics are assimilating into America’s mainstream” and, in a sense, “becoming white, in both culture and identification.” This oft-repeated “story of American integration” happened with Italians who “were considered racially suspect” before disappearing “into the white majority.” Notably, rising “English proficiency is another measure of Hispanic assimilation.” And good news for all: “Hispanics’ cultural assimilation means that in the future, ethnic identity will matter less — and America will be more united.” \n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“Education Secretary Linda McMahon is doing exactly what President Donald J.
