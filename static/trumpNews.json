Its two-car system climbs steep hills and serves both locals and the city's millions of annual tourists. Each tram can hold up to 42 passengers and is operated by Carris, Lisbon's public transport operator, as per the New York Times.\nAlso Read | Vladimir Putin Invites North Korea's Kim Jong Un to Russia As They Meet in Beijing.\nIn a statement, Tiago Augusto, head of Portugal's health ministry, noted that the victims included both Portuguese citizens and foreigners, though nationalities had yet to be confirmed.

Nine others, five of them in critical condition, were taken to São Jose Hospital, officials said, as reported by the New York Times.\nLisbon's Mayor Carlos Moedas posted on social media, calling it a \"tragic moment\" for the city.\n\"Lisbon is in mourning. This is a tragic moment for the city.

The victims have been taken to the hospital. I deeply regret the lives lost and all the suffering caused. At this moment, what matters is to act: support the families, assist the injured and ensure all necessary support to the authorities on the ground,\" he stated in a post on X. He further declared \"three days of Municipal Mourning\" for the victims in the incident. \"The Lisbon City Council decrees three days of Municipal Mourning for the victims of the tragic accident at the Gloria Funicular.

Russian and North Korean despots laugh, joke, hug and even enjoy a breakfast date together during trip to Beijing","text":"Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un were spotted laughing, joking, hugging, and even enjoying breakfast together during a trip to Beijing.\n\nRare images captured candid moments between the two leaders as they sat across the table from one another and shared a car ride - underscoring a personal warmth and growing closeness in Russia–North Korea ties.\n\nSuited an in seemingly good spirits - Putin and Jong Un were seen sharing moments of laughter and embrace on their visit to Beijing to attend China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.\n\nChina's growing military might was shown off by President Xi Jinping yesterday during a massive parade in Beijing.\n\nPresident Xi welcomed Kim with a long handshake, then moved on to greet Putin, before all three walked together to watch the parade. \n\nThis was the first time all three leaders have been seen in public together. Later, Putin and Kim met, with Putin praising Pyongyang for sending soldiers to fight in Ukraine.\n\nPutin and Kim joined 24 other dignitaries who had been invited to the Beijing parade.\n\nSouth Korea's President Lee Jae Myung did get an invitation, but turned it down. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who met President Xi earlier this week - was also not present.\n\nXi boasted China was an ‘unstoppable’ force – and warned the world faces a choice of ‘peace or war’.\n\nOn Monday, Xi had delivered his vision for a new global security and economic order during a summit of nations that included Russia and India.\n\nIn a barely veiled attack on Donald Trump’s America, he said: ‘We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics.’\n\nMr Trump responded to yesterday’s parade in Tiananmen Square – and to the show of unity by America’s rivals on the world stage – by accusing them of ‘conspiring’ against the US.\n\nIn a Truth Social post he asked Xi to ‘please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America’.\n\nHe then raised the support that the US gave to China in the Second World War in its fight against the occupying Japanese, questioning whether Xi ‘will mention the massive amount of support and “blood” that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader.’\n\nHe signed off: ‘May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration.’\n\nThe Kremlin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, responded to Mr Trump’s message saying: ‘No one has been conspiring, no one has been plotting anything, no conspiracies.\n\n‘None of these three leaders had such a thought.’\n\nHe added: ‘Everyone understands the role played by the United States, the current administration of President Trump and President Trump personally in the current international situation.’\n\nThe parade included tanks, regiments of troops and the very latest Chinese hardware such as missiles, lasers and drones.\n\nKicking off the parade, Xi cautioned that the world was still ‘faced with a choice of peace or war’ before saying that China was ‘unstoppable.’\n\nThe demonstration that China is rapidly catching up with America’s lead in military technology was the climax of a summit of world leaders who have ties to the autocrats in Beijing and Moscow and was billed as an alternative to the US-led global system.\n\nLasers, drones and missiles... Beijing's hi-tech kit is catching up with the US\n\nChina's huge show of hardware yesterday was designed to prove that it is catching up with America’s military.\n\nThe US and the West have long held an advantage over China thanks to their technology and the quality of their weapons – but Beijing’s show of force reveals even that is now under threat.\n\nOn show were intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear strike to Western cities and hypersonic missiles capable of striking ships at sea.\n\nThere were also new tanks, aircraft, undersea drones and combat robots. The demonstration was meant to tell the world that China could one day be ready to break the West’s long-held grip on international order.\n\nBut behind the columns of tanks and rows of soldiers marching in perfect unison, a small white box sitting on a transporter could be the clearest sign of China’s advances in weapons technology.\n\nThe LY-1 is a shipborne laser weapon – an addition to a powerful navy which already has more warships than the US Navy. Its specific capabilities remain unknown but experts fear it can burn through electronics and blind enemy sensors, and so bring down drones, missiles and planes.\n\nThe US and Britain have made strides towards developing their own directed-energy weapons.\n\nBritain’s is known as DragonFire. It is part of a £5 billion investment and trials have shown it can lock on to and destroy drones.\n\nEach ‘shot’ costs just a few pounds – far cheaper than firing a missile. The UK plans to mount DragonFire on Royal Navy ships from 2027. A land version is also being tested on Army vehicles.\n\nAmerica, meanwhile, has poured billions into laser research and remains ahead of both Britain and China – for now. One of its most advanced is the Helios system that can burn drones out of the sky and blind enemy sensors.\n\nXi Jinping and Vladimir Putin were overheard at the parade discussing how to prolong life.\n\nPutin suggested eternal life could be achievable as a result of innovations in biotechnology, according to remarks caught on a hot mic by Chinese state TV. Neither Xi nor Putin has expressed any intention of stepping down.\n\nAt one point Putin’s translator said: ‘With the development of biotechnology, organs can be continuously transplanted, and people can live younger and younger, and even achieve immortality.’","summary":"Images captured candid moments between the two leaders as they sat across the table from one another and shared a car ride -underscoring a growing closeness in Russia-North Korea ties.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15063829/Vlad-Kims-love-Russian-North-Korean-despots-laugh-joke-hug-enjoy-breakfast-date-trip-Beijing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/01/101818123-0-image-m-62_1756945195749.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:43:35","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor,Kevin Adjei-Darko,Taryn Pedler","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor","Kevin Adjei-Darko","Taryn Pedler"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.252},{"id":357197480,"title":"Don Trump Jr. called his father on Labor Day weekend 'to make sure' he was alive amid death rumors","text":"Donald Trump Jr. revealed that he called his father over Labor Day weekend 'to make sure' he was still alive amid viral internet rumors he had died.\n\nThe 47-year-old told Newsmax he saw the trending posts on X about his father's disappearance and decided it was time for a check in.\n\n'I called my father over the weekend and be like, \"Hey, just want to make sure you're not dead,\"' Don Jr. said. \n\n'\"I know my daughter's playing golf with you as we speak, you know, I keep reading about it on Twitter, so I just want to make sure.\" [He] didn't even know what I was talking about.'\n\nTrump, 79, had a low-key weekend with no formal engagements over Labor Day weekend, sparking theories online that his health had deteriorated.\n\nSome even went so far as to say he was already dead.\n\nThe rumors were exacerbated when Trump allegedly shared an old golfing picture as 'proof of life.'\n\nTrump shared a Truth Social post of himself pictured alongside former NFL coach Jon Gruden.\n\n'Great playing Golf with Jon Gruden — A really nice guy, and true character!' the president wrote in a caption accompanying the picture of Gruden in a Trump cap and purple polo.\n\nTrump had been seen at a distance at his National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Saturday, but Gruden couldn't be placed there at the same time. \n\nIn fact, it was understood he traveled to the golf course with his granddaughter, Kai. Don Jr. has now confirmed that Trump and Kai were golfing together. \n\nFueling speculation further, social media sleuths dug up a photo of Gruden taken the week earlier on August 23 at the same golf course wearing the exact same outfit.\n\nCritics questioned whether it was likely he had returned to Virginia a week later wearing the same outfit for another round of golf.\n\nShortly after the old picture of Gruden went viral, footage taken by AP of Trump on the same day emerged in which he was wearing the same outfit as the one in the photo he claimed was from this weekend.\n\nTrump quelled the rumors himself with a press conference on Tuesday, during which he was asked about the mix up.\n\nTrump dismissed speculation by saying he was 'very active this Labor Day.' \n\n'Really? I didn't see that,' Trump initially said when a Fox News reporter referred to the rumors. 'It's sort of crazy, but last week, I did numerous news conferences, all successful.'\n\nTrump noted that the media was not holding him to the same standard as former President Joe Biden. \n\n'I didn't do any [public events] for two days, and they said there must be something wrong with him. Biden would not do them for months, you wouldn't see him, and nobody ever said there was ever anything wrong with him, and we know he wasn't in the greatest of shape,' Trump said. \n\nTrump was spotted with what appeared to be bruising on his hand, but his physician has reassured the public that it is nothing of concern.\n\nInstead, he said that was a result of 'irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin 'as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention' treatment.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed in July that the president was suffering from 'chronic venous insufficiency,' that was causing 'mild swelling' in his lower legs.\n\nThe president's physician revealed in a memo that his condition was 'a benign and common condition' in elderly people but that there was no evidence of any serious arterial disease.","summary":"Don Trump Jr. saw the trending posts on X about his father's disappearance and decided it was time for a check in.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15063707/Donald-Trump-Jr-death-rumors-golfing-kai-hoax.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/00/101817273-0-image-m-157_1756942927909.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:39:10","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":357197168,"title":"Eric Adams not dropping out of NYC mayoral race after reports Trump officials may offer him place in administration","text":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams has confirmed he’s not dropping out of the mayoral race following reports Trump administration officials were considering offering him a federal position.\n\nThe mayoral election in November will be a competitive one with Adams and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo running as independents and state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, as the Democratic nominee.\n\nThere has been speculation Trump may intervene in the mayor’s race to thwart Mamdani, the frontrunner who has sparred with the president over his administration’s policies, such as its immigration crackdown.\n\nLast month, The New York Times reported Trump took a call with Cuomo as he considered inserting himself into the race. A spokesman for Cuomo and Trump had denied recently speaking to each other when the reporting came out.\n\nOn Wednesday, the NYT reported, citing unnamed sources, Trump advisers have their eye on Adams for a possible role in the administration to help clear the crowded campaign field to give Cuomo a better chance of beating Mamdani.\n\nThe Associated Press also reported, citing a person familiar with the matter, Trump intermediaries had reached out to Adams’ associates to discuss whether he would consider taking a federal job over another potential term as mayor.\n\nTodd Shapiro, a spokesperson for Adams’ campaign, told The Independent the mayor “has had no discussions with, nor has he met with, President Donald Trump regarding the mayoral race.\n\n“The Mayor is fully committed to winning this election, with millions of New Yorkers preparing to cast their votes.”\n\nShapiro made Adams’ intentions even clearer in a statement published by the AP: “He is not dropping out of the race.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nWhether people believe Adams may leave the race for a position in the White House or for another reason, gamblers bet that he will drop out.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Polymarket, a prediction market, says there is a 75 percent chance Adams will drop out of the race based on the bets people are making. On Tuesday, the odds were just under 30 percent.\n\nBut the odds went down to 63 percent as of Wednesday night.\n\nMamdani became the frontrunner in the mayor’s race after beating Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June by 7.7 percentage points.\n\nIn a poll conducted by American Pulse Research & Polling from August 14 to 19, Mamdani led his closest competitor, Cuomo, by about 12 percentage points, 36.9 to 24.6 percent, among New York City likely voters.\n\nCurtis Sliwa, a Republican, got 16.8 percent of voter support, and Adams trailed with 11.4 percent.\n\nMamdani responded to the reports about the Trump administration potentially getting involved in the mayoral race at a Wednesday news conference, calling it “an affront to democracy.”\n\nCuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi previously told The Independent of Trump’s reported interest in the former governor, “it seems clear that President Trump would either prefer Mr. Mamdani, whom he refers to as a 'commie,’ because he believes Mamdani would serve as a political boon to Republicans nationwide in the midterms, symbolizing what he sees as the Democratic Party’s extremism.”\n\n“Alternatively, he may favor Eric Adams, who is a wholly owned subsidiary of the President. And there is already a Republican in the race, who is the nominee of President Trump’s party,” he said.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/odds-eric-adams-dropping-nyc-205924377.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27yMhx7.sEqv0Lp9prLzNw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a54d6a1ab2b003f25b9762df871db4f1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:38:58","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":357197172,"title":"Trump flounders as he calls Epstein furor a ‘hoax’ while sex-abuse survivors bring Capitol to tears","text":"Has Donald Trump found the limit of his grip on MAGA world?\n\nCongress is back in Washington and the attention around the Jeffrey Epstein investigation is more intense than ever. After lawmakers went home for the August recess some Republican leaders were hopeful that the headlines which have given the president and his allies the most trouble of any issue in years were finally on their way out of the news cycle.\n\nInstead, members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform spent the summer month doggedly pursuing the issue and returned on Tuesday to publish what they said was the first batch of documents retrieved via subpoena from the Department of Justice. On Tuesday, the committee released more than 33,000 pages received from the DOJ, though only a small fraction contained new information.\n\nWednesday led to more problems for the president as a split-screen played out in close to real time across Washington. At the White House, seated next to the president of Poland, Trump declared that the Epstein issue was a “Democrat hoax” and likened it to conspiracies surrounding the John F. Kennedy assassination. Across town, lawmakers on Capitol Hill — including some of his close Republican allies — rallied with Epstein’s victims just a few feet from the steps of the Capitol.\n\nTheir message was clear: the issue is no hoax, nor is it going away any time soon.\n\nWednesday’s event near the Capitol steps drew hundreds of protesters, media, spectators and supporters and made it obvious that the furor around the administration’s handling of the investigation is not dissipating.\n\nAfter releasing a joint memo with the FBI regarding the investigation in July, the Justice Department stated that it would break a commitment to release evidence from the investigation and insisted that it had no evidence linking Epstein’s crimes to the numerous powerful men and institutions with whom he pursued friendships.\n\nThe agency’s declarations stunned and angered many younger Trump supporters who latched on to the issue through social media and other online content; Democrats were less shocked, but quickly jumped on the opportunity to call out the president for his administration’s reversal.\n\nSince then, the Justice Department has pursued a less direct strategy. The agency filed a long-shot request to make grand jury transcripts related to Epstein’s prosecution public; it was denied, with a judge calling the move a distraction. It complied with a Oversight panel subpoena, while dispatching Trump’s own former attorney to speak personally with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s imprisoned accomplice. Trump has since declined to reject the possibility of pardoning Maxwell, despite being repeatedly pressed on it.\n\nThe problem for Trump: there’s very little momentum in the news cycle working to push Jeffrey Epstein out of the headlines — and a lot more keeping the spotlight squarely on it. The salience of the issue among his MAGA base is now threatening to spiral out of control for the president. The first batch of the Oversight committee’s Epstein document dump, which contained documents that were largely previously-released, managed to slow but not halt the momentum among Republican House members.\n\nAlarm bells were clearly going off in the White House on Wednesday, when an unnamed White House spokesperson issued a statement outright threatening retribution against Republicans who break ranks and join a discharge petition that would force the Justice Department to release all of its files on the investigation.\n\n“Helping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThat tactic worked for Trump in July, when the White House bullied Republican holdouts into line and shepherded passage of the “big, beautiful bill” through the House. The president’s iron grip on the GOP is legendary at this point. And it makes the response Wednesday from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of his allies, all the more significant.\n\n“This isn’t a hostile act towards the administration. The hostile act has been against these women for so many years now, and the hostile act is covering up for Jeffrey Epstein and everyone else that’s been involved in this; and that’s the real hostile act,” she said. “I look forward to talking with President Trump about these women that I’ve met. I also encouraged him already this morning that he should have these women in the Oval Office. They deserve to be there.”\n\nWhile the discharge petition’s main Republican cosponsor Rep. Thomas Massie is no ally of Trump’s, the statement from Greene is just the tip of the iceberg as it pertains to the GOP’s hesitance to dismiss the Epstein issue.\n\nJust two more Republicans would be needed to sign on to Massie’s discharge petition for it to succeed; two others currently supporting the legislation include MAGA Reps. Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace. Their defiance is a sign of the issue’s potency, especially with younger voters.\n\nMace, also a survivor of sexual violence, left a hearing in tears on Tuesday as Epstein survivors recounted their experiences to lawmakers on the Oversight panel. She later said the testimony triggered a panic attack.\n\n“I feel the immense pain of how hard all victims are fighting for themselves because we know absolutely no one will fight for us. GOD BLESS ALL SURVIVORS,” wrote the congresswoman.\n\nMassie was fiery in his response, calling the White House statement “disgusting.” He, Greene, and the Epstein survivors who gathered this week on Capitol Hill have all signaled they’re ready to ratchet up the pressure on the White House and Speaker Mike Johnson until the petition gets the requisite votes.

We’re making sure folks are prepared and we’re ready to respond.”Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.Activists say they’ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city’s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.Trump signaled this week that he’s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn't given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.Trump's administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.The administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. His administration plans to appeal the California deployment ruling.Trump has often singled out Chicago and other Democrat-led cities. Recently, his administration started playing up the city’s daily crime log, including using shootings over Labor Day weekend as justification for sending in troops.“I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor,” Trump said Wednesday.He and Pritzker have traded barbs for days about the issue. Pritzker, a two-term governor and frequent Trump critic, has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential contender.“I can’t live in a fantasy land where I pretend Trump is not tearing this country apart for personal greed and power,” Pritzker posted Wednesday on X. At an event later in the day, he told reporters his office had not received any additional information from the federal government.There has been little outward support for Trump’s plans in Chicago, with only a handful of Republicans and conservative leaders saying they’d welcome the intervention.Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to the city's drop in crime, and asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead.Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.RELATED STORY | 'Unhinged': Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker responds to Trump threat to deploy National Guard to ChicagoChicago is home to a large and thriving Mexican community, and the threat of the troop deployment and immigration crackdown has put a damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations planned over the next two weeks.Organizers acknowledged the threat of immigration arrests might keep some people at home, but they’re boosting security measures and inviting more allies. It’s a similar tactic that activists tried for annual May Day protests, when fears about public gatherings were also high.Teresa Fraga, who is organizing an event in the city’s heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood, said the event has hired more security, lawyers and neighborhood patrols.“It’s a dark cloud that is hanging over our heads,” she said. “But we are planning a safe event.”Worries are also high in many of the city’s Black neighborhoods, where organizations have been busy advising residents about what their rights are should they interact with law enforcement.Dozens of Black churches plan to take part in “Resistance Sunday” this weekend, to disseminate information about legal rights during traffic stops and other encounters.“We need resources, not troops,” said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent civil rights activist. “We’re not interested in this charade of troops.”Johnson and other Black mayors have called Trump’s targeting of Democratic cities racist. And Trump has often used racist narratives about urban crime when talking about the unprecedented deployment of troops in the nation's capital.“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.RELATED STORY | Trump's use of National Guard during Los Angeles immigration protests is illegal, judge rulesChicago’s public school system suggested that families create phone trees to quickly share information and organize walk-to-school groups to “provide safety in numbers.”“We know that the potential of increased federal presence is creating anxiety and fear about safety at school and safety within the broad community,” Chicago Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents.Members of the Chicago Teachers Union planned to distribute materials at schools this week with tips on legal rights and creating a buddy system on the school commute.","summary":"Chicago community leaders forged ahead Wednesday with preparations for the influx of National Guard troops and immigration agents the city is expecting.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/chicago-prepares-for-an-influx-of-national-guard-troops-and-immigration-agents","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2cd7cc6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5040x2646+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2F5c%2Fe688e6a24d019bc8f3d2e952cea6%2Fap25246746907353.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:31:58","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.209},{"id":357199000,"title":"Mother of Texas girl allegedly killed by illegal immigrants backs Trump military crackdown on cartels","text":"EXCLUSIVE: The mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, a Houston girl allegedly killed by Venezuelan illegal immigrants last June, recently spoke out in support of U.S. military action against suspected Tren de Aragua (TdA) narco-terrorists. President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the U.S. military carried out a strike that killed 11 alleged TdA narco-terrorists on a drug boat in the southern Caribbean, demonstrating the administration's continued efforts to stop dangerous narcotics from reaching U.S. shores. \"Taking down their drug boat [Tuesday] shows real strength, and I pray they keep going until every last one of these monsters is off our streets and out of our hemisphere,\" Alexis Nungary said. TRUMP TOUTS US STRIKE AS MADURO SLAMS MILITARY ‘THREAT’ OFF VENEZUELA In a video produced by The American Border Story, a national initiative dedicated to exposing the human impact of America’s border crisis through storytelling and investigative reporting, Nungary shared the devastating story of tracking her daughter's phone to a skate park two minutes from their home. She described being met by officers and crime scene tape where Jocelyn’s body was discovered. \"There's already an officer walking in my direction before I even put my car in park,\" Nungary said. \"I run out, and I'm like, 'I'm looking for my daughter. [I] don't know where she is. … I've checked everywhere her phone shows it's here.' He kind of walked me away from the direction of where the tape was, and he was like, ‘Oh, this is something else. … but just keep your phone on you nearby.’\" Homicide detectives later confirmed they found her daughter's body. She had been sexually assaulted before her death. \"She left marks on them, she bit them, she left scratches,\" Nungary said. \"She had broken nails. She had their DNA under her nails. I think when she knew she wasn't going to make it out, she knew a way to help find them. It's sad that she had to do that, but it's a very courageous thing that she was able to do that at such a young age.\" MEN ACCUSED OF KILLING JOCELYN NUNGARAY BELIEVED TO BE VENEZUELAN GANG MEMBERS: SEARCH WARRANT Jocelyn's suspected killers were later identified as Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and Franklin Jose Pena Ramos, 26, both illegal Venezuelan nationals. Pena was previously accused of raping an American woman vacationing in Costa Rica, and the pair were allegedly associated with TdA, a foreign terrorist organization. Pena had TdA-related tattoos, and Martinez-Rangel's social media account used emojis associated with the gang, according to search warrants obtained by affiliate FOX 26 Houston. The men were caught by U.S. Border Patrol near El Paso, Texas, in early 2024, but released on their own recognizance under the Biden administration into the U.S. The murder happened just months after their illegal entry. FAMILY MEMBER OF INFANTS BURNED ALIVE BY CARTEL THANKS TRUMP FOR CRACKDOWN: ‘HOPEFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME’ Following Jocelyn's death, Nungary said both men were arrested on capital murder charges in El Paso and quickly released back into the community. They have since been placed under immigration detainers as prosecutors seek the death penalty. \"The two men who took my daughter's life away from her were not from here,\" she said. \"They were released because of Biden's catch and release policy. They weren't held until their detention immigration hearing. They were let go. … She should have never encountered them. She should have been able to make it home. She didn't ask for her life to be ripped away from her.\" Nungary added she believes unvetted immigrants have a different agenda than those who migrate to the country legally. \"It's been kind of scary to know the kind of world we live in as Americans … I still have another child. I was scared to know what could have happened to him if we hadn't had [President] Donald Trump come into presidency,\" she said. \"Just knowing the fact that he's made so much change in so little time, it's incredible. It's incredible to know that there is somebody that wants to make a difference and that wants us to genuinely be safe as citizens.\" After learning Jocelyn was an animal lover, Trump signed an executive order in March renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge the \"Jocelyn Nungaray National Refuge,\" in her honor. \"I just have an amount of serenity that reaches my soul when I'm there, and I just know that she's fully there in spirit,\" Nungary said. \"If she was here, she would probably ask to go camping there and say that's her second home every weekend. She would want to go there every weekend and put up a tent. … She had a very big heart.\" HOUSE UNANIMOUSLY VOTES TO MEMORIALIZE TEXAS GIRL ALLEGEDLY SLAIN BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Nungary said every time the Trump administration fights back against TdA and other narco-terrorist cartels, she feels a sense of justice for Jocelyn. \"My daughter was murdered by these same violent criminals who should never have been here in the first place,\" she wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Unlike Biden, who let known illegals back onto our streets, this administration is taking action to stop them.\" Nicole Kiprilov, executive director of The American Border Story, added the Venezuelans should never have been on American soil. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"[Tuesday's] strike against the Tren de Aragua drug boat shows that this administration is finally taking the fight directly to the cartels, unlike [former President] Joe Biden, who allowed these known illegals to walk free,\" Kiprilov said. \"At TABS, we’re committed to making sure families like Jocelyn’s are never forgotten, and that Americans see what real leadership against these narco-terrorists looks like.\"","summary":"Alexis Nungaray, mother of murdered 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, supports military action against Venezuelan cartels after her daughter was allegedly killed by suspected TdA members.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/mother-texas-girl-allegedly-killed-illegal-immigrants-backs-trump-military-crackdown-cartels","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/alexis-nungaray.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378313858112","publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:28:50","author":"Alexandra Koch","authors":["Alexandra Koch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":357198286,"title":"World News | India-Germany Agree on Gratis Visas for Student Exchanges, Eye New Indo-Pacific Mechanism","text":"New Delhi [India], September 4 (ANI): India and Germany have agreed on gratis visas for short-term school and college visits to promote student exchanges and education ties, as well as establishing a new bilateral consultation mechanism on the Indo-Pacific region, the Ministry of External Affairs stated on Wednesday.

The incarceration of Todd and Julie Chrisley on bank fraud and tax evasion charges in 2023, the arrest of Chase Chrisley in January, and other assorted scandals have seriously transformed the family's cheery public image. But Lifetime's new series, The Chrisleys: Back to Reality delves into yet another dark corner of Chrisley lore: the bitter falling out between Lindsie Chrisley and the rest of the family.\n\n \"I still don't know how to put into words the betrayal that we have experienced,\" patriarch Todd said in a phone call from prison at the beginning of Back to Reality's third episode, which aired Tuesday. \"God is saying to you, 'Forgive those who trespass against you, lift your brother and sister up.' And I struggle with that every day.\"\n\n Lindsie is Todd's daughter with ex Teresa Terry, along with brother Kyle, while their half-siblings Savannah, Chase, and Grayson are Todd's children with Julie Chrisley, one of the centerpieces of the Chrisley media universe. Kyle only regularly appeared on the first season of Chrisley Knows Best, but Lindsie was a staple of the first five seasons.\n\n \"I know for a fact there was resentment that my parents were together and we had our nuclear family, and they just didn't feel like they were a part of it,\" Savannah said of Lindsie and Kyle. Creeping resentment eventually morphed into full-on bad blood, when it was revealed that Lindsie cooperated in the FBI's investigation into Todd and Julie. Savannah said she \"will never forget seeing my dad's face\" when the family learned at Todd and Julie's sentencing hearing just how involved Lindsie was.\n\n \"My dad broke,\" she said.\n\n \"Growing up the way we grew up with a blended family, unfortunately, we were not this perfect, kumbaya, like, no,\" Savannah shared. According to Todd and Julie's eldest, Lindsie was however \"the perfect child\" growing up, and though she \"started acting out\" in her teens, the real turning point came during the filming of Chrisley Knows Best season 5.\n\n Savannah claimed that one day, Lindsie sought out Chloe Chrisley, Kyle's daughter whom Todd and Julie legally adopted in 2016, to collaborate on a social media post, despite their parents' wishes. \"Lindsie just started going absolutely insane - yelling, screaming, calling my mom every name under the sun... At that point, that's when Lindsie's time on the show came to an end.\"\n\n From 2018 onward, the relationship between the core Chrisley family and Kyle and Lindsie strained to the point of breaking. Meanwhile, the state of Tennessee had been building a financial crimes case against Todd and Julie that was eventually transferred to the jurisdiction of the FBI. The \"seed\" of that case, according to Savannah, was \"planted\" by Todd's former partner in his real estate business, Mark Braddock, who allegedly grew vengeful toward the family after Todd let him go in 2012.\n\n Charges of bank fraud and tax evasion were formally brought against Todd and Julie in 2019. That news rocked the family hard, but it would prove to only be the first domino in a long, dramatic chain soon to topple over.\n\n Lindsie appeared on an episode of Dr. Phil in Oct. 2019, just months after Todd and Julie's indictment. During the interview, Lindsie gave her side of the Chloe altercation story, in which she alleged that Julie \"shoved me at my neck,\" which is what really severed the relationship. She also claimed that Todd accused her of having an affair with a tax official, and denied incendiary allegations that she had secretly been in communication with Braddock for a year and a half regarding the case against her father and stepmother.\n\n Looking back at the interview, Todd remarked in a phone call from prison, \"We never talked to her again, after that incident. After that, we had no more involvement with her until after the indictment.\" Savannah shared. \"In my opinion, she was hell bent on bringing it all down. And boy did she succeed - or at least, she thinks she did.\"\n\n Todd and Julie appeared in court in June 2022, and were ultimately found guilty. Their sentencing hearing was scheduled for that November, but the month before, Todd finally reunited his daughters on a special crossover episode of their podcasts. \"I thought it was B.S. from the very beginning,\" Savannah snarked, \"But I can understand how he felt - like he lost children of his.\"\n\n Though it seemed the extended Chrisley clan was reunifying just in case Todd and Julie were to face prison time, another bombshell dropped during the sentencing hearing.\n\n \"During that sentencing hearing, I will never forget seeing my dad's face,\" Savannah recalled. \"We learned that before they tried to reconcile, Lindsie wrote to the FBI. The moment the prosecutors read the letter, my dad broke. Tears were falling on the table... It was the most heartbreaking thing in the entire world. Not only was he looking at federal prison, for potentially the rest of his life, but also his child helped put him there.\"\n\n Todd shared his own memory of the moment: \"To hear a letter read by the prosecution, that my daughter had sent to an FBI agent - I think I knew that the bridge had been burned and there was no way back. My heart just sank. I was in a state of shock.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Lindsie had admitted to engaging in communications with the FBI in court months earlier. Though she had reconciled with Todd and Julie by the time of that court appearance, in 2020, Lindsie allegedly requested a restraining order against Todd, whom she accused of harassing her. She also claimed that Todd, with the help of Chase Chrisley, attempted to extort her into cooperation by threatening to release a sex tape she was featured in.\n\n Entertainment Weekly did not immediately hear back from Lindsie Chrisley for comment.\n\n She recanted those earlier claims during her 2022 court appearance, even claiming to have learned the tape didn't exist, but wrote to the FBI once more before the sentencing trial. Todd claimed on Back to Reality that Lindsie sais she was forced into cooperation, and thought it was for Todd and Julie's benefit, but the Chrisleys viewed this revelation as a final nail in the coffin.\n\n \"I can't even tell you how your heart hurts and how you feel betrayed by the people you trusted,\" said Nanny Faye, Todd's mother. Grayson, Todd and Julie's youngest, remarked, \"I think we have to be very careful about who we let in our life, because we've had own family members betray us.\"\n\n For his own part, Todd noted, \"I look at where I am in life, and the irony of the situation is that I have one daughter that participated in sending me to prison, and one daughter who has worked tirelessly to bring her mama and daddy home.\"\n\n In May, Todd and Julie Chrisley were granted pardons by President Donald Trump, and have since been released from prison.\n\n Though Lindsie reacted positively to her dad and stepmom's release, she noted on a March episode of her The Southern Tea podcast, \"I have not seen my dad in quite some time and I have had no contact. And that's all I'm going to say for that.\"\n\n In July, she dropped the Chrisley from her name on Instagram, taking the last name Landsman from her current partner, David Landsman, noting her maiden name \"became very problematic with me being associated in any capacity.\"\n\n New episodes of The Chrisleys: Back to Reality air Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Lifetime through Sept. 16.","summary":"\"I still don't know how to put into words the betrayal that we have experienced,\" Todd Chrisley said on Lifetime's new series, \"The Chrisleys: Back to Reality.\"","url":"https://ew.com/savannah-chrisley-breaks-down-family-falling-out-with-half-sister-lindsie-11803121","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/EjRh38go2a_jBBIgirhLV2zWv34=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/savannah-chrisley-todd-chrisley-julie-chrisley-chase-chrisley-lindsie-chrisley-2016-NBCUniversal-Summer-Press-Day-030625-d1997ef2b0d54b2d92fb0cb4926","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:26:15","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":357198172,"title":"Trump plans to ask Supreme Court to toss E. Jean Carroll's $5 million abuse and defamation verdict","text":"NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump will soon ask the Supreme Court to throw out a jury's finding in a civil lawsuit that he sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s and later defamed her, his lawyers said in a recent court filing.\n\nTrump's lawyers previewed the move as they asked the high court to extend its deadline for challenging the $5 million verdict from Sept. 10 to Nov. 11. The president \"intends to seek review\" of \"significant issues\" arising from the trial and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' subsequent decisions upholding the verdict, his lawyers said.\n\nCarroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said Wednesday: \"We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review by the United States Supreme Court.\"\n\nCarroll testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury retailer across the street from Trump Tower. The jury also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll when he made comments in October 2022 denying her allegation.\n\nA three-judge appellate panel upheld the verdict last December, rejecting Trump's claims that trial Judge Lewis A. Kaplan's decisions spoiled the trial, including by allowing two other Trump sexual abuse accusers to testify. The women said Trump committed similar acts against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denied all three women's allegations.\n\nIn June, 2nd Circuit judges denied Trump's petition for the full appellate court to take up the case. That left Trump with two options: accept the result and allow Carroll to collect the judgment, which he'd previously paid into escrow, or fight on in Supreme Court, whose conservative majority - including three of his own appointees - could be more open to considering his challenge.\n\nTrump skipped the 2023 trial but testified briefly at a follow-up defamation trial last year that ended with a jury ordering him to pay Carroll an additional $83.3 million. The second trial resulted from comments then-President Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir.\n\nJudge Kaplan presided over both trials and instructed the second jury to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Judge Kaplan and Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, are not related.\n\nIn their deadline-related filing, Trump's lawyers said Kaplan compounded his \"significant errors\" at first trial by \"improperly preventing\" Trump from contesting the first jury's finding that he had sexually abused Carroll, leading to an \"unjust judgment of $83.3 million.\"\n\nThe 2nd Circuit heard arguments in June in Trump's appeal of that verdict but has not ruled.\n\nTrump has had recent success fending off costly civil judgments. Last month, a New York appeals court threw out Trump's staggering penalty in a state civil fraud lawsuit.\n\nThe Associated Press does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.","summary":"Trump \"intends to seek review\" of \"significant issues\" arising from the trial and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' subsequent decisions upholding the abuse and defamation verdict.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/donald-trump-plans-ask-supreme-court-toss-jean-carrolls-5-million-abuse-defamation-verdict/17734271/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17734221_090325-ap-wabc-e-jean-carroll-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:20:51","author":"Michael R.

All 298 people on board - including 38 Australians - were killed when it was shot out of the sky by a Russian missile. \n\nAlbanese would not be drawn into criticising his best friend, instead insisting at a press conference that he was 'not meeting' with dictators such as Putin or Jong Un. \n\nBut his refusal to criticise Andrews has prompted a flurry of criticism suggesting that the Prime Minister has allowed an old friendship to cloud his better judgement. \n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley told Sky News that 'old flat mates stick together'.\n\nIn extraordinary footage, former Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was filmed being greeted by President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan on a red carpet procession before the military parade kicked off. Both men shook hands for several seconds as they appeared to exchange warm pleasantries\n\nAndrews (pictured, back right) posed for official pictures just metres away from world leaders including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (front right), Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev (middle) and Russian leader Vladimir Putin (front left) \n\nThe Prime Minister would not be drawn into criticising his best friend, instead insisting at a press conference that he was 'not meeting' with dictators such as Putin or Jong Un\n\n'Anthony Albanese needs to demonstrate some moral clarity here and actually call out Daniel Andrews for being just a few feet away from dictators and despots,' she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Liberal Senator Jane Hume slammed Andrews for displaying an 'extraordinary lack of judgement', claiming she was 'astounded' Albanese had not called him to warn him off attending. \n\n'It was clearly a sign of military might, a display of military might quite threatening in its intentions. And there he was, standing alongside some of the most unsavoury characters from right around the world,' Senator Hume told Today.\n\n'If he had diplomatic support, I think that that would be an issue. Whether he went there as a private citizen or not. I just think that shows a lack of judgement.'\n\nAndrews has been criticised even by those on the left.\n\nFormer Labor Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said Andrews had gone a 'bridge too far'. \n\n'I respect Dan, I respect Bob, but I think they've just gone the next level,' Palaszczuk told Sky News.\n\n'Go there for a holiday, do your business talks, but there's no need to attend this military parade.'\n\nThe subsequent 70-minute parade was an extraordinary display of Chinese military might, with a reported 10,000 goose-stepping troops from the People's Liberation Army taking part\n\nAs he drove past, Xi would say 'hello comrades' to which the thousands of troops would bark back in unison: 'Hello chairman'\n\n'Trade is one thing, and tourism, but military parades, I would honestly stop and think seriously about that.'\n\nAlbanese and Andrews are old friends and once shared a flat together in Canberra in the late 1990s. \n\nThe Australian ambassador to China, Scott Dewar, was not in attendance. \n\nFormer NSW Premier Bob Carr was invited but thought better of attending the parade, preferring instead to speak to speak to Chinese officials on the sidelines. \n\nCarr defended the trip, claiming it was important to maintain ties with China when US President Donald Trump was upending the world order. \n\n'Meanwhile Trump’s 50 per cent tariffs produce an India-China rapprochement, undercutting the Quad & devaluing its next meeting (in Delhi) which Trump is not now attending. In this chaos why shouldn’t we talk with China?', he posted on X.\n\n'Disagreeing where necessary, building cooperation where it’s needed.'\n\nMeanwhile, Trump fired a shot of his own at the gathered dictators, writing on Truth Social: 'Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un, as you conspire against The United States of America.' \n\nThe subsequent 70-minute parade was an extraordinary display of Chinese military might, with a reported 10,000 goose-stepping troops from the People's Liberation Army taking part.\n\nPresident Xi was led on an open-top car ride along the 4km-long Chang'an Avenue near Tiananmen Square, past the thousands of troops and military hardware. \n\nThis included hypersonic missiles, stealth fighter jets, tanks and other weapons in China's massive military arsenal. \n\nAs he drove past, Xi would say 'hello comrades' to which the thousands of troops would bark back in unison: 'Hello chairman'.\n\nAnthony AlbaneseDaniel AndrewsChina\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPersonal reason Albo won't slam Andrews for photo with Kim Jong-Un and dictator whose forces killed 38 Aussies\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Andrews and Xi shook hands for several seconds as both men appeared to exchange warm pleasantries on the red carpet.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15063711/Anthony-Albanese-dictator-Dan-Andrews-China.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/00/101817903-0-image-m-25_1756942941333.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 00:19:48","author":"Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":357197428,"title":"Hegseth: More Venezuelan Drug Traffickers Will ‘Meet the Same Consequences’","text":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated that more Venezuelan narcotraffickers would ‘meet the same outcome’ as the 11 Tren de Aragua members who were killed on Tuesday during a U.S. military operation.\n\nHegseth appeared on Fox & Friends on Wednesday morning to issue the threat. \n\n‘We have assets airborne, in the water, and on ships, because this mission is critically important to us, and it doesn’t conclude with just this strike,’ stated Hegseth.\n\n‘Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated Narco terrorist will face the same fate,’ he added. \n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the U.S. strike on Tuesday from the Oval Office.\n\nDuring his Wednesday meeting with the Polish president, he was asked why he decided to use deadly force against the traffickers. \n\n‘There was a massive amount of drugs on the boat; we have recordings of their discussions.

Nevertheless, it quickly entered the panoply of books, with Vice President JD Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy” among them, that provided insight into a new era of not only American but Western politics.\n\nThe book’s success, even featured on former President Barack Obama’s list of recommended books, catapulted Deneen to one of the most prominent academic figures in the West and his ideas to the forefront of America’s most contentious political debates.\n\nMuch has happened in the years since “Why Liberalism Failed” was published. Liberalism managed to claw back power, first through undermining Trump’s agenda at almost every turn from within, and then through the empty vessel of former President Joe Biden. Yet, Trump was able to mount a surprising return in 2024 with a new resolve to dismantle the forces of liberalism concentrated in Washington, D.C. Deneen joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss what future lies beyond liberalism.\n\n”Liberalism failed not because it failed to live up to itself, but it failed because it succeeded,” Deneen told The Daily Signal. “In other words, the kind of ideological underpinnings of liberalism, which advances the idea of human life lived in accordance with the sovereign. The choices of the sovereign will must be thoroughly liberated, must be liberated from all bonds, arbitrary limitations, limitations of other human beings, limitations of nature, limitations of inheritance.”\n\n“As long as liberalism coexisted with sort of non-liberal institutions and practices and religion and family life and culture, liberalism was not fully itself,” Deneen explained. “And in that way, I think when people are sort of nostalgic for the good old days of liberalism, they’re thinking of a kind of a mixed, a certain kind of mixed regime in a way—liberalism that was not itself thoroughly liberal. But as the kind of ideological commitments and logic of liberalism unfolded, and certainly accelerated, in the last, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, I think we see the kind of catastrophe that it leaves in its wake.”\n\nLiberalism’s failure has led us to a new era of politics that Deneen described as postliberal. \n\n“If my thesis is correct, that liberalism has failed, we are already in a postliberal future,” Deneen explained. “I think that’s true. I think we are in a postliberal future.”\n\n”What we’re past is once all of those pre-liberal inheritances had been purified,” Deneen continued, “then the clear sort of inhumanity of living in that condition and the sort of unbearableness of that for especially our ordinary common man who simply was not thriving under conditions of globalization and borderlessness and sexual anarchy and communal devastation and family breakdown that, you know, politically, that meant it was over.”\n\n“Postliberalism, then, is what do we do now that we are living in the wreckage of kind of the high watermark of liberalism,” Deneen said. \n\nJust as the epoch of modernity is paired with its intellectual orientation modernism, the postliberal era has a cultural and political ethos of its own called postliberalism.\n\nWhile its critics have treated postliberalism as a monolith, Deneen argues it is not. Of the three main strains of postliberalism Deneen broadly identifies, two could ultimately prove extremely dangerous. The first is the Left’s response to postliberalism: a continuation and consolidation of wokeism. The second is a response from the Right, which Deneen described as “essentially a kind of, ‘We will gain liberty through tyranny or through a kind of despotism.’”\n\n“It’s an odd thing to say, ‘We need authoritarianism to ensure liberty because ordinary people don’t want to be free,’” Deneen added.\n\nThe third kind of postliberalism is the kind Deneen is advocating for. “The alternative that I would propose would be a very distinct form of postliberal, which would be to reject the libertarianism of the Left and the libertarianism of the Right. And so I really think that the coming years are going to be a contestation of these three kinds of postliberalisms,” Deneen said. “Stay tuned.”","summary":"This is a preview of this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Don’t miss politics editor Bradley Devlin’s interview with Professor Patrick Deneen by turning...

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday (September 3, 2025) opened up about US President Donald Trump’s role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and what was discussed between him and Trump during the Alaska talks.Speaking at a press conference after concluding his China visit, Putin praised Trump for having a 'sincere desire to find a solution' to the Ukraine conflict. On being asked about his discussions with Trump during the Alaska summit, Putin said, ‘We spoke in broken English’—small talk for a 30-second ride. Putin’s remarks came weeks after he met the US president in Alaska, which concluded without any agreement on ending the Russia-Ukraine war.During his interaction with reporters, he also mentioned US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who has travelled to Russia several times in 2025 to try to strike a deal over Ukraine. He said that the critiques of Witkoff simply dislike Trump's position: “The war party always attacks the peace party.”Putin on ‘security guarantees’ to UkraineOn being asked about Washington’s efforts and the speculations now that a formula exists of “security guarantees in exchange for territories,” the Russian president said, “No, we have never raised the issue in this way, nor have we ever discussed it in such terms.”Live Events“Security guarantees are a natural necessity, as I often stress. We proceed from the fact that every country should have a security system, and Ukraine is no exception. But this is not connected to any swaps, especially those of territories,” he added.Putin on Trump’s Victory Day postWhile reacting to Trump’s Victory Day post, the Kremlin leader said that he has a sense of humor. This comes after Trump accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of conspiring against Washington with the leaders of Russia and North Korea.The remarks of the US president came as China hosted world leaders at its largest-ever Victory Day parade in Beijing on Wednesday - a showcase of China's military might. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un as you conspire against the United States of America.\"Trump-Putin Alaska TalksTrump, who had pledged confidently to bring about an end to the Russia-Ukraine war on his first day back in the White House, failed to secure an agreement from Putin to end the war. He fell short in his most significant move yet to stop the bloodshed, even after rolling out the red carpet for the man who started it.“There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” the U.S. president said, after Putin claimed they had hammered out an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” Trump had said he would call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders to brief them on the talks.The US president had offered Putin both a carrot and a stick, issuing threats of punishing economic sanctions on Russia while also extending a warm welcome at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, but he appeared to walk away without any concrete progress on ending the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onPutin Trump Russia UkraineputinUkraineRussia\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Putin dismissed the notion of trading security guarantees for territories and reacted to Trump's Victory Day post with humor. Despite Trump's efforts and threats of sanctions, the Alaska summit, held in August 2025, concluded without a resolution to the ongoing war.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/weeks-after-alaska-talks-putin-weighs-in-on-trumps-role-in-russia-ukraine-peace-efforts-heres-what-he-said/articleshow/123687731.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-123687732,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-89248,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:55:08","author":"Divyadeep Singh","authors":["Divyadeep Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":357190656,"title":"Vice President JD Vance visits families, victims of Annunciation shooting","text":"Vice President JD Vance met privately on Wednesday with the parents of the two children killed last week at a school Mass in Minneapolis, offering words of support but steering clear of the developing political fight over tougher gun laws. \n\nAccompanied by his wife, second lady Usha Vance, the vice president visited the sanctuary at Annunciation Church. Before entering the church, the Vances laid bouquets at a memorial outside Annunciation and paused to read chalk messages on the steps.\n\nThe two children killed were 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski; 21 other people were injured, mostly children. \n\nFletcher’s and Harper’s names were written in big block letters near where the Vances laid flowers.

They killed him with his wife and children; they erased them all. No one is left,” Sabreen al-Mabhuh, a displaced Palestinian, told Al Jazeera.\n\nIsraeli grenades have also ignited tents at schools sheltering displaced families in Sheikh Radwan, Reuters reported. “Sheikh Radwan is being burned upside-down,” resident Zakeya Sami said. “If the takeover of Gaza City isn’t stopped, we might die. We won’t forgive anyone who watches this and does nothing.”\n\nGaza’s media office says Israel has detonated at least 100 explosive-laden robots in Gaza City over the past three weeks to destroy entire residential blocks and neighbourhoods. About 1,100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza City alone during Israel’s assault there since August 13.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, described the situation as apocalyptic. “It feels endless and all-consuming … entire neighbourhoods are being erased block by block,” he said. “People are losing everything they’ve built over decades. For many, this feels like a living nightmare.”\n\nHamas ready to accept a comprehensive ceasefire\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Hamas reiterated its readiness to accept a comprehensive Gaza ceasefire and release of all Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The group’s remarks come shortly after United States President Donald Trump called on Hamas to release the captives still held in Gaza. About 48 captives are believed to be still in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nHamas slammed Israel for committing “horrific war crimes” with a strike on the al-Jarisi family home in northern Gaza City, which killed at least 10, calling it part of a systematic campaign to destroy Palestinian life.\n\nThe call came as Gaza’s Health Ministry reported six more deaths from “famine and malnutrition” in the past 24 hours, including a child. It said 367 Palestinians, 131 of them children, have died from hunger-related causes during Israel’s blockade, which continues to severely limit the entry of food and aid.\n\nThe Israeli operation to seize Gaza City will likely displace one million Palestinians, with most of the enclave’s 2.3 million people displaced multiple times. A spokesperson for UN chief Antonio Guterres on Wednesday said that more than 82,000 new cases of forced displacement were recorded in Gaza between August 14 and 31, including 30,000 people forced from north to south.\n\nUNICEF has warned that 132,000 children under five are at risk of dying from acute malnutrition by mid-2026, adding up to over 320,000 Palestinian children facing severe hunger. “With famine at risk of spreading, children urgently need a mass influx of humanitarian aid – including specialised nutrition products,” the agency said on X.\n\nThe Integrated Food Security Phase Classification confirmed in August that famine conditions had gripped northern Gaza and were rapidly spreading south. Aid workers say the total Israeli blockade has turned basic survival into a daily struggle.\n\nAbdullah Al-Arian, an associate professor at Georgetown University in Qatar, said Israel’s scorched-earth offensive shows it is waging genocide with “total impunity”. He noted that Palestinians are refusing evacuation orders due to exhaustion from repeated displacements and the absence of safe zones, which Israeli forces have systematically bombed.\n\nGrowing global outrage\n\nIsrael has rejected Hamas’s latest offer to end the Gaza war. In a statement, the Prime Minister’s Office reiterated Israel’s stance that “the war can end immediately on the conditions set by the cabinet”, which include the release of all the Israeli captives being held in Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas.\n\nHamas has agreed to ceasefire proposals presented by the mediators, but it has refused to disarm until the Palestinian state is established as part of the so-called two-state solution. Qatar, which has mediated in the conflict, said that Israel has yet to agree to its latest ceasefire proposal, which was accepted by Hamas last month.\n\nIsrael’s campaign is drawing mounting international backlash. Several European countries, including France, Britain, Belgium, Canada and Australia, are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly later this month.\n\nSpain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez slammed Europe’s response to the war on Wednesday as a “failure” that has damaged its credibility. “We can’t last longer if we want to be taken seriously on crises like Ukraine,” he said. Sanchez was the first European leader to describe Israel’s actions in Gaza as a genocide.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister John Swinney announced his government will block funding to arms companies supplying Israel. “We will pause new awards of public money to arms companies whose products are linked to countries committing genocide. That will include Israel,” he said, urging London to suspend its trade agreement with Israel.\n\nThe UAE also issued a stark warning, saying Israel’s potential annexation of the occupied West Bank would cross a “red line” and undermine the Abraham Accords. “Our position has not changed since 2020: We support a Palestinian state,” said Lana Nusseibeh, a senior UAE diplomat.\n\nThis came as Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich unveiled a plan for Israel to annex nearly all of the occupied West Bank, urging Prime Minister Netanyahu to endorse it.\n\nMeanwhile, Utrecht University in the Netherlands announced an academic boycott of Israeli institutions over “genocidal policies” in Gaza. Rector Wilco Hazeleger said the move reflects a moral obligation. “We will not start new collaborations with Israeli parties. A boycott is in place until further notice,” he said.","summary":"Hamas says it is ready to accept a comprehensive Gaza ceasefire but Israel continues its offensive to seize Gaza City.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/3/hamas-calls-for-un-action-as-israel-escalates-brutal-bombardment-of-gaza?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gaza-1756929364.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:49:10","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":357190242,"title":"Trump unlawfully cancelled Harvard's research grants, U.S. judge rules","text":"A federal judge on Wednesday (September 3, 2025) ruled that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration unlawfully terminated about $2.2 billion in grants awarded to Harvard University and can no longer cut off research funding to the prestigious Ivy League school.\n\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston marked a major legal victory for Harvard as it seeks to cut a deal that could bring an end to the White House's multi-front conflict with the nation's oldest and richest university.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts-based school became a central focus of the administration's broad campaign to leverage federal funding to force change at U.S. universities, which Mr. Trump says are gripped by antisemitic and \"radical left\" ideologies.\n\nAlso Read | Trump administration refers Harvard to Justice Department in civil rights probe\n\nAmong the earliest actions the administration took against Harvard was to cancel hundreds of grants awarded to university researchers on the grounds that the school failed to do enough to address harassment of Jewish students on its campus.\n\nHarvard sued, arguing the Trump administration was retaliating against it in violation of its free-speech rights after it refused to meet officials' demands that it cede control over who it hires and who it teaches.\n\nJudge Burroughs, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said the Republican President was right to combat antisemitism and that Harvard was \"wrong to tolerate hateful behaviour as long as it did.\"\n\nAlso Read | Trump vs Harvard: Harvard’s challenge to Trump administration could test limits of government power\n\nBut she said fighting antisemitism was not the administration's true aim and that officials wanted to pressure Harvard to accede to its demands in violation of its free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nJudge Burroughs said it was the job of courts to safeguard academic freedom and \"ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.\"\n\nShe barred the administration from terminating or freezing any additional federal funding to Harvard and blocked it from continuing to withhold payment on existing grants or refusing to award new funding to the school in the future.\n\nAlso Read | Harvard loses another $450 million in grants in escalating battle with Trump administration\n\nHarvard and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe decision came a week after Mr. Trump during an August 26 Cabinet meeting renewed his call for Harvard to settle with the administration and pay \"nothing less than $500 million,\" saying the school had \"been very bad.\"\n\nThree other Ivy League schools have made deals with the administration, including Columbia University, which in July agreed to pay $220 million to restore federal research money that had been denied because of allegations the university allowed antisemitism to fester on campus.\n\nCOMMENT | ‘David Harvard’ versus ‘Goliath Trump’\n\nAs with Columbia, the Trump administration took actions against Harvard related to the pro-Palestinian protest movement that roiled its campus and other universities in the wake of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nHarvard has said it has taken steps to ensure its campus is welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students, who it acknowledges experienced \"vicious and reprehensible\" treatment following the onset of Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe administration's decision to cancel grants was one of many actions it has taken against Harvard. It has also sought to bar international students from attending the school; threatened Harvard's accreditation status; and opened the door to cutting off more funds by finding it violated federal civil rights law.\n\nJudge Burroughs in a separate case has already barred the administration from halting Harvard's ability to host international students, who comprise about a quarter of the school's student body.","summary":"The judge said Mr. Trump was right to combat antisemitism and that Harvard was “wrong to tolerate hateful behaviour as long as it did” but fighting antisemitism was not the administration’s true aim and that officials wanted to pressure Harvard to accede to its demands in violation of its free-speech rights under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-unlawfully-cancelled-harvards-research-grants-us-judge-rules/article70009936.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/uq2vsq/article70009937.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-03T214901Z_1696006953_RC24RFA2MU3L_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:49:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":357196576,"title":"Epstein victims compiling their own list of sex abusers: ‘We know the names’","text":"Victims of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein said on Wednesday they were compiling a confidential list of his associates who abused underage girls.\nUS President Donald Trump, a one-time close friend of the deceased financier, sought meanwhile to dampen the enduring political furore over the Epstein case.\n“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president,” he said.\nTrump’s comments came as eight of Epstein’s victims held an emotional news conference at the US Capitol, where some of them spoke publicly for the first time about the sexual abuse they suffered.\nSome of the women were as young as 14 when introduced to Epstein.\n“We were just kids,” said Marina Lacerda, who said she was paid US$300 to give “an older guy” a massage at his New York mansion. “It went from a dream job to the worst nightmare,” said Lacerda, who was “Minor Victim 1” in Epstein’s federal indictment.\n\nThe women urged the Justice Department to release all of the Epstein investigation files and for Congress to pass a bill forcing their publication.\n“There is no hoax.

We’re making sure folks are prepared and we’re ready to respond.” Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.\nActivists say they’ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city’s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.\n Trump’s plans for Chicago Trump signaled this week that he’s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn’t given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.\nTrump’s administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.\nThe administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. His administration plans to appeal the California deployment ruling.\nTrump has often singled out Chicago and other Democrat-led cities. Recently, his administration started playing up the city’s daily crime log, including using shootings over Labor Day weekend as justification for sending in troops.\n“I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor,” Trump said Wednesday.\nHe and Pritzker have traded barbs for days about the issue. Pritzker, a two-term governor and frequent Trump critic, has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential contender.\n“I can’t live in a fantasy land where I pretend Trump is not tearing this country apart for personal greed and power,” Pritzker posted Wednesday on X. At an event later in the day, he told reporters his office had not received any additional information from the federal government.\nThere has been little outward support for Trump’s plans in Chicago, with only a handful of Republicans and conservative leaders saying they’d welcome the intervention.\nJohnson and Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to the city’s drop in crime, and asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead.\nEchoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.\n A damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations Chicago is home to a large and thriving Mexican community, and the threat of the troop deployment and immigration crackdown has put a damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations planned over the next two weeks.\nOrganizers acknowledged the threat of immigration arrests might keep some people at home, but they’re boosting security measures and inviting more allies. It’s a similar tactic that activists tried for annual May Day protests, when fears about public gatherings were also high.\nTeresa Fraga, who is organizing an event in the city’s heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood, said the event has hired more security, lawyers and neighborhood patrols.\n“It’s a dark cloud that is hanging over our heads,” she said. “But we are planning a safe event.” Worries in Black neighborhoods Worries are also high in many of the city’s Black neighborhoods, where organizations have been busy advising residents about what their rights are should they interact with law enforcement.\nDozens of Black churches plan to take part in “Resistance Sunday” this weekend, to disseminate information about legal rights during traffic stops and other encounters.\n“We need resources, not troops,” said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent civil rights activist. “We’re not interested in this charade of troops.” Johnson and other Black mayors have called Trump’s targeting of Democratic cities racist. And Trump has often used racist narratives about urban crime when talking about the unprecedented deployment of troops in the nation’s capital.\n“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.\n City schools prepare Chicago’s public school system suggested that families create phone trees to quickly share information and organize walk-to-school groups to “provide safety in numbers.” “We know that the potential of increased federal presence is creating anxiety and fear about safety at school and safety within the broad community,” Chicago Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents.\nMembers of the Chicago Teachers Union planned to distribute materials at schools this week with tips on legal rights and creating a buddy system on the school commute.

I’m running for re-election, I’m still doing that and I’m looking forward to getting re-elected.”\n\nLast year, Mr Adams was charged with a string of federal corruption and bribery charges – formally dropped under the direction of the Department of Justice – which argued the case was hindering Mr Adams’s ability to help Mr Trump with his immigration crackdown.\n\nHe did not enter the Democratic primary, but instead, he entered the race as an independent candidate. He is currently fourth in the polls, according to tracker RacetotheWH.\n\nWhile many Republicans view Mr Mamdani, who plans to introduce city-run supermarkets and free buses, as a useful figure to attack Left-wing policies, Mr Trump is said to be concerned about his home city, where he still owns several properties.\n\nWealthy New York businessmen and Mr Cuomo’s allies have also reportedly been considering offering Mr Adams a plum private sector job in return for him dropping out of the race.\n\nJohn Catsimatidis, a billionaire grocery and oil magnate in New York, told The New York Times he had spoken to Mr Trump on Sunday, who is “very concerned” about Mr Mamdani’s potential win.\n\nMr Mamdani on Wednesday said: “Today we have learned what New Yorkers long suspected, Andrew Cuomo is Donald Trump’s choice to be the next mayor of this city… This [news] is an affront to our democracy, an affront to what makes so many of us proud to be Americans – that we choose our own leaders.”\n\nMr Cuomo told a fundraiser in the Hamptons last month that he expected Mr Trump to wade into the election.\n\n“Trump himself, as well as top Republicans, will say the goal is to stop Mamdani. And you’ll be wasting your vote on Sliwa. So I feel good about that”, Mr Cuomo said, according to Politico.\n\nMr Sliwa, the Republican candidate and founder of New York’s Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol group, ran for mayor four years ago and lost to Mr Adams by almost 40 percentage points.\n\nHe has consistently said he has no plans to leave the race, saying the only way he would drop out is if he was hit by a truck.\n\nMr Sliwa said: “The White House has not contacted me, and I’m not interested in a job with the White House.\n\n“My focus is right here in New York. I’m the only candidate on a major party line who can defeat Mamdani, and I’m committed to carrying this fight through to Election Day. The people of New York City deserve a mayor who truly cares.”\n\nTodd Shapiro, the spokesperson for Mr Adams’s campaign, said: “Mayor Adams has not met with Donald Trump, don’t believe the noise.\n\n“He is not dropping out of the race.

Should America Be Concerned?  ","text":"Russia says it will help China grow its nuclear power capacity and overtake the U.S. as a leading producer of nuclear energy. \n\nThe U.S. currently has 94 nuclear reactors, the most in the world, followed by France and China, tied with 57 each, according to the Power Reactor Information System database. \n\nChina is working to expand the number of nuclear reactors it has and “has ambitious plans for the development of atomic energy,” Alexei Likhachev, Russia’s Rosatom chief, told Russian state television. \n\n“The task has been set to catch up and surpass the United States in installed capacity, which means reaching a capacity of more than 100 gigawatts,” Likhachev added. \n\nAsked if Russia plans to help China in this endeavor, he said, “We will help. We are already helping,” Reuters reports. \n\nRussia has already begun to help China build nuclear reactors, but there “is nothing inherently threatening about China expanding its commercial nuclear capacity, nor with Russia helping them,” Jack Spencer, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow in the Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment, tells The Daily Signal. \n\nBoth Russia and China “already have a military nuclear capability, and there is very little overlap between commercial and military nuclear anyway,” according to Spencer. \n\nRussia assisting China in the building of nuclear power will give China greater “access to abundant, reliable, and clean energy to fuel a growing, modern economy,” Spencer explains. “It gives them additional expertise and strengthens their commercial nuclear industrial base. That is the same benefit it provides Russia, and this is where it should be a wake-up call to the United States.” \n\nChina has made no secret of its desire to grow its global economic influence and has used its Belt and Road Initiative to do just that. China has been on the forefront of solar energy and production of electric vehicle batteries. \n\nSpencer, author of “Nuclear Revolution: Powering the Next Generation,” said nuclear energy is not only clean, but the answer to America’s own energy crisis, and other countries are increasingly seeing the appeal of nuclear energy. \n\n“Like China, countries around the world are looking for clean, reliable power, and nuclear is a serious competitor to provide it,” Spencer said. “As this demand grows, China and Russia will be well-positioned to provide it, and those collaborations can cement a century-long relationship. To counter this, the United States—with its friends and allies, like South Korea, who is itself a leader in commercial nuclear technology—must free its commercial nuclear industry to grow and became internationally competitive.” \n\nPresident Donald Trump has signed executive orders to advance the development of nuclear energy in the U.S. Trump’s executive order aims to eliminate unnecessary red tape that has slowed, and sometime nearly halted, development of new nuclear energy sites in the U.S. \n\nTrump’s executive orders on nuclear energy, Spencer says, must be “faithfully executed to liberate America’s nuclear industry from onerous and obsolete regulation.”","summary":"Russia says it will help China grow its nuclear power capacity and overtake the U.S. as a leading producer of nuclear energy.   The U.S....

His commitment is unwavering, and he proves that every single day.\"\n\nShe later clarified: \"This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.

The document, titled “Request for Department of Defense Assistance in Support of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Removal Operations at Naval Station Great Lakes, Illinois,” outlines the scope of the plan. The memo states that DHS is asking the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide infrastructure and logistical support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). Officials described the assistance as “critical to ensuring the efficient and secure handling of aliens” in accordance with federal regulations. Naval Station Great Lakes Identified as Operational Hub Naval Station Great Lakes, located near North Chicago, is highlighted in the memo as the central site due to its highway access, fuel supplies, and logistical infrastructure. DHS says the base will serve as the backbone for detention, processing, and removal operations in the Chicago Area of Responsibility. The request, according to the memo, was made under several new executive orders and proclamations signed by President Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. These include Executive Order 14167, which clarifies the military’s role in protecting US territorial integrity, and Presidential Proclamation 10886, declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Part of Broader Immigration and Security Push The move represents one of the first major steps by the Trump administration to use military infrastructure to bolster immigration enforcement. The DHS memo also cites Executive Order 14165, titled “Securing Our Borders,” as justification for deploying DoD facilities to ICE operations. Critics are likely to raise questions about the precedent of involving military assets in domestic immigration enforcement. Supporters, however, argue that the Chicago metropolitan area’s strategic location makes Naval Station Great Lakes an essential partner in national security.

The foundation’s endowment stood at $77.2 billion at the end of last year, and it spent $102.3 billion since its inception, giving $8 billion in 2024 alone. \n\nBill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, has used the foundation to forward many of the left-leaning elites’ preferred causes, such as contraception, global development, vaccines, and more. While many of his causes align with the Left, he has not embraced an outwardly activist image like Hungarian American billionaire George Soros, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, or Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss. \n\nThe Gates Foundation’s divorce from Arabella doesn’t just represent a loss of cash, but a loss of respectability and clout, as Arabella draws more scrutiny as an engine of leftist political activism.\n\nThe Gates-Arabella Divorce\n\nThe Gates Foundation had given $450 million to Arabella-linked entities over the past 16 years, but on June 24, the foundation’s CEO Mark Suzman sent an internal memo announcing the foundation would halt new grants to the nonprofits Arabella works with, The New York Times’ Theodore Schleifer reported last week.\n\nOther nonprofits are also seeking to distance themselves from Arabella in order to preserve ties with the Gates Foundation, sources told Schleifer. \n\nThe June 24 note doesn’t mention politics, instead emphasizing cutting out middlemen. \n\n“Teams are increasingly working directly with programmatic partners—organizations that are deeply embedded in the communities we serve and closely aligned with our mission,” it reads. “As we look ahead, this is a chance to build deeper, more durable relationships with those partners—and to reinforce the kind of legacy we want to leave behind.”\n\nWhile a source confirmed with Schleifer that the Gates Foundation has been pulling back from other intermediaries, Arabella has taken considerable heat in recent years. \n\nLast year, Capital Research Center President Scott Walter published a book on Arabella Advisors, highlighting how the for-profit company helps left-leaning nonprofits promote climate alarmism, abortion, and other causes. The book’s cover features Bill Gates.\n\nThat research proved foundational to my own book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government.” I testified before Congress alongside Walter on how Americans’ taxpayer dollars prop up leftist groups, including some nonprofits linked to Arabella.\n\nThis increased scrutiny—coupled with President Donald Trump’s orders cutting federal funding for climate alarmist causes; “diversity, equity, and inclusion” efforts; and gender ideology—may have combined to make Arabella too toxic for the Gates Foundation. Trump reportedly met with Gates in February and in August, but the White House declined to comment on whether the meetings had any impact on the foundation’s decision. The foundation did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment.\n\nWhat Is Arabella?\n\nArabella Advisors describes itself as a service provider, helping nonprofits pursue their missions. It supports independent nonprofit organizations that are tax exempt under Sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) of Internal Revenue Code, providing operational and administrative services such as compliance, accounting, human resources, and more.\n\nArabella Advisors provides these services to “seven sisters”: the New Venture Fund, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, the Hopewell Fund, the Windward Fund, the North Fund, the Telescope Fund, and the Impetus Fund. From 2006 to 2023, these organizations generated combined revenues of $9.2 billion and expenditures of $7.8 billion, according to tax returns analyzed by the Capital Research Center.\n\nSome of these nonprofits in turn act as “fiscal sponsors” for other projects.\n\nThis structure allows donors to give to an Arabella-linked nonprofit while cloaking which project their money supports. \n\nThe company also helps politically active nonprofits, like the 501(c)(4) Sixteen Thirty Fund, which contributes to political action committees. That nonprofit donated $97 million to super PACs seeking to elect Democrats or defeat Republicans since 2016, The New York Times reported. \n\nArabella Advisors had 425 employees as of 2023, according to an internal study.\n\nA Messy Separation\n\nNot only is the Gates Foundation blocking any new grants to Arabella-managed entities, but it has also begun to “pursue early exits” from ongoing grants, according to Schleifer.\n\nFurthermore, Concentric Equity Partners, a private equity firm that acquired Arabella in 2020, removed Arabella from its public “investments” page earlier this year.\n\n“We are proud of the work we’ve done and continue to do with the Gates Foundation and the impact we’ve helped support through their giving to the New Venture Fund,” an Arabella Advisors spokesperson told The Daily Signal. “Arabella Advisors provides operational support to hundreds of philanthropic clients pursuing social change. We do not have donors, make grants, or engage in political activity.”\n\nWhat Does This Mean for the Left’s Dark Money Network?\n\nIt remains unclear just how much the Gates Foundation’s withdrawal will affect Arabella Advisors. \n\n“Over the next five years, this decision will probably cost Arabella something close to $1 billion in revenues, at least on the nonprofit side,” the Capital Research Center’s investigative researcher Parker Thayer said in a recent podcast episode. He noted that most of the Gates Foundation’s contributions to the Arabella network were “nonpolitical.” He predicted that Arabella will survive the hit.\n\nAs I noted in my book, Arabella’s client nonprofits have contributed to many of the activist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration. \n\nThe New Venture Fund, for example, gave: \n\n$20,000 in 2022 to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which pushed the demonization of conservatives in federal law enforcement under President Joe Biden\n\n$50,000 in 2018 to the Human Rights Campaign, which pushed gender ideology in the Biden administration\n\n$800,000 between 2010 and 2016 to the National Wildlife Federation, which pushed climate alarmism in the Biden administration\n\n$2.97 million from 2012 to 2021 to the Center for American Progress, which pushed climate alarmism and open borders in the Biden administration\n\n$120,000 from 2014 to 2017 to Demos, which pushed a federal takeover of elections under Biden\n\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund gave $3.6 million to the climate alarmist Sierra Club from 2014 to 2022 and another $300,00 to the Center for American Progress from 2014 to 2021. \n\nThe Gates Foundation’s withdrawal may not directly impact these grants or similar forms of political activism, but it does deal a heavy blow to the structure Arabella Advisors provides, which in turn will weaken the Left’s dark money network overall.","summary":"This summer, the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation secretly began the process of withdrawing from its longstanding partnership with Arabella Advisors, a central hub of...

Rather, she pointed to ulterior motives.\n\n“A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically motivated assault on this country’s premier universities,” Burroughs wrote.\n\nTrump’s threats against Harvard have been at the centre of his administration’s efforts to exert greater control over higher education. But critics denounced those moves as attacks on academic freedom and freedom of expression.\n\nOther prestigious US universities have struck deals with the government amid threats to slash federal funding.\n\nColumbia University, for instance, agreed to pay the administration $220m and comply with Trump administration demands, including changes to its disciplinary practices and the hiring of a new provost to ensure “balanced” curricula.\n\nBrown University likewise cut a deal to restore its funding, including paying $50m to workforce training programmes in Rhode Island.\n\nThe University of Virginia, meanwhile, saw its president resign under threat of a Department of Justice investigation into its diversity programmes in June.\n\nTrump has targeted several schools, including Columbia, for their prominent role in the antiwar protests that emerged after Israel launched its war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that those protests promoted anti-Semitism and created an unsafe environment for Jewish students. Student activists, however, have rejected those assertions.\n\nThe activists also publicly questioned whether Trump’s actions were truly motivated by concerns about civil rights and anti-Semitism on campus.\n\nCritics have argued that the Trump administration used anti-Semitism as a pretext for gaining greater control over academic activity. They also point out that instances of harassment and even violence against pro-Palestine students have received little attention.\n\nIn April, as Harvard faced dramatic cuts to its federal funding, the Trump administration issued a list of a demands for the school to comply with.\n\nThose demands included changing its disciplinary practices, accepting an audit of its student admissions, and ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\n\nHarvard, however, resisted, becoming the first top university to do so. University President Alan Garber explained that he saw the demands as an infringement on academic freedom.\n\nTrump has since threatened to annul Harvard’s tax-exempt status and bar the school from admitting international students, among other things.\n\n“The worthy goal of combating unlawful anti-Semitic discrimination on campus cannot justify the flatly unlawful and unconstitutional means used by the Trump administration in this attempted hostile takeover, including demanding that Harvard impose ideological litmus tests and restrictive speech codes,” the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), a free speech organisation, said in a statement following Wednesday’s ruling.","summary":"The decision is a victory for the Ivy League university, which has been locked in a months-long feud with Trump.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/3/us-judge-rules-trump-unlawfully-cut-harvard-university-research-grants?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-21T174023Z_638325211_RC24RFA7EP7E_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-HARVARD-1753287312.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:14:13","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":357198318,"title":"Trump administration agrees to restore health websites and data","text":"By MIKE STOBBE\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Federal officials have agreed to restore health- and science-related webpages and data under to a lawsuit settlement with doctors groups and other organizations who sued.\n\nThe settlement was announced this week by the lead plaintiffs in the case, the Washington State Medical Association.\n\nSoon after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, federal health officials deleted or removed information on a range of topics including pregnancy risks, opioid-use disorder and the AIDS epidemic.

The judge placed the ruling on hold until noon on Sept. 12 to give the Trump administration time to appeal.\n\nThe notice to appeal was filed Wednesday with the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nBreyer’s ruling was based on an 1878 law that prevents federal troops from being used for regular law enforcement activities. The Trump administration has argued that the troops were there to protect federal officers and property and they were not performing local policing duties.\n\n“Once again, a rogue judge is trying to usurp the authority of the Commander-in-Chief to protect American cities from violence and destruction,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said in a message to City News Service on Tuesday. “President Trump saved Los Angeles, which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he stepped in. While far-left courts try to stop President Trump from carrying out his mandate to Make America Safe Again, the President is committed to protecting law-abiding citizens, and this will not be the final say on the issue.”\n\nThe ruling follows a lawsuit by California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a three-day trial in San Francisco federal court.\n\nTrump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in June.\n\nThe injunction applies only to the military in California, not nationally.

Andrew Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\n\n“Mayor Adams has not met with Donald Trump — don’t believe the noise. He is not dropping out of the race,” said his campaign spokesperson, Todd Shapiro.\n\nAfter Mamdani romped in the Democratic primary, which Adams had skipped, some pundits suggested that the 33-year-old democratic socialist might be unbeatable in the general election unless either Cuomo or Adams dropped out. \n\nDuring a series of television interviews where he had intended to talk about his efforts to fight crime in the city, Adams battled back against the idea that he might leave the race.\n\n“If there’s any changes in this race, I will announce that,” Adams told Fox 5. “Right now, we’re moving straight ahead to do — No. 1, serve this city as we’re currently doing, doing a darn good job. And we’re looking forward to reelection.”\n\nAfter spending Tuesday in Florida after his 65th birthday, Adams was asked whether he met with anyone from the Trump administration while there. The mayor would only say that he “met with several political figures,” including Miami’s Republican mayor. \n\n“I met with several political figures in Florida,” he told PIX11, saying the trip was to “deal with some personal issues.”\n\nAdams, in that interview, pushed back against questions about whether he would exit the contest but added: “I’ve never had a problem finding jobs as I transition.” \n\nLater Wednesday, Adams reiterated at an unrelated news conference that he's still running for reelection and didn't go to Florida to “seek a job,” adding that he often receives job offers from boards, educational institutions and others who have been impressed with what he’s done with the city.\n\nMamdani held a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday, calling the reports “an affront to democracy.”\n\n“We know that this city will decide its own future. And we know that it is New Yorkers that we will turn to to make that decision in November, not the White House in Washington, D.C.,\" he said. \n\nAdams had previously quit the Democratic primary after he was charged in a federal corruption case. The Trump administration successfully moved to drop the case so the mayor could better assist with the president's immigration agenda, which freed Adams up to run as an independent in the general election, but has not helped his image in the overwhelmingly Democratic city. \n\nA spokesperson for Cuomo, who is now running as an independent candidate, did not immediately return a request for comment.","summary":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams is insisting that he isn’t dropping his reelection campaign after reports he had been approached about potentially taking a job with the federal government","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/eric-adams-andrew-cuomo-zohran-mamdani-nyc-adams-b2819698.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/04/00/Election_2025_NYC_Mayor_Adams_53217.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:06:34","author":"Jake Offenhartz","authors":["Jake Offenhartz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":357185508,"title":"Trump administration executes extraordinary move to troll ex-Biden officials on LinkedIn","text":"Former White House staffers who worked for Democratic presidents now have President Donald Trump's face stamped on their LinkedIn pages. \n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration's social media team started using the official White House LinkedIn account for the first time in conjunction with the Labor Day holiday. \n\n'This Labor Day, we’re celebrating an America First comeback,' a post read. \n\nAs part of the rollout, the Trump folks changed the White House's picture to one of Trump's head. \n\nNow former President Barack Obama's official page even has Trump's face on it for the eight years the Democrat served as commander-in-chief.\n\nThis move was discovered by Jeremy Edwards, who had served as an assistant press secretary in President Joe Biden's White House. \n\nEdwards took to X to share his discovery. \n\n'The White House is now posting on LinkedIn and made their profile picture a picture of Trump's face, which means if you worked for the White House in the past, and it's on your profile, people see Trump's face,' the ex-Biden staffer wrote. \n\n'I guess that's what I get for using LinkedIn,' he added. \n\nHe shared a screengrab of his LinkedIn page that showed the Republican president staring back at him. \n\nEdwards' post got the attention of White House Communications Director Steven Cheung. \n\n'That's the whole point, dummy,' Cheung wrote. \n\n'Trolololololol,' the Trump staffer added. \n\nThe Biden aide punched back. \n\n'Thanks for the explainer, dumb***.

Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor,' Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nMamdani described himself as 'Donald Trump's worst nightmare' in the Democratic debate, noting he is 'a progressive, Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things I believe in.'\n\nTrump's concern about a Mamdani win is unique among Republicans in Washington. \n\nMany have considered that is extremely liberal policies will serve them well in the midterms, as they'll be able to draw comparisons between him and any other Democrat candidates.\n\nTrump, however, has a deep and storied connection to New York and has heard the complaints of locals who are concerned about Mamdani's stance on everything from immigration to real estate and raising taxes.","summary":"As it stands, Mamdani is leading election polling, followed by Cuomo, then Sliwa and Adams in fourth.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15063391/trump-mamdani-cuomo-new-york-city-mayor-Adams.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/03/23/101815091-0-image-a-140_1756939227987.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:06:10","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":357188370,"title":"'Come Visit Us': Putin Invites Kim Jong Un To Moscow During Warm Exchange In Beijing","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin extended a warm welcome to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday, inviting him to visit Moscow during their latest meeting in Beijing. The two leaders met on the sidelines of a large military parade held to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, a key event in China’s Victory Day celebrations, stated Reuters.\nTheir conversation, which lasted two-and-a-half hours, took place at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in the Chinese capital. As the meeting concluded, the leaders embraced before parting ways. Kim told Putin through an interpreter, “See you soon,” to which Putin responded, “We are waiting for you, come visit us.”\nThe Kremlin confirmed that both leaders travelled together from a reception to the meeting venue, highlighting the close nature of their diplomatic exchange.\nSince the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, North Korea has provided increasing support to Moscow. In their recent talks, Kim once again pledged full backing, telling Putin he would do “everything I can to assist.” Putin expressed gratitude for North Korea’s military support, specifically acknowledging the deployment of North Korean troops who assisted Russian forces in repelling a Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk border region.\nDuring the meeting, Kim emphasised that ties between the two nations have “significantly strengthened” since the signing of a strategic partnership agreement in June 2024 during a summit in Pyongyang.\nThe Beijing parade marked a major diplomatic moment for Kim, as it was his first time participating in a multilateral event during his 14-year rule. It was also the first public appearance of Kim, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping together, presenting a united front amid ongoing global tensions.\nDuring the parade, Xi Jinping warned that the world was standing at “a crossroads between peace and war,” while standing alongside Putin and Kim, a rare visual of trilateral alignment among China, Russia, and North Korea.\nMeanwhile, former US President Donald Trump expressed his concerns, stating he was “very disappointed” with Putin and suggesting that Xi, Putin, and Kim were “conspiring against the United States.” In response, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian state television, “No one has been conspiring, no one has been plotting anything, no conspiracies.”","summary":"Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, North Korea has provided increasing support to Moscow.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/come-visit-us-putin-invites-kim-jong-un-to-moscow-during-warm-exchange-in-beijing-ws-l-9547874.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Russian-President-Vladimir-Putin-left-and-North-Koreas-leader-Kim-Jong-Un-in-Pyongyang.-Kremlin-2025-08-6aceb185951f6fbbbfaed6ad29ec9d22.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:05:51","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.132},{"id":357188230,"title":"Six takeaways from Epstein survivors speaking out on Capitol Hill","text":"Marina Lacerda breaks her silence \n\nEpstein survivor Marina Lacerda broke her silence Wednesday in an interview with ABC ahead of the press conference, where she revealed details of her working for Epstein from the age of 14 to 17. She was identified as “Minor Victim 1” in Epstein’s 2019 indictment. \n\n“I never thought that I would find myself here; the only reason I am here is because it feels like the people who matter in this country finally care about what we have to say,” Lacerda said. \n\nLacerda recalled it as her “worst nightmare,” saying she dropped out of school before ninth grade because she was “needed at the house so often.” She does not remember many of the memories from this time period, explaining this causes her “so much fear and so much confusion,” as her therapist has said her “brain is trying to protect itself.”\n\n“They have documents with my name on them that were confiscated from Jeffrey Epstein’s house and could help me put the pieces of my own life back together,” Lacerda later said.\n\nThe survivors were not notified of Ghislaine Maxwell’s move from Florida to Texas\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein’s associates, was interviewed earlier this year by senior Department of Justice official Todd Blanche in Tallahassee, where she was being held in prison. She was later moved to a prison in Texas last month that is also deemed “low-security,” but only houses women.\n\nThe victims said they were not notified of Maxwell’s move ahead of time, with some of them finding out through social media, while also pushing back on the interview the DOJ conducted. \n\n“Her voice that day was the same voice that sent me off to a monster,” survivor Theresa Helm said of Maxwell’s interview with DOJ Attorney Todd Blanche. \n\n“Nothing can be believed from what she says, because she’s been charged with perjury. I myself could sit there and listen, and as I did, I sat there and listened to this woman’s voice lie, and there was no pushback from Todd Blanche, because does he even have the facts to be able to push back on her? We could sit there and push back. Why didn’t we get to attend that? Why … Why wasn’t even one of us consulted prior to that day in that meeting? And why on earth has she been moved from Florida, to her, it basically is prison spa. … Let’s be real. None of us were consulted,” Helm continued. \n\nMaxwell, 63, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in recruiting and sex trafficking minors. Her confidant, Epstein, killed himself in a New York prison in 2019, where he was facing charges for sex trafficking. \n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) pledges to read a possible list compiled by survivors on House floor \n\nSurvivor Lisa Phillips suggested Wednesday that a group of survivors has debated publishing a list of people involved in their case if the DOJ does not release more of the files. Other survivors expressed that they back this effort but shared the sentiment that the duty falls to the DOJ to release information like this, as many of them remain fearful of their safety. \n\nGreene, one of four Republicans who have signed the discharge petition, said she would read the women’s names. \n\n“In Jeffrey Epstein’s home and the places they went with him, they saw the most powerful people in the world in his pictures, and they saw him with those people,” Greene said. “Can you imagine how terrifying it would be to name names like that?” \n\nGreene expressed her understanding of the fear of sharing names, saying the people on the potential list could “sue these women into poverty and homelessness.” \n\n“It’s a scary thing to name names, but I will tell you, I’m not afraid to name names, and so if they want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the House floor and I’ll say every damn name that abused these women,” she continued. “I can do that for them.”\n\nThe demonstrators brought large crowd sizes\n\nWhere the survivors spoke outside the Capitol, Greene said it was the biggest crowd size of her time in Congress. \n\nA large crowd of people gathered around holding signs in support of the victims and pushing for the release of the files as the press conference began. Shortly after, Capitol Police moved the protesters over to the side as the victims began speaking to avoid crowding the driveway of the Capitol.\n\nThe Epstein files have been a heated nationwide issue this year, gaining a lot of traction in the last few months when the department announced after the July 4 weekend that it had no plans to make any further documents available and affirming that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges related to sex trafficking of minors.\n\nDemonstrators held signs that read “justice for survivors,” “unlock the Epstein files,” “victims’ voices matter,” and many more. \n\nThe survivors want more files to be released and the transparency bill to pass\n\nThe survivors repeatedly asked that Congress pass Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna’s (D-CA) bill, which would require a full release of the files while also providing victim protection as needed. Massie introduced a discharge petition on Tuesday to force a vote on their legislation to release the criminal files on deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“To be clear, the only motive for opposing this bill would be to conceal wrongdoing,” survivor Anouska De Georgiou said at the press conference. “You have a choice. Stand with the truth or with the lies that have protected predators for decades.”\n\nAt the conference’s closing, Massie made a call to action and urged people to call their members of Congress and urged them to get this bill passed. \n\n“My main call to action is to the people watching these live feeds that are going through these cameras right now: congressmen listen to you, light up their phones, burn down the phone lines here in Washington, DC,” Massie said in closing. \n\nThe so-called “discharge petition” must reach 218 signatures for it to force the speaker to call a vote on it. After the petition reaches that threshold, the member can call a vote after seven legislative days. Most, if not all, Democrats are expected to sign the petition, meaning only six Republicans would need to cross party lines to add their names. \n\nReps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Nancy Mace (R-SC), and Greene signed on to the discharge petition after Mace left a House Oversight Committee meeting with the victims in tears. Along with Massie, they are the only Republicans on the petition as of Wednesday. Massie and Khanna would need two more Republicans and all Democrats to reach the necessary signatures. \n\nTrump clapped back as the press conference took place \n\nWhile Massie and Khanna held the press conference for their transparency bill and discharge petition, President Donald Trump held his own press conference, repeating his previous comments calling the situation a “hoax.”\n\n“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends. You know, it reminds me a little of the Kennedy situation. We gave them everything over and over again, more and more and more, and nobody’s ever satisfied,” Trump told reporters Wednesday at White House, referring to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nTrump and the Justice Department have sought to move past the Epstein files since it became a major point of contingency for the administration in July.\n\n“From what I understand, I could check, but from what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given,” Trump said. “But it’s really a Democrat hoax because they’re trying to get people to talk about something that’s totally irrelevant to the success that we’ve had as a nation since I’ve been president.”\n\nOne victim addressed the president’s comments when asked by a reporter. \n\n“Mr. President Donald J. Trump, I am a registered Republican, not that that matters because this is not political; however, I cordially invite you to the Capitol to meet me in person so you can understand this is not a hoax,” she said. \n\nThese comments come as factions of the GOP have fought to dampen the heat from this issue since July. \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) added a new bill to the floor that passed just hours after the press conference on Wednesday, which would direct the House Oversight Committee to “continue its ongoing investigation” into Epstein, in leadership’s latest effort to appease the members of the GOP caucus on the issue. The Oversight Committee released 33,000 pages on Epstein, just hours after the discharge petition opened. Throughout the week, the White House has sent a political warning to Republicans who tried to join Massie’s effort.\n\nEven as the GOP works to dampen the issue, Democrats are not letting up. The top Senate Finance Democrat released a list of 58 individuals and entities with Epstein ties on Wednesday. \n\n“The Treasury records shine a light on how high-profile individuals paid Epstein staggering sums of money, which was then used to move women around the world or engage in dubious transactions indicative of money laundering,” Senate Finance ranking member Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote.\n\n“They also show how U.S. financial institutions turned a blind eye to the financing of Epstein’s criminal network, simply waiving the payments through without properly reporting them to U.S. authorities in a timely fashion, as required by law. Financial institutions, attorneys, and agents actively participated in Epstein’s illegal operations or were grossly negligent,” he continued.","summary":"A bipartisan event drew many eyes on Capitol

financier, who networked with celebrities and politicians alike, first began as early as 2005.\n\nBut interest has exploded in recent months even as US President Donald Trump urged the public to move on from what he deems a \"pretty boring\" saga.\n\nHere's a timeline of some of the key events leading up to the latest developments.\n\nTo quickly navigate to a specific event, use the links

search of his property finds photos of girls throughout the house.\n\nMultiple underage girls, many of them high school students, would later tell police Epstein hired them to give sexual massages.\n\nMay 2006: Investigation sent to a grand jury\n\nFlorida officials sign paperwork to charge Epstein with multiple counts of unlawful sex with a minor.\n\nBefore the charges can proceed, the county's top prosecutor, State Attorney Barry Krischer, sends the case to a grand jury.\n\nIn the US, a grand jury is a group of people who decide whether the prosecutor's evidence provides probable cause to issue a formal charge.\n\nJuly 2006: Epstein indicted on soliciting prostitution\n\nThat grand jury indicts Epstein on a single count of soliciting prostitution and he is arrested.\n\nThe minor charge leads to accusations of special treatment or bribery — claims that are later dismissed by Florida detectives.\n\nThe FBI also starts its investigation at this time.\n\nJune 2008: Epstein enters a federal plea deal\n\nEpstein pleads guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution and soliciting prostitution from someone under 18.\n\nHe's sentenced to 18 months in jail.\n\nAt this time, a controversial plea deal is made, meaning Epstein avoids federal charges that could have seen him face life in prison.\n\nHis sentence allows him to continue to work and he is released on probation after 13 months.\n\nAfter his release from jail, Epstein spends almost a decade facing allegations from multiple women who say they are his victims.\n\nJuly 2019: Epstein is arrested on sex trafficking charges\n\nEpstein is arrested in New York on sex trafficking charges involving allegations that date back to the early 2000s.\n\nHe is accused of paying underage girls for massages and molesting them at his homes in Florida and New York.\n\nEpstein pleads not guilty to the charges against him but is denied bail.\n\nThe charges are placed after renewed interest in the secret plea deal overseen by the labour secretary for the Trump administration at the time, Alexander Acosta.\n\nFollowing Epstein's New York arrest, Mr Acosta resigns from Mr Trump's administration.\n\nAugust 2019: Epstein found dead\n\nEpstein is found dead inside his New York cell.\n\nInvestigators say he killed himself.\n\nJuly 2020: Ghislaine Maxwell charged\n\nNew York prosecutors charge Ghislaine Maxwell — Epstein's longtime associate and girlfriend — with scouting girls for Epstein's abuse.\n\nPrevious lawsuits have accused Maxwell of being the \"highest-ranking employee\" in Epstein's trafficking ring, but this is the first time she has faced charges.\n\nDecember 2021: Jury convicts Ghislaine Maxwell\n\nAfter a month-long trial, Maxwell is convicted of sex trafficking, conspiracy and transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity.\n\nShe is found guilty of five out of six counts.\n\nFebruary 2022: Prince Andrew reaches settlement\n\nA civil settlement is finalised between Prince Andrew and a woman who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein to the royal as a teenager.\n\nVirginia Giuffre alleged she was trafficked for sex by Epstein to the

Epstein documents\n\nPreviously secret court documents in Epstein's case are unsealed by a US judge.\n\nThe 40-page release mostly consists of already public material — though there are mentions of Epstein's friendship with former US president Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.\n\nThe documents relate to Ms Giuffre's 2015 lawsuit against Epstein — which was settled in 2017.\n\nJune 2024: Trump suggests he'd declassify files\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump tells Fox News he'd consider declassifying the Epstein files — quickly making a caveat that there might be a lot of \"phony stuff\" in the files.\n\nFebruary 2025: Pam Bondi says client list on her desk\n\nAsked if the Justice Department would publish Epstein's client list, Attorney-General Pam Bondi says it's \"sitting on my desk right now to review\".\n\nThe White House later clarified Ms Bondi referred to documents relating to the Epstein case, not a \"client list\".\n\nFollowing this, MAGA influencers are given declassified binders relating to the case, but much of what they contain is public information.\n\nJune 2025: Elon Musk says Trump is 'in the Epstein files'\n\nFollowing a spectacular bromance break-up, billionaire Elon Musk says the president is featured in the files.\n\n\"Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" he wrote on X.\n\nMr Musk did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\nJuly 7, 2025: Justice Department says it won't make files public\n\nThe US Justice Department says it won't make any more files public, for fear of harming victims.\n\nIt also said that Epstein didn't maintain a client list and that there was no evidence of foul play in Epstein's death.\n\nJuly 17, 2025: Trump sues after Wall Street Journal story\n\nAmid renewed speculation, The Wall Street Journal reports Epstein received a sexually suggestive letter bearing Mr Trump's name.\n\nThe letter featured a drawing of a naked woman and the cryptic lines: \"May every day be another beautiful secret.\"\n\nThe president calls the letter \"false, malicious, and defamatory\".\n\nThe next day, Mr Trump sues the paper and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nOn the 17th, Mr Trump also makes a lengthy Truth Social post in which he calls his supporters \"weaklings\" for questioning the transparency of an injury into Epstein.\n\n\"Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker,\" he wrote online.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tells reporters that Mr Trump \"would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case\".\n\nJuly 18, 2025: Trump administration asks to unseal grand jury transcripts\n\nThe Trump administration asks a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's case.\n\nA Florida and New York judge have already rejected an attempt to unseal transcripts from both Epstein and Maxwell's cases.\n\nJuly 23 2025: House Oversight subcommittee votes to subpoena Justice Department\n\nA House Oversight subcommittee votes to subpoena the Justice Department for files.\n\nThe full committee also issues a subpoena for Maxwell to testify before committee officials in August.\n\nJuly 30 2025: Trump says Epstein 'stole' girls from Mar-a-Lago\n\nMr Trump says he fell out with Epstein because the financier \"stole\" young women, including Virginia Giuffre, from his Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nMs Giuffre alleged that she had been recruited by Maxwell while working at Mar-a-Lago as a high school student and had then been sexually abused from around 1999 to 2002 by Epstein, Maxwell and others.\n\n\"When I heard about it, I told him, I said, 'Listen, we don't want you taking our people,'\" Mr Trump tells reporters in his most expansive Epstein comments yet.\n\nIt came as lawyers for Maxwell said they were open to having their client cooperate with Congress, but wanted her to be guaranteed immunity by politicians first.\n\nAugust 5 2025:Maxwell opposes grand jury unsealing\n\nGhslaine Maxwell asks a Manhattan judge to deny the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury transcripts.\n\nHer lawyers argue public interest cannot \"justify a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy\" and her legal options remain \"viable\".\n\nIt comes as a top US House committee subpoenas Bill and Hillary Clinton and top-ranking law enforcement officials.\n\nMr Clinton was among a number of luminaries acquainted with Epstein. He has never been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims.\n\nAugust 14, 2025: Melania Trump sues Hunter Biden over 'defamatory' Epstein comments\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump demands Hunter Biden \"retract the false, defamatory, and lewd\" statements he made about her that referenced her relationship with Epstein.\n\nLawyers for Mrs Trump say if Mr Biden fails to retract his statements, she will seek more than $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) in damages.\n\nThe threat relates to Mr Biden's July 21 interview with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan, according to Mrs Trump's lawyer Alejandro Brito.\n\nMr Biden had alleged that \"Epstein introduced Melania to Trump.\"\n\nAugust 20, 2025: Justice Department agrees to give files to Congress\n\nThe Justice Department agrees to provide documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation to Congress.\n\nKentucky representative James Comer, the Republican committee chair, says it will take some time for officials to release the files in question.\n\nThe House committee's subpoena seeks all documents and communications from the case files of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nIt also demands records about communications between former US president Joe Biden's administration and the Justice Department regarding Epstein, as well as documents related to an earlier federal investigation into Epstein in Florida that resulted in a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nAugust 23, 2025: Justice officials release Maxwell interviews\n\nInterviews between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche are released.\n\nIn the interviews, Maxwell says she never saw Mr Trump \"in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"\n\n\"In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,\" she says, according to the transcript.\n\nShe added that she never heard Epstein or anyone else allude to Mr Trump doing \"anything inappropriate with masseuses\".\n\nShe also denies allegations concerning former president Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.\n\nAugust 26, 2025: House committee subpoenas Epstein's estate\n\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenas the estate of Epstein, demanding it provides Congress with documents including the book that was compiled with notes from friends for his 50th birthday.\n\nOther items include his last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact

everyone in America can see those documents,\" he said.\n\n\"It's going as quick as we can get them uploaded.\n\n\"We want those to be public as soon as possible.\"\n\nMr Comer also told NBC News that there was \"nothing new in the documents\" that he ordered to be released by the panel.","summary":"Interest in the 20-year-old case has exploded in recent months even as US President Donald Trump

TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said Rachel Reeves must target the rich to restore a sense of fairness to voters who are struggling to make ends meet. On Wednesday the Chancellor announced she would deliver a Budget on November 26, when she is widely expected to have to hike taxes to balance the books. Ms Reeves acknowledged the economy is \"not working well enough\" for ordinary people and promised a \"tight grip\" on spending amid market jitters over the state of the public finances. Pressure has been mounting on the Chancellor to impose a wealth tax, with senior Labour figures including former leader Lord Kinnock backing the call. The TUC proposes a package of taxes on wealth, banks and gambling companies to fund public services and rebuild Britain after years of Tory rule. The plans, which include a windfall tax on bank profits, a 2% wealth tax on those with assets over £10million and higher taxes on online gambling, prove popular with voters, according to a poll. More than 2 in 3 (68%) support the move, which rises to 78% among Labour voters considering switching to Reform UK. In an interview with the Mirror ahead of TUC Congress this weekend, Mr Nowak said: \"For far too many people, change still feels like a slogan, not a lived reality. \"We'll be pushing the Government to deliver the Employment Rights Bill in full and in advance of the Budget, if the choice is cutting public services or asking those with the broader shoulders to pay a fairer share, the public is very clear. \"The Government should have a grown up conversation about tax, crucially showing that with every decision they make they're on the side of working people.\" The top union leader said Labour had made good progress in getting a grip on NHS waiting lists, investing in public infrastructure, workers rights and stabilising the economy after years of Tory chaos. \"There's lots to be positive about, but the Government has to prove it's on the side of working people, and I think it can take a big step towards doing that in the Budget,\" he said. Voters want to see public services protected after funding was slashed by the Tories, he said. Labour must stick to its manifesto vow to protect working people from higher income tax, national insurance contributions and VAT, as well as protecting public services, he said. \"We need a tax system that reflects inequality, not just inequality in income but inequality in those who've got wealth and assets and those who haven't,\" he said. \"The fact is that those at the top have done really well over the last few years, despite the cost of living crisis where ordinary families have been battered. When you've got workers going out to work full time who are still reliant on food banks, it's hard to ask them to pay more tax unless you've explored every other opportunity.\" Mr Nowak said the plan could draw a clear dividing line with Reform, which has been soaring in the polls after spending the summer stoking anger over migration. He said: \" Nigel Farage says he's on the side of working people and then votes against legislation that would give millions of people rights at work. \"He says he stands up for the little man but we know he's on the same tax-cutting agenda for the super-rich that his mate Donald Trump is on in the White House.\" He added: \"Lots of people are disillusioned with our politics at the moment, people like Nigel Farage are sowing division, creating that sense that Britain is somehow broken. \"I'm more optimistic than that. I think this country's got a really bright future, but we really do need the Government to step up to the plate and deliver.” Ms Reeves is drawing up plans to make the economy work for ordinary people, with a focus on curbing inflation putting a strain on household budgets. She said: \"Britain’s economy isn’t broken. But I know it’s not working well enough for working people. Bills are too high, and you feel that you're putting more in, but you're getting less out. And that has to change.\" The later-than-expected Budget will let her prepare the ground for any tax rises, as well as announce a series of moves to drive up productivity - in the hope that the watchdog factors this into its forecasts. Ms Reeves wants to avoid a Budget on the scale of last year, which saw her unveil £40billion in tax rises to fund £70billion of public spending on things like schools and hospitals . But U-turns on cuts to winter fuel and disability benefits, and rising borrowing costs have left her scrambling to make up the shortfall. The scale of the challenge was laid bare by the NIESR economic think tank last month, which predicted Ms Reeves was on course for a £41billion shortfall on her self-imposed rule of balancing day-to-day spending with tax receipts in 2029-30. :: Hold Sway polled 5,024 British adults online for the TUC from 15-19 August.","summary":"TUC general secretary Paul Nowak has called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to slap wealth taxes on the richest Brits to prove Labour is on the side of ordinary people","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/rachel-reeves-must-bring-wealth-35843854","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35835816.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/4_Budget-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:01:00","author":"Lizzy Buchan","authors":["Lizzy Buchan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":357186204,"title":"Working people don’t think Keir Starmer is on their side, warns Labour’s biggest backer","text":"Sir Keir Starmer has failed to prove to working people in the UK that he is one of them and risks opening the door for Nigel Farage to seize power, the leader of Labour’s biggest backer has warned.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in Brighton next week, TUC general secretary Paul Nowak told The Independent that “for too many people, ‘change’ feels too much like a slogan and they don’t feel it in their pockets”.\n\nIt comes as the TUC is set to use the annual congress to push the agenda on wealth taxes to fill the spending gap in Rachel Reeves’ budget.\n\nNowak and his fellow trade unionists are championing a permanent hike in the banking surcharge to as much as 35 per cent; an annual wealth tax of 2 per cent on people with assets worth £10m or more; a gambling tax of 50 per cent on online casinos; and equalising capital gains tax to the level of taxation on wages to 36 per cent.\n\nThe left-wing agenda has privately been supported by some ministers, including beleaguered deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who proposed wealth taxes to avoid cuts in the spending review.\n\nAnd Nowak pointed to polling for the TUC that showed the moves would be popular among voters, including people considering switching from Labour to Reform.\n\nA Hold Sway poll of 5,024 British adults from 15 to 19 August found that a rise in capital gains taxes was backed by 51 per cent overall, rising to 57 per cent among Labour voters from the 2024 election now leaning to Reform.\n\nA tax on the profits of banks and other financial institutions has 66 per cent support, rising to 73 per cent among Labour voters switching to Reform.\n\nA 2 per cent annual wealth tax paid by people with assets worth more than £10m has 68 per cent support, increasing to 75 per cent among Labour voters from 2024 now leaning to Reform.\n\nNowak admitted that he would be “surprised” if Reeves takes all their suggestions straight away even though a gambling tax and rise in capital gains are said to be on the agenda.\n\nBut he added: “There is clearly an appetite out there from the British public for a grown-up conversation about tax and about the fact that there is a big inequality in our country that is less about income inequality. It’s about those who’ve got assets and wealth and those who haven’t.”\n\nWhile he has praised the speed with which the Labour government has pushed through a package on workers’ rights that will get royal assent in weeks, and praised moves like putting inheritance tax on farms, VAT on private school fees and tackling non-dom status, he fears that not enough is being done.\n\nThe TUC general secretary admitted, “There’ll be some in the trade union movement who think that Jeremy Corbyn and his Your Party is part of the solution” as he noted “people are disillusioned by what they see is the mainstream politics.”\n\nAnd he warned: “Keir Starmer people want the government to show whose side they’re on.”\n\nHe pointed out that the Labour election manifesto had one big word on the front – “change” – but suggested voters were not feeling it, allowing Farage to fill the gap.\n\n“For far too many people, ‘change’ still feels like a slogan rather than their lived reality. They’re still facing the same cost of living pressures. They haven’t seen the improvements come through in terms of public services.\n\n“That is partly because you cannot turn around 14 years of decline quickly, and partly because that’s been some self-inflicted mistakes, whether it was winter fuel allowance [cuts] or the way that welfare reform was handled.”\n\nAnd Nowak insisted that he could foresee an election victory for Farage and Reform UK “supported by a right-wing rump of the Tories”.\n\nWith many union members being attracted to Reform’s message, he said that Farage was “a right-wing wolf in left-wing sheep’s clothing” offering some left-wing policies on nationalising steel and some utilities.\n\n“Nigel Farage can appear that he’s got some simple solutions to some of the big problems the country faces.”\n\nHe said that Farage importing Elon Musk’s disastrous Doge project to cut spending in councils Reform runs has underlined the chaos he would bring to national government.\n\nHe added: “I think that the prospect of Nigel Farage anywhere near No 10 should scare the life out of anyone who really is genuinely a patriot in this country, who cares about this country.\n\n“He doesn’t care, despite waving the union jack and the cross of St George. All he is interested in is the interests of Elon Musk, Donald Trump and his right-wing backers.

With Trump seated behind the Resolute Desk and European leaders gathered around him “like schoolchildren,” it revealed more about his foreign-policy agenda than a thousand communiqués ever could.\nThe symbolism was unmistakable. By disregarding the balance among the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Trump did more than flout diplomatic protocol. He also signalled to Russia and China that, on issues concerning Europe, he is the one with whom to negotiate.\nSeven months into his second presidency, Trump is running the world as if it were a private corporation, unbound by common rules or established norms. The Oval Office is the executive suite; Trump is the CEO; other world leaders are the employees; and centuries-old conventions fall by the wayside.\nTrump seeks a global order based on patronage, not partnership, and European leaders’ behaviour during the Oval Office meeting appeared to validate that goal. It is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle – or even Angela Merkel – sitting quietly as Trump treated them as subordinates. But today’s Europe, fragmented by populism and short on strategic leadership, is ill-equipped to act as a global power.\nTrump’s approach to Nato follows the same logic. His effort to turn the alliance into a US-centric strategic instrument is particularly dangerous amid the Russia-Ukraine war.\nIn the past, Nato maintained relative stability by engaging Russia and Ukraine simultaneously through mechanisms like the Nato-Russia Council and the Nato-Ukraine Commission (replaced in 2023 by the Nato-Ukraine Council). These parallel channels helped strike a fragile balance between dialogue and deterrence, which Trump’s policies now put at risk.\nNotably absent from the White House summit were the countries most exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict: Turkey, Poland, Norway, Sweden, and the Black Sea and Baltic states. Excluding these frontline countries undermines Nato’s core principle of collective security and erodes the alliance’s strategic cohesion.\nThe implications for Turkey could be far-reaching. Despite commanding Nato’s second-largest military (after the US) and playing an important role in the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and Eurasia, it has been reduced to a peripheral observer, treated as a convenient host for occasional meetings rather than a strategic ally.\nTurkey was conspicuously excluded from the Ukraine summit and received no direct briefing from Trump, either before or after. Instead, it was informed indirectly through Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte. Turkey was also left out of the recent Azerbaijan-Armenia summit.\nTurkey’s diminished standing reflects a profound strategic miscalculation. Following the Washington summit, French president Emmanuel Macron stated that Turkey’s role would be “crucial” to providing Ukraine with concrete security guarantees.\nAt first glance, that may have sounded like praise. In reality, it signalled a troubling revival of Cold War-era thinking that values Turkey solely for the size of its military, not for its strategic vision or decision-making capacity.\nIn effect, Turkey has been pushed back into the role it played during the Korean War in the early 1950s: a frontline security provider excluded from the discussions that shaped its future. Today, Turkey once again finds itself shut out of deliberations on issues vital to its national interests, yet is expected to implement decisions in which it had no say.\nI confronted this outdated mindset in my 2001 book Strategic Depth, and later as Turkey’s foreign minister and prime minister. It reflects a persistent strategic blindness among American and European policymakers that no Turkish official should normalise or tolerate.\nWestern leaders must abandon the illusion that Turkey is an adolescent nation-state whose pride can be soothed with compliments. Turkey is no newcomer. It is a seasoned, strategically mature regional power – a civilisational actor that has long helped shape Europe and the global order.\nTo treat it merely as a military asset is to misunderstand the essence of its strategic identity: a tradition of diplomacy and statecraft forged by centuries of navigating shifting power balances across continents.\nTurkey cannot afford to remain passive. To avoid being sidelined, it must pursue strategic recalibration, beginning with three urgent steps. First, it should form a bloc of like-minded countries within Nato by initiating talks with other members excluded from the White House summit on Ukraine, such as Poland, Norway, Sweden, and the Baltic states. By creating an alternative forum for strategic coordination, it could inject much-needed balance into Nato’s internal dynamics.\nSecond, Turkey should spearhead the creation of an advisory framework that brings together Black Sea states like Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, and Moldova while bolstering direct communication with both Ukraine and Russia.\nRevitalising initiatives such as the Black Sea Naval Force and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation – institutions that once anchored post-Cold War stability – could foster constructive dialogue among all regional actors, including Russia and Ukraine.\nThird, Turkey must reclaim its strategic centrality, making clear to the US and the European Union that it is not a passive Middle Eastern outpost but a major Eurasian power. This requires a far more assertive diplomatic posture.\nThe Oval Office image of Trump flanked by European leaders was not just a photo-op. It was a snapshot of Europe’s leadership vacuum, Nato’s internal imbalance, and Turkey’s marginalisation.\nPolicymakers in Europe and Turkey must heed its message: unless they act swiftly and decisively, the emerging order will not just be negotiated without them – it will be negotiated at their expense.\n\nAhmet Davutoğlu is a former prime minister (2014-16) and foreign minister (2009-14) of Turkey.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"The Oval Office image of Donald Trump flanked by European leaders was not just a photo-op; it was a snapshot of Europe’s leadership vacuum, Nato’s internal imbalance, and Turkey’s marginalisation.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/09/04/pushing-back-against-trumps-new-world-order","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ac5d43ab-donald-trump-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-03 23:00:23","author":"Ahmet Davutoğlu","authors":["Ahmet Davutoğlu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.081}]}
