Exactly 56% said they voted for Trump and 58% for GOP congressional candidates. \n\nOf those people of faith, 60% of Protestants said they voted for Trump and 58% of Catholics said they did the same. Sixty-one percent of Catholics said they voted for Republican congressional candidates, as did 60% of Protestants. \n\nPublic Opinion Strategies interviewed 800 individuals by phone on election night for the Faith & Freedom Coalition, speaking to those who said that they had voted. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46 percentage points. \n\nRalph Reed, founder and chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, said at a press conference Wednesday that Harris’ liberal stance on abortion may have turned off voters of faith, and that Democrats have a “religion problem” in their party. \n\nReed also attributed the defeat of two ballot questions in Florida, one on abortion rights and one legalizing marijuana, to Trump’s overperformance among Hispanic, faith-based voters. The coalition registered voters in Hispanic churches, he said. \n\nPenny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, which calls itself the nation’s largest public policy organization for women, said her group was part of the coalition’s get-out-the-vote effort. \n\nFully 70% of voters surveyed said their votes were influenced by social issues related to Title IX, the federal law prohibiting discrimination against women in schools that receive federal funds, Nance said. \n\nShe said voters told Concerned Women for America that it’s important not to allow boys or men in girls or women’s sports or in their safe spaces such as restrooms and locker rooms. \n\nAll told, about 600 volunteers knocked on doors in an effort to visit 10 million households, Reed said.","summary":"Most Catholics and Protestants say they voted for the once and future president, Donald Trump, in Tuesday’s election, while most nonreligious Americans seem to have...

Donovan until 1983. She was a principal of the Jacksonville, Florida-based government affairs firm Summerall, Smith & Wiles until 1986.\n\nWiles returned to Washington politics in 1988, working as the deputy director of operations for the vice presidential campaign of then-candidate Dan Quayle, the running mate of Republican George H.W. Bush, who was elected president later that year. She then joined Rep. Tillie K. Fowler (R-Fla.), serving as district director from 1992 until 1995.\n\nThe first was to manage Rick Scott’s 2010 gubernatorial campaign, years before he became one of Florida’s U.S. senators. Scott faced an uphill battle in that election, staving off criticism of his previous company’s massive Medicare fraud scheme and barely beating his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, by slightly more than 1 percent of the vote.\n\nWhen Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) ran for president in 2012, Wiles served as co-chair of his Florida advisory council. She also briefly managed the 2012 presidential campaign of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.\n\nSome have also credited Wiles with rescuing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s 2018 gubernatorial campaign when DeSantis was still a little-known congressman. She worked as his senior adviser from September 2018 until January 2019.\n\nTrump later named Wiles the co-chair of his Florida operation, and the longtime operative helped him win in the Sunshine State in two straight consecutive elections before Republicans grew a massive voter registration advantage over Democrats in Florida after 2021.\n\nIn March 2021, Trump hired Wiles to serve as CEO of his Save America Leadership PAC. Then, along with Chris LaCivita, Wiles co-chaired Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n“Susie likes to stay sort of in the back, let me tell you. The ice baby. We call her the ice baby. Susie likes to stay in the background. She’s not in the background,” Trump added. “Thank you, Susie.”\n\nRecently, however, Wiles broke her customary silence to make a public statement in response to billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, who said on daytime television that Trump is never seen around “strong, intelligent women.”\n\nBetween 2001 and 2004, she was the principal of Wiles Consulting, Inc., which provided “government affairs and communications consulting to a variety of clients.” From 2011 until 2022, Wiles was the Jacksonville managing partner of Ballard Partners, Florida’s largest government affairs firm. Ballard Partners represents local and national clients, including BlueCross BlueShield of Florida.\n\nSince 2011, Wiles has served as principal of Right Coast Strategies, a public affairs, communications, and direct marking public relations firm founded in partnership with former Jacksonville Jaguars athlete Tony Boselli.\n\nWiles recently lobbied for the Swisher International tobacco company and is the co-chair of the lobbying giant Mercury Public Affairs. Mercury’s clients include AT&T, the Embassy of Qatar, and SpaceX.\n\nShe was one of the broadcaster’s three children and grew up in New Jersey. Kemp, who gave Wiles her first job in politics, was one of Summerall’s teammates at the New York Giants.\n\nSummerall battled alcoholism and later credited his daughter with pushing him to seek rehab and sobriety.\n\n“I hadn’t been there much for my kids, but Susan’s letter made it clear that I’d hurt them even in my absence,” Summerall wrote in his memoir, adding that the two grew close later in life.\n\nAfter Summerall’s 2013 death, Wiles described him as “an extraordinary man and a wonderful father.”","summary":"As senior advisor to Trump's campaign, Wiles has stayed out of the limelight and been credited for running a disciplined operation.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/6-things-to-know-about-susie-wiles-trumps-next-chief-of-staff-5756762","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/09/id5756953-outside-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 01:01:37","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.075},{"id":263663090,"title":"Trump plans to withdraw US from Paris climate pact, open some national monuments to drilling: report","text":"Nov 8 – U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team has prepared executive orders and proclamations on withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and shrinking the size of some national monuments to allow more drilling and mining, the New York Times reported on Friday.\n\nTrump is also expected to end the pause on permitting new liquefied natural gas exports to big markets in Asia and Europe and revoke a waiver that allows California and other states to have tighter pollution standards, according to the report.\n\nTrump promised during his campaign to take many of the actions listed in the report.

Shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker which he leads as CEO and in which he owns a 13% stake, rose nearly 15% in trading on Wall Street, implying a wealth gain of $15bn.\n\nThere could be more to come. Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial firm Wedbush Securities, said a Trump victory could add up to $200bn to the value of Tesla, which would increase Musk’s wealth by about $26bn in total, including Wednesday’s increase.\n\n“The biggest positive from a Trump win would be for Tesla and Musk,” Ives wrote in a note to investors, citing likely benefits such as the possibility of Trump imposing tariffs, or import taxes, on electric vehicles made in China.\n\nMusk also owns SpaceX, a rocket company that has a host of US government contracts. Last month alone it secured contracts worth over $700m from the US Space Force. SpaceX and Tesla have received at least $15.4bn in government contracts over the past decade, a recent New York Times analysis shows.\n\nGiven that Musk has received contracts from Space Force under Joe Biden’s administration, the expectation is that the flow of federal deals will not decrease under Trump.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor and specialist in government regulation Richard Pierce said he was “certain” Musk’s businesses would benefit from more contracts.\n\n Soft power\n\nThe Trump victory has also underlined the soft power of Musk’s ownership of the social media platform X, even if it appears unlikely that he will directly recoup the heavily inflated $44bn he spent on it in 2022 when it was better known as Twitter (the ‘sink’ photo is from when Musk marched into Twitter’s office carrying the aforementioned basin).\n\nX has undergone a right-wing shift under Musk’s ownership and played a contributory role in Trump’s campaign. Musk has reinstated inflammatory right-wing figures such as the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nMusk’s control of the network has enabled him to amplify his own pro-Trump messaging on the platform. His is the largest account, with more than 200m followers.\n\nIt has been highly active during the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 times a day with very heavy engagement — the ‘sink’ post alone has been viewed 50m times. X has been a key player in a media ecosystem that has supported Trump, including podcasters such as Joe Rogan.\n\nFormer head of Twitter’s European operations Bruce Daisley said throughout Musk’s ownership of X the billionaire had refused to compromise for short-term financial gain.\n\n“By introducing a more aggressive algorithm he has definitely changed a space that commentators, journalists, and political people use into a place that favours right-wing voices, including his own. He has had an impact on stuff that people are consuming,” said Daisley.\n\nGovernment job\n\nThere is also likely to be a role for Musk in the Trump administration. In September, Trump said he would form a government efficiency commission, with Musk leading it. A full-time government job would require Musk to put his companies in trust, but a part-time government efficiency role would not require such action.\n\n“In theory, Musk cannot take a full-time government job without putting his companies in trust,” said Boston College law school professor Brian Quinn.\n\n“However, he can participate as a part-time member of a presidential commission, etc, without doing so.”\n\nMusk has already indicated that a government efficiency body would help SpaceX, stating on X that his business could reach Mars sooner “so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy”.\n\n“The Department of Government Efficiency is the only path to extending life beyond Earth,” he added in a post on X.\n\nUS federal regulations can be a bugbear for Musk. For instance, he has made clear his frustration with the Federal Aviation Administration, warning in September after another clash with it that the company will be “filing suit against the FAA for regulatory overreach”.\n\nGeorge Washington University’s Pierce said that Musk could expect an easier ride from federal regulators and prosecutors.\n\n“All federal regulators and prosecutors work for the president,” he said. “He can tell them to do something or not to do something with the understanding that he will fire them if they disobey.”\n\nOther Musk companies include the artificial intelligence start-up xAI, which is reportedly heading for a valuation of $40bn, and the brain implant firm Neuralink, which is reportedly worth $8bn.\n\nMusk is a figure of global fame and power already, but Trump underlined it on Wednesday.\n\n“We have a new star, a star is born: Elon.”\n\nThat star is likely to get brighter, and more powerful, under a Trump administration.\n\n Guardian Service","summary":"Elon Musk’s contribution to Donald Trump’s return to the White House will reap benefits for the Tesla chief executive and world’s richest person, writes Dan Milmo","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41512889.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8740/4370390_9_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2181433152_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 01:00:00","author":"Dan Milmo,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Dan Milmo","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.304},{"id":263663052,"title":"Florida Democratic congressman says he was target in attempted assassination","text":"A Florida Democratic congressman said that police arrested a suspect who allegedly was armed and had him on a target list near his home the day before the election.\n\nRep.

The other two men are currently under arrest. \n\nMr Trump has already survived two attempts on his life, including avoiding death by a fraction of an inch when he was shot in the ear at an election rally in Pennsylvania in July.\n\nWhile in a US jail, Shakeri, described as an ‘asset’ of the IRGC, recruited two gun-toting American criminals to carry out the assassination, according to the US Department of Justice.\n\nShakeri, 51, said his Iranian handlers had instructed him last month to produce a plan within seven days to kill Mr Trump ahead of the election, according to documents unsealed last night.\n\nHe explained he had been tasked with surveilling and killing Trump to avenge the devastating drone strike that killed Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in January 2020.\n\nSince the Soleimani’s death, Trump has been a target during his election campaign where he asked for military planes and larger Secret Service detail to protect him from Iranian threats. \n\nShakeri reportedly told his spymasters Trump’s assassination would cost a ‘huge’ amount of money, to which they allegedly replied: ‘We have already spent a lot of money so the money’s not an issue.’\n\nFBI special agent Mathew Chrusz said this was understood to mean that the Iranians had previously spent a significant sum of money on efforts to murder Mr Trump. \n\nAfter being ordered to assassinate Trump with just a month until millions of Americans went to the polls on November 5, Shakeri told the FBI he didn’t plan to carry out the operation in the timeframe he was given.\n\nShakeri – an Afghan refugee granted asylum in America – was deported back to Iran in 2008 after serving a 14-year sentence for armed robbery in New York state prisons \n\nHowever according to the FBI special agent, he maintained an extensive prison contact base, recruiting two accomplices while serving time in the US for his crime. \n\nCarlisle Rivera, 49, and Jonathan Loadholt, 36, were both in prison for violent offences, and both men have now been arrested and charged with offences relating to ‘murder-for-hire’.\n\nThe disturbing documents unsealed by the Department of Justice Friday revealed the arsenal of weapons the assassins had at their disposal and the texts messages they sent each other to concoct their deadly plan.\n\nThe trio also shared frightening voice messages, urging patience and detailing how they would follow their targets.\n\nBut Shakeri, having allegedly made admissions to US agents, is currently ensconced in the Iranian capital out of reach of American law enforcement.\n\nAnnouncing the charges last night, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said: ‘There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran.\n\n‘The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran’s assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald J Trump.’\n\nAccording to the FBI, the IRGC also tasked Shakeri with carrying out other assassinations against US and Israeli citizens in the United States.\n\nRivera and Loadholt were allegedly directed by Shakeri to surveil an unnamed U.S. citizen who is an ‘outspoken critic’ of the Iranian regime.\n\n‘In exchange for Shakeri’s promise of $100,000, Rivera and Loadholt repeatedly sought to locate Victim-1 for murder,’ the complaint states.\n\nThey travelled to Fairfield University in Connecticut, where the individual was set to appear earlier this year, and also stalked her home in Brooklyn.\n\nIranian-American activist Masih Alinejad said on Fox News Friday that she is the individual that was targeted for murder.\n\nShakeri told Rivera in a voice note when discussing the murder plot: ‘You just gotta have patience … You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don’t think about going in. In is a suicide move.’\n\nAlinejad said she is ‘grateful’ to the FBI for informing her ahead of the Fairfield University event, which she skipped to ‘project the students.’\n\n‘I don’t want to die. I want to be alive to see the end of this regime,’ Alinejad added.\n\nThis comes shortly after Trump said he would blow Iran ‘to smithereens’ if he was back at the helm of the oval office last September. \n\nIt came as a former head of MI6 has told Europe to wake up and ‘smell the coffee’ about its need to protect the continent following Mr Trump’s presidential victory.\n\nSir Alex Younger said subsequent generations would not easily forgive the political leaders of this era should they fail to take remedial action.\n\nSpeaking on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, he said: ‘Trump is disdainful of alliances, he takes a highly transactional approach to them.\n\n‘The security guarantee we have enjoyed for 80 years, since the Second World War, is obviously going to have to change.’\n\nIn his first call with Volodymyr Zelensky since winning the election, Mr Trump invited tech billionaire Elon Musk to join the conversation.\n\nIt is the latest indication that Mr Musk will play a prominent role in Mr Trump’s administration.\n\nIt remained unclear last night what the Ukrainian president made of the move, as he has previously clashed with Mr Musk.","summary":"The FBI foiled a chilling plot by Iran’s secret service to assassinate Donald&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/iranian-assassination-plot-to-kill-donald-trump-thwarted-by-fbi-as-spy-escapes-to-tehran/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/08/22/91871283-14061335-Three_alleged_hitmen_have_been_charged_over_an_attempted_murder_-m-110_1731106209983.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:55:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.558},{"id":263662852,"title":"Report: Musk took part in call between Trump, Zelenskyy","text":"Report: Musk took part in call between Trump, Zelenskyy\n A new Axios report says that billionaire Elon Musk was on a phone call between President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscoring that Musk has a seat at the table as Trump navigates his return to power.

While Republicans also took control of the U.S. Senate, the status of the House remains up in the air, although the GOP currently looks favored to retain its grip on the chamber.However, Democrats may have a better chance of capturing control of the House in the 2026 midterms even if they come up short this year. The party that controls the presidency typically loses House seats in midterm elections and the chamber is all but certain to be closely divided in 2026.During his first stint in the White House, Trump was twice impeached by the Democrat-controlled House, the first time in 2019 over his alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate then-candidate Joe Biden and the second in January 2021 over his role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was acquitted by the Senate in both cases.Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist in the early months of the first Trump administration, warned during an episode of his War Room podcast on Friday that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, would lead the charge to another Trump impeachment if House control flips during the midterms.\"Hakeem Jeffries could be, will be, the speaker of the House in two years,\" Bannon said. \"And the first thing he will do in the early days of 2027 is move to impeach Donald Trump. Trust me. They're gonna put $10 billion in back of him. They have nobody else.\"He continued: \"...Hakeem Jeffries is just sitting there, right? He's ready to go. The [billionaire Democratic donor] Reid Hoffmans of the world are gonna put $10 billion in back of him to win a couple of seats, a handful of seats, in places that are kind of Democratic anyway.\"Bannon, meanwhile, was released from prison last week after serving a four-month sentence for two counts of contempt of Congress for failing to respond to a House select committee-issued subpoena investigating the Capitol riot.Newsweek reached out for comment to the office of Jeffries via email on Friday evening.Republican attempts to impeach President Joe Biden began almost immediately after he took office, initiated by figures such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and Trump ally.On Biden's first full day as president on January 21, 2021, the congresswoman filed articles of impeachment against him, alleging improper involvement with his son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, which has been widely contested as there is no evidence of any wrongdoing.Multiple attempts to impeach Biden failed while Democrats controlled the House and after Republicans took control.Impeaching and removing a president from office has never been accomplished and remains unlikely unless one party controls both chambers of Congress by wide margins. Trump came the closest of any president to earning the distinction at the conclusion of his second Senate impeachment trial just before he left office.Despite GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, saying that Trump was \"practically and morally responsible for provoking\" the Capitol riot, only seven Republicans joined with Democrats in voting to convict Trump, with the 57-43 vote falling 10 votes short of a required two-thirds majority.","summary":"Trump is the only president in U.S. history to have been impeached twice by the House of Representatives.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-warns-potential-third-donald-trump-impeachment-1983079","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2517015/donald-trump-impeachment-steve-bannon-warning.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:36:42","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":263662326,"title":"What Trump's second term means for space and why one expert is 'hugely optimistic'","text":"Now that president-elect Donald Trump is set to return to power in the US, Elon Musk's plans for sending humans beyond Earth's orbit may be more likely to come to fruition.Space industry experts told Business Insider that Musk's influence over Trump could help advance his business interests, including sending the first crewed mission to Mars.\"I'm hugely optimistic about what's going to happen in space now,\" Michelle Hanlon, executive director of the Center for Air and Space Law at the University of Mississippi School of Law, told Business Insider.Hanlon's optimism isn't unfounded, especially if Trump's second term focuses on space as much as his first.During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump's administration founded the Space Force, re-launched the National Space Council, and established NASA's Artemis program. This program is set to return astronauts to the moon and lay the groundwork for the first crewed mission to Mars.But space isn't the only interest Trump and Musk share. They also want to slash government regulations.Trump has said that he would cut 10 regulations for every new one his administration creates.Musk and his businesses, meanwhile, have clashed with regulators, including the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration.\"There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" Musk wrote on X after Trump announced that he planned to put the billionaire at the helm of a new \"department of government efficiency.\"It's unclear how much influence Musk would have over regulations if this department came to fruition. Trump's trust in Musk to run such a department, however, is a testament to the pair's burgeoning relationship.The two men teamed up on the campaign trail, with Musk contributing millions to Trump's reelection campaign and appearing with him at a rally in Pennsylvania.In his election-night victory speech, Trump praised Musk for SpaceX's Starship vehicle, designed to shuttle the first humans to Mars, and for the company's Starlink internet satellites, which are designed to offer fast, cheap internet to remote locations worldwide.Musk also joined a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday — underscoring how influential Musk could be once Trump returns to office, Axios reported.Whether that influence translates to Trump founding a new \"department of government efficiency\" for Musk, though, is unclear.SpaceX and Musk did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Trump's campaign said that Musk's ideas and efficiency will benefit federal bureaucracy but his role in Trump's administration remains under wraps.\"It's a crazy situation, but you can't just create a new department,\" Deborah Sivas, the director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford, told BI. She said Congress would have to approve it, which may be more likely since Republicans won the Senate majority.Changing a government agency's powers or rules, Sivas said, requires making new rules or passing a law through Congress. That can take months, and it's not guaranteed to work.So, it's unlikely that Musk would be able to single-handedly eliminate key steps in regulatory processes, like the typical environmental review requirement for building a new rocket launchpad.\"I think Elon Musk will be more likely in the background, whispering in his ear,\" Sivas said of the billionaire's relationship with Trump.\"Is he going to be able to influence space policy? Yes, no question,\" Hanlon said, adding that she sees that as a \"good thing\" because of Musk's experience.In other arenas, like environmental regulation, Sivas isn't so sure.\"I feel like he should stay in his business lane and stay out of the government lane,\" Sivas said. \"When you put those two together, it's like putting church and state together.\"Even if Musk can't change regulations, a space-friendly Trump administration could smooth the path to Musk's goal of building a city on Mars.Musk recently said that he plans to launch Starships to Mars for the first time in just two years. If those flights go well, he said that the first human crews would follow four years from now.\"That's a pretty ambitious timeline,\" George Nield, former associate administrator of the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, told BI. To meet it would probably require \"different regulatory frameworks or contractual arrangements than we've used in the past,\" he added.\"If anybody can do it, it will be Elon Musk,\" Hanlon said. But the government can help, she said, by making regulators more efficient.To help even further, she added, \"It can become a policy of the US government to support commercial flight to Mars.\"With Trump's interest in Starship, the chances of that look better than ever.Regulations aren't the only obstacle. There are still a lot of technical hurdles to overcome before we can reach Mars, Nield said.The moon, on the other hand, is more achievable, and Trump has had his eye on it. Weeks after Musk endorsed Trump, the president-elect told reporters that the moon was the first step toward his ultimate goal to reach Mars.For the Artemis program's first human moon landing, NASA plans to launch four astronauts toward the moon using its Space Launch System and Orion spaceship.In lunar orbit, the ship would meet up with SpaceX's Starship, which would carry two astronauts to the moon's surface, putting boots in the lunar dust for the first time since 1972.The date for that mission has been repeatedly pushed back, with September 2026 being NASA's current target.There's no indication that Trump is considering this, but if he wants a faster moon landing, he could ditch the NASA hardware and send astronauts aboard Starship alone, Nield said.\"If we see rapid progress with Starship and encouragement from the administration and Congress, I don't see any reason why that couldn't happen in a small number of years,\" Nield said.","summary":"The Trump and Musk alliance could speed up the next human moon landing and Starship's first mission to Mars.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-trump-presidency-election-means-elon-musk-space-moon-mars-2024-11","image":"https://i.insider.com/672e3bcb88cea3ba1c1f2e2c?width=772&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:36:07","author":"Morgan McFall-Johnsen","authors":["Morgan McFall-Johnsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":263662142,"title":"Will U.S. Continue Funding Belize’s Climate Projects?","text":"Will U.S. Continue Funding Belize’s Climate Projects?\n\nEarlier this week, the United States held its 2024 presidential election, with Republican candidate Donald J.

But one columnist is arguing that consensus is wrong.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for MSNBC, columnist Michael A. Cohen (not Trump's former lawyer) wrote that Democrats actually had the wind at their backs when it came to the economy. He noted that President Joe Biden added 16 million jobs during his tenure, oversaw a significant increase in real (inflation-adjusted) wages, got inflation back down to 2018 levels, and cancelled more than $175 billion in federal student debt.\n\nAdditionally, the Biden-Harris administration passed several historic bills into law that were immensely beneficial to the economy, like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (which spent more than $1 trillion on improving roads, bridges, airports and expanding rural broadband internet access), the CHIPS and Science Act (which created roughly 115,000 new manufacturing jobs in the semiconductor industry) and the Inflation Reduction Act (which made billions of dollars in investments in the renewable energy sector). Cohen opined that this should have made Democrats the obvious choice for voters who said they were motivated by economic issues, even though voters were ultimately unmoved.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Not good enough anymore': Union leader explains why Dems lost economic argument to Trump\n\n\"Biden’s record and the disparity in the two candidates’ economic messages didn’t increase the party’s support among working-class voters (which are defined here as those without a college degree),\" he wrote. \"In short, under Biden, Democrats adopted one of the most pro-working class policy agendas in recent political memory, enacted much of it — and accrued no electoral benefit.\"\n\nCohen also addressed the arguments that Democrats weren't messaging enough on economic policy. He pointed out that the Harris campaign \"poured $200 million into ads that focused on her economic message\" and that she actually \"outspent the Trump campaign by around $70 million on ads about the economy.\"\n\n\"What was the content of these ads? Calls to end corporate price gouging, lower housing costs, cut middle-class taxes and protect Social Security and Medicare. Other Harris ads accused Trump of only looking out for his billionaire pals and corporations and attacked him for enacting tax cuts that were primarily directed at the wealthiest Americans,\" he continued. \"This is the definition of an economic populist message.\"\n\nNevertheless, Democrats fell short among working-class voters across multiple racial demographics. This was particularly true among the non-white working class, where she performed 16 points worse than Biden in 2020 and 26 points worse than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016. Cohen's rationale was that Trump's victory came not from his own economic agenda — which he characterized as tariffs that would raise prices on consumer goods and tax cuts that would primarily benefit the richest Americans — but from his ability to scapegoat undocumented immigrants for Americans' problems.\n\nREAD MORE: AOC praises Johnson's 'honesty' after he admits plan to repeal bill that created 115K jobs\n\n\"As in 2016, Trump served as a political voice channeling the fears, cultural grievances and resentments of working-class Americans — and, as has been the case for much of the past 60 years for Republicans, it worked,\" he wrote. \"Of course, it’s not just Trump. The GOP’s attention to the white working class is overwhelmingly symbolic. They offer nothing substantive on policy. They oppose expanding health care access or raising the minimum wage.\"\n\nCohen pointed out that in the ruby-red state of Missouri, progressive economic policies were incredibly popular with voters in the Show Me State. Not only did a ballot question on abortion rights succeed by a 58-42 margin, but a referendum on paid sick leave and raising the minimum wage also passed with a comfortable margin. Still, only 40% of voters cast their ballot for Harris, who backed those policies, while the rest voted for Trump, who has openly opposed those ideas.\n\n\"Democrats are a party of 'doing stuff' with an electorate utterly indifferent to the stuff they do,\" Cohen wrote.\n\nClick here to read Cohen's full column on MSNBC.\n\nREAD MORE: The world's 10 richest billionaires made $64 billion from Trump's victory","summary":"An emerging consensus about the 2024 election is that Vice President Kamala Harris lost working class voters to President-elect Donald Trump because he had better messaging about economic issues.

Students already use AI to write their essays, so teaching students to use it may encourage them to be lazier and become dependent on it, hindering their ability to think freely.\n\nInstead, students should use AI in more productive and limited ways or abandon it altogether. When a student relies solely on AI, they start to forget how to write, let alone form coherent sentences. Is this the future we want, students not able to write without computer assistance? Will our children get through college without AI to guide them?\n\nThis simply cannot be.

I think this is a laudable goal but the charging issue looms large.\n\nLast year, Honda and Toyota, who make more vehicles than any other carmaker in the United States, testified in Congress that their research and dealers say consumers are not ready yet.\n\nSo, the authors should consider plug-in hybrids as a reasonable interim step, while chargers move consumers to adapt to all-electric vehicles when more charging alternatives are available. Apartment dwellers cannot readily charge their vehicles when home. It is not practical for them to get their vehicles charged elsewhere while they work.\n\nWe may need to move faster, but wishing and legislation won’t make that happen.\n\nDev Mahadevan\nCastro Valley\n\nIt’s time to curb excess,\npower of private equity\n\nThe time has come for private equity’s reckoning. It has penetrated every aspect of our lives — from housing to groceries, from hospitals to care homes, from preschools to funeral homes, from pet care to copper mines. Originally, it had some legitimate use, but now it’s the unapologetic center of blatant greed, lousy service and lame excuses.\n\nIts upper reaches are the playground for obscene displays of wealth. Case in point, Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire impresario of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, just hosted a 200-person housewarming party at his $27 million mansion in Newport. Before that, there was his 70th birthday in Palm Beach, and before that, his 60th which cost a reported $3 million-$5 million and featured Venetian gondolas, Arabian camels, Mongolian acrobats and a giant cake in the shape of a Chinese temple.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nJim Wolpman\nWalnut Creek\n\nPoultry, meat recall\na testament to waste\n\nRe: “Poultry, meat are subjected to recall” (Page A2, Oct. 11).\n\nI wonder how many animals led a tortured life and then were needlessly killed to total 10 million pounds of meat? How much land was wasted growing their millions of pounds of feed? How much water and fuel was wasted, and air and water pollution created —- needlessly?\n\nA slap on the wrist for BrucePac does not serve justice for the four-month “lapse” that allowed such waste and disregard for public health and safety.

I know she called a lot of my colleagues; she never called me. I’ve had one interaction with Harris, at her Naval Observatory Christmas party,’ she told the New York Times.\n\nThe clash came over fake plastic trees. \n\n‘I’m not super comfortable at that kind of thing,’ she said, detailing the holiday interaction-gone-bad.\n\n‘I’d had a couple of beers, and I noticed that almost all of the garlands were plastic. My district grows a hell of a lot of Christmas trees. I was strong-armed into taking a picture,’ she continued.\n\n‘I said, “Madam Vice President, we grow those where I live,”‘ said the occasional critic of her party. \n\nEvidently the line didn’t go over well with Harris, who hails from Oakland. and who faced blistering attacks from rival Donald Trump about her own authenticity. Her rival even questioned whether she actually worked at McDonald’s as she says she did.\n\n‘She just walked away from me. There was kind of an eye roll, maybe. My thinking was, it does matter to people where I live. It’s the respect, the cultural regard for farmers. I didn’t feel like she understood what I was trying to say,’ she said.\n\nEven if she took a dig at her host’s holiday decorations, Democrats might want to give the lawmaker a hearing: she represents a GOP-leaning district, and is on the way to defeating Republican Joe Kent by outperforming Harris in her district.\n\nDemocrats are reflecting on what went wrong after Trump ate into traditional consituencies, including union members and minority voters.\n\nHis coalition is becoming increasingly downscale, while Democrats, traditionally anchored in the working class, are gaining about white college educated voters. \n\nThe lawmaker’s race was a key pickup opportunity for Republicans against the Trump-backed Kent. \n\nAsked if she was surprised by the results, she responded, ‘I got yelled at every time I tried to say something about that. By everyone. I think I’m at the platinum level of bipartisanship, where I’ve gotten threats of physical violence from both sides.’\n\nAnd as Trump prepared to take over and perhaps have unified control of government, she encouraged her party to look inward. ‘It’s a lot easier to look outward, to blame and demonize other people, instead of looking in the mirror and seeing what we can do. It is not fun to feel accountability. It requires a mental flexibility that’s painful.

While it is unclear whether Trump would have continued the prior policy, he has repeatedly promised not to put American lives at risk and to rapidly conclude the conflict once in office again.\n\nThe potential American presence on the ground will be “small” and located “far” from the front lines, and they are not expected to engage in combat, Reuters wrote on Friday, citing an anonymous US official. As the US and its NATO partners have provided Kiev with increasingly sophisticated American-made armaments, such as F-16 fighter jets and Patriot air defense systems, restrictions have slowed repairs and proven increasingly challenging. Much of the equipment has been damaged beyond repair by Kiev’s own specialists.\n\nThe policy change aligns the Pentagon more closely with the US State Department and USAID, which already have contractors in Ukraine, according to another official.\n\n“These contractors will help the Ukrainian Armed Forces rapidly repair and maintain US-provided equipment as needed so it can quickly return to the front lines,” CNN wrote on Friday, citing a defense official. Specifically, F-16 jets and Patriot batteries “require specific technical expertise to maintain,” they said.\n\nAllowing US contractors to work in Ukraine will provide a faster alternative to the current method of transporting equipment to NATO countries like Poland and Romania for repairs, CNN noted.\n\nMeanwhile the risks of being killed by Russian strikes will fall on the companies bidding for the Pentagon contracts.\n\n“Each US contractor, organization, or company will be responsible for the safety and security of their employees and will be required to include risk mitigation plans as part of their bids,” CNN cited a defense official as saying.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously stated that Moscow is aware of the “direct involvement of NATO troops in this conflict.” He pointed out that several high-tech systems the US and its allies have provided to Kiev, such as ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles, require the involvement of Western officers to operate them.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry regularly reports airstrikes on repair facilities in Ukraine. This week alone, the Russian military carried out at least 38 strikes on Kiev’s military-industrial complex facilities, as well as supporting energy and military infrastructure, according to the latest report on Friday.","summary":"US President Joe Biden has permitted the deployment of American defense contractors to Ukraine, Pentagon officials told the media \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/607391-biden-pentagon-contractors-ukraine/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.11/article/672eabaa85f5401e1c41e57f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:27:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":263660632,"title":"Imran Khan says won’t ‘flee’ Pakistan like Nawaz Sharif","text":"LAHORE, Nov 8 : Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has reiterated that he will “never flee” the country like ex-premier Nawaz Sharif, rejecting claims that he is seeking refuge outside the country.\n\nIn the face of speculations triggered after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif recently said that Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party is urging “foreign powers” to get their supreme leader released and send him abroad, Khan issued a statement on X, asserting that he will not leave the country at any cost.\n\n“I will never flee the country.

Musk, who campaigned for Trump in the final weeks of the 2024 race, was not scheduled to be on the call but walked into the room and greeted Zelenskyy, according to the source. He was not part of a substantive conversation between the two leaders, the person said. Neither Zelenskyy nor Trump had previously disclosed that Musk was on the call. Axios first reported his participation, which was confirmed by other outlets. Trump transition team officials declined requests for comment Friday. Neither Musk nor the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., immediately responded to requests for comment. Zelenskyy on Wednesday described his call with Trump as \"excellent.\" \"We agreed to maintain close dialogue and advance our cooperation,\" Zelenskyy continued in a post on X. \"Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace.\" Trump has previously claimed that he could have the war \"settled\" in one day, asserting that if he became president-elect, \"I’ll get it done before even becoming president.\" He did not lay out a plan for doing so. During Trump's lone debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say whether he wanted Ukraine, a U.S. ally, to win the war. \"I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, all right,\" he said. \"Negotiate a deal.\" Vice President-elect JD Vance has also suggested that Ukraine should be ready to give up some of its territory to end the war. Musk has also had phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The conversations were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Near the start of the war, after Russia invaded, Musk helped provide internet support for Ukraine. Emergency Starlink receivers played a key role in helping Ukrainians communicate. Starlink systems are a service that is part of SpaceX, which Musk owns. But he has also angered Ukrainians for suggesting the country give up some of its territory to Russia. In October 2022, he suggested that Ukraine cede Crimea to Russia as part of a possible peace deal, drawing rebukes from Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials.","summary":"Tech mogul Elon Musk briefly joined President-elect Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/elon-musk-briefly-joins-trumps-call-volodymyr-zelenskyy-rcna179418","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241010-elon-must-donald-trump-se-445p-b1402f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:26:57","author":"Megan Lebowitz","authors":["Megan Lebowitz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":263660434,"title":"Time to accept harsh truth about Kamala Harris","text":"Take a look at social media right now and you’ll see it’s full of Democratic supporters absolutely baffled by Kamala Harris’ loss. \n\nTake the below from one post as an example of them all.\n\n“Can someone explain this to me? Her venues were filled, his were empty and people were leaving. Her (rallies) were full of positivity, his with threats and hatred. \n\n“How the hell did this happen?”\n\nPerhaps it is indeed time to face the difficult truth about how the hell this did happen. \n\nMaybe it was because Kamala Harris wasn’t a very good candidate. \n\nIf the Democratic Party truly believed Donald Trump was the danger to society they continually made him out to be during the campaign, why didn't they go through the process of picking the best person to face him?\n\nIt sounds harsh. And this is not to suggest Ms Harris isn’t formidable. Accomplished and whip smart, at times during the campaign she shone.\n\nShe made mincemeat of Mr Trump in their one debate.\n\nOn the campaign trial, she was a natural — easily chatting to supporters’ mums on the phone, or flipping chicken wings on a grill. She was far more natural than Mr Trump cos-playing as a Macca’s worker. \n\nAnd she had scripted flourishes of brilliance. In her concession speech she told the devastated crowd of her supporters that “while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign”.\n\nBut those flourishes weren’t enough. \n\nNot against the Trump juggernaut. And that should have been obvious. But failings in the Democratic Party conspired to put a flawed candidate in front of Americans. \n\nAnd they saw right through it.\n\nHarris: Warmth but waffle\n\nMs Harris was full of warmth but also full of waffle. She extolled the virtues of a new generation of leadership, while being literally part of the old generation of leadership. She flip-flopped on policies and flubbed her answers far too often.\n\nWhile Mr Trump provided simplistic answers to complex issues, Ms Harris provided complex nuances that confused voters, and which they didn’t care to hear. \n\nNone of this was new news. Ms Harris took part in the Democratic primaries before the 2020 election and bowed out early, haemorrhaging cash and with her popularity in single digits. Up against competitors, she didn’t do great. \n\nThis time around, the problems began with Joe Biden. After indicating he would be a one term “transition” president, just enough to lever Mr Trump out and bring in new blood, the ongoing allure of the Oval Office was just too much. He wanted to stay put. \n\nBy the time his own party forced him out there was no time left for primaries, the established method of choosing a presidential candidate. \n\nThe intricacies of this system may baffle many. But the campaigning and debating do test and legitimatise a candidate in the eyes of the party and voters.\n\nEven at the late stage Mr Biden departed there was still time for at least a debate between Democrat hopefuls. To see who was best. \n\nInstead, Ms Harris was installed. \n\nThat was seen as unforgivable by some voters. \n\nIt also meant Ms Harris’ flaws didn’t come to fruition until it was too late. \n\nWitness what some have seen as the moment Ms Harris lost the election. Her October interview on US talk show The View. \n\nUtterly unexpectedly to her, it seemed, but in no way from leftfield for anyone else, came the simplest of questions: how would she differentiate herself from President Biden, given how low his approval ratings were?\n\n“Not a thing comes to mind,” she said. \n\nIt was a ludicrous response. Why on earth would you say you would make no changes when change was what polling said Americans wanted?\n\nIf a primary debate had taken place and Ms Harris had come up with this answer alongside other contenders, it’s very possible she wouldn’t have become the candidate. \n\nThe party should have known that divorcing Ms Harris from the Biden-Harris administration would be an impossible feat. \n\nTake the hot button issue of immigration. The Republicans characterised Ms Harris as Mr Biden’s failed “border tsar”. \n\nThat’s somewhat unfair. Her role was to work on the root causes of migration, not literally man the frontier. \n\nBut immigration was of importance to voters. She had four years to fix it, and she didn’t; why should voters trust that she would fix it given another four years?\n\nThere were other red flags aplenty about Ms Harris. \n\nA mere six months into her vice presidential term her approval ratings went into negative territory, and they never recovered. \n\nOther Democrats have far higher approval ratings. Josh Shapiro is the governor of Pennsylvania – you know, that state Ms Harris simply had to win, but didn’t. \n\nHis approval ratings have been consistently good. Heck, even around a quarter of Republicans in the state rate him.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is also popular within her state.\n\nNeither of them were part of the Biden administration and so could have offered a much more convincing answer to a question about what they would do differently.\n\nYet neither had the chance to go head-to-head with Ms Harris to test who the best candidate was before the campaign proper began.\n\nInstead, Ms Harris was tested when the campaign was underway. And in too many ways, she came up wanting.\n\nOf course there are other, more insidious, factors at play. \n\nAccording to a YouGov poll from last month, 14 per cent of Americans simply do not believe women are as qualified as men to be president. Among Trump supporters that rises to one third.\n\nIt would be foolish to suggest sexism and racism played no role in the voting choices of some Americans, even if it was among a minority.\n\nThat is of course not to suggest a major US party should never have a female presidential candidate. The country right next door to the US, Mexico, elected a woman president in June. She got 61 per cent of the vote. \n\nThe road is undoubtedly tougher, however. \n\nEven if Ms Harris was the perfect candidate who never once stumbled – which she wasn’t – she still may have lost due to the messy, seemingly undemocratic, process by which she was nominated and her closeness to an unpopular president.\n\nThe question Democrats on social media should be asking is how the hell was it that their own party let this happen?","summary":"Democrats are in a state of shock and bewilderment as to how Kamala Harris lost perhaps they need to face up to the truth.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/time-to-accept-harsh-truth-about-kamala-harris/news-story/4a2bb2ae7cf1b2612643f06b7e3cfb29?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b63b5e4e1fb95c12932b7a0381c0f266","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:26:37","author":"Benedict Brook","authors":["Benedict Brook"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.429},{"id":263660918,"title":"Trump plans to rehire Tom Homan, father of family separation policy, to tackle immigration","text":"With Donald Trump headed back to the White House, the Republican is likely to turn to a familiar, highly controversial face to oversee his signature issue of immigration.\n\nTom Homan, who served as the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) between 2017 and 2018, is considered one of the key architects of the first Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” family separation policy. \n\nUnder the initiative, immigration officials broke with the longstanding practice of keeping migrant families together and out of detention, instead sending parents to immigration court for removal proceedings and children to the care of a separate agency. \n\nImmigration offenses are considered civil violations, not criminal ones, and many of the families first presented as asylum-seekers, but they were soon on the fast track out of the country.\n\nThe practice separated at least 5,000 families, many permanently, as parents were sent abroad and the Trump administration initially declined to keep track of where they ended up. As of this May, an estimated 1,400 families remained apart.\n\nTrump has been eager to bring Homan, a Project 2025 contributor, back into the fold, telling a radio host during the campaign, “He’s coming on board.”\n\nThat would mean Homan would likely be involved in Trump’s stated goal of carrying out the “largest deportation operation in American history” through federal, state, and local law enforcement by invoking the same 1798 law used to carry out mass Japanese internment during WWII. \n\nAs Homan boasted during a conference in July, “They ain’t seen s*** yet...Wait until 2025.”\n\nWhen asked in a recent ‘60 Minutes’ interview about whether that operation would entail returning to family separation, Homan suggested it “needs to be considered absolutely.”\n\n\"Their parent absolutely entered the country illegally, had a child knowing he was in the country illegally,” Homan explained. “So he created that crisis.\"\n\nAccording to reporting from The Atlantic, Homan may have been the first government official to seriously propose intentional family separation back in 2014, though officials dismissed this at the time as “heartless and impractical,” given both the moral and logistical costs of separating children from their families. \n\nThe proposal later found a receptive ear in Donald Trump, who launched his 2016 campaign demonizing Mexican migrants as drug dealers and rapists and made cracking down on immigration a signature issue.\n\nHoman told The Atlantic he was inspired to propose the family separation idea after witnessing the aftermath of grisly trafficking and violence on the border.\n\n“The goal wasn’t to traumatize,” he told the magazine. “The goal was to stop the madness, stop the death, stop the rape, stop the children dying, stop the cartels doing what they’re doing.”\n\nSince then, he’s taken on a more belligerent tone.\n\n“I’m sick and tired of hearing about the family separation,” Homan said at a conference last year. “I’m still being sued over that.” \n\n“I don’t give a s***, right? Bottom line is, we enforced the law.”\n\nSince retiring from the Trump administration, Homan has been a fixture on Fox News, where he describes immigration as an “invasion.” Border states like Texas have pushed to declare immigration an “invasion” to free up additional military-style powers to police the border, which experts have told The Independent is a view unfounded in the law.\n\nHoman has also served in a group of border experts called Border911, which has traveled the country promoting the idea, which many argue is racist, that Democrats are intentionally encouraging illegal immigration to secure political power.\n\nBorder911 has backed initiatives like Prop 314 in Arizona, which passed this year, allowing state and local officials to act as immigration officials, normally the duty of the federal government. \n\nThe group, according to reporting from the Texas Observer, was previously part of the America Project, a group founded by pro-Trump election deniers Patrick Byrne, former CEO of Overstock.com, and Michael Flynn, Trump’s disgraced, QAnon-following former national security adviser. \n\nPeople affiliated with the border group have private businesses that receive government contracts and provide consulting on immigration issues and could stand to gain from a new administration promoting hardline immigration policies.\n\nThe Biden administration indeed presided over record levels of migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in late 2023, but levels have since returned to less than half of their peak during the Trump administration.","summary":"Homan presided over unprecedented ‘zero tolerance’ family separation program that severed thousands of migrant families, in some cases permanently","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-tom-homan-immigration-border-b2644077.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/13/17/homan-ice.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/J5gpGRuS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:26:10","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.5},{"id":263663216,"title":"Trump’s Tuesday Triumph Was Beyond Epic","text":"“Look what happened!

No one can dismiss the Make America Great Again movement as a cult, a ruse, or the result of some Kremlin-authored algorithm. The facts have flattened the Left’s excuses, fantasies, and hoaxes:\n\n• At this writing, Trump has won 295 Electoral College votes?. Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris took 226.\n\n• Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin went Trump’s way. Ironically, vote tabulation continues glacially in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada. Trump’s leads there should carry him to 312 electoral votes. \n\n• Trump is now the first Republican to win the popular vote since G.W. Bush in 2004. As of Friday, at 4:15 p.m., according to the Associated Press, Trump scored 73,590,230 votes (50.7%) or 4,318,557 over 69,271,673 votes (47.7%) for Harris. \n\n• Trump also won a full majority, not a mere plurality, as did Bill Clinton in 1992 (43%) and 1996 (49.2%) and G.W. Bush in 2000 (47.9%).\n\n• Trump improved in Democrat states that he lost in 2020:\n\nNew Mexico, up 5.1%\n\nConnecticut: 6%\n\nIllinois: 8.5%\n\nMassachusetts: 8.6%\n\nMaryland: 10.3%\n\nNew Jersey: 10.9%\n\nNew York: 11.6% \n\nCalifornia: 12%\n\n• In the Golden State counties of Butte, Nevada, Fresno, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Inyo, San Bernardino, and Orange, voters switched from Democrat in 2020 to Republican.\n\n• In New York City, Trump boosted his 2020 showing by 10.83% on Manhattan, 12.57% in Brooklyn, 15.24% on Staten Island, 21.59% in Queens, and 21.96% in the Bronx. The New York Post called Trump’s Bronx and Queens totals “a staggering improvement in two of the most diverse places on the planet for a candidate decried by his opponents as a craven racist.” Nearby, Trump won suburban Nassau County (52% to 47%) — a GOP first since 1992.\n\n• For a man whom the morally repugnant Left calls Adolf Hitler, Jr., Trump saw his Jewish support rise from 24% in 2016 to 30% in 2020 to 32% on Tuesday, according to 2024 Fox News Voter Analysis. Trump won 38% of the Jewish vote in Arizona, 42% in Nevada, and 46% in New York.\n\n• Trump won 16% of the black vote, up from 8% in 2016 and 12% in 2020. Tuesday’s total included 9% of black women (matching 9% in 2020) and 24% of black men (up from 19%). Rural Anson County, North Carolina, is 40% black. It has backed the Republican nominee only twice since Reconstruction: Richard Milhous Nixon in 1972 and Trump in 2024.\n\n• Among Hispanics, Trumped soared from 28% in 2016 to 32% in 2020 to 42% in 2024. Trump became the first Republican to take Cubanesque Miami-Dade County since 1988. Trump on Tuesday won 14 of 18 Texas counties abutting Mexico. He flipped Starr County, Texas by 16%. Newsweek calls it “America’s most Hispanic county,” with 97% in that demographic. Trump is the first Republican to win Starr since 1892 — the year Grover Cleveland took his second, non-consecutive term.\n\nSo much for Democrats’ bird-brained strategy of wooing American Hispanics by inviting illegal aliens who “look like them” to invade, impoverish, and terrorize this country.\n\n• The alleged woman-hating Trump saw his female support grow from 41% in 2016 to 42% in 2020 to 46% this week. Are these pro-Trump women misogynists? Meanwhile, Harris scored only 43% of men’s ballots. Does she hate men?\n\nTrump on Thursday named his buoyant campaign chief, Susie Wiles, as his new White House chief of staff. Wiles will become the first woman in that role. No Democrat president ever trusted women enough to appoint one of them to lead his team. Trump just did. What a misogynist!\n\nWhile the Left whimpers, moans, weeps, chops off its hair, and launches an anti-sex strike, a few Democrats have sifted a sliver of self-awareness from the sands of defeat.\n\n“Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far Left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, blacks, Asians, and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like ‘Defund the Police’ or ‘From the River to the Sea’ or ‘Latinx,’” Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., wrote Wednesday via X. \n\n“There is more to lose than there is to gain politically from pandering to a far left that is more representative of Twitter, Twitch, and TikTok than it is of the real world,” he continued. “The working class is not buying the ivory-towered nonsense that the far left is selling.”\n\nIndeed, the American people shouted an ear-shattering, “HELL NO!” to the Democrats’ puerile program.\n\nThis election was a massive, peanut-allergy-like reaction against the Left’s entire product line: Border destruction, freebies for illegal aliens, sky-high prices for citizens, free-range shoplifters, Climatarianism, gas-stove bans, mandatory electric vehicles, racial fetishism, FBI-fueled censorship, lawfare, weaponized government, tampons in boys’ rooms, penises in girls’ locker rooms, child sexual mutilation, discarded parental rights, “saving” pet squirrels by killing them, pro-Hamas chaos, Iranian missiles fired at Israel, Houthi rockets igniting the Red Sea, a Chinese balloon spying on American military facilities, and a whole nauseating lot more.\n\nThe American people screamed a clear and convincing “Yes!” to Trump, Republicans, and their America First agenda: Reverence for the American Founding, a restored US-Mexico frontier, a complete southern-border wall, immediate expulsion of illegal-alien criminals, mass deportation of the other illegal aliens, hugs and opportunities for legal immigrants, permanent Trump tax cuts, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, No Tax on Social Security benefits, fiscal sanity, a War on Government Waste, energy dominance, a red light for the Green New Deal, one-track justice, consequences for criminals, school choice, Death to DEI, color-neutral government, Transgenderism in the trash, Peace through Strength, an Israeli win in Gaza, more Abraham Accords, Ukraine at peace, Russia back in its borders, Iran back in a box, North Korea back in talks, China back in check, and America’s enemies on their backs.\n\nBefore advancing the policy agenda that he won a mandate to deliver, Trump began to harmonize the United States.\n\n“We’re going to help our country heal,” Trump told his supporters in Palm Beach at 2:30 a.m. on Wednesday. “We will make America safe, strong, prosperous, powerful, and free again.” \n\n“I’m asking every citizen all across our land to join me in this noble and righteous endeavor. It’s time to put the divisions of the past four years behind us. It’s time to unite…Success will bring us together.” The 45th and (soon) 47th President of the United States concluded: “This will truly be the golden age of America.”\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

As usual, two men were battling it. It was a time in America when a woman’s career was basically confined to classrooms, offices, hospitals or airplanes.\n\nThree years later, when women were being hired to replace young men going off to Vietnam, I got a back-door break and became a reporter. Although I did not burn my bra or march in the streets, I embraced the birth of the women’s liberation movement in the 1960s and looked forward to leaving the minefield women faced of less pay, longer hours and tearjerker “women’s stories” assigned by male editors.\n\nIn 1972, Shirley Chisholm, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, would become an early trailblazer, making history as the first African American woman to seek a major party presidential nomination.\n\nBut it wasn’t until 1984, when a woman named “Gerry” — U.S. Sen. Geraldine Ferraro — would find a place on a major party ticket, chosen by Dem presidential contender Fritz Mondale as his veepmate.\n\nMondale had tipped the national corps that he’d narrowed his choice to two women, one a blonde (Ferraro) and the other a brunette (San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein).\n\nThree words from an impeccable source gave me a brief exclusive national scoop.\n\n“It’s the blonde.”\n\nIn a Time magazine interview, Mondale later talked about what Ferraro endured on the campaign trail.\n\n“We went down to Mississippi, and some old farmer said, ‘Young lady, do you make good blueberry muffins?’\n\n“And she said, ‘Yes. Do you?’\n\n“She had to keep her cool. She had to be nice about it. And yet she was undergoing a revolution.”\n\nThe ‘revolution’ will not be rushed\n\nIt would be nearly a quarter of a century — and a new millennium — before another woman would make it that far. When Vietnam War hero John McCain selected Alaska Republican Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, I initially lent some support to her candidacy — and got shellacked for it.\n\nWith her big glasses and red lipstick, Palin was emerging as a possible new quintessential female role model — a hunter with a college degree, who didn’t always wear highly tailored outfits and liked talking about her five kids.\n\n“Hmmm. Maybe . . . I am not a feminist after all,” I wrote at the time.\n\n“What fault is there in admiring a woman who is against abortion -- even though I believe in freedom of choice?\n\n“What’s wrong with huge respect for a woman who chose to give birth to a Down syndrome child knowing full well what was in store for her and her family?\n\n“So what if she’s a Republican?”\n\nIt didn’t take long for Palin to go poof. She proved a mighty embarrassment to McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\n\n‘More work to do’\n\nThen in 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first woman to finally make it to the top of a major party ticket — only to lose to Trump.\n\n“Where do I begin?” I wrote that November.\n\n“That I’m furious the chances of a woman being elected president in my lifetime are actuarially now slim to none!\n\n“That a man who embraced the dark side of humor, racism and fear was able to lure an army of frustrated rural Americans to a place they rarely frequent: the voting booth?\n\n“When Clinton delivered her concession speech, she reminded all of us ‘not to grow weary and lose heart for there was more work to do.’\n\n“’For there are more seasons to come,’” she said.\n\nAnd now, I’m 80, and once again, we are approaching winter in the wake of a gargantuan failure to elect a good and qualified woman, Vice President Kamala Harris, to lead our country.\n\nOn and on it will go, as pundits and experts analyze why the Democratic Party just stumbled again on America’s political battlefield.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, they’ll come up with an acceptable answer to why a woman has yet to become president.\n\nBut remembering Dad’s advice so many years ago, I won’t be holding my breath.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/11/08/sneed-sunday-kamala-harris-shirley-chisholm-ferraro-palin-hillary-clinton-women-president","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d0d0bd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4713+0+285/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F62%2F584311ef4a72804002ab04b891f8%2F2182","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:18:59","author":"Michael Sneed","authors":["Michael Sneed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.148},{"id":263659950,"title":"Bloodshed in Ukraine to end soon, Musk says","text":"NEW YORK, November 8. /TASS/.

The president lost, and Starr County turned blue for over 130 years, until the 2024 presidential election. \n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump earned 9,443 votes in the county, which is 97% Hispanic or Latino, and Kamala Harris received 6,845 votes, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s office. \n\nStarr County is located in the Rio Grande Valley and is one of 18 Texas counties that sits on or within 20 miles of Mexico’s border. Trump won 14 out of the 18 Texas border counties, many of which were Democrat strongholds. \n\nStarr, Hidalgo, Willacy, and Cameron counties comprise most of the Rio Grande Valley. Despite voting for Joe Biden in 2020, Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008, all four Rio Grande Valley counties supported Trump in 2024. \n\nTrump’s victory in the valley “is historic,” Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said during a recent conversation on “The Daily Signal Podcast.” \n\nTrump’s victory in the border counties, which have a large Hispanic population, is due in part to his strong performance among Latino voters. \n\nIn fact, 46% of Latino voters in the U.S. backed Trump in 2024, up from 34% in 2020, according to Reuters. Trump performed especially well among Hispanic males, who supported him with 55% of their vote.\n\nHe won more Latino voters than any Republican president in recent history, and the big question is, Why? \n\nThe Border \n\n“Biden and Harris throwing the border open and allowing millions upon millions to stream in for a reason that we haven’t yet really understood was the deciding factor,” said Gonzalez, author of “A Race for the Future: How Conservatives Can Break the Liberal Monopoly on Hispanic Americans.” \n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have encountered more than 10 million illegal aliens at America’s borders under the Biden-Harris administration. \n\nThe “invasion” at the southern border “created a sense of chaos,” Frank Lopez, former Border Patrol agent and Val Verde County, Texas, resident told The Daily Signal. Lopez’s county border’s Mexico and also voted for Trump in 2024 and 2020, but for Clinton in 2016. \n\n“The reason we elected Trump is because one thing that’s respected is doing what you say you’re going to do,” Lopez said, speaking for those in the Hispanic American community. “Trump, one thing he did was, the border was under control.” \n\nTraditional Values \n\nMuch of the Hispanic community holds conservative values, says Lopez, who ran to be the Republican candidate for Texas’ 23rd Congressional District in 2024 but lost in the primary to incumbent Tony Gonzales.\n\n“The woke LGBTQ stuff does not sit well with very traditional family-centric morals and values,” Lopez said. \n\nThe Biden-Harris administration has promoted an LGBTQ agenda throughout the federal government and recently introduced a rule change to Title IX of the Education Amendments to redefine “sex” to include gender identify and sexual orientation. Such a change that includes these categories under sex discrimination prohibitions in federally funded education programs would swing the door open for men who identity as women to compete in women’s sports and enter female-only spaces such as locker rooms, and vice versa. \n\nLopez added that pro-life Hispanic voters also saw Trump as the “lesser of two evils” on the issue of abortion. \n\n“Texas IS getting more red,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote on X Friday in response to a map showing an increasing number of Texas counties turning red in the last three elections.\n\n“One big reason is that Hispanics in Texas have realized that Republicans align with their values of faith, family, freedom, and free enterprise,” Abbott wrote. “They support capitalism & pro-energy production policies & no boys in girls sports.”\n\nPatriotism \n\nTrump is “proud to be an American,” Lopez said. \n\n“He loves America. He believes in America. He believes that we can get it done through hard work, having a vision and pursuing it, and that resounds with the [Hispanic] community,” he said. \n\nBecause many Hispanics families have a family member who served in the military, a sense of patriotism is a “huge component of why we go for him.” \n\nAsked if the shift to the right among Hispanic voters is indicative of a permanent change, Gonzalez said it is too soon to know for sure. \n\nRegarding policy issues, he says Hispanic voters are “just Americans,” adding, “They want the same things that all the other Americans want.”","summary":"In 1892, Starr County, Texas, voted to reelect Republican President Benjamin Harrison.

And so, she never convinced the electorate that she would not flip back to her earlier radicalism once elected or even in defeat finishing out her vice-presidential term.\n\nThere were three damning realities that even if Harris had been a gifted politician and an adept speaker, she could never have changed.\n\nOne, Harris was preposterously running as a turn-the-page, new-generation candidate.\n\nBut why had she not sought to implement such a “new chapter” for the prior 45 months as an incumbent vice president, especially while in office during the campaign itself?\n\nVoters knew the answer: The entire Biden-Harris tenure was an utter, far left-wing disaster, one for which the radical Harris 1.0 had for three-plus years claimed co-ownership.\n\nTwo, why did Harris avoid all impromptu interviews and the media for most of the campaign—only to reverse course and seek out reporters when her polls eroded?\n\nDid it hurt Harris more to avoid the media—or meet with reporters and thus confirm her inanity to millions of viewers and listeners?\n\nThree, why did Harris serially lie to America that Biden was hale and vigorous as president—until hours before his senility prompted leftist donors and party insiders to force him off the ticket?\n\nAnd why could she not declare her independence from the historically unpopular Biden?\n\nHarris instead chose to terrify voters to vote against a demonized and “fascist” Trump rather than to vote for Harris and her make-believe agendas.\n\nBut even in demonizing Trump, the maladroit Harris hit a wall.\n\nBy campaign’s end, Trump’s favorables were often higher than her own.\n\nHis prior four years as president polled higher than the current Biden-Harris train wreck.\n\nTrump, the purported “racist,” won more Hispanic and black voters than past “moderate” Republicans such as Bob Dole, John McCain, or Mitt Romney.\n\nIt was hard to damn Trump as a crazy fascist when iconic liberal figures, like Robert Kennedy Jr. or Tulsi Gabbard, were campaigning for him.\n\nTrump had reinvented the Republican Party by substituting ecumenical, middle-class solidarity for polarizing racial tribalism. Elitist Democrats were left to cater to the interests of their well-off and very rich donors as well as the subsidized poor.\n\nFinally, workaholic Trump campaigned nonstop for two years, won all the Republican primaries, and was endorsed by his two chief primary rivals.\n\nIn contrast, the Harris “nomination” was the product of a coup that, in 48 hours, removed from the ticket an incumbent president, nullified the will of his 14 million primary voters, and coronated Harris, who had neither won nor ever entered a primary.\n\nThat late July forced abdication of Biden lent an air of illegitimacy to Harris’s candidacy, as well as truncating the time available to campaign.\n\nFinally, Harris’ first major decision was to nominate as her vice president the buffoonish and inept Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. His radicalism, serial lying, and herky-jerky “weirdness” proved a force multiplier of her own mediocrity.\n\nIn contrast, the calm, empathetic, and astute Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate, eviscerated Walz in their sole debate and did the same to the media.\n\nAdd it all up—and Harris and her star-crossed candidacy were simply and rightly doomed.\n\n(C) 2024 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Phil Murphy highlighted the opportunities that exist to bring together diverse perspectives and stakeholders from both sides of the aisle.\n\n“As we look toward the future, our administration is committed to working with President Trump wherever we can to advance New Jersey’s interests just as we did throughout his first term,” Murphy said on Nov. 6. “Our commitment, again, is not to any person or party, but to the people of New Jersey and to the rule of law.” \n\nHe expressed gratitude for Trump’s assistance in greenlighting an infrastructure project in his first term and for his administration’s partnership during the pandemic, saying he’ll “never forget their help.” \n\n“So today, at a time of great division in our nation, when the bonds between our fellow citizens have grown so frayed, let New Jersey be united in making our state and ... our nation the best place to live, work, and raise a family.” \n\nForging relationships that serve multiple purposes and offer widespread benefits is a priority, he said. \n\n“We’re going to fight for what we believe is being attacked ... and we won’t pull punches on that front, but we will embrace where we can find common ground, and we’ve been able to do that and kept that up,” Murphy said. “Just as it is our responsibility to continue to stand up against any threat to our state or to our people, it is also our responsibility to take any opportunity that presents itself to work with the president to protect and uplift the people of our state because that is what responsible leaders do.” \n\nWashington State\n\nWashington’s incoming and outgoing governors said the Evergreen State is prepared to sue the Trump administration if its values are challenged, after having filed 97 lawsuits during Trump’s first four years in office.\n\n“Many are understandably worried about the outcome of the presidential election, but Washingtonians know we’ve been here before,” Gov. Jay Inslee said in a statement. “Our state and others formed enduring alliances for progress during Trump’s first term in office, and we will continue to push the needle of progress for a more perfect union.” \n\nGovernor-elect Bob Ferguson said in a Nov. 7 press conference that his administration is ready to take on the federal government if necessary.\n\nDuring Trump’s first tenure, 160 multistate lawsuits were filed against his administration. About 60 such suits were filed against President Joe Biden, the second-highest total in at least the last 40 years, according to data compiled by Paul Nolette, an associate professor at Marquette University. \n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey also voiced a willingness to challenge the new administration on immigration policies, telling other media outlets that state police will not cooperate with requests from the federal government to participate in operations to deport illegal immigrants.

And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was “a lot of talk about massive cheating” in Pennsylvania — which officials said had “no factual basis whatsoever.” \n\nBut as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.\n\n“I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,” said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they’re not pushed anymore.”\n\nThe shift was stark in Elon Musk’s “Election Integrity Community,” a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner’s political action committee encouraging members to report “voter fraud or irregularities.” \n\nThe group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAfter that, the posting drastically diminished. \n\nRead’s team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning. \n\nOn Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.\n\nDanielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public’s research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state’s election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.\n\n“On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,” Tompson said. “The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.”\n\nWhile the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead. \n\nMeanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million “missing votes.” On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it’s grounds for a recount. \n\nBut the volume of posts questioning Harris’s loss was nowhere near the “Stop the Steal” efforts that followed Trump’s 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read’s research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.\n\n“A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,” Harris said. “And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.”","summary":"By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.  Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples &#8230;\n\n\nThe post When Trump&#8217;s victory became clear, online claims of election fraud quieted appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/when-trumps-victory-became-clear-online-claims-of-election-fraud-quieted/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/08/99549f97-674c-4a73-89d4-d9d38a0aa822/thumbnail/1200x630/b8d26b183b710521fd6fd990e7cddbbc/gettyimages-2183267787.jpg?v=c1d30b1df13c40bf65c6c1e6d9ac4ad7","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:12:17","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":263663352,"title":"Donald Trump and Ted Cruz scored big wins in Texas, but the president-elect outperformed the senator on his own turf","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz dominated their respective races in Texas this year, widening their margins of victory compared to previous races by making considerable inroads across the state’s border counties, areas traditionally viewed as Democratic strongholds.\n\nTrump bested Vice President Kamala Harris by 14 percentage points in Texas, a significant increase from his 5-point advantage over President Joe Biden in 2020 and his 9-point lead over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Cruz, meanwhile, defeated U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Dallas Democrat, by 9 percentage points, a more comfortable victory than his 2018 performance when he barely edged out Democrat Beto O’Rourke.\n\nTrump and Cruz’s gains along the border came after the Republican party invested heavily in garnering support in South Texas, a majority Hispanic area where Democrats spent less time campaigning. Trump and Cruz both held onto their voter bases in red, rural counties and increased their share of votes from the border. Trump’s support in the border grew from 41% in 2020 to 55% in 2024 while Cruz’s increased from 33% in 2018 to 45% this year.\n\nTrump’s edge over Cruz reflects a common trend of presidential candidates carrying the ticket and receiving the highest number of votes, said Joshua Blank, director of research for the Texas Politics Project. And it also reflects Trump’s unique advantage winning over young male voters.\n\n“This is another example of how 2020 was a very odd election,” Blank said, noting that U.S. Sen. John Cornyn received more votes than Trump that year. “Cornyn’s performance was almost certainly a reflection of Trump’s handling of the pandemic, not a reflection of an underlying shift in the electorate.”\n\nBlank added the relative strengths of the candidates Trump and Cruz faced may have also played into their different margins of victory. Allred, who was virtually unknown prior to his Senate campaign, presented himself as a moderate candidate who worked across both sides of the aisle. Cruz tried to portray Allred as a liberal candidate who wanted to let boys play on girls sports teams.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, was seen as a liberal candidate, in part because of her background and her association with the Biden administration.\n\nAn October survey by the Texas Politics Project found that 80% of likely Republicans voters identified Harris as “extremely liberal.” In contrast, only 45% of likely Republican voters characterized Allred that way.\n\n“Allred was a more palatable choice for people uncomfortable with Cruz than Harris was for people uncomfortable with Trump,” Blank said.\n\nIn big, blue, urban counties like Harris and Dallas, Trump managed to pull more votes than in previous elections, lessening Harris’ advantage in the state’s most populous regions.\n\nTrump and Cruz also benefited from a drop in voter turnout this year in the Democratic strongholds.\n\nIn a handful of counties — including border counties such as Webb and Hidalgo as well as larger fast-growing areas like Williamson and Tarrant — the gap in support for Trump and Cruz resulted in a split ticket, where Trump and Allred both won.\n\nFor some voters in the Republican party, Allred was a viable alternative to Cruz.\n\n“There are people in his own party who detest him, who think he’s insincere,” said Jon Taylor, a political science professor at the University of Texas San Antonio. “People remember that he fled to Cancun in 2021” during winter storm Uri.","summary":"Cruz beat his challenger by 9 points, while Trump prevailed over his by 14 points.

JB Pritzker pledged Illinois is ready to withstand any retribution on issues such as immigration and reproductive rights from Republican President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nNoting he’s been called a “happy warrior,” Pritzker said during press availability Thursday that “anyone who intends to come take away the freedom and opportunity and dignity of Illinois, I would remind you that a happy warrior is still a warrior.\n\n“You come for my people, you come through me.”\n\nThere’s been no love lost between the former president and the governor, whose scorn amplified over Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Trump, who was reelected Tuesday, meanwhile has commented on social media that Pritzker has destroyed Illinois.\n\nPritzker noted Illinois enshrined a woman’s right to an abortion in the state Constitution after Trump appointees on the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The General Assembly also affirmed workers’ and LGBTQ rights, and environmental protections, he said.\n\n“Chaos, retribution and disarray radiated from the White House the last time Donald Trump occupied it. Perhaps this time may be different. But if it isn’t, Illinois will remain a place of stability and competent governance,” Pritzker said.\n\n“Illinois has remained a place where rights are protected and that everyone can call home.”\n\nAsked if the state could lose federal aid for projects like O’Hare International Airport or CTA Red Line construction, Pritzker said he expected that funding to continue and that future grants would be administered impartially.\n\n“It would be illegal for Trump to stop those grants from flowing in,” Pritzker said, adding the state would take legal action if that happened.\n\nIt’s been speculated that Pritzker is ready for a presidential run.\n\nHowever, “the work that I do now as governor is work I love doing and in the wake of Tuesday’s election, I think back to my first days in office and the first two years when Donald Trump was president and we had to defend Illinois against a lot of policies Trump was imposing.\n\n“I think that work is going to continue. I have no plans for anything else.”\n\nPritzker also addressed Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump.\n\nWith little over 100 days to campaign, “that’s an extraordinarily short amount of time.

Some witnesses claim that the Israeli fans were ‘up for a fight’, and provoked the violence by tearing down a Palestinian flag in the centre of a city where 13 per cent of the population is Muslim, as well as indulging in anti-Palestinian chants.\n\nPerhaps some Israeli visitors did help to stoke the unrest – if so, this is reprehensible. Yet such assertions are also in keeping with the pattern we see so often with anti-Semitic violence, in which the perpetrators paint themselves as victims pushed beyond the limits of endurance by their Zionist oppressors.\n\nBut there is no doubt about the reality of the attacks on the Maccabi fans. Many were chased, beaten and knifed. Some sought refuge in hotels, others leapt into the city’s famous canals for safety. At least five people were taken to hospital and 62 arrested.\n\nSo serious was the perceived danger that Israel dispatched two planes to the Netherlands to rescue the shaken fans.\n\nThe lessons of history do not seem to have been learned. Amsterdam is, after all, the city where Anne Frank hid from the Nazi occupiers before her death in Bergen-Belsen in 1945.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Third Reich, Europe’s politicians repeatedly said that nothing like the Holocaust should ever be allowed to happen again. Yet through their folly on migration, their reluctance to defend Europe’s heritage and their impulse to appease Islamist fanaticism, these political leaders are now creating a continent where Jews increasingly no longer feel safe.\n\nIt is bitterly ironic that Europe’s ruling elite justifies its obsession with cultural diversity and demographic upheaval by harping on about its commitment to tolerance, yet in reality this strategy is fuelling rampant intolerance.\n\nIn another terrible historic irony, the savagery in Amsterdam came two days before the anniversary of Kristallnacht in 1938, the most brutal of all the Nazis’ pre-war anti-Jewish pogroms. Yet too many progressive politicians, pundits and policy-makers refuse to face up to this truth about intolerance.\n\nInstead, they heap all the blame for divisions on the ‘far-Right’ or populist demagogues, while remaining attached to their disastrous open-door policies.\n\nIn an inversion of morality, they ignore the rising tide of jihadist anti-Semitism in front of their own eyes, yet hysterically accuse Donald Trump of being a ‘fascist’ or a second Hitler because he wants to tighten border controls in the US.\n\nGlobalise the Intifada’ is one of the slogans of the Palestinian movement. Tragically, that demand is now being realised due to mass migration and institutional cowardice, as we can see in the endless Palestinian demonstrations in our cities, or in the disturbing surge of anti-Semitism since October last year.\n\nAccording to one study, there were no fewer than 5,500 incidents of abusive behaviour towards Jews in Britain last year, the highest ever total.\n\nReferring to the Middle East recently, President Macron of France said: ‘We must not import this conflict.’ But that is exactly what Europe’s rulers have done – and the consequences were all too clearly displayed in Amsterdam this week.","summary":"The appalling scenes of violence in Amsterdam following the game between home&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/violent-incidents-after-ajax-and-maccabi-tel-aviv-match-in-anne-franks-city-highlight-a-failure-to-heed-historical-lessons-leo-mckinstry-comments/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/08/21/91869443-14061151-image-a-64_1731102423141.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:08:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":263659570,"title":"Lifeline for Ukraine as Zelensky has 25-minute phone call with Trump AND Elon Musk about US support during Russia war","text":"UKRAINE has been given a lifeline after Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with Donald Trump and Elon Musk over the phone this week.\n\nThe powerful trio reportedly spent 25 minutes on the phone together as President-elect Trump vowed to support Ukraine in their continued fight against Russia. \n\nUkraine is waiting with bated breath for the Republican's next move following his historic election win.\n\nIt comes amid speculation Trump may leave the war-torn nation in a precautions position by favouring his pal Vladimir Putin's wishes.\n\nZelensky was believed to be calling up Trump to congratulate him on the landslide victory on Wednesday. \n\nDuring the chat Trump gave Zelensky reassurance saying he would support Ukraine, Axios reported.\n\nTrump said he didn’t plan on abandoning Ukraine in light of the conflict but wanted to “give diplomacy a chance”, report US media.\n\nThe 78-year-old followed up with: “I promise you will be happy with me.\"\n\nMusk -

with his plan on how to achieve that now being revealed.\n\nHe would freeze the conflict in place and establish a demilitarised zone down the locked front line, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nKyiv would not join Nato for 20 years, but the US would continue to arm Ukraine to the teeth to prevent Putin from invading again.\n\nWho would police the demilitarised zone remains unclear, according to the sources, but it wouldn't involve American troops or an international body.\n\nIt remains unclear if the Ukrainians approve of the plan\n\nOne man is likely to be less than impressed by the phone call is Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe congratulated Trump on Thursday before labelling him a \"real man\" as he spoke to reporters in Sochi.\n\nPutin's acknowledgement of Trump's landslide win came just after top Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov spoke on the Republican's desire to end the war in Ukraine within days.\n\nDuring his turbulent campaign Trump confidently announced he plans to end the conflict in Europe within 24 hours of being in office.\n\nPeskov called Trump's comments an “overexaggeration”.\n\nDespite the remark he did say Trump’s administration will be better placed to try and solve the conflict than Joe Biden's.\n\nPeskov said: “Of course, there was a little bit of overexaggeration that he would be able to do it overnight.\n\n“Certainly, there’s nothing that can heal this problem overnight.\n\n“But at least if the new administration is going to look for peace, not for the continuation of the war, it will be better.”\n\nTrump has previously been accused of harbouring close ties with Russia and Putin - something he has always strongly denied as a \"hoax\".\n\nDuring his time in the White House, Trump managed to keep Russia on his side and kept Putin at bay.\n\nBut early on during Biden's reign Vlad launched his invasion.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/13832280/lifeline-ukraine-zelensky-phone-call-trump-elon-musk/","image":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-k09z921ck-1731110472531.jpg?1731110981&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-09 00:08:44","author":"Georgie English","authors":["Georgie English"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":263659384,"title":"Emmy award winner from iconic 1970s sitcom looks unrecognizable at 77 as she bikes around LA","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Nov 9th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs floods kill hundreds in Spain, why locals believe the appalling devastation around Valencia was the result of the EU's eco-zealotry, which ripped out the historic dams that would have prevented the catastrophe\n\nGeorgina Cooper died 'after suddenly falling ill on holiday': Supermodel, 46, passed away in hospital while on trip to Kos with her husband just months after they got married, friend reveals\n\nHas Andrew foiled the King's bid to force him out of Royal Lodge?

'They didn't have good manners at the table. They reached over one another for food … and they talked about real things.\n'They peeled off the veneer. And you saw the less-than-perfect side of human beings. You saw the arguing and the vehemence and the bigotry. You can't put the genie back in the bottle now. Everything got more honest after that.'\nThe series ran from 1971 to 1979, and in the same interview which took place earlier this year, Struthers said the associated fame drastically changed her life.\n'It became apparent rather quickly that my life had completely turned upside down,' she told the outlet of how she could no longer go out to a simple lunch with Reiner without being mobbed by fans.\nAnd all of these decades later, doors are still opening for her in her career because of her life-changing role on All in the Family. \n\nThe Emmy Award-winning comedic actress, 77, looked strong and healthy in a red Hamilton the musical t-shirt and black leggings as she bent over the handlebars of the bicycle\n\nShe adhered to safety regulations by having a black helmet on and wore pink trainers and had a red jacket tied around her waist.\n\nStruthers played their daughter Gloria Stivic who was married to Michael 'Meathead' Stivic, played by Rob Reiner\n\n'It sounds like I'm bragging. I'm not bragging. I'm always dumbfounded,' she said. \n'I don't have to audition for theater. I get offered parts. I get people who call and say, 'We want Sally to do this for us this year.\n'And that's because they know that my name sells tickets and fills the seats,' she said incredulously. \n'That wouldn't have happened without the renown of 'All in the Family.' So, I'm grateful every day.'\nLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEmmy award winner from iconic 1970s sitcom looks unrecognizable at 77 as she bikes around LA\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDeclan Donnelly and his wife Ali Astall arrive in Australia for the new series of I'm A Celebrity as they head out for breakfast with their children\n\n'It truly pains me': Dua Lipa reveals she has cancelled an upcoming concert over safety concerns\n\nKirstie Allsopp set to inherit eye-watering amount from her father Charles' multi-million pound fortune following auctioneer's death aged 83\n\nEXCLUSIVEThey cut open my skull to remove my brain tumour, reveals CAPRICE.
