Here are some of the main points of the executive order and questions it raises.\n\nVoters would need to provide citizenship documents to register\n\nTrump’s order calls for the federal voter registration form to be amended so prospective voters must provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a birth certificate.\n\nIt also says states should turn over their voter lists and records of voter list maintenance to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency for review, and directs federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.\n\nIf states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants, the order says.\n\nNoncitizen voting, which is already a felony in federal elections that can lead to prison time and deportation, is exceedingly rare. Still, Trump falsely claimed in 2024 that it might happen in large enough numbers to sway the outcome of the presidential race, and it has been a top conservative priority in recent months.\n\nRepublicans have been trying to get a documentary proof of citizenship requirement through Congress, a goal this order seeks to accomplish. Voting rights groups have expressed concern about such a requirement, saying it could disenfranchise the millions of Americans who do not have proof of citizenship readily available.\n\nMail ballots would need to be received by Election Day\n\nThe order requires votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day and says federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nPerhaps no state is more notorious for drawn-out vote counts than California, the nation’s most populous. It allows ballots to be counted if they are received up to seven days following the election as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.\n\nMost California voters cast ballots they receive in the mail, and in the pursuit of accuracy, thoroughness and counting every vote, the state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks or even a month or more. In one Northern California U.S. House primary last year, a recount settled the outcome nearly two months after the election. At the time, Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who oversees elections, said in a statement: “I understand that people want finality, but accuracy is of utmost importance.”\n\nBut the extended tallies have raised fears that they could undercut, rather than bolster, voter confidence. In 2018, then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan described California’s election system as “bizarre” in a year when Democrats picked off a string of GOP-held House seats.\n\nIn a statement, California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said Trump’s order “does nothing to improve the safety of our federal elections — what it would do is disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.”\n\nPadilla, who formerly served as California’s chief elections officer, said Trump “lacks the authority to implement many of the changes laid out in this illegal executive order.”\n\nBallots could not rely on QR codes to be counted\n\nThe executive order instructs the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to protect election integrity. That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.\n\nTrump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.\n\nIn Georgia, an important presidential battleground, virtually all in-person voters use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter’s selections and a QR code, a type of barcode that is read by a scanner to count the votes.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and other jurisdictions throughout the country that use these machines.\n\nRepresentatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. The Georgia Legislature last year passed a law requiring that QR codes be removed from ballots by July 2026.\n\nForeign nationals would be barred from making donations\n\nThe order cracks down on foreign nationals contributing or donating in U.S. elections. It’s an issue that’s been bubbling in recent years in the states, as Republicans seek to dampen the influence of Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss.\n\nWyss, who lives in Wyoming, has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to 501(c) nonprofit organizations that support liberal causes. One of those groups, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, donated a combined $3.9 million to enshrine abortion protections in the Ohio Constitution. It also helped thwart a proposed constitutional amendment advanced by Ohio Republicans the previous summer that would have made passing future constitutional amendments harder.\n\nDuring the run-up to last year’s presidential election, legislative Republicans linked then-President Joe Biden’s appearance on Ohio’s fall ballot to passing a ban on contributions from foreign individuals, companies, governments or political parties to campaigns for or against proposed amendments to the state constitution.\n\nOther states have followed suit, most recently Kansas — which passed a nearly identical bill earlier this month after hearing testimony from Ohio’s secretary of state. Like the Ohio bill, it appears partly a response to a successful campaign to protect abortion rights in Kansas, which received money from the Sixteen Thirty Fund. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has not said publicly whether she’ll sign it.\n\nCan Trump do all this through executive order?\n\nThe federal government plays a fairly limited role in American elections. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution gives states the authority to determine the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. The so-called “Elections Clause” doesn’t get into the specifics of voting or ballot-counting procedures -– those details are left to the states – but it does give Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office.\n\nIt does not mention any role for the president or the executive branch in regulating elections. Biden issued an executive order in 2021 directing federal agencies to take steps to promote voting access, but Republicans at the time argued that the order was unconstitutional and exceeded the president’s authority. Trump rescinded the Biden order earlier this year.\n\nVoting rights advocates have begun to make similar arguments against Trump’s order.\n\n“A president does not set election law and never will,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, a grassroots advocacy organization that supports expanded voter access.\n\nSophia Lin Lakin, the director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, called core parts of the executive order “a blatant overreach that threatens to disenfranchise tens of millions of eligible voters.”\n\nGiven the nation’s long history of decentralized, state-run elections, any attempt to change state election laws by executive order is likely to face challenges in court. Marc Elias, a leading Democratic election and voting rights attorney, promised exactly that.\n\n“Moments ago, Donald Trump signed a massive voter suppression executive order,” he said in a social media post. “This will not stand. We will sue.”\n\nUltimately, the courts will decide how far Trump can go in overhauling election procedures.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael R.

Mr Hegseth also criticised the magazine and said: “Nobody was texting war plans.” (The National Security Council, in a valiant effort to snatch an honourable draw from the mess, described the messages as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy co-ordination between senior officials”.)\n\nThe controversy will have a strong political resonance in the US. The intense focus on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of private a email server for public communications some years ago seems almost innocent in comparison to this mess.\n\nReaders who may be chortling at the shenanigans in Washington DC should pause and consider the wider context involved here. If this is how the highest officials in the US operate, it does not augur well for any of us.\n\n Seán Rooney — Unacceptable wait for justice\n\nForeign affairs minister Simon Harris is visiting Lebanon this week, where he will meet with the Irish soldiers who are part of the long-standing Unifil peacekeeping force.\n\nHe will also meet with politicians in Lebanon to raise the killing of Irish soldier Private Seán Rooney, and the slow progress in bringing those responsible to justice.\n\nPt Rooney was shot and killed near the village of Al-Aqbiya south Lebanon in 2022, and while seven people have been indicted for the killing, only one of them has been detained.\n\n“I am looking forward to meeting the defence minister and the foreign affairs minister tomorrow where I will have an opportunity to raise the case of Private Seán Rooney,” said Mr Harris before leaving for Lebanon.\n\n“It is simply not acceptable to the Irish Government that it has taken so long to make progress in relation to the trial of those accused of the murder of Pt Rooney, and I look forward to conveying that in the strongest possible terms.”\n\nMr Harris is correct to describe this delay as unacceptable.\n\nIt is now almost two and a half years since Pt Rooney was killed, and his colleague, Trooper Shane Kearney, seriously injured, and since then the wheels of investigation, never mind justice, have turned very slowly.\n\nThe UN was itself criticised last year for not releasing crucial information to aid the inquest into Pt Rooney’s death, and it was as late as December 2024 when the UN made more details available to the Rooney family.\n\nPt Rooney made the ultimate sacrifice, saving the lives of his comrades as he drove them away from a confrontation in Lebanon.\n\nThe lack of progress in bringing his killers to justice is an insult to him and to his family.\n\n Chaos continues in speaking rights row\n\nAnother day, another feast of unruly scenes in the Dáil Chamber.\n\nAs expected, matters became heated very quickly in Leinster House yesterday, with the opposition and Government at loggerheads again over the issue of speaking time.\n\nIt would be an unnecessary cruelty to inflict too much detail on readers when they have already suffered so much on this front. Suffice to say the Government side was playing down the significance of speaking time and the opposition playing it up; one side called yesterday the “dark day of Irish democracy”, and the other side responded by saying that that description was “farcical”.\n\nAnd, right on cue, we had the suspension of the house due to the roaring.\n\n'Farce' looks like a reasonable description of the entire situation. This, the 34th Dáil, met for the first time on December 18, and this row ignited that day. Now it is three months later and the row is still rumbling along in the background. The public could be forgiven for a certain weariness with this nonsense by now.\n\nThere is no shortage of pressing issues to deal with, from the ongoing housing crisis, which shows no sign of abating, to the turmoil in Washington and its implications for us. There is Conor McGregor’s gross peacocking, and the fallout from conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nOur parliamentarians may have made their points about procedure, but they have opened themselves to a searching question. Is this intermittent chaos a true reflection of the operation of national politics? Because if it is — complete with grandstanding, name-calling, and roaring — then we have little chance of working out solutions to the real problems that face us.","summary":"Even for the most jaded news consumers, the latest developments in American politics come as a shock.\n            The Atlantic magazine editor ...","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41600566.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9110/4555447_1_seoimage1x1_US_20Trump_20175484A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 01:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":304146698,"title":"Rosie O’Donnell questions validity of Trump’s 2024 election win, wants Musk’s influence ‘investigated’","text":"Rosie O’Donnell says DOGE head Elon Musk’s involvement in President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential win should be investigated.\n\n“I question why the first time in American history a president has won every swing state and is also best friends and his largest donor was a man who owns and runs the Internet,” O’Donnell said Friday on Ireland’s The Late Late Show.\n\nShe appeared to be referring to Musk and his ownership of X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“I would hope that would be investigated and that we would see whether or not it was an anomaly or something else that happened on election night in America when Kamala Harris was filling up stadiums with people who supported her and Donald Trump was not able to do that,” she added.\n\n“So it’s curious to me,” she said. “And as an American and a believer in democracy, I would hope that we would be able to look at all of the reasons why this happened in our country.”\n\nWhen reached for comment about Musk by Fox News Digital, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers said, “America is better off without an unpatriotic, out-of-touch, and irrelevant celebrity like Rosie O’Donnell. Good riddance!”\n\nO’Donnell also said that she wrote an apology to Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin for the interaction with Trump at the White House earlier this month when a reporter asked him about her move to his country: “Why in the world would you let Rosie O’Donnell move to Ireland? I think she is going to lower your happiness.”\n\nBefore Martin could reply, Trump said, “That’s true. I like that question. Do you know you have Rosie O’Donnell? Do you know who she is? You’re better off not knowing.”\n\nThe former co-host of “The View” also knocked Trump signing an executive order Thursday to shut down the Department of Education.\n\n“He disbanded the Department of Education, and I have a child who has autism and that child will be denied services and many, many autistic children because the funding for these programs for special needs children comes from the federal government as well as the states,” O’Donnell said. \n\nShe added that the closing of the department would “be disastrous for children on the spectrum,” calling it “terrifying.”\n\nIn response to a comment request from Fox News Digital about O’Donnell’s concerns, the White House highlighted a Friday post from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nKennedy said his department “is fully prepared to take on the responsibility of supporting individuals with special needs and overseeing nutrition programs that were run by @usedgov. We are committed to ensuring every American has access to the resources they need to thrive. We will make the care of our most vulnerable citizens our highest national priority. Together, we will Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital in a statement, “President Trump is doing everything within his executive authority to dismantle the Department of Education and return education back to the states while safeguarding critical functions for students and families such as student loans, special needs programs, and nutrition programs. The President has always said Congress has a role to play in this effort, and we expect them to help the President deliver.” \n\nFox News Digital reached out to O’Donnell, but she declined further comment.","summary":"O'Donnell also knocked Trump signing an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/media/rosie-odonnell-questions-validity-of-trumps-2024-win-wants-elon-musk-investigated/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/2019-file-photo-shows-rosie-101101930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rSD5YWr3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:59:11","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":304148136,"title":"Sarah Harte: It would be foolish to dismiss Conor McGregor's political aspirations","text":"Last week, Donald Trump’s favourite Irish person, notorious 36-year-old UFC fighter Conor McGregor, announced on Instagram that he intended to run. This is the crazy world we live in. \n\nJoshing aside, the recent spectacle of blowhard Conor McGregor in the White House purporting to speak for the people of Ireland was stomach-churning. Posing in the Oval Office won’t change the fact McGregor was found liable in a civil case for the assault of Nikita Hand, although he is appealing the verdict.\n\n Conor McGregor can’t nominate himself to run for President. No matter how he is courted in America, the process of running for president is not straightforward. A potential candidate must get the backing of four local authorities or 20 Oireachtas members to be nominated. How likely is that? It’s possible but improbable. \n\nAssuming he cleared that hurdle, he would have to win a majority of the vote. The coalition parties are moving to block Conor McGregor’s attempt to gain a nomination by introducing their candidates into the field, making it more challenging for independents to succeed in the council route.\n\nMcGregor is a profoundly ignorant man in how he conducts himself, including punching an elderly man and driving around on the night he assaulted Nikita Hand “trying to get something going” with a partner and four children at home. Who can forget Dee Devlin’s shipwrecked face when she emerged from court with her partner?\n\nHowever, it’s ill-advised, as the American Democrats have done, to exist in an echo chamber and assume that a far-right buffoon with populist policies could never appeal to voters disenchanted with mainstream politics. If America proves anything, it’s never say never.\n\nThe Trumpian vote demonstrated that lack of opportunity and relative poverty make for strange times. When people feel they can achieve a reasonable standard of living, advance modestly, and dream of their children doing better than they did, which is what we all hope for, then democracy thrives.\n\nIn the 1990s, presidents were young and popular, people trusted each other, and we didn’t have to prove everything we said. Naturally, the seeds of what would go wrong were already being planted, not least the deregulation of the financial system, which led to a crash that changed the world. \n\nThe point is that we felt we could be anyone and anything was possible.\n\nThat no longer feels conceivable as many people struggle and to quote Captain Boyle in Sean O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock, “Th' whole worl's in a terrible state o' chassis.\" There’s something about O’Casey’s work that feels current. O’Casey wrote about the chasm between the official republican rhetoric of the time and the reality of life for normal people.\n\nWhen people struggle to find homes or access essential services, such as finding school places for their children with special needs and battling to keep their heads above water, we risk political disruption.\n\nNo recent White House audiences or interviews with Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, and Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of health (the less said about them, the better) will ever change the fact that McGregor is, despite his athletic prowess, a clown.\n\nHowever, if he was cleverer and with less baggage, somebody as shallow and cartoonish as Conor McGregor could attract support as a potential presidential candidate. A loud-mouthed, provocative bogeyman peddling an anti-immigration, anti-government line. An Irish version of JD Vance who, despite his apparent failings and multiple contradictions, emerged from poverty and is clever.\n\nIn 2018, wealthy right-wing Donegal businessman Peter Casey won nearly a quarter of the vote after running on an anti-Traveller platform with strong rural support. \n\nCasey is a curious character in that he later volunteered a large property for housing Ukrainian war refugees, something that did not go down well with right-wing groups online who accused him baselessly of \"human trafficking\". He won his subsequent defamation case. \n\nHowever, his 2018 success proved there are rich seams out there waiting to be mined. He is preparing to run again on a put Ireland first campaign. Sound familiar?\n\nMeanwhile, dismissing McGregor is tempting from where I am standing, but others may not see things like that.\n\nWitness the outrage and shock when Gerry Hutch nearly got elected to the Dáil. I watched the election coverage all day, and nobody appeared to see it coming except Bertie Ahern, who, to paraphrase the late Charles Haughey, is one of the cutest of them all. \n\nHe didn’t engage in the handwringing. He said: “Gerry Hutch has been around as long as I have been. I won’t get into morals or ethics, but Hutch has indirectly been kind to the Dublin Central community.\n\n Whether we like it or not, he is respected by people, which explains his 3,000 votes. \n\n\"It’s not just younger people who voted for him; older people I know voted for him. We can all say the self-righteous things we want, but the reaction is what it is.” \n\nIndeed. I’m sure the former Taoiseach understands that crises or perceived crises provoke a departure from democracy or at least provoke people into voting for populists. Bertie may run for president, although he has not officially thrown his hat in the ring.\n\nReality check needed for politicians\n\nSome of our politicians need a reality check because, unbelievably, the Dáil speaking rights row rumbles on. Sinn Féin whip Pádraig Mac Lochlainn said: “We have to stand our ground.” \n\nAs I have written before, ill-advised in-house procedural shenanigans like these lead normal people to vote against highly paid elites squabbling about something that matters little to them, even if that means voting for a disruptive loser.\n\nThis is precisely why America is saddled with Trump and ‘hillybilly’ Maga loyalist J D Vance. They did not come from a vacuum and attracted, amongst others, working-class voters in dire economic straits who felt cut loose by the establishment. \n\nTheir modus operandi, like McGregor’s, is to attract controversy, spread baseless rumours, and spew anti-system bile, although they are both infinite times smarter than McGregor.\n\nVictor Frankl, the Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, coined the phrase “Control the controllable”. He meant that life is what we make it. Reworking his phrase, we can control the president's nomination procedure. \n\nBut there are other things we can’t ultimately control unless we take notice because it’s like an underground river you can’t see. The damp rises through the ground until suddenly, too late, you realise your feet are sodden.\n\nCriticism of boorish Conor McGregor is justified, but disparaging some of the people who would vote for him is a bad strategy. Hillary Clinton made a catastrophic mistake in a 2016 campaign speech when she described Trump supporters as “deplorables”. \n\nJoe Biden compounded it last year when he appeared to demonise Trump supporters as “garbage”, even if that is not what he meant. Look to America and realise we have been warned.","summary":"America's example - and our own history, told so well by Sean O'Casey - shows that when people are struggling to survive, political chaos ensues ","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-41599495.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9106/4553350_22_seoimage1x1_2.78277285.jpg_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:49:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Sean O","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Sean O"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":304146062,"title":"Musk's super PAC jumps into Florida's special elections","text":"A super PAC tied to billionaire Elon Musk has started spending in two deeply Republican House seats in Florida ahead of next week’s special elections, according to a new campaign finance report.

Fine recently filed a lackluster fundraising report, significantly trailing his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, a public school teacher. Patronis was also outraised by his Democratic opponent in the 1st District, gun control activist Gay Valimont, but not as dramatically. The winner of the 1st District race will replace former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz.

Hostin said he had handled classified material better than members of the Trump administration.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg jokingly called the reporter “her cousin.”\n\nFellow co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin, an ex-Trump aide and former Pentagon press secretary, was also critical of how the officials used Signal, an encrypted messaging app popular with journalists, to discuss a military operation.\n\n“We were talking about top administration officials using a group chat to discuss secret war plans,” Goldberg said, laughing as they came back from a commercial break for a second segment, adding, “I don’t know why it’s cracking me up.”\n\nCo-host Joy Behar called it “sick,” while Hostin added, “It’s so deeply unserious and scary.”\n\nBehar listed off what she considered a series of early “glitches” by the Trump administration, saying, “This guy has to go. I’m sorry.”\n\nTrump is not planning to fire Waltz in the wake of The Atlantic’s reporting of the apparent national security breach, Fox News has learned. Jeffrey Goldberg wrote that Waltz was the one who had apparently accidentally included him in the thread.\n\n“He’s not getting fired,” Trump told Fox News. The president said the incident was a “mistake,” though there was “nothing important” in the Signal text thread.\n\nThe president said the “attack was a success,” referring to the U.S. operation against the Houthis in Yemen that was discussed on the text chain between senior cabinet officials.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt released a new statement on Tuesday.\n\n“Jeffrey Goldberg is well-known for his sensationalist spin,” Leavitt wrote, before offering three “facts about his latest story.” Leavitt said no “war plans” were discussed, no classified material was sent to the thread and that the White House Counsel’s Office has provided guidance on a number of different platforms for the president’s top officials to communicate “as safely and efficiently as possible.”\n\nThe National Security Council earlier said The Atlantic’s report referenced what appeared to be an “authentic message chain.”","summary":"'Should we be saying, ‘Lock them up?'' asked co-host Whoopi Goldberg.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/media/the-view-hosts-cheer-trump-officials-texting-debacle-say-some-should-face-jail/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-eeze6tdn0-1742949836786.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1742935532&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rSD5YWr3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:47:37","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":304146274,"title":"J.D.

But Jenner signaled it doesn't plan to back down without a fight.The firm, headquartered in Chicago, employs over 400 attorneys across six offices nationwide and is the fourth major law firm targeted by the Trump administration with similar executive actions. Each of the firms — Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling — has had ties to Trump's political opponents.In the Tuesday order, Trump specifically singled out attorney Andrew Weissmann, a Jenner employee who served as a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller's Special Counsel's Office, which investigated Trump's ties to Russia in 2016. The order described Weissmann's career as \"rooted in weaponized government and abuse of power.\"\"Jenner & Block has had a long history representing clients, paid and pro bono, in their most difficult matters since 1914,\" Jenner & Block said in a statement released after the order was issued. \"Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.\"US District Judge Beryl Howell on March 12 partially blocked Trump's order against Perkins Coie. Politico reported that during an emergency hearing, the judge said that the \"retaliatory animus\" of Trump's order against the firm was \"clear on its face\" and \"runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.\"On Friday, the Justice Department filed a motion to disqualify Howell from overseeing the lawsuit, arguing the judge is \"insufficiently impartial\" to rule on the case.While Perkins Coie fights the executive order in court, another targeted firm has taken a contrasting approach to handling Trump's actions against it.Instead of challenging the order's legality, Paul Weiss agreed to reevaluate its hiring practices in alignment with Trump's anti-DEI initiatives and provide $40 million in pro bono legal work to further causes identified by the Trump administration, such as combating antisemitism and assisting veterans. Trump rescinded the order against Paul Weiss after the agreement was struck, though Business Insider previously reported the language in Paul Weiss' copy of the agreement did not include references to DEI that were in Trump's announcement.Rachel Cohen, a now-former associate from the high-profile firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, last Friday publicly resigned over what she said was her firm's resistance to challenging the president's orders.Also on Friday, the president sent a memo to Attorney General Pam Bondi ordering her to identify \"frivolous\" lawsuits against his administration and flag the law firms associated with the cases so they can be targeted for punitive actions like those levied against Paul Weiss and Perkins Coie.In an email to his staff on Sunday, Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp called Trump's order \"unprecedented\" in the firm's 150-year history and an \"existential threat.\"\"The executive order could easily have destroyed our firm,\" Karp wrote. \"It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.\"The assault on Big Law — and each firm's disparate handling of the orders against them — has made waves across the legal industry, with legal scholars warning Business Insider the unprecedented attacks from the sitting president are a threat to the rule of law that have implications far beyond damaging the businesses of the targeted firms.\"Something like this has never happened, or maybe hasn't happened since the time of Andrew Jackson. I mean, this is really a kind of a constitutional crisis,\" Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, previously told BI. \"I think our legal system is under attack, and it's a question of who's going to step up and defend it.\"Have a tip?

Also Read | US President Donald Trump Nominates Republican Attorney Thomas March Bell, Once Accused of Mishandling Taxpayer Funds, As HHS Watchdog. Trump nominated Huckabee, a well-known evangelical Christian and vehement supporter of Israel, to take on the critical post in Jerusalem days after he won reelection on a campaign promise to end the now 17-month war in Gaza. But after a brief ceasefire, US and Arab mediators are now struggling to get a ceasefire deal back on track after Israeli forces resumed the war last week with a surprise wave of deadly airstrikes. Also Read | Eid al-Fitr 2025 Holiday Air Traffic Surge: Sharjah Airport Gears Up To Welcome Over Half Million Passengers During Holiday on Eid Ul Fitr. While Republican senators applauded Huckabee's staunch support for America's closest ally, Israel, Democrats questioned his past rhetoric about Palestinians deemed “extreme” by even some pro-Israel groups and contradicting longstanding US policy in the region. The former Arkansas governor acknowledged his past support for Israel's right to annex the West Bank and incorporate its Palestinian population into Israel, but said it would not be his “prerogative” to carry out that policy. “If confirmed, it will be my responsibility to carry out the president's priorities, not mine,” Huckabee said in response to Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley's questions. Huckabee, a one-time presidential hopeful, has also repeatedly backed referring to the West Bank by its biblical name of \"Judea and Samaria\", a term that right-wing Israeli politicians and activists have thus far fruitlessly pushed the US to accept. He did not give a clear answer to whether he still stands by that when pushed by Senator Chris Van Hollen. Most notably, Huckabee has long been opposed to the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian people. In an interview last year, he went even further, saying that he doesn't even believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as \"Palestinians\". As the situation in Gaza has deteriorated with the recent collapse of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli officials have begun to talk more seriously about reoccupation of the territory, something to which President Joe Biden's administration had been adamantly opposed. Trump has made his proposals about a potential US takeover of Gaza, which have attracted attention as well as strong criticism from Arab nations and others. When asked about Trump's plan, Huckabee denied that the president ever said he would “force displacement\" of Palestinians from Gaza “unless it is for their safety” and says Palestinians could be incentivised to leave. Even before his hearing started, Democrats and some pro-Israel groups voiced their opposition to his nomination, saying that his views on the conflict are “extreme” and \"counter to Americans' interests\". “Huckabee's positions are not the words of a thoughtful diplomat -- they are the words of a provocateur whose views are far outside international consensus and contrary to the core bipartisan principles of American diplomacy,” Jerry Nadler, a senior Jewish Democrat, said in a statement. “In one of the most volatile and violent areas in the world today, there is no need for more extremism, and certainly not from the historic ambassador's post and behind the powerful seal of the United States.” Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the pro-Israel group J Street, which previously criticised the Biden and Trump administrations' handling of the war, echoed that sentiment, saying Huckabee's views “would undermine American interests and the administration's own stated commitment to pursuit of long-term regional peace and security\". “Huckabee's embrace of annexation, extremist settlers and fanatical Christian Zionism stands in stark contrast to the Jewish, democratic values held by the overwhelming majority of our community -- and in stark contrast to Israel's founding values of justice, equality and peace,\" he added. Another nominee who testified before the committee on Tuesday was Kevin Cabrera, Trump's pick to be the ambassador to Panama, a country that has bristled at the Republican president's repeated calls for the US to retake control of the Panama Canal for national security reasons due to potential threats from China. \"One of the key aspects of our cooperation is ensuring the security of the Panama Canal, a critical international waterway that facilitates global trade and economic growth,\" Cabrera said in his opening remarks. He also praised decisions by the Panamanian government to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative and to review contracts with a China-based company that is running ports at both ends of the canal. The company has preliminarily agreed to sell its interests in the subsidiaries that run the ports, but the deal is not yet complete. Cabrera also faced repeated calls from Democrats to commit to upholding Panama's sovereignty and advising the president to do the same, but responded that he would defer to Trump, who has said “all the options are on the table” when it comes to asserting US control over the Panama Canal.

This order includes mandates for voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering for federal elections and requires that all ballots be submitted by Election Day.\n\nThe order criticizes the current state of election security for lacking “basic and necessary” safeguards and urges collaboration between states and federal agencies to exchange voter information and prosecute electoral fraud. It also warns that states failing to adhere to these stipulations may face the withdrawal of federal funds.\n\nThis executive action, which may quickly encounter opposition due to states having significant autonomy in determining their own election procedures, aligns with Trump’s ongoing criticism of election protocols. The order instructs federal bodies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, and the State Department to share federal data with election authorities to help identify any non-citizens on voter lists.\n\nIt also says the attorney general should “prioritise enforcement of federal election integrity laws” in states that don’t share information about suspected election crimes with the federal government.\n\nTrump’s order is likely to face legal challenges, given that the Constitution gives authority over elections to the states. While Congress has the power to regulate voting – and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act – the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the “times, places and manner” for elections.\n\nColorado’s Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an “unlawful” weaponisation of the federal government and said Trump is “trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.”\n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who has been the subject of Trump’s ire, responded to the order in a social media post, saying, “This will not stand. We will sue.”\n\nThe executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration.\n\nHe said some federal agencies provide election support, including the US Election Assistance Commission, which distributes federal grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.\n\nFormer President Biden issued an executive order in 2021 directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew complaints from Republicans who called it federal overreach. Trump has rescinded that order.\n\nTrump’s order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to redraw its guidelines for voting systems, including to prioritise those that give voters a paper record of the ballot they cast. It said the commission should condition the funding it distributes to states on those new guidelines, which could affect states like Georgia, which use a barcode-based vote tallying system.\n\nGeorgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger nonetheless reacted positively to Trump’s order, calling it a “great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.”\n\n“Thank you, President Trump, for this executive order ensuring that only American citizens decide American elections,” Raffensperger said.\n\nRepresentative Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a “welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.”\n\nMike Lindell, a Trump ally who spreads election conspiracies and who wants to ban voting systems in favour of hand-counting ballots, fundraised off the news on Tuesday, saying in an email it will fix our “sick elections.”\n\nTrump’s executive order comes as the Republican National Committee launched a massive effort to probe voter registration list maintenance nationwide.

The rapidly moving media machine has an army of journalists scrambling day and night to expose the Trump administration’s flaws.\n\nIt’s a tough ask, given Mr Trump has long held a disdain for the mainstream press and has kept them at arm’s reach.\n\nBut this week, a solid-gold example of inept amateurism from the country’s elites was served up on a platter, for the editor-in-chief of one of Mr Trump’s biggest rival publications no less.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic blew the world press out of the park when he woke up with a bizarre stroke of luck — a front-row seat to the conversations military reporters and analysts spend their lives pontificating over.\n\nHe was allegedly invited by White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz to a Signal thread named “Houthi PC small group”.\n\nIt wasn’t long before details from one of the world’s most secretive group chats shot around the globe.\n\nGoldberg claims he saw live details of weapons packages, targets, and strike timing two hours before missiles hit Yemen, exposing a crucial error in the most elite office’s internal security mechanisms. \n\n“In my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of (a principals committee) being convened over a commercial messaging app,” he wrote.\n\nMORE:‘Hate’: Ivanka lifts lid on leaving Donald Trump\n\n“If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn’t somebody who supported the Houthis.\n\n“They were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people.”\n\nThe incident has immediately set off alarm bells on Capitol Hill as the administration reels to fix one of the most excruciating egg-on-face blunders seen in years. \n\nThe information leaked in this specific breach is hardly the kind to topple an administration, but the phenomenon has certainly raised some uncomfortable questions for Mr Trump’s “reckless” inner circle.\n\nA National Security Advisor mistakenly opening the door to a well-known and openly anti-Trump journalist will not go down well with the Commander-in-Chief, to say the least.\n\nMORE:Trump’s ex eyes $22m payout after shock split\n\nDemocrats jumped on the opportunity, accusing the administration of being flippant with military intelligence, and while some Republicans have acknowledged the error, some have attempted to dodge the elephant in the room.\n\n“Mistakes were made,” said Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker. \n\nMeanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has called for a full investigation, branding it “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time”.\n\nThe White House confirmed the incident but hastily downplayed its implications as damage-control mode kicked in.\n\n“The attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding that President Trump “continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team.”\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth leaned on familiar lines when cornered by the press. He dismissed Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited” journalist.\n\nWhen questioned by reporters about the leak, Hegseth danced around the specifics and instead ridiculed Goldberg, who he claims has “made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again … this is a guy who peddles garbage, it’s what he does”.\n\nWhat was in the chat?\n\nAccording to Goldberg’s report, the chat group included several Trump cabinet members and senior national security figures: Vice President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and others. \n\nGoldberg wrote that while he was initially unsure if the messages were real, he became convinced of their authenticity when he watched messages in real-time about a strike and then saw reports of explosions in Sanaa minutes later. Houthi officials later claimed 53 people had been killed.\n\nOne of the more telling moments came when the user identified as JD Vance voiced concern that the strike ran counter to Donald Trump’s messaging on Europe. \n\n“There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,” the message read. “But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.”\n\nAmong the other threads in the chat was a proposal to bill European countries for US naval protection of shipping lanes. \n\n“Whether it’s now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,” the Waltz account wrote. \n\n“I just hate bailing Europe out again,” Vance said.\n\n“VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC,” Hegseth replied.\n\nVance’s office later clarified to the BBC that the vice president “unequivocally supports this administration’s foreign policy,” and that he and the president “are in complete agreement”.\n\nA spokesperson for the National Security Council confirmed that the thread appeared to be real, and called it “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy co-ordination between senior officials.” \n\nThe drama has also exposed the specific platform White House officials are communicating on. Signal is a privacy-focused messaging application that has a strong reputation for keeping things completely under wraps, at least in comparison to more mainstream platforms. \n\nThe embarrassing slip-up has also revealed that the most powerful government on the planet does not, in fact, have its own in-house methods of communication and will discuss military matters on a program readily available on the App Store.\n\n“I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” Goldberg wrote.\n\n“I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.”\n\nAn internal review is now underway.","summary":"The truly bonkers texts sent by Donald Trump’s inner circle, in one of the wildest security breaches of our age, have been revealed.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/mistakes-were-made-white-house-in-damage-control-after-one-of-the-most-stunning-breaches-in-us-history/news-story/1229b8a47931c1a4a83aafd3d1fead9a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/55a16274cfd5f61baf1a1439fdc925c5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:30:29","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":304146848,"title":"Police Report Suggests Natural Causes in Death of Former U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber","text":"Virginia police looking into the death of former U.S. Attorney Jessica Aber say everything they have found suggests natural causes.\n\nThe investigation into the death of Aber, who served as the top prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia for over three years, will remain open until the medical examiner’s office issues a final ruling, Alexandria police said Tuesday.\n\n“While the investigation into the death of Ms. Jessica Aber is ongoing, at this time, detectives have found no evidence suggesting that her death was caused by anything other than natural causes,” police said in a statement.\n\nAber, 43, was found by police officers who were called on a report of an unresponsive person at around 9:20 a.m. Saturday, police said.\n\nPolice believe the death was the result of a longstanding medical issue, a friend of the family previously told NBC News.\n\nAber was appointed as U.S. attorney for the district by President Joe Biden on Aug. 10, 2021, and was then confirmed by the Senate.\n\nShe had been an assistant U.S. attorney for the district since 2009 and was deputy chief of the criminal division before being named U.S. attorney, her department biography says.\n\nAber announced her resignation as U.S. attorney on Jan. 20, the same day that President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second term.\n\nU.S. attorneys are political appointees chosen by the president, and can be removed at the will of the president.\n\nAber “was unmatched as a leader, mentor, and prosecutor, and she is simply irreplaceable as a human being,” the U.S. attorney for the district, Erik S.

Homan has boasted the operation was his follow-through on a promise to “bring hell” to Boston, targeting the city for its so-called sanctuary policies. \n\nAccording to WCVB, Homan was asked Tuesday outside the White House about concerns that people without any criminal history were detained as part of the recent arrests in Massachusetts. \n\nHoman said municipalities can decrease the number of what he called “collateral arrests” by cooperating with federal authorities, referencing the operation in Massachusetts:\n\n“Most of them were criminals, but many of them collaterals, majority were criminals. How come the collaterals? I’ve said this a thousand times — sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the community and more collateral arrests. Why? Because if we can’t get access to the bad guy in the county jail, if they’re going to choose to release him into the public, which is just, releasing a public safety threat into the public is just dumb to begin with, because it puts the public safety at risk, right? But when you release that public safety threat back into the public, that means we have to go find him. When we find him, most likely, he’s with others. And if they’re in the country illegally, they’re coming too. Because we’re not going to tell ICE to ignore the oath that [they] took to enforce immigration law and walk away from illegal aliens like the last administration does. So if you want to force us into communities, fine, we’ll go. But collateral arrests will increase because we’re going to run into illegal aliens while we’re in the course of looking for those targets.”\n\nIn a statement, ICE said 205 of those arrested as part of the operation in Massachusetts had “significant criminal convictions or charges” and the agency blamed local jurisdictions for refusing to honor detainer requests, saying it forced officers to make “at-large arrests.” \n\nThe agency did not detail the reasoning for arresting the remaining 165 people.\n\nDetainer requests, which ICE lodges with local police when it becomes aware a person being detained is eligible for deportation, are not mandatory for police departments to follow. In Massachusetts, a 2017 Supreme Judicial Court ruling dictated that state officials cannot detain people solely based on ICE detainer requests. \n\nGovernor Maura Healey said in a statement Tuesday that her office had not been given any documentation related to the recent arrests and said she offered to meet with Homan. \n\n“We haven’t been provided any information,” Healey said. “He was apparently on the ground here last week but, I extended myself earlier, I said I’d be happy to meet with him, he didn’t take me up on that.”\n\nOn Monday, Healey reiterated the message that Massachusetts is not a “sanctuary state.”\n\n“Here are the facts. Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state, and Massachusetts law enforcement regularly partners with federal agencies and federal law enforcement to keep people safe,” Healey said. “In fact, just two weeks ago, the Massachusetts State Police were brought to the White House and recognized by President Trump and Attorney General Bondi for our partnership in arresting two dozen members of a violent gang and fentanyl trafficking ring in Lawrence.”\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu and Police Commissioner Michael Cox have repeatedly said they regularly cooperate with the federal government when it comes to the apprehension and deportation of undocumented immigrants to address issues of public safety. \n\nThe city’s “sanctuary” policies limit cooperation with federal agents attempting to detain people on civil warrants. The Boston Trust Act directs the Boston police to only coordinate with ICE on issues of significant public safety importance, such as child exploitation and human trafficking.

Video from the Tesla's onboard surveillance system shows a man driving a Kia sedan pulling up alongside the parked Tesla and spray-painting the vehicle. Paint cans can be seen in both of his hands.\n\nThe car's owner, who identified himself as Hiroshi, shared the footage with ABC7 News anchor Dion Lim.\n\nRELATED: Tesla vehicles targeted around the Bay Area amid anti-Elon Musk protests\n\n\"I wasn't shocked because this has been happening so frequently,\" Hiroshi said. \"Even the police, when they showed up, both officers are Tesla owners as well.

They say there have been three arrests at the Tesla showroom on 4th Street in recent weeks, including a man who brandished a stun gun.\n\nHiroshi said he was able to have the spray paint removed and remains undeterred in his loyalty to the Tesla brand. He told ABC7 he plans to expedite his order for the company's new Cybertruck.\n\nThere's been a clear uptick in these kinds of incidents since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that's slashing government spending.

governor Guy Debelle once quoted Door's frontman Jim Morrison in a speech when the fallout from the global financial crisis was still front of mind:\n\n\"The future's uncertain and the end is always near.\"\n\nIn his budget speech last night, Jim Chalmers was somewhat less dramatic, but the warning was very similar.\n\n\"The global economy is volatile and unpredictable,\" he cautioned.\n\nAlmost in the same breath as Mr Chalmers trumpeted the likelihood of a soft landing for Australia's economy in its descent from peak inflation, he warned that the global outlook could deal Australia blows on multiple fronts.\n\n\"Trade disruptions are rising, China's growth is slowing, war is still raging in Europe, and a ceasefire in the Middle East is breaking down,\" he observed.\n\nThose blows are already landing.\n\nTreasury says the global economy grew 3.3 per cent last year and is likely to growth by 3.25 per cent each year for the next three.\n\n\"If realised, this would represent the longest stretch of below-average growth since the early 1990s,\" Budget Paper 1 warned.\n\nBut things could get even worse — Treasury warned the risks to the global outlook are currently skewed to the downside.\n\n\"The global outlook remains clouded by uneven risks in the trajectory of growth, inflation and monetary policy,\" Treasury's number-crunchers noted.\n\nTrump tariffs create 'significant uncertainty and volatility'\n\nOne of the biggest risks in the short-term is US president Donald Trump's love of tariffs.\n\nIn the budget, Treasury did some modelling suggesting that a blanket 25 per cent tariff on manufactured goods coming into the US would likely take more than 0.1 of a percentage point off Australia's economic growth, while adding that much to inflation.\n\nThat's mostly because our key export destinations — such as China, Japan and Korea — would be hard hit on their exports to the US.\n\n\"The indirect effect of the tariffs is estimated to be nearly four times as large as the direct effect, reflecting the relative importance of affected trade flows between Australia, China, and the United States,\" Treasury forecast.\n\nHowever, that hit to GDP could nearly double if Australia responded with tariffs of our own.\n\nAnd Treasury warned that its modelling could significantly underestimate the economic impact from Trump's tariffs and the global reaction to them, with China, the EU, Canada and others having already announced retaliatory measures.\n\n\"Escalating trade tensions have created significant uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets,\" Budget Paper 1 noted with concern.\n\nThe Grattan Institute's chief executive Aruna Sathanapally said, in a worst case scenario, an escalating trade war could rip the globalised economy apart.\n\n\"The first round effects of the tariffs isn't the main thing to worry about — that will be annoying and unwelcome and probably some bad economic policy,\" she told the ABC News budget special.\n\n\"But the effects on the global economy, and then the effects in terms of uncertainty and chaos, and what effect that has on people's investment decisions, those things we need to be really worried about.\n\n\"And even more worrying is the international order — if it breaks down, it becomes more troubling and expensive.\"\n\nIt feels like the end is nearer than usual\n\nWe're already seeing some of those effects.\n\nUS companies have been scrambling to import just about anything and everything — from cars to copper, building materials to gold bullion — in order to beat the imposition of the import taxes.\n\nThat is boosting economic activity ahead of the tariffs, but this is just bringing forward demand that will leave an even bigger hole once the import taxes come in. \n\nThen there's those knock on effects to business investment and activity.\n\nFinancial news outlet Bloomberg carried a story this week of a US project waiting on the importation of pipes from Germany, where threatened levies on Chinese shipping had indefinitely delayed delivery.\n\nThat project is now stuck in limbo and could remain so for months.\n\nSimilar stories are proliferating, and businesses are likely to defer many major investment plans until they have clarity about where global trade relationships and tariffs stand.\n\nDonald Trump is by no means the only global leader who has adopted increasingly protectionist policies in recent years.\n\n\"According to the IMF, restrictions on trade and investment have grown sixfold in the past 15 years,\" Budget Paper 1 noted.\n\nBut the sheer scale and immediacy of Trump's tariff plans threaten to dwarf even the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of Ferris Bueller fame, which infamously deepened and prolonged the Great Depression.\n\nJim Morrison and Guy Debelle both may have been a bit ahead of their time. Not only is the future uncertain, but the end feels increasingly near.","summary":"One man appears to be the last remaining hurdle between Australia and the soft economic landing that the federal government and Reserve Bank have been angling for.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-26/trump-tariffs-and-volatile-global-economy-threaten-budget/105095192","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6f27b25d478553e3c5d5d1729511c8a1?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2136&cropW=3797&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:16:46","author":"Michael Janda","authors":["Michael Janda"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":304146016,"title":"World News | Belgium Closely Following Mehul Choksi Case, Says Government Spokesperson","text":"By Sahil Pandey\nBrussels [Belgium], March 26 (ANI): The Belgian government is closely monitoring the case of fugitive Indian businessman Mehul Choksi, emphasising that it is being handled with significant attention, according to David Jordens, Spokesperson and Head of Service for social media and press at Belgium's Federal Public Service (FPS) Foreign Affairs.

They are expected to render a decision by Wednesday. De Moraes is among the judges considering the case.\n\nTuesday’s hearing is the result of Gonet’s decision to file formal charges against Bolsonaro and 33 allies on February 18. Gonet told the justices that there was a preponderance of evidence against the defendants.\n\n“The criminal organisation documented its project, and during the investigations, manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets and exchanges of messages were found,” Gonet said.\n\nBolsonaro faces five counts, including “attempted violent abolition of the democratic state of law” and damaging government property. Federal police initially indicted him in an 884-page report in November.\n\nThe far-right Bolsonaro and his allies have decried the charges as part of an elaborate conspiracy by their political rivals to prevent him from running for president again.\n\nAlready, in 2023, a panel of judges decided to ban Bolsonaro from holding public office until 2030, on the basis that he used his power as president to sow doubt about the country’s voting system.\n\nBut Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing. He faces an array of investigations and probes, some related to his actions during the 2022 election and others pertaining to accusations of money laundering and other crimes.\n\n“I am innocent,” Bolsonaro said in a podcast on Monday. “I have no doubt that, in 30 days at the most, they will kill me.” He did not specify who had threatened him.\n\nSpeaking to reporters the next day at Brasilia’s airport, Bolsonaro nevertheless expressed hope that the justice system would exonerate him.\n\n“I’m fine. I always hope for justice. Nothing is substantiated in the accusations, made in a biased way, by the federal police,” Bolsonaro said.\n\nThe accusations centre on the lead-up and aftermath of the 2022 elections. Even before the first vote was cast, Bolsonaro spread false rumours that Brazil’s electronic voting system could not be trusted.\n\nThe race between Bolsonaro, the incumbent, and the left-leaning Lula was tight. But in a run-off election on October 30, 2022, Lula prevailed by narrow margins, earning 50.9 percent of the vote.\n\nBolsonaro, however, did not publicly acknowledge defeat. Instead, he and his allies sought to challenge his loss with a legal complaint, which was ultimately tossed for lack of evidence.\n\nHis supporters, meanwhile, flooded the streets, with truckers blocking major roadways. The police headquarters in the capital, Brasilia, was attacked, and a bomb threat was allegedly uncovered in the lead-up to Lula’s inauguration.\n\nBut tensions reached a peak on January 8, 2023, just days after Lula was sworn in.\n\nOn that day, thousands of Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed the Three Powers Plaza in Brasilia, breaking into buildings representing the country’s Congress, presidency and Supreme Court. Congress was not in session at the time, nor was Lula in residence.\n\nBrazil’s federal police have since accused Bolsonaro and his allies of attempting to trigger a “state of siege” that would allow the military to topple the government.\n\nBoth allies and critics have compared Bolsonaro with United States President Donald Trump, who likewise rejected a past election defeat as fraudulent – without proof.\n\nFor Trump, that loss came in 2020, when he was bested by Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has since returned to office after winning the 2024 race.\n\nBolsonaro’s allies have indicated they hope that Trump, now serving a second term, could use the US’s influence to push Brazilian authorities to drop the case and clear the way for Bolsonaro to make another presidential bid.\n\nBolsonaro has expressed a strong affinity for Brazil’s military dictatorship, which ruled the country from 1964 through 1985.\n\nCrowds of his supporters gathered in front of military barracks after the 2022 election, calling for the armed forces to intervene and stop Lula from taking power.","summary":"Top prosecutor argues Bolsonaro oversaw a criminal effort to remain in office despite his loss in the 2022 elections.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/26/brazilian-supreme-court-considers-trial-for-bolsonaro-over-coup-allegations?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AP25084497512451-1-1742940997.jpg?resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:13:21","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":304139256,"title":"Experts Caution Against U.S. Shift Towards Vaccine Skepticism as It Threatens Public Health","text":"As vaccine hesitancy increases in the US, isolated, tight-knit and religious communities have frequently been at the center of high-profile outbreaks.\n\nSuch is the case in west Texas, where a rural community is the center of an expanding measles outbreak that has already claimed the lives of two Americans – the first deaths from the disease in nearly a decade.\n\nHowever, as the conspiracy theories of Maga conservatism marry the bugbears of the US health secretary and vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, the one-time fringe view of vaccines has become increasingly mainstream – with activists in right-leaning population centers taking lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic into the realm of childhood inoculations.\n\nOne need look no further than Sarasota, Florida, for a full-throated political denunciation.\n\n“Generally, people are weak, lazy,” said Vic Mellor, an activist based near Sarasota, and a close ally of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nMellor owns the We the People Health and Wellness Center in nearby Venice. Mellor, in a shirt that shouts “VIOLENCE MIGHT BE THE ANSWER”, is a self-professed attendee of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\n“And that lazy part just makes them ignorant … Covid has proven that obviously this is true. I mean, all the facts are starting to come out on Covid now – that it was a hoax. That is just an extension of where this hoax began decades earlier with the vaccines, OK? This is all a money grab, this is all a power grab.”\n\nThe pandemic was real, and it started Mellor down the road of questioning vaccines. Where he once opposed only the Covid-19 shots, he now opposes vaccines entirely – arguing they harm children despite experts on vaccines considering them one of mankind’s greatest medical achievements.\n\n“This is not an isolated, rural, religious community, which I think is what a lot of people associate with an anti-vaccine mentality,” said Kathryn Olivarius, the author of Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom, and a historian of disease at Stanford University. “This is in the heart of everything.”\n\nSarasota has become a proving ground for the Maga right. Among nail salons, mom-and-pop Cuban restaurants and roadside motels lining US 41, known locally as the Tamiami Trail, a visitor can find the gates of New College. This was once a public university prized for its progressive liberal arts education. Now it is part of the new conservative experiment in remaking higher education led by activists aligned with Donald Trump and the Republican Florida governor, Ron DeSantis.\n\nAlong the same road is the Sarasota memorial hospital, an aberration in American healthcare – it is publicly owned with open board elections. The normally sleepy election became contentious when insurgent “health freedom” candidates, supported in part by Mellor, entered the race. Three won seats on the nine-member board in 2022.\n\nEven the name of this stretch of sun-bleached asphalt is up for debate. This year, a state Republican lawmaker – who has also introduced bills to limit vaccine requirements – briefly proposed changing its name to the “Gulf of America Trail” – a nod to Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nArguably the most salient artifact of this activism in Sarasota is the least visible: vaccination rates against measles.\n\nMeasles vaccination rates for kindergarteners have plummeted over the last two decades – from 97% in 2004 to 84% in 2023, according to state health records. Sarasota is roughly on par with the vaccination rates in rural Gaines county, Texas – the center of the ongoing measles outbreak that sickened 279 people in in that state alone. Notably, both Gaines county and Sarasota have large home-schooling communities, meaning vaccination rates could in fact be lower.\n\nIt is well known in research circles that right-leaning states across the US south and west have worse health metrics – from obesity to violence to diseases such as diabetes. That reality was supercharged during the pandemic; as vaccine mandates became a fixation on the right, Republican-leaning voters became more skeptical of vaccines. In turn, places with politically conservative leaders experienced more Covid-19 deaths and greater stress on hospitals.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. At least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks of the disease. But despite a supremely effective vaccine that eliminated the disease from the US in 2000, vaccine hesitancy has increasingly taken hold.\n\nConservative activism alone can’t be blamed for declining measles vaccination rates. The measles vaccine in particular has been subject to a sustained firehose of misinformation stemming from a fraudulent paper linking the vaccine to autism in 1999. For years, this misinformation was largely nonpartisan. And Florida’s anti-vaccine movement was active even before the pandemic – with a vocal contingent of parents arguing against strengthening school vaccine standards in 2019.\n\nWhat appears new in Sarasota is how local conservative activists have brought opposition to vaccines into the heart of their philosophy. By Mellor’s telling, he and a loosely affiliated group of Maga activists began to adopt anti-vaccine beliefs as the pandemic wore on – helping organize major health protests in the area in recent years, such as mask mandate opt-outs and the “health freedom” campaign for hospital board seats.\n\nMellor said his nearby property, the Hollow, was a gathering place during the pandemic (it is also a part-time gun range). He cites ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug that became a fascination of the right, as the reason “we didn’t lose people at all” during the height of the pandemic. Available clinical evidence shows it is not effective against Covid-19.\n\nKennedy has fit neatly into this realignment. He enjoys trust ratings among Republicans nearly as high as Trump, according to polling from the health-focused Kaiser Family Foundation. Kennedy has already spread dubious information about measles vaccines in public statements (notably: from a Steak ’n Shake in Florida) – a response one vaccine expert said “couldn’t be worse”.\n\n“While children are in the hospital suffering severe measles pneumonia, struggling to breathe, [Kennedy] stands up in front of the American public and says measles vaccines kill people every year and that it causes blindness and deafness,” said Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Severe side effects from the vaccine are possible, but they are much rarer than disability and death from measles.\n\n“This is what happens when you have a virulent anti-vaccine activist, a science denialist, as the head of the most important public health agency in the United States,” said Offit. “He should either be quiet or stand down.”\n\nThe same poll found trust in public health agencies has fallen precipitously amid Republican attacks. More than a quarter of Republican parents report delaying childhood vaccines, the poll found, a rate that has more than doubled since 2022. There is no analogous trend among Democratic parents. Despite how claims espoused by vaccine skeptics can be easily refuted, their power has not been undercut.\n\n“The anti-vaccine business is big business,” said Offit, pointing to the myriad unproven “treatments” offered by promoters of vaccine misinformation, some of which are offered at Mellor’s We the People health center. “We have been taken over by a foreign country, and the goal of that foreign country is to disassemble public health.”\n\nThe misery of measles did not take long to appear in Texas – measles-induced pneumonia has already led pediatricians to intubate children, including at least one baby, according to the Associated Press. About one to three people out of 1,000 who are infected by measles die from the infection, and one in 1,000 suffer severe brain swelling called encephalitis, which can lead to blindness, deafness and developmental delays.\n\n“We actually don’t have the perspective people in the past had on these diseases,” Olivarius. “I have spent many, many, many years reading letters and missives from parents who are petrified of what’s going to happen to their children” if there are outbreaks of yellow fever, polio or measles, Olivarius said about diseases now largely confined to history – thanks to vaccines.\n\n“The lesson from history is these are not mild ailments,” she said. “These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too.”","summary":"As vaccine hesitancy increases in the US, isolated, tight-knit and religious communities&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/experts-caution-against-u-s-shift-towards-vaccine-skepticism-as-it-threatens-public-health/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:10:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":304139252,"title":"Trump’s Cabinet Violated Regulations by Using Messaging Apps","text":"A lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., claims that members of President Donald Trump‘s cabinet breached federal law by utilizing the encrypted Signal messaging app to discuss military operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe 16-page document, submitted by the nonprofit government transparency group American Oversight, accuses Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and several Trump administration officials of violating the Federal Records Act (FRA) during an extended group chat about planning and “coordinating imminent U.S. military strikes in Yemen.”\n\nThe conversations in question occurred between March 11 and March 15, according to the lawsuit. The government’s use of the popular messaging app was first reported this week when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, reported that he was accidentally added to the group chat by national security adviser Michael Waltz.\n\nSignal is widely used for its encryption functions. The app is also well-known for its ability to automatically delete messages after a certain period of time, subject to user specifications. The use of the auto-delete feature in the chat, the plaintiffs say, runs afoul of federal law.\n\n“According to the Atlantic Article, at least one participant in the Signal chat enabled the function that makes messages disappear after set time limits,” the lawsuit claims. “Defendant Waltz set at least some messages to disappear after one week, and at least some messages to disappear after four weeks.”\n\nSo far, the plaintiffs allege, at least one message in the chat was already deleted by the time Goldberg reported on his experience.\n\nThat lone deletion — and the likelihood of other potentially more forthcoming — violates several federal laws and implicates the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as well, according to the lawsuit.\n\n“Defendants, as members of the Signal chat, know or reasonably should know that one or more messages in the Signal chat were or remain subject to automatic deletion in violation of the FRA and implementing rules and regulations of Defendants’ respective agencies, the lawsuit reads. “Defendants have failed and continue to fail to implement measures to prevent the automatic deletion of messages in the Signal chat, which violates their obligations under the FRA.”\n\nThe filing goes on, at length:\n\nAmerican Oversight has regularly requested DoD’s communications through FOIA, including Signal messages, and it will continue to do so in the future. Upon information and belief, under current DoD recordkeeping rules and practices, officials do not forward Signal messages, including messages from the Signal chat, to their official email accounts, thereby barring American Oversight and other FOIA requesters from obtaining responsive records to which they are otherwise entitled under FOIA, particularly if such Signal messages have enabled the disappearing function.\n\nTo hear the plaintiffs tell it, the use of Signal by federal agencies violates the FRA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a statute that broadly governs administrative agencies. The alleged APA violation is due to the “final” nature of the deleted messages, in question, the lawsuit claims.\n\n“Signal is not an authorized system for preserving federal records and does not comply with recordkeeping requirements,” the filing goes on. “Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations.”\n\nThe lawsuit also lays out a specific set of allegations against Secretary of State Marco Rubio, due to his current dual role as the acting Archivist of the United States and therefore the head of the National Archives. The use of Signal is at least a double whammy against Rubio because he has “an independent non-discretionary duty under the FRA to initiate a recovery action” under the NARA under the present circumstances, the plaintiffs allege.\n\nAnd, at least so far, Rubio has failed to exercise his mandatory duties under NARA, the lawsuit claims. This alleged failure, according to American Oversight, also violates the APA for various reasons.\n\nThe filing generally purports to be an effort “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal for sensitive national security decision-making.”\n\nThe lawsuit specifically requests a bevy of declaratory judgments that the group chat participants violated federal law, that the messages in question are subject to FRA, and that failure to maintain the messages violated the FRA. The plaintiffs are also seeking an injunction that orders the defendants to comply with their duties under federal records laws, and that might lead to “the recovery or restoration of any deleted or destroyed materials to the extent possible.”","summary":"President Donald Trump listens as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth speaks in the&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/trumps-cabinet-violated-regulations-by-using-messaging-apps/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:08:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":304138984,"title":"Republicans can make serious gains in NY — IF big donors get in the game","text":"“Hey Vickie, when are you running for mayor?”\n\nFor the last few months I’ve been hearing this at least once a week, and my answer is always the same: “When the GOP gets serious about New York.”\n\nThe last election saw a seismic political shift throughout the city — people turned out not only to support President Trump, but to send an unmistakable message of dissatisfaction to the Democratic monopoly that rules the state.\n\nIt was a shot across the bow of a political machine currently mired in some of the lowest approval ratings ever recorded.\n\nBut the real question is whether the Republican Party can capitalize, and on that the jury is still very much out.\n\nThe sad fact is, politics runs on money — and in New York City, Democrats have it and Republicans don’t. Simple as that.\n\nI’m talking about the kind of third-party expenditures and infrastructure that not only make candidates competitive, but buy your party credibility in the minds of voters.\n\nThis is where Democrats have their real edge — a vast patronage network of unions, activist organs and of course nonprofits, all colluding to project a facade of inevitability so airtight that even Boss Tweed couldn’t have dreamt it at the height of Tammany Hall.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans struggle not only to win elections, but to recruit talented candidates in the first place.\n\nWe don’t have much of a pitch to offer: “Put your life and career on hold, subject yourself and your family to vicious attacks by vindictive leftists, without any kind of institutional support, infrastructure, media or funding. Oh and you’ll probably lose.”\n\nSo yeah, not great.\n\nIt’s a shame, because there are actual openings here. In the current political environment there’s no reason why the GOP couldn’t flip at least five more City Council seats as well as a handful of state senate and assembly seats.\n\nWe have a golden opportunity to boot Alvin Bragg, the despicable Soros DA who’s been a blight on our city since he took office four years ago, and replace him with Maud Maron, an attorney and parents’ rights activist who would restore common sense and justice to the office.\n\nIf the terror-loving antisemitic socialist Zohran Mamdani wins the Democrats’ ranked-choice primary, Curtis Sliwa is on deck to potentially deliver a massive upset in the mayor’s race.\n\nAnd let’s not forget next year’s race for governor: Gov. Hochul has never been weaker. A strong Republican with a well-funded operation could crush her.\n\nBut none of this will happen without money.\n\nSliwa and Maron are badly underfunded and unprepared to mount the competitive campaign New Yorkers deserve. Republicans aren’t running any candidate at all in many council districts.\n\nWhere is the national and state GOP in all this?\n\nWell, they checked out of NYC a long time ago, leaving us for dead — and taking data and fundraising infrastructure with them.\n\nBut we’re not dead. We just need an adrenaline shot to get off life support.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential race, we saw big donors get behind Donald Trump in a way we’ve never seen previously. Wealthy former Democrats from Elon Musk to Bill Ackman recognized the dangers of the woke leftist agenda and put their money on the line.\n\nWe need to ask them to do the same for us here in New York.\n\nAckman, a native New Yorker, understands what’s at stake. He’s been speaking out about the risks to our Jewish community in light of unprecedented antisemitic attacks — from radicals who now have their very own superstar mayoral candidate and several very supportive City Council members.\n\nThis isn’t going to be cheap. \n\nWe’re talking about an investment of $70 to $100 million — not just in contributions to individual candidates or propping up our county committees, but to build real infrastructure: candidate training, consulting networks, independent expenditure groups, activist patronage and more, to fight the Democrats’ machine on equal footing.\n\nVoter activation is the key. Our major elections suffer from woefully low turnout — barely breaking 20%.\n\nDo you think it’s because 80% of New Yorkers are so thrilled with how our city is run they don’t see a need to vote, or because they’re so disgusted and disillusioned with our monopoly politics they’ve simply given up?\n\nReaching these people and getting them engaged is not an impossible task. They came out for Trump.\n\nWith appropriate funding and competent campaign infrastructure, we can turn out even more of them, guaranteed. I’ve seen it up close.\n\nWhen I flipped my Queens district red four years ago, I won by one percentage point. Two years later I won re-election in a 20-point landslide.\n\nI know firsthand the appetite for change in this city. It’s everywhere and it’s palpable.\n\nThe voters are waiting for us; Republicans just have to do what’s necessary to reach them.\n\nBut we cannot do it alone. Now’s the time for the GOP donor class to take New York seriously.\n\nIf we build it, they will come.\n\nVickie Paladino is a Republican City Council member representing the 19th district in northern Queens.","summary":"The 2024 election saw a seismic political shift in NYC as voters sent an unmistakable message of dissatisfaction to the Democrats.

Kentucky's GOP supermajority legislature will have a chance to override Beshear's veto when lawmakers reconvene on Thursday for the final two days of this year's 30-day session. The bill's supporters said it's meant to offer clarity to doctors now fearful of breaking Kentucky law for terminating pregnancies while treating expectant mothers with grave complications. Also Read | Eid al-Fitr 2025 Holiday Air Traffic Surge: Sharjah Airport Gears Up To Welcome Over Half Million Passengers During Holiday on Eid Ul Fitr. Delving into potential life-or-death situations, the bill aims to provide clear guidelines for doctors in such emergencies while maintaining Kentucky's strict prohibitions against abortion, supporters said. “Although supporters of House Bill 90 claim it protects pregnant women and clarifies abortion law in Kentucky, it actually does the opposite,” Beshear said in his veto message. Kentucky's near-total abortion ban has been in place since a so-called trigger law took effect when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade in 2022. The Bluegrass state bans abortions except when carried out to save a mother's life. Efforts to add exceptions for cases of rape or incest or when pregnancies are nonviable have made no headway in Kentucky's Republican-supermajority legislature. The new legislation would create a list of emergency situations in which abortions could be done to save the mother's life, but Beshear said it was flawed. “The bill is silent on any other emergency situations. No one, including legislators, can possibly create an exhaustive list of emergency situations that may occur in a hospital or medical facility. Gaps in the law are literally a matter of life and death,\" the governor said in his message. A House Republican spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Since the Supreme Court overturned the Roe vs Wade and allowed states to enforce abortion bans, exceptions have been a legal and political battleground. The Kentucky bill says doctors exercising reasonable medical judgment may take action “separating a pregnant woman from her unborn child” in such cases as: lifesaving miscarriage management; emergency intervention for sepsis and hemorrhaging; procedures necessary to prevent the death or substantial risk of death of the pregnant woman; removal of an ectopic pregnancy; treatment of a molar pregnancy. “It's not meant to be an exhaustive list but it is the most common issues that physicians and mothers, who are facing a crisis pregnancy, are facing,” Republican Kimberly Poore Moser said during a House debate on the measure. Addia Wuchner, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life, was among the bill's advocates, telling a legislative panel: \"This is medical care that needs to take place in the Commonwealth.\" (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

It threatens to pull federal funding from states where election officials don’t comply.\n\nThe move, which is likely to face swift challenges because states have broad authority to set their own election rules, is consistent with Trump’s long history of railing against election processes. He often claims elections are being rigged, even before the results are known, and has waged battles against certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden and falsely blamed it on widespread fraud.\n\nTrump has focused particularly on mail voting, arguing without evidence that it’s insecure and invites fraud even as he has shifted his position on the issue given its popularity with voters, including Republicans. While fraud occurs, it’s rare, limited in scope and gets prosecuted.\n\nThe order’s documentary proof of citizenship requirement signals that the president is not waiting for congressional Republicans to pass their long-anticipated Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE Act, which has aimed to do the same thing.\n\nRepublicans have defended that measure as necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Voting in federal elections by noncitizens is already illegal and can result in felony charges and deportation.\n\nVoting rights groups have expressed concerns that the requirement could disenfranchise people. An estimated 9% of U.S. citizens of voting age, or 21.3 million people, do not have proof of citizenship readily available, according to a 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice and other groups.\n\nThere are also concerns that married women who have changed their names will encounter trouble when trying to register because their birth certificates list their maiden names. Such hiccups happened in recent town elections in New Hampshire, which has a new state law requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote.\n\nTrump’s order directs federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the State Department to share with election officials federal data that could help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.\n\nIt also says the attorney general should “prioritize enforcement of federal election integrity laws” in states that don’t share information about suspected election crimes with the federal government.\n\nThe order aims to require votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day and says federal funding should be conditional on state compliance. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nTrump’s order is likely to face legal challenges, given that the Constitution gives authority over elections to the states. While Congress has the power to regulate voting — and has done so to pass such laws as the Voting Rights Act — the Constitution makes clear that states have primary authority to set the “times, places and manner” for elections.\n\nColorado’s Democratic secretary of state, Jena Griswold, called the order an “unlawful” weaponization of the federal government and said Trump is “trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box.”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the ranking member of the House committee that oversees elections, said the executive order “is not just misguided — it is immoral and illegal.”\n\nAt least one Democratic attorney on Tuesday threatened legal action. Marc Elias, who has been the subject of Trump’s ire, said in a social media post: “This will not stand. We will sue.”\n\nThe executive branch does have some authority over elections, said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law expert and former White House senior policy adviser during the Biden administration. He said some federal agencies provide election support, including the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which distributes federal grant money to states and runs a voluntary certification program for voting systems. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency helps election officials protect their systems.\n\nFormer President Biden issued an executive order in 2021 directing federal agencies to take steps to boost voter registration, which drew complaints from Republicans who called it federal overreach. Trump has rescinded that order.\n\nTrump’s order calls on the Election Assistance Commission to amend voting system guidelines to protect election integrity, including guidance that voting systems should not use a ballot that uses a barcode or QR code in the vote counting process. It said the commission should condition the funding it distributes to states on those new guidelines.\n\nVirtually all in-person voters in Georgia, as well as voters in several other states, use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter’s selections and a QR code, a type of barcode, that is read by a scanner to count the votes.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and the other jurisdictions that use these machines. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. Raffensperger issued a statement thanking Trump for the executive order, calling it a “great first step for election integrity reform nationwide.”\n\nRep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House committee that oversees elections, said the order is a “welcome action to secure our elections and prevent foreign influence.”\n\nMike Lindell, a Trump ally who spreads election conspiracies and who wants to ban voting systems in favor of hand-counting ballots, fundraised off the news on Tuesday, saying in an email it will fix our “sick elections.”\n\nTrump’s executive order comes as the Republican National Committee launched a massive effort to probe voter registration list maintenance nationwide.

Pressure Mounts After War Plans Leak","text":"President Donald Trump is facing growing pressure to dismiss U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth following the leak of highly sensitive war plans through the encrypted messaging app Signal. The controversy erupted after it was revealed that a private chat between top U.S. officials, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Hegseth, was mistakenly shared with a journalist.\nThe leaked conversation detailed plans for airstrikes on Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, which took place on March 15. The incident has sparked outrage among lawmakers, with some calling for immediate action against those involved.\nDemocrats Demand Hegseth’s Removal\nLeading the charge for accountability, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries described Hegseth as “the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in American history” in a strongly worded letter.\n“His continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation’s security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger,” Jeffries wrote. “His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives, and likely violated the law. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth should be fired immediately.”\nTrump Dismisses Concerns, Defends Officials\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump downplayed the seriousness of the leak, arguing that the chat contained “no classified information.”\n“They were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,” he told reporters.\nTrump also defended his National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, who mistakenly added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to the Signal conversation.\n“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” Trump told NBC News. While he acknowledged that officials would “probably” stop using Signal for sensitive discussions, he did not commit to a full investigation, despite calls from Democrats for high-level resignations.\nWhat Was Leaked?\nThe private chat on Signal included high-ranking officials such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\nWhile Gabbard and Ratcliffe testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that no classified information was shared, Democratic senators remain skeptical. According to The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Hegseth disclosed operational details, including information about targets, weaponry, and attack sequencing.\nRepublican Majority Leader John Thune indicated that the Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to investigate Trump administration officials’ use of Signal for military discussions.\nWhite House Attacks Journalist Instead of Admitting Mistake\nRather than taking full responsibility, the White House has shifted focus toward criticizing the journalist who exposed the leak. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Goldberg of sensationalizing the story, while White House Communications Director Steven Cheung dismissed the media’s coverage of the security breach as a “witch hunt.”\nThe Atlantic responded firmly, stating, “Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans.”\nPentagon Warnings About Signal Ignored?\nDespite the administration’s attempts to downplay the issue, questions remain about why top officials used Signal for discussions instead of secure government channels. According to a report from NBC News, the Pentagon had previously warned against using Signal due to security risks.\nAn internal Pentagon email reportedly stated, “Russia-aligned threat groups are actively targeting the Signal Messenger application of individuals likely to exchange sensitive military and government communications related to the war in Ukraine.”\nEmployees were advised to update the app and adjust their security settings to mitigate potential risks. However, it remains unclear whether any of the officials involved took these precautions.\nALSO READ: US Federal Judge Blocks Deportation of Georgetown Scholar Badar Khan Suri","summary":"President Donald Trump is facing growing pressure to dismiss U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth following the leak of highly sensitive war plans through the encrypted messaging app Signal.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has lingering questions about President Donald Trump's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) nominee, Dr. Mehmet Oz, and his past stances on transgender treatments for minors and abortion, and he says the nominee hasn't answered his inquiries. The Missouri Republican told Fox News Digital in an interview that he remains concerned by Oz's past of \"promoting transgender surgeries for minors, promoting transgender hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors.\" He submitted a number of questions to Oz on the subjects earlier in the month, but Hawley said Oz never answered. \"He hasn't. Which I think is strange,\" he said. TOP DEM USED SAME APP USED IN ATLANTIC SCANDAL TO SET UP CONTACT WITH STEELE DOSSIER AUTHOR \"I'm hoping that he's changed his views,\" Hawley added. \"I'd like to hear from him that he is in total alignment with President Trump, who has been tremendously strong on this.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"Every member of the Trump administration is working from the same playbook, President Trump’s playbook, to restore commonsense policies and put an end to left-wing ideological nonsense afflicting our government.\" \"We look forward to the Senate’s swift confirmation of Dr. Oz so he can join the rest of our all-star team at HHS working to Make America Healthy Again by restoring common sense, transparency, and confidence in our healthcare apparatus.\" 'STOP THEM!': DEMOCRAT CLASHES WITH TRUMP SOCIAL SECURITY NOMINEE OVER DOGE ACCESS As Hawley noted, Oz has used his television show to platform people who supported and promoted transgender treatments, particularly for minors. Oz hosted two transgender children on his show in 2010 in a segment titled, \"Transgender Kids: Too Young to Decide?\" Josie, 8, and the child's mother, Vanessia, claimed that Josie's life improved once the male-born child began embracing a feminine lifestyle. Isaac, who was 15, and the minor's parents, Arturo and Monica, revealed that they decided to let their female-born teenager begin taking puberty blockers and have the teenager's breasts removed in a double mastectomy. CAN CONGRESS DEFUND FEDERAL COURTS WITH KEY TRUMP BUDGET PROCESS? The segment was touted as \"groundbreaking\" by LGBTQ activist group GLAAD, which told supporters to thank Oz. The television doctor has also had a history of supporting abortion. In a 2019 interview on popular radio show \"The Breakfast Club,\" Oz said he was concerned by state laws aimed at restricting or limiting abortion, saying it's \"a hard issue for everybody.\" And while on \"a personal level,\" he didn't like abortion, he also believed he should not \"interfere with everyone else’s stuff.\" CHUCK SCHUMER FACING 'UPHILL FIGHT' AMID LEADERSHIP DOUBTS: 'MATTER OF WHEN, NOT IF' \"Because it’s hard enough to get into life as it is,\" he added. When Oz ran for Senate in Pennsylvania as a Republican in 2022, he still opposed government jurisdiction on the subject of abortion. \"I don’t want the federal government involved with that at all,\" he said during a debate with now-Sen.

She noted that snubbing these opportunities because of political differences contributes to the impression that the party is \"elitist.\" \"Instead of snubbing your nose at those people, which is the perception that a lot of people have of Democrats, is that we’re elitist and we’re academic, and we look down on people who don’t watch traditional Hollywood movies or engage in mainstream media — that’s the perception, and that’s why people are turning against Democrats,\" McMorrow said. NEWSOM, PRITZER, BUTTIGIEG, AMONG THE DEMOCRATS MAKING EARLY 2028 MOVES Politico portrayed the \"Rising Democratic Star\" – who is reportedly prepping a run for U.S. Senate in Michigan in 2026 – as someone who can bring a fresh perspective to a Democratic Party that is struggling following its electoral defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump. The Democratic Party is currently suffering some of its worst polling in decades. According to national polls from CNN and NBC News published earlier this month, just 29% and 27% of respondents, respectively, say they view the party favorably. These represent the lowest approval numbers for the party surveyed by those outlets since the early '90s. McMorrow first gained notoriety in 2022 after a clip went viral of her impassioned rebuttal to a Republican colleague went viral on the floor of the Michigan State Senate after that colleague accused her of \"grooming and sexualizing children\" because of her opposition to a parental rights bill. One of the suggestions McMorrow gave was that the party needs to convey \"authenticity\" and do that by meeting people \"everywhere.\" MEDIA, DEMS CELEBRATE TESLA WOES AS ANGER OVER ELON MUSK'S ROLE IN TRUMP ADMIN CONTINUES \"Democrats have to start being unafraid to go everywhere and meeting people where they are,\" she said while mentioning \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris famously missed an opportunity to go on Rogan’s show just before the election. The Harris team reportedly maintained that bad timing during the height of her campaign season sunk the interview, while Rogan has insisted he gave Harris ample opportunity to fit in a sit-down. Either way, McMorrow said not going on programs like Rogan contributes to the impression that the Democratic Party is above ordinary people who watch the popular podcast. \"You have to be willing to go into spaces that may feel a little bit uncomfortable, and be willing to have maybe three-hour long podcast conversations, or go into a dive bar or go into a bowling alley,\" she said. \"People have really good bull---- detectors. They can tell when you’re giving talking points and you’re trying to be buttoned up,\" she said. \"And this is a moment where I think people want to vote for people that they like and people that they trust, and they’re not going to like you or trust you if they don’t feel like they know who you are, and that’s much bigger than just your job or your title.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Democratic Michigan state senator Mallory McMorrow said in a new interview that her party needs to occupy more popular cultural spaces so it doesn&apos;t come off as &quot;elitist.&quot;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/democratic-u-s-senate-hopeful-party-nixing-rogan-interview-people-turning-against","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/GettyImages-2166798144.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:00:53","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":304140930,"title":"Here is where Maine is challenging the Trump administration in court","text":"Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has repeatedly called several of President Donald Trump’s most high-profile decisions illegal. And he hasn’t shied away from attacking these actions in court.\n\n Frey has joined a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in several multistate lawsuits against the administration since Trump returned to office in January, tackling immigration issues, access to federal funding and the right to privacy.\n\nThe state is also responding to two Title IX investigations, alleging its transgender sports policy violates federal law. Both the federal departments of Education and the Health and Human Services last week gave the state 10 days to respond to their reports, or else Maine risks action from the Department of Justice.\n\nHere’s a breakdown on the latest federal lawsuits involving Maine and the Trump administration:\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nJan. 21 | DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\nFrey and 18 other attorneys general sued the Trump administration after he signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship, the constitutional principle that if someone is born in the U.S., they are a citizen.\n\nA U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts granted Frey and the others’ request for a preliminary injunction, halting Trump’s order until the legal case ends. (The American Civil Liberties Union of Maine joined a similar lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire, where a judge also blocked Trump’s order.)\n\nTrump asked the U.S. Supreme Court on March 14 to weigh in after three appeals courts (including the 1st U.S. Circuit in Boston) rejected his pleas.\n\nFEDERAL FUNDING FREEZE\n\nJan. 28 | DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\nFrey and 22 other Democratic attorneys general sued Trump and the Office of Budget and Management, which shared plans to freeze federal funding to states and nonprofit organizations in late January.\n\nPanic ensued. In Maine alone, there was outcry from public housing agencies, the Medicaid program, victims’ rights organizations, student financial aid recipients and local governments who all rely on federal funding.\n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island immediately blocked Trump from enforcing the freeze as soon as the lawsuit was filed, and on March 6 signed off on a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration , preventing it from freezing essential funding until a final decision is made in the case. The OMB rescinded its order.\n\nBut before that, Frey and the rest of the states had twice asked the judge to enforce the order.\n\n‘DOGE’ ACCESS TO PRIVATE INFO\n\nFeb. 7 | SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nFrey and 18 other Democratic attorneys general sued the Department of Government Efficiency, otherwise called DOGE, to prevent its “unauthorized access” to the Treasury Department’s central payment system.\n\nDOGE was established by the Trump administration and is unofficially led by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nFrey said the states were suing to stop DOGE from accessing what would be American’s “most sensitive personal information,” including bank account details and Social Security numbers.\n\nA judge granted their request for a temporary restraining order, halting DOGE’s access, and then granted their heavier request for a preliminary injunction on Feb. 21.\n\nRESEARCH FUNDING\n\nFeb. 10 | DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\nThis lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, challenged Trump’s ability to cut reimbursements at research institutions for biomedical research and utility costs.\n\nThese institutions rely on a unique “indirect cost reimbursement system” with the federal government to pay for their work. In early February, the National Institutes on Health announced it would slash rates unilaterally by 15% (which Frey said would have a disproportionate impact on varying institutions and their work.)\n\nIn Maine, the order would lead to millions in cutbacks for scientific research at the University of New England, Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, MDI Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, the University of Maine System and the MaineHealth Institute for Research.\n\nA temporary restraining order was issued that same day and was extended 11 days later, despite opposition from the Trump administration.\n\nOn March 5, a Massachusetts judge agreed to award Frey and the others a nationwide preliminary injunction, preventing billions of dollars in cuts to research until a final decision is made.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LAYOFFS\n\nMarch 13 | DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\nFrey joined 21 other attorneys general in a lawsuit against the Trump administration in March after Trump ordered the Department of Education to drastically reduce its workforce. (That included shuttering its regional office in Boston.)\n\nThe states’ attorneys asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to reverse Trump’s order.\n\nThey filed a motion for preliminary injunction on Monday, asking the court to pause Trump’s order, halting the layoffs, until a final decision is reached in the case. The court has yet to hold a hearing on the request.","summary":"Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey has joined several multistate lawsuits against the Trump administration related to immigration, privacy rights and federal funding.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/03/25/here-is-where-maine-is-challenging-the-trump-administration-in-court/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/41682399_20250325_AaronFrey_290971-1742946923.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:00:33","author":"Emily Allen","authors":["Emily Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":304140252,"title":"Panama ports deal: eyebrows raised over Hong Kong’s Richard Li in Beijing, observers say","text":"The appearance of the younger son of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing at a high-profile summit in Beijing on the weekend caused a stir in business circles given how the central government had signalled its displeasure over the sale of Panama Canal ports controlled by his family’s conglomerate, observers have said.\nRichard Li Tzar-kai was among 93 people who appeared in a group photo with Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the China Development Forum on Sunday in Beijing. His father and his elder brother, Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, were absent.\nStanding in the last row, the younger brother was sporting his usual round, black-framed glasses.\nHe attended in his capacity as founder of Pacific Century Group, a Hong Kong-based private investment conglomerate with interests in technology, media, financial services, infrastructure and property.\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant to the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said on Tuesday that Beijing recognised that the brothers had been involved in separate business ventures for a long time.\n“Richard Li is not involved in the sale of piers by Hutchison and he is a tycoon in his own right,” Lau said. “Besides, Beijing has not issued any official statement against Hutchison or Li Ka-shing.”\nCK Hutchison Holdings, which is controlled by the Li family, has remained silent since revealing on March 4 the surprise deal to sell its overseas port assets, including operations at each end of the Panama Canal.\nA consortium led by the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock for US$23 billion, secured the deal.\nIt will make the consortium a top player in the global port industry, while the sale will generate US$19 billion in cash for CK Hutchison.\n\nLau said Richard Li was invited to the Beijing event before the controversy erupted.\nThe central government had not decided to “abruptly” withdraw the invitation, the veteran observer said.\nBut Beijing remained “very much concerned” about the Li family following the port deal.\nUnited States President Donald Trump has hailed the sale, saying Washington will be “reclaiming” the canal from what he sees as Chinese control. CK Hutchison came under intense pressure over its Panama operations when Trump returned to the White House in January.\nCK Hutchison’s share price jumped 4.2 per cent to HK$45.05 on Monday after the photo of Richard Li attending the Beijing event was released, and remained unchanged on Tuesday.\nOther Hongkongers spotted in the group shot at the two-day forum included Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing chairman Carlson Tong Ka-shing, Rosewood Hotel Group chief executive Sonia Cheng Chi-man and the MTR Corporation chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen.\nThe backdrop of the photo read: “Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global Economy”.\nJacky Ko Chung-kit, vice-chairman of the Y. Elites Association, which has over 1,300 members and advises the government, said Richard Li’s attendance “as one of the representatives of the Chinese business community” raised eyebrows given the tight spot the conglomerate is finding itself in over the ports sale.\n“This would have been something to be proud of, but CK Hutchison’s proposed sale of overseas port assets, including Panama, has sparked controversy in recent days,” Ko said.\n“We can’t help but ask: since it is a Chinese enterprise, shouldn’t it be China’s interests that should be safeguarded? So, should the Li family think twice about selling the ports?\n“Chinese companies should stand on the perspective of national interests ... Foreign enterprises are still firmly optimistic about the Chinese market and actively integrate into the tide of China’s development, should the Li family go against the current?”\nKo cited close to 30 American companies that took part in the conference, with multinationals such as Apple, Pfizer, FedEx, Siemens, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Samsung also attending.\nThe controversy surrounding the CK Hutchison deal has continued to snowball, with leading Hong Kong political figures weighing in over the past days.\nOver the weekend, Starry Lee Wai-king, the city’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislative body, said companies would find making “pure commercial decisions” difficult in the current environment as politics and business were intertwined.\nHer predecessor, Tam Yiu-chung, said the export business and the shipping industry “matter to national security”.\nChief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu also lashed out against foreign governments’ “abusive use of coercion” in trade relations last week.\nThe politicians were echoing commentaries from state-owned Hong Kong media outlet Ta Kung Pao, which slammed the sale. Beijing’s offices in Hong Kong reposted the pieces in recent weeks.","summary":"Younger son of tycoon Li Ka-shing rubbed shoulders with elites on weekend in nation’s capital, but observer says Beijing sees him as separate to controversial deal.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3303867/panama-deal-eyebrows-raised-over-hong-kongs-richard-li-beijing-observers-say","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/25/931dca39-aa49-4620-8419-e343888b4176_4d46d04b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-26 00:00:14","author":"Lam Ka-Sing","authors":["Lam Ka-Sing"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.173},{"id":304143942,"title":"Trump Issues Executive Order Including Major Changes To Elections—Here’s What We Know","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that promises to bring major changes to the voting process in the U.S., issuing the order after he pushed a litany of false voter fraud claims.\n\nTrump signed the order Tuesday afternoon. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe executive order said the U.S. “fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and accused former President Joe Biden’s Justice Department of not prioritizing the vetting of voters’ citizenship in recent elections.\n\nThe order aims to make changes to the voting registration process, voter records and voting systems.\n\nIt is likely the order will be challenged in court, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nHow Will Voting Registration Change Under The Executive Order?\n\nDocumentary proof of U.S. citizenship will be needed to register for voting in federal elections, such as for president and members of Congress. Proofs of citizenship include a U.S. passport, a Real ID-compliant driver’s license, a military ID or a federal or state government-issued ID.\n\nHow Are Absentee And Mail-In Ballots Impacted By The Executive Order?\n\nAbsentee and mail-in ballots, the latter of which Trump has baselessly accused of provoking large-scale fraud, cannot be counted after Election Day. Puerto Rico and 18 states accept mail ballots received after Election Day, the Associated Press reported, citing the National Conference of State Legislatures and noting ballots are accepted if they are postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\nWhat Penalties Will There Be For Not Following The Order’s Requirements?\n\nStates that do not follow the requirements laid out in the order could potentially lose federal funding and grants.\n\nWill Doge Be Involved In The Voting Registration Process?\n\nYes, partially. The Department of Government Efficiency, which is headed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, will work with the Department of Homeland Security to review every state’s public voter registration list for “voter list maintenance activities.”\n\nVoter fraud in the U.S. has not proved to be the large-scale problem Trump has claimed it is. An Associated Press analysis of every potential voter fraud case in battleground states disputed by Trump in the 2020 election found cases of fraud were minimal, did not come close to changing the outcome of elections and showed there was no collusion among groups of people intended to rig voting at a large scale. Additionally, a report commissioned by Trump’s own 2020 campaign reportedly found no widespread election fraud, suggesting the campaign pushed election fraud claims despite knowing they were false.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump and his campaign repeatedly alleged large-scale voter fraud in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, when former President Joe Biden defeated Trump with 306 electoral votes and 51.3% of the popular vote. A House committee investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and Trump’s actions on that day found he was told by aides and family there was no backing for the voter fraud allegations he made. Trump continued making the claims years after the 2020 election, even fueling debunked and contested fraud allegations during the 2024 election, though the president largely stopped pushing the claims after results rolling in on election night suggested a clear victory.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Vows ‘Long Term Prison Sentences’ For Election ‘Cheating’—Despite No Evidence Of Major Fraud (Forbes)\n\nTrump’s Pennsylvania Fraud Claims Debunked: Overseas Voter Challenges Latest Claims Spreading In Battleground State (Forbes)\n\nTrump’s Claims Of ‘Massive Cheating’ Struck Down By Philadelphia Officials (Forbes)\n\nTrump Approval Rating Tracker: Here’s Where He Stands—After 2 Months Marked By Court Battles, Trade Wars (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Among them is whether federal laws were violated, if classified information was exposed on the commercial messaging app, and whether anyone will face consequences for the leaks. Also Read | US President Donald Trump Nominates Republican Attorney Thomas March Bell, Once Accused of Mishandling Taxpayer Funds, As HHS Watchdog. Here's what we know so far, and what we don't know. KNOWN: Signal is a publicly available app that provides encrypted communications, but it can be hacked. It is not approved for carrying classified information. Also Read | Eid al-Fitr 2025 Holiday Air Traffic Surge: Sharjah Airport Gears Up To Welcome Over Half Million Passengers During Holiday on Eid Ul Fitr. On March 14, one day before the strikes, the US defence department cautioned personnel about the vulnerability of Signal, specifically that Russia was attempting to hack the app, according to a US official, who was not authorised to speak to the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity. One known vulnerability is that malicious actors, if they have access to a person's phone, can link their own device to the user's Signal -- and essentially monitor messages remotely in real time. NOT KNOWN: How frequently the administration and the defence department use Signal for sensitive government communications, and whether those on the chat were using unauthorised personal devices to transmit or receive those messages. The department put out an instruction in 2023 restricting what information could be posted on unauthorised and unclassified systems. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard would not say whether she was accessing the information on her personal phone or government-issued phone, citing an ongoing investigation by the National Security Council. KNOWN: The government has a requirement under the Presidential Records Act to archive all of those planning discussions. NOT KNOWN: Whether anyone in the group archived the messages as required by law to a government server. KNOWN: The chat group included 18 members, including Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. The group, called “Houthi PC Small Group\", likely for Houthi \"principals committee”, comprised Trump's senior-most advisors on national security, including Gabbard, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The National Security Council said the text chain “appears to be authentic\". NOT KNOWN: How Goldberg got added. Each agency principal named a staff member to be added to the chat, and Waltz named his staffer Alex Wong, as taking the lead in assembling the team that would monitor the attacks. It was not clear if Waltz himself, or a staffer managing Waltz's Signal account, sent Goldberg the invitation. KNOWN: Just hours before the attack on the Houthis in Yemen began, Hegseth shared details on the timing, targets, weapons and sequence of strikes that would take place. NOT KNOWN: The classification level of this information. In the Senate hearing, both Gabbard and Ratcliffe referred questions to Hegseth on whether classified information was posted to the unclassified Signal chat. Hegseth so far has not answered questions on whether the information he shared on Signal during that messaging was classified. KNOWN: Hegseth has adamantly denied that “war plans” were texted on Signal, something that current and former US officials called “semantics.” War plans carry a specific meaning. They often refer to the numbered and highly classified planning documents — sometimes thousands of pages long — that would inform US decisions in case of a major conflict, such as if the United States is called to defend Taiwan. But the information Hegseth did post -- specific attack details selecting human and weapons storage targets -- was a subset of those plans and was likely informed by the same classified intelligence. Posting those details to an unclassified app risked tipping off adversaries of the pending attack and could have put US service members at risk, multiple U.S. officials said. Sharing that information on a commercial app like Signal in advance of a strike “would be a violation of everything that we're about,” said former defence secretary Chuck Hagel, who served under President Barack Obama. NOT KNOWN: If anyone outside the messaging group got access to the Signal texts. KNOWN: Hegseth is cracking down on unauthorised leaks of information inside the Defense Department, and his chief of staff issued a memo on March 21 saying the Pentagon would use polygraph tests to determine the sources of recent leaks, and prosecute those found to have disclosed unauthorized information. NOT KNOWN: Whether Hegseth will take responsibility for the unauthorized release of national defense information to a journalist regarding the attack plans on the Houthis.

Appearing on Steve Bannon’s podcast “The War Room,” she said she’s working to scale back the agency to its “bare minimum”, in alignment with the president’s recent executive order aimed in part at lowering federal spending on media. \n\nUnited States Agency for Global Media is a global media agency designed to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy,” according to its website. Several entities are overseen by United States Agency for Global Media, including Voice of America, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. \n\nAccording to Lake, programming supported by the agency does not always serve its pro-American purpose. \n\n“The focus was supposed to be talking and telling the American story, and they haven’t been doing that,” she said. “I recently tuned in and saw a graphic on Voice of America that showed President Trump with a swastika over his face. That’s not what our taxpayer-funded media should be putting out.” \n\nLake explained that the cuts are not solely about editorial content but about a broader mission to prevent bankruptcy and rein in government spending. \n\n“We’ve got to get this debt under control, Steve,” she added, “or we won’t have a country anymore.” \n\nMany government agencies—such as United States Agency for Global Media—are created by Congress, so Trump cannot dismantle them through an executive order. However, funding for the agencies can be cut back to a legal minimum. \n\nLake is working with lawyers to determine the statutory minimum for the various grantees of United States Agency for Global Media to scale back funding. \n\nShe noted that once money is funneled to United States Agency for Global Media’s grantees, there is a lack of transparency. “We don’t know exactly what they’re doing with that money. … So, we just want to have more transparency.

DNA extracted from these cells is \"inserted into a donor egg\" and the resultant embryo \"implanted into a surrogate mother\", said The Independent. This means a \"genetically identical twin\" can be born \"months – or even years – after the original pet has passed away\".\n\nThe process doesn't come cheap – typical fees range from £15,000 to £30,000 – and animal rights activists have called it \"cruel\" and \"unethical\", claiming that each surrogate mother undergoes \"unnecessary suffering\". But that doesn't seem to be stopping the increasing demand for cloned pets.\n'Twice as many pets as toddlers'\nBehind the popularity of the pet cloning in China are two clear recent trends. First, the relationship between Chinese people and their pets has changed. Pets' main role used to be \"guarding homes\", Liu Xiaoxia, a pet industry expert, told Global Times. Now, they are valued for \"emotional interaction and companionship\" and have \"a deeper integration into people's daily lives\".\nAnd that's led to the second trend: a surge in pet ownership. Millions of Chinese people got a pet during the pandemic, and figures suggest that, by 2030, there will twice as many pets in China as toddlers. There is now a booming industry \"to pamper them\", said Bloomberg, with 4.7 million pet-related companies in the country, up by almost 50% in the past 12 months alone. It's a market already worth ¥300.2 billion (£32 billion), said Global Times, and forecast to reach ¥400 billion (£42.6 billion) by 2027.\nAnd, as those pandemic-purchased pets age, pet cloning looks set to become an increasingly profitable part of this sector. A Goldman Sachs report calculated that 28% of pet dogs in China are more than seven years old, and about 10% of cats are more than eight years old, said the Financial Times. That means \"millions of cats and dogs are entering old age\".\nCould pet cloning take off in the UK? Cloning animals is banned here, except for research purposes. But there is a company in Shropshire that gets around this by freezing the tissue samples and sending them to the US for the cloning process, before \"a twin of the original animal\" can be brought back to the UK, said The Guardian.\n\nExplore More\n\nChina economy\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nChas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nChas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

student Yunseo Chung for deportation","text":"A judge ordered US authorities on Tuesday to cease efforts to detain and deport a New York college student, as US President Donald Trump presses his campaign against pupils linked to pro-Palestinian protests.\nTrump has targeted New York’s Columbia University, where the student is enrolled, as an epicentre of the US student protest movement sparked by Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, stripping federal funds and directing immigration officers to deport foreign student demonstrators.\nCritics argue that the Trump administration’s campaign is retribution and will have a chilling effect on free speech, while its supporters insist it is necessary to restore order to campuses and protect Jewish students.\nAuthorities had sought to detain Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old South Korean citizen and permanent resident of the United States, under the same powers they used to arrest and hold Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil pending deportation.\nIn both cases, authorities argue the students undermined US foreign policy through their actions, a charge which allows the Secretary of State to deport foreigners.\nChung, whom officers reportedly have been unable to find, sued the US government on Monday, arguing that “immigration enforcement – here, immigration detention and threatened deportation – may not be used as a tool to punish non-citizen speakers who express political views disfavoured by the current administration”.\n\nAccording to Chung’s lawyers, Columbia’s Public Safety department contacted Chung to tell her that Homeland Security agents were seeking her arrest.\nAt an emergency hearing on Tuesday, judge Naomi Buchwald ordered the government to stop its effort to locate and remove Chung, a court order said.\n“Defendants-respondents are enjoined from detaining the plaintiff-petitioner pending further order of this court,” Buchwald said in a temporary restraining order.\nSeparately, a number of university professors sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, arguing its policy targeting foreign academics was illegal.\n“The policy prevents or impedes plaintiffs’ US citizen members from hearing from, and associating with, their non-citizen students and colleagues,” the lawsuit reads.\nIn addition, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers asked a New York judge to declare Trump’s slashing of US$400 million from Columbia’s budget unconstitutional and to restore the funding.\nColumbia’s student movement has been at the forefront of protests that have exposed deep rifts over the war in Gaza, drawing dividing lines on the issues of protest and free speech across the country.\nKhalil, the arrested Columbia graduate student, was a prominent leader in the protest movement, leading negotiations between students and university authorities.\nLawyers are seeking to have him released from detention in Louisiana while they fight his deportation.\nChung, meanwhile, did not have such a high profile in the protest movement.\nHer lawyers acknowledge that she was detained and released for “obstruction of governmental administration” and the case is pending in the New York courts system.\n\nOn March 13, federal agents searched two Columbia-owned residences apparently in connection with Chung’s case, according to her lawyers.\nActivists call the protests that rocked numerous US campuses a show of support for the Palestinian people, while Trump condemns them as antisemitic and says they must end.\nThe president has cut US$400 million in federal funding for Columbia – including research grants and other contracts – on the grounds that the institution has not adequately protected Jewish students from harassment.\nColumbia announced on Friday a package of concessions to the Trump administration around defining antisemitism, policing protests and oversight for specific academic departments.\nThey stopped short however of some of the more strenuous demands of the Trump administration, which nonetheless welcomed the Ivy League college’s proposals.\nTodd Wolfson, of the American Association of University Professors that joined the academics’ lawsuit, said “the Trump administration is going after international scholars and students who speak their minds about Palestine, but make no mistake: they won’t stop there”.","summary":"Authorities are seeking to detain the green card holder under the same powers they used to target pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud

owner urges Rachel Reeves to reform business rates if planning tax cuts for US tech giants","text":"THE owner of Screwfix and B&Q has called on the Chancellor to urgently reform business rates if she plans to cut taxes for big US tech companies, including Amazon. \n\nKingfisher boss Thierry Garnier said web retailers already had unfair advantages. \n\nRachel Reeves is considering softening the digital services taxes on US technology in an attempt to broker better terms with President Donald Trump on a trade deal. \n\nAnd Mr Garnier responded: “It puts even more pressure to reform business rates because it is already an unfair competition for bricks and mortar retailers who are paying higher taxes.” \n\nKingfisher highlighted that it is facing £145million in higher costs this year - with £45million directly down to the government’s changes to national insurance contributions and looming packaging levies. \n\nKingfisher would also pay a higher rates bill under government plans to increase the levy for more valuable and large properties. \n\nMr Garnier had backed calls for the Chancellor to stagger in the changes to NICs — to allow companies to be able to budget properly rather than face a sudden wall of costs from the start of April. \n\nHowever, it is understood the demands have fallen on deaf ears as Ms Reeves grapples with the demands of stretched finances and a need to hike defence spending. \n\nKingfisher’s shares were knocked hard yesterday by its warnings that profits and cashflow will be lower this year as a result of the uncertain environment. \n\nBut the UK is more resilient for the DIY giant than its markets in Poland, Romania and France. \n\nFor the past year, Kingfisher posted total revenues of £12.7billion and pre-tax profits of £306 million. \n\nIn the UK, Screwfix is powering ahead with plans to open 30 new small City stores within the year, creating 400 jobs. \n\nIts speedy deliveries on Screwfix Sprint have also jumped by 40 per cent. \n\nU.S fizz fever\n\nPOSH tonic maker Fever-Tree is fizzing in America — while things are less bubbly in the UK. \n\nThe British drinks company yesterday reported its US sales had risen by 9 per cent to £128million, but fell by 3 per cent in the UK to £111million. \n\nThe brand recently signed a tie-up with US brewer Molson-Coors in a further bid to boost its expansion in America, where it is more popular for its ginger beer and mixers, including a new Espresso Martini cocktail mix. \n\nThe firm recently tied-up with actress Margot Robbie’s Papa Salt gin brand for its first ready-to-drink tinnies, with a “blood orange gin spritz” using soda, rather than tonic. \n\nBeware growing wrong!\n\nTHE head of the City watchdog yesterday said that the government’s drive for economic growth has trade-offs with the potential for “one or two more things” to go wrong. \n\nNikhil Rathi, boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, told MPs yesterday there should be a “good healthy debate” around the benefits and risks of having a strong focus on growth. \n\nThe FCA is reviewing mortgage lending and shake-ups to savings accounts to encourage retail investors to take more risk with their savings. \n\nHowever, Mr Rathi cautioned that it was “not great” how many young people were choosing crypto as an investment because “there’s a very high risk and you could potentially lose all your money”. \n\nA.I means more gas for Shell\n\nSHELL is placing a big bet on gas while trimming spending on renewables — as it bids to boost returns for shareholders. \n\nThe FTSE 100-listed energy giant said it was prioritising “higher return opportunities” and plans to ramp up sales of liquefied natural gas (LNG). \n\nIt reckons LNG will become even more important as AI data centres around the world suck up huge amounts of power. \n\nRather than cutting oil production to reduce carbon emissions, it will maintain current levels, while also reducing spending on lower profit, low-carbon businesses. \n\nBoss Wael Sawan is motivated by a desire to boost Shell’s valuation on a par with its US rivals. He said: “We are investing where we have competitive strengths and delivering more for our shareholders.” \n\nMr Sawan’s annual pay rose by 8.5 per cent last year — up to £8.6million, Shell’s accounts show. \n\nAldi ups its steak\n\nAldi is to become Britain’s biggest seller of upmarket Wagyu beef after signing a contract with a Yorkshire farm. \n\nThe £320million deal with family-owned Warrendale Wagyu will help the discounter sell 2.5million steaks a year. \n\nAldi first started selling the steaks — known for their fat marbling — and burgers to appeal to more middle class shoppers. The steaks sell for around £6.99 in Aldi, around £10 cheaper than Waitrose. \n\nElon overtaken\n\nCHINESE electric car maker BYD’S sales have overtaken Elon Musk’s Tesla for the first time in a milestone moment for the industry. \n\nThe rapidly growing Shenzhen-based brand saw sales jump by 29 per cent last year to $107billion (£83 billion), eclipsing Tesla’s $97.7billion (£76.6 billion). \n\nTesla is suffering slumping sales, particularly in Europe where some drivers are boycotting the brand due to Musk’s involvement with Donald Trump and his support for Germany’s AfD party. \n\nTAXPAYERS now own 4 per cent less in NatWest as the bank edges back to private hands. A large stake was shored up in the 2008 credit crunch. \n\nBut it has been rapidly cut from 40 per cent at the end of 2023, aided by NatWest’s improved share price. \n\nChop at shops \n\nRETAIL sales slumped this month as trade tensions and Budget woes hit business and consumer confidence. \n\nSales volumes fell the fastest since election jitters last July, stats from the CBI business lobby show. They are at negative 41 per cent for March, down from negative 23 per cent earlier. It marks the sixth month in a row that sales have fallen. \n\nThe CBI’s Martin Sartorius said it shows a need for “policies that boost businesses’ confidence to invest” ahead of the Spring Statement.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/34058232/screwfix-owner-rachel-reeves-reform-business-rates/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/crop-34058448.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-25 23:47:26","author":"Ashley Armstrong","authors":["Ashley Armstrong"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.029}]}
