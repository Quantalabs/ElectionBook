Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX as well as an advisor to President Donald Trump, bought the site then called Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, gutted its staff and changed its policies on hate speech, misinformation and user verification and renamed it X.\n\nMORE: Elon Musk announces new company xAI\n\nHe launched xAI a year later.\n\n“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined.

Saturday's demonstrations marked the first coordinated effort to target all 277 Tesla locations in the US, as per Al Jazeera.\nIn New York City, hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Manhattan Tesla store, demanding Musk's resignation.

Vance and other senior officials “gently offered” President Donald Trump to fire National Security Adviser Mike Waltz during a private discussion about the blunder in which Waltz accidentally included a reporter in a confidential chat about US military strikes in Yemen, according to anonymous insider sources cited by Politico.\n\nTwo individuals allegedly familiar with the closed-door meeting at the White House on Wednesday night told Politico that Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and personnel chief Sergio Gor advised Trump that it might be time to cut Waltz loose.\n\nThe president reportedly agreed that Waltz had “messed up,” but ultimately decided against a dismissal.\n\n“Like hell he’d give the liberal media and pearl-clutching Democrats a win,” Politico wrote on Friday, citing one insider as saying the administration “don’t want to give the press a scalp.”\n\nThe leak, first reported by The Atlantic on Monday, revealed that Waltz had inadvertently invited editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a confidential Signal chat where senior administration officials were discussing upcoming airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. Waltz has taken “full responsibility” for the incident, calling it “embarrassing” in a Fox News interview and attributing the inclusion to a technical “glitch.”\n\nPresident Trump has largely downplayed the controversy, dismissing the media response as a “witch hunt” and questioning the reliability of Signal. He also emphasized that no classified information was compromised and praised the military operation as “unbelievably successful.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt voiced the administration’s stance, stating on Monday that “President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.”\n\nVance, for his part, has publicly aligned himself with the president’s decision. On Friday, he brought Waltz along for a high-profile trip to Greenland, where he dismissed media speculation and defended the national security team.\n\n“If you think you’re going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody, you’ve got another thing coming,” Vance told reporters.\n\nYet Politico claimed that Waltz’s position remains tenuous, citing one Trump ally who said, “They’ll stick by him for now, but he’ll be gone in a couple of weeks.” Other unnamed sources described longstanding personal and political tensions, alleging that Waltz has alienated colleagues by overstepping boundaries and acting more like a principal than a staffer.\n\nA spokesman for Waltz, Brian Hughes, pushed back against the narrative, calling the reports “gossip from people lacking the integrity to attach their names.” He emphasized that Waltz “serves at the pleasure of President Trump” and continues to have the president’s support.","summary":"Vice President J.D.

Chock and Bates finished with 222.06 points, while Gilles and Poirier took the silver medal for the second straight year with 216.54. Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson landed on the podium in third, earning Britain’s first world medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean finished their run of four straight ice dance titles in 1984. Oksana Grishuk and Evgeni Platov were the last to win three in a row, triumphing four straight times for Russia from 1994-97. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Coming in here, we weren’t thinking about a three-peat or any type of title defense. It was a standalone event,\" Bates said. \"We were as prepared as we could possibly be, and we skated as well as we could have.\" The Americans and Canadians have dominated ice dance in recent years, winning six of the nine medals awarded in the past three years. The rivalry between the teams of Chock and Bates and Gilles and Poirier has become one of the most intense in recent years, and this year had the added spice of geopolitical tension between their respective countries. The U.S. and Canada are engaged in an unprecedented trade war after President Donald Trump imposed a series of tariffs against Canada, prompting retaliatory tariffs in response. The tension from the ongoing trade war has spilled into sports. The sports tension was first exposed during the NHL 4 Nations Face-Off tournament from Feb. 12-20. Fans in Canada booed the U.S. national anthem while fans in the U.S. booed the Canadian national anthem ahead of multiple games. It started Feb. 13, when Canadian fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem after Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Canada and suggestion the country should become America's 51st state. NHL STAR ON TEAM USA PLAYERS' AMERICAN PRIDE: 'HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM AMERICANS IN GENERAL' The booing prompted brawls between Canadian and U.S. players in the first meeting of the tournament between the two teams Feb. 15. The U.S. won that game 3-1. The Canadian national anthem was then booed at TD Garden in Boston before a 4 Nations game between Canada and Finland. The U.S. and Canada then met in the final Feb. 20, and American fans in Boston again booed the Canadian national anthem, albeit with a lighter tone. Canada won the game in overtime, 3-2. Since then, hostile rhetoric between the two countries, including in sports, has only escalated. NHL games involving teams based in Canada and the U.S. have often featured booing during pregame national anthems of the visiting team. Fans at WWE Elimination Chamber in Toronto booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" ahead of the event. Star sports commentator Pat McAfee loudly lambasted the Canadian fans for booing and the country as a whole in response during the Peacock broadcast. \"It kind of sucks that it's in the terrible country of Canada that booed our national anthem to start this entire thing,\" McAfee shouted at the broadcast table. McAfee has since said he has received death threats against his infant daughter for the comments. Canadian men’s soccer coach Jesse Marsch blasted Trump for his \"51st state\" remarks, calling them \"insulting.\" During CONCACAF Nations League media day, Marsch said he was \"ashamed\" of how Canada had been insulted by the president. \"If I have one message to our president, it’s lay off the ridiculous rhetoric about Canada being the 51st state,\" Marsch said. \"As an American, I’m ashamed of the arrogance and disregard we’ve shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies. But one thing’s for sure: When I look forward a month from now, this will fuel our team. The mentality we have, the will we have to play for our country.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP NHL legend Wayne Gretzky has also been criticized by fellow Canadians for his apparent support of Trump, who recently said he had asked Gretzky to become the next \"governor of Canada\" after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning. After Gretzky expressed support for \"Canada remaining a separate country, rather than becoming a cherished and beautiful 51st State,\" Trump declared Gretzky a \"free agent.\" Now, the U.S. has notched a victory in the heightened sports rivalry courtesy of Bates and Chock, but the stakes will be higher in the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics next year. Chock and Bates were part of the U.S. squad that won team gold at the 2022 Games in Beijing after a protracted investigation into Russian doping. But, for all their success, Chock and Bates have never stood on an Olympic podium in ice dance, finishing in fourth place three years ago. \"I think the Olympic season certainly carries a different weight than the other three years,\" Chock said. \"You have this incredible opportunity to reach the entire world, and it makes it really special because it amplifies our voices on and off the ice.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy JESSICA JANES FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:36 GMT, 30 March 2025 |Updated:00:38 GMT, 30 March 2025 \n\nHollywood actress Goldie Hawn has reportedly turned down an offer of up to £1 million to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. \nThe Overboard star, 79, was said to be in advanced talks to sign up for the ITV1 reality show, which begins on April 7, according to The Sun. \nHowever, Goldie, who revealed at the 2025 Oscars that she was struggling with her vision due to cataracts, reportedly decided the timing wasn't right for her and declined the offer. \nA source told the publication: 'Goldie would have been a massive coup for Celebrity Big Brother.\n'She is a Hollywood legend so would have had plenty of tales to spill on the rich and famous.\n'Bosses were hoping to replicate the success of Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh who were a hit on last year’s series thanks to their lack of filter and celebrity gossip.' \n\nHollywood actress Goldie Hawn has reportedly turned down an offer of up to £1 million to appear on Celebrity Big Brother (pictured this month)\n\nThe Overboard star, 79, was said to be in advanced talks to sign up for the ITV1 reality show, which begins on April 7, according to The Sun (pictured with her daughter Kate Hudson)\nThe source added that Goldie was 'flattered by the offer' however, she decided now wasn't the right time for her. \nOther stars reportedly joining Celebrity Big Brother include Coronation Street actor Jack P. Shepherd and British Olympic legend Daley Thompson. The show will begin on April 7. \nMailOnline has contacted Goldie's representative for comment. \nEarlier this month, the actress left viewers of the 2025 Academy Awards stunned after giving a heartbreaking health update on stage. \nThe 79-year-old Oscar winner, who was presenting with Andrew Garfield, stopped partway through her scripted presentation because she was unable to read the text on the teleprompter.\n'I was so lucky [to] make movies... and making people laugh,' Goldie said. 'And maybe some didn't, but that's OK.' \n'In the meantime,' she continued, before suddenly pausing and turning to Garfield.\n'OK. Sweetheart, can you read that. I can't read that,' she said, going off script.\n\nHowever, Goldie, who revealed at the 2025 Oscars that she was struggling with her vision due to cataracts, reportedly decided the timing wasn't right for her and declined the offer (pictured last year)\n'I'm completely blind. I mean, I am!' she continued, before revealing the cause of her vision issues: 'Cataracts.'\nWhile Goldie had previously spoken about having cataracts, this was the first time she discussed it in front of such a large audience. The Oscars typically attract about 20 million viewers. \nGarfield played it cool, responding, 'OK, I've got you.'\nHowever, after the overwhelming response to her comments, Goldie was reportedly concerned that her 'joke' overshadowed her appearance as a presenter. \n'Goldie is embarrassed that the focus of her Oscar night was her vision issues, it is not something she wanted everyone talking about,' a source said.\n'She was just trying to be funny.'\nCataracts develop when the usually clear lens of the eye becomes cloudy, making it seem as if one is viewing the world through a fog. \nThe condition can impact activities that require clear vision, such as reading or driving - especially at night. \nCataracts often develop gradually and may not be noticed for some time. However, the good news is that cataract surgery is typically safe and effective, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nBefore Goldie's admission, Andrew was responsible for one of the most touching moments of the night. \n\nEarlier this month, the actress left viewers of the 2025 Academy Awards stunned after giving a heartbreaking health update on stage alongside Andrew Garfield\n\nShe paused her prepared speech after being unable to read the teleprompter. 'I'm completely blind. I mean, I am!' she said, before revealing the cause of her vision issues: 'Cataracts'\nThe two-time Oscar nominee, 41, was joined by Goldie as they presented the award for Best Animated Feature Film.\nBut Andrew took her by surprise when he brought her to tears as he revealed her surprise impact on his late mother. \nThe Social Network star, who lost his mother Lynn Garfield to cancer in 2019, thanked Goldie for giving his mother 'the most joy, the most comfort' through her long career peppered with classic film and television performances.\nGoldie was visibly moved by the seemingly impromptu speech and started to cry before she partially covered her face with the winner's envelope and tried to wipe her eyes.\n\nAndrew, who looked stylish in a brown tux with a lustrous satin shirt, turned toward Goldie at the microphone and held her hand between his as he shared his sweet praise.\n'Can I tell you something?' Andrew asked mysteriously as soon as he and Goldie were ready to start their presentation.\n'There's someone, there's a person who gave my mother during her life the most joy, the most comfort, and tonight, I feel very lucky, because I get to thank that person from the bottom of my heart,' he said before revealing that the person was standing right next to him.\n'You've given us movies full of joy. You've lifted our spirits and you've made us feel it all was right with the world, over and over again,' he said while holding Goldie's hand.\n\nBefore Goldie's admission, Andrew was responsible for one of the most touching moments of the night, making Goldie Hawn tear up at the mention of his late mother \n\nThe Social Network star thanked Goldie for giving his mother 'the most joy, the most comfort' through her long career peppered with classic film and television performances \n\nAndrew lost his mother Lynn Garfield (R) to cancer in 2019; they're pictured with his father Richard Garfield at a Tony Awards after party in 2018 in NYC\n\n Goldie Hawn regrets 'revealing' shocking health condition while presenting on stage at 2025 Oscars \nGoldie, whose face crumpled up as she tried to hold back her tears, responded: 'Thank you so much, that really touches me.'\n'I was so lucky [to] make movies... and making people laugh,' she continued in what seemed to be the start of her preplanned speech. 'And maybe some didn't, but that's OK.'\nAndrew, whose latest film We Live In Time was released in October in the US and on New Year's Day in the UK, spoke about his mother last year during the film's publicity campaign.\nIn the film, Florence Pugh plays his love interest who battles Ovarian cancer, and the storyline prompted comparisons to Andrew's mother Lynn's own battle with cancer before her death.\nWhile speaking with the Hollywood Reporter last year, Andrew said that filming We Live In Time had helped him to heal from the loss of his beloved mother.\n'Every species of every living thing on this earth has lost a mother. Young dinosaurs were losing their mothers,' he said, adding that his experience wasn't 'special.'\n'We’re lucky if it’s that way around, rather than the other. And of course, countless parents lose their children in one way or another too, I can’t even imagine what that must feel like,' he continued.\n'So in terms of my own personal experience, yeah, it felt like a very simple act of healing for myself, and hopefully healing for an audience.'\nCelebrity Big BrotherGoldie Hawn\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHollywood actress 'turns down seven-figure deal to appear on Celebrity Big Brother' amid ongoing struggles with eye health\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Well, Republicans, that’s you now!”\n\nMaher listed examples of Republicans going to great lengths to honor President Donald Trump from pushing to rename Washington D.C.’s Dulles International Airport after him to a bill adding his face to Mount Rushmore.\n\nHe also called out their embrace of Trump’s iconic dance and the group of supporters who dressed like Trump outside the courthouse during his hush money payment trial. \n\nHe singled out Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick as an example of Republicans talking like Trump “with the crazy, over-the-top exaggerations.”\n\n“And these bills they’ve introduced to make Trump’s birthday a holiday and put him on currency and Mount Rushmore- this is not what we do here, guys!” Maher exclaimed. \n\n“He’s still in office for God’s sake. Can we see how it turns out before we put him on a stamp?”\n\n“If I admit that there is a level of Trump Derangement Syndrome on the left, will you admit that this s— is also deranged?” Maher asked. \n\n“All the people on the right who say they certainly don’t agree with me on everything, but they respect the way I keep it real about the left and like me because I’m honest. Well, that’s a two-way street. Are you being honest?”\n\nThe HBO host suggested the people around Trump are too cowardly to correct him when he’s wrong, pointing to when Trump claimed during his address to Congress that DOGE found $8 million in federal funding that was allocated for “transgender mice,” insisting it was actually “transgenic mice” used for hormone treatment research. \n\n“So I know, my Republican friends, when you hear ‘cult,’ you roll your eyes. But let me add one thing to it that you might not have heard,” Maher later said. \n\n“You know a cult is really a cult when the leader asks you to turn on friends and family because they’re the only ones who are a threat to deprogram you. It’s why Tom Cruise doesn’t talk to his own kid. Which brings me to America. I’m suddenly saying to our closest friend in the world, ‘You know what? F— Canada for no particular reason.’”\n\nMaher went on to sound the alarm on Trump backers like Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and “War Room” host Steve Bannon over comments legitimizing the idea of a third Trump term, insisting it won’t stop with them.\n\n“And you know, you just know that soon the entire Republican Party will be on this page,” Maher said.\n\n“Okay, there’s no fuzz on this. It’s as clear as one, two, three. Presidents get two terms, not more, no matter how wonderful you think they are. It’s written in black and white in the Constitution. Guys, you know this is wrong. You know in your heart this is the moment when Rome stops being a republic. So come on.

nine months ago.\n\n“The United States’ announcement, combined with recent reductions in official development assistance by some countries to fund increased defence spending, has made our situation

in $1.3 billion, representing 16.3 percent of the WHO’s then $7.89 billion budget.\n\nMost of the US funding was through voluntary contributions for specific earmarked projects, rather than fixed membership fees.\n\n“Despite our best efforts, we are now at the point where we have no choice but to reduce the scale of our work and workforce,” said Tedros.\n\n“This reduction will begin at

Stay—Poll","text":"A plurality of Republicans believe Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth should resign after he shared sensitive military attack plans in a Signal group chat with other top Trump administration officials and journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, according to a new poll.Newsweek reached out to the Defense Department via email for comment on Saturday.Why It MattersCriticism erupted in the aftermath of reporting of the communications in a Signal group chat—which included Vice President JD Vance, Hegseth, national security adviser Mike Waltz and other top administration officials—regarding imminent military strikes in Yemen, including attack plans. Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to the chat and saw the whole discussion play out, later reporting on the incident via the magazine.The journalist reported that the text exchange included U.S. military plans involving airstrikes against the Houthis, Iran-backed rebels in Yemen who've been launching attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea amid a clash over control of shipping routes.The handling of private military discussions among top officials in President Donald Trump's Cabinet has triggered significant U.S. security concerns, including from some Republican lawmakers.What To KnowNew polling released by J.L. Partners in conjunction with The Daily Mail on Friday showed that a plurality of Republicans believe Hegseth should resign in the wake of the scandal. Thirty-eight percent of GOP respondents said he should resign while just 33 percent said he should stay.Among independents, a majority said the Trump administration official should step aside, with 54 percent backing his resignation and just 20 percent saying he should remain. The independent results largely aligned with the overall results—with Republicans and Democrats included—which showed 54 percent backing Hegseth's resignation and 22 percent saying he should stay as the Pentagon chief.The poll was carried out from March 25 to 27 among 1,001 registered voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.Hegseth, according to Goldberg's reporting, was the individual in the chat who shared the attack plans, including information about targets, timing and weapons. However, Waltz is reportedly the Trump administration official who accidentally added the journalist to the group chat.National security experts have said sharing such sensitive information may violate the law and have also raised concerns about the use of Signal for these types of communications. They have warned that U.S. adversaries can easily hack and potentially monitor an individual's personal phone, which is why the government has specific rules about how to handle classified information.The National Security Council (NSC) has confirmed the authenticity of the message chain, stating it \"appears to be authentic\" and that they are \"reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\"Hegseth and the administration have said the information shared was not classified, but analysts have pushed back against those statements.\"What Hegseth shared two hours ahead of the strikes were time sensitive 'attack orders' or 'operational plans' with actual timing of the strikes and mention of F18s, MQ9 Reapers and Tomahawks. This information is typically sent through classified channels to the commanders in the field as 'secret, no forn' message. In other words the information is 'classified' and should not be shared through insecure channels,\" Fox News' chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday.What People Are SayingDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X on Wednesday: \"I see war plans every single day. No one is texting war plans.\"Hegseth also told reporters: \"You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again...This is a guy who peddles in garbage...Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say.\"Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic during a recent MSNBC interview: \"The Secretary of Defense seems like a person who is unserious and is trying to deflect from the fact that he participated in a conversation on an unclassified messaging app that he probably shouldn't have participated in.\"President Donald Trump in comments to reporters about the incident on Wednesday: \"I think it's all a witch hunt. That's all. I think it's a witch hunt. I wasn't involved with it.\"Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told Fox News on Thursday: \"The Democrats are just trying to change the subject and trash Hegseth because Trump is on a roll.\"Representative Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told reporters on Wednesday: \"The White House is in denial that this was not classified or sensitive data. They should just own up to it and preserve credibility.\"J.L. Partners co-founder James Johnson told The Daily Mail: \"The Signal drama seems to have cut past the usual battle lines, and the public think it a sackable offense regardless of their politics.\"What Happens Next?It's unclear if any official involved in the chat will face consequences or resign, but thus far nobody has stepped aside.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated no changes are expected to the president's national security team, noting that \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team.\"Meanwhile, some analysts have said that lower-level government employees would likely face prosecution if they shared sensitive information in a similar way, but that appears highly unlikely to happen to Hegseth or anyone else involved in the chat given current political realities.","summary":"Fifty-four percent of all voters surveyed said that Trump's defense secretary should step down.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/more-republicans-want-pete-hegseth-resign-stay-poll-2052704","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2617517/pete-hegseth.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 00:33:06","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":305626136,"title":"Trump says he won't 'fire people' over Signal messages, reiterates support of national security team","text":"President Donald Trump on Saturday made his clearest commitment to not fire anyone over an embarrassing accidental leak of his administration's plans for an airstrike against the Houthis in Yemen.

He also said that he had confidence in Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, and Pete Hegseth, his Pentagon chief.

Afterwards, The Atlantic published an article on the internal exchange, shocking the national security establishment.

win against lefty insanity","text":"Maybe the third time will be the charm.\n\nColumbia University obviously subscribes to the belief that Friday night is the best time to put out bad news. \n\nHow else to explain the fact that, at 8 p.m. Friday, it announced that its interim president had quit?\n\nIf members of the Board of Trustees hoped nobody would notice, they’re more delusional than advertised.\n\nThe resignation of Dr. Katrina Armstrong is yet another bombshell development in the Trump administration’s crackdown on universities violating the civil rights of Jewish students, with Columbia a serial offender and top test case.\n\nThe announcement gave no reason why Armstrong is returning to the medical school or why she is being replaced by Claire Shipman, co-chair of the trustees.\n\nShipman, a former television journalist, will be Columbia’s third president in a year. \n\nThe first, Nemat Shafik, was overwhelmed by campus chaos after the Hamas terrorist invasion of Israel and the Jewish state’s response, and fled to London.\n\nThen again, no explanation for the latest change was needed. \n\nNumerous reports show Columbia mired in internal turmoil over the White House plan to strip it of at least $400 million in federal grants and contracts unless it makes changes that will subject disruptive students to arrest and provide responsible oversight to two departments that are hotbeds of antisemitism.\n\nArmstrong’s sin was that she tried to play for two teams at the same time. \n\nShe initially promised the White House that Columbia would forbid demonstrators from wearing masks, then said the opposite to faculty members.\n\nShe later reassured the White House she would keep her initial promise, but her credibility was ruined.\n\nSo now she’s gone, and Shipman is left to clean up the mess. \n\nIf she fails to implement the reasonable demands, she will plunge Columbia into a legal war it can’t win and could cost it billions of dollars in lost federal aid over several years.\n\nThat would demolish its standing for a generation and set the stage for other schools to suffer similar penalties.\n\nThe Friday night drama at -Columbia ended yet another consequential week in Donald Trump’s dynamic second term.\n\nIt marks the ninth week since he took the oath, but if your scorecard is based on mainstream media news coverage, you probably believe it was an utter disaster.\n\nDon’t be fooled. \n\nThere was important progress on key areas of Trump’s agenda, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying the US has revoked more than 300 student visas, mostly for supporting Hamas.\n\nAnti-Trump resistance\n\nThe media, of course, celebrates each time a federal judge blocks Trump from acting, especially when it involves his deportation of illegal criminal aliens.\n\nThe right way to see most of those decisions is that berobed activists are abusing their authority to join the resistance and tie Trump’s hands. \n\nMost of the cases will end up in the appeals courts or the Supreme Court, which are generally less political.\n\nFor most media, the top story was the continued bleeding from the White House’s self-inflicted wound of Signal-gate. \n\nThe administration’s inability to put the story to rest is giving leftist outlets a rare jolt of joy.\n\nThey’re pumped with the adrenaline of being on death watch, with their hope being that one or more of the participants in the botched communication over the attack on the Houthis will be shown the door.\n\nTheir top target is Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who sent the detailed texts that, if not technically “war plans,” are close enough to set off alarms.\n\nThe runner-up target is Mike Waltz, the national security adviser whose office somehow included Jeffrey Goldberg, the virulent anti-Trumper from The Atlantic magazine, in the list of chat participants.\n\n“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he’s a good man,” Trump said earlier last week.\n\nVice President JD Vance, sensing the media fervor for a scalp, took Waltz to Greenland with him Friday and told reporters they would be disappointed.\n\n“If you think you’re going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody you’ve got another think coming!” Vance said. \n\n“We are standing behind our entire national security team.”\n\nHe and Trump understand that giving the media beasts one scalp will only whet their appetite for more.\n\nFirst major fumble\n\nAlthough legitimate questions about the leak remain, including whether participants were using private or government devices, the real reason Dems and the media are so hot for the story is that the incident marks the administration’s first major fumble.\n\nThat it came in late March illustrates how relatively successful Trump’s start has been.\n\nWith so little to seize on, Dems and their media shills are desperate for a soapbox and this one will do until a better one comes along.\n\nMeanwhile, a fair assessment of other events last week turns an honest scorecard far more positive than negative.\n\nOne big development was the long interview on Fox News with Elon Musk and seven top people from his DOGE team. \n\nBret Baier wanted them to address charges that they don’t know what they are doing and are chopping costs without regard to the impact on ordinary Americans.\n\nMusk set the stage by noting the most important numbers: The federal government is spending $7 trillion this year, and nearly $2 trillion of that is borrowed money.\n\nThat’s outrageous and a formula for serious trouble, which is why he aims to cut the borrowing in half, to $1 trillion. \n\nThat would reduce overall spending by about 15%, which Musk called “quite reasonable” and said it could be done “without affecting critical programs.”\n\nProving waste & fraud\n\nOne by one, his team cited examples of enormous waste and fraud, a common one being that federal operations are hobbled by computer systems that are often outdated and incompatible. \n\nOne agency alone has 27 chief information officers.\n\nThe retirement system is maddeningly slow because documents have been stored for nearly 70 years in an old limestone mine in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe informative interview lifted the veil on DOGE, and put names and faces on the historic effort.\n\nAnother important story that big media ran from was the congressional testimony of the heads of PBS and NPR. \n\nTrump has targeted their public funding as part of the overall retrenchment and also because they largely echo the leftist views of the legacy media.\n\nDems, of course, defended the arrangement, but Republicans did an excellent job of exposing the bias.\n\nNPR boss Katherine Maher especially came across as deceitful in denying any partisan slant despite a slew of her own posts in 2018 where she called Trump a “fascist” and “a deranged sociopath.”\n\nAnd she claimed not to know that 87 staffers in Washington were registered Dems, while there are zero registered Republicans.\n\nThe upshot was that the hearing made a solid case that funding of more than $500 million should be cut.\n\nCount that as low-hanging fruit for the DOGE team!","summary":"Columbia University announced on Friday that interim president Dr. Katrina Armstrong has stepped down effective

GOP and GiveSendGo user data in custody: DOJ","text":"An alleged co-founder of the online hacker movement Anonymous has been taken into custody after a 2021 data breach targeting the Texas Republican Party. Aubrey Cottle, a 37-year-old Canadian national, is known professionally as \"Kirtaner.\" The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged Cottle with hacking into the Texas Republican Party's web server and stealing sensitive data in 2021. Cottle was arrested in Canada Wednesday, and authorities there are pursuing additional charges under Canadian law, the DOJ said. CANADA FREEDOM CONVOY: GIVESENDGO DEMANDS FBI PROBE HACKERS, ALLEGES 'HIGHLY COORDINATED' POLITICAL DOXING In Texas, Cottle faces charges of \"unlawfully transferring, possessing or using a means of identification with the intent to commit, or aid or abet, or in connection with, unlawful activity under state or federal law,\" according to a press release. Cottle uses his LinkedIn profile to describe himself as a \"Filthy blackhat but good boi.\" The same page shows Cottle as one of the founders of Anonymous, a decentralized hacker group aiming to breach governmental institutions in protest. \"Yes, that one,\" Cottle wrote. \"Hal Turner, Scientology, Guy Fawkes masks, you got it. Really. Google it.\" According to a news release from acting U.S. Attorney Margaret Leachman for the Western District of Texas, Cottle gained unauthorized access to a third-party hosting company called \"Epik\" before defacing the Texas GOP’s website. \"Texas: Taking voices from women to promote theocratic erosion of church/state barriers,\" the Anonymous rewrite of the site's landing page said. The banner of the website was replaced with cartoon characters, a pornographic image and a music video. HACKER GROUP ANONYMOUS DECLARES 'TOTAL WAR' ON DONALD TRUMP The same release alleges Cottle stole a backup of the website's server containing personal identifying information. The stolen data was then posted online for public download. Prosecutors added Cottle even bragged about the breach on social media. Cottle's TikTok page's bio says \"that Anonymous founder hacker guy you probably saw in the news or Vice or sumthn.\" According to the DOJ, data from the Texas Republican Party leak was discovered in a search on Cottle's personal electronic devices. The Anonymous group's breach of the website was allegedly pro-choice retaliation. In September 2021, the Lone Star State passed the Texas Heartbeat Act. Under the act, abortion is illegal past the point a fetal heartbeat can be detected, around five or six weeks of gestational age. Cottle has also been linked to a \"political doxing\" data breach of Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo in February 2022, after the platform hosted a fundraiser for the Canada Freedom Convoy. Names of donors, intended to remain private and secure on the platform, were publicized across the internet. GiveSendGo founder Jacob Wells spoke with Fox News Digital at the time of the breach. \"This is illegal, and these people should be going to jail. The FBI — I mean, it's surprising that we haven't heard from any investigative services. We will be reaching out ourselves to just see that there's some investigation into this. This is completely unacceptable,\" Wells said. GiveSendGo has a crowdfunding campaign for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI Austin Cyber Task Force is investigating Cottle's case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney G. Karthik Srinivasan is prosecuting the case. If convicted, Cottle faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"A Canadian national, &quot;Kirtaner,&quot; was in custody after being linked to a 2021 breach of the Texas GOP website, allowing stolen data to be posted online for download.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/alleged-canadian-hacker-2021-theft-texas-gop-givesendgo-user-data-custody-doj","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/08/931/523/GOP_crop.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 00:25:49","author":"Jasmine Baehr","authors":["Jasmine Baehr"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":305626172,"title":"Daniel Craig, 57, cuts a stylish figure in an oversized suit as he arrives at Queer premiere in Milan","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Mar 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHead of Prince Harry's Sentebale charity accuses him of 'harassment and bullying at scale' after calling the Sussex brand 'toxic' - and claims they asked her to defend Meghan Markle against negative publicity\n\nShane Warne death 'cover up': The shocking item that was quietly removed from hotel room where Aussie cricket legend spent final hours in marathon orgy with three Thai prostitutes\n\nLabour MP charged the taxpayer £900 so she could pay 'pet rent' for her cockapoo dog to stay at her second home\n\n'She's cashing in!'

like the \"tone\" of US Vice-President JD Vance's comments during his visit to Greenland.\n\nMr Vance said Copenhagen had not done enough for the strategically placed, resource-rich Danish territory that is coveted by US President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We are open to criticisms, but let me be completely honest, we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered,\" Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in posts on social media.\n\n\"This is not how you speak to your close allies, and I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"\n\nMr Vance made his comments during a trip to the Pituffik Space Base in north-western Greenland, viewed by both Copenhagen and Nuuk as a provocation.\n\n\"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" Mr Vance told a press conference.\n\n\"You have under-invested in the people of Greenland and you have under-invested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass.\"\n\nMr Trump argues that the United States needs the vast Arctic island for national and international security and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.\n\nAsked about the potential use of force, Mr Vance stressed the US administration did not think that was \"ever going to be necessary\".\n\n\"We think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump-style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America,\" Mr Vance said.\n\nDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also hit back at Mr Vance in a statement, saying his remarks about Denmark were \"not accurate\". \n\nShe also said she would be visiting the island next week.\n\nMr Vance was accompanied by his wife Usha, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Utah senator Mike Lee and former Homeland Security advisor Julia Nesheiwat, who is Waltz's wife.\n\n'Unacceptable pressure'\n\nDanish and Greenlandic officials, backed by the European Union, have insisted that the United States will not obtain Greenland.\n\nMs Frederiksen has condemned the US visit as \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland and Denmark.\n\nMr Rasmussen said Denmark had stepped up investment in Arctic security, with Copenhagen announcing in January a $US2 billion ($3.2 billion) plan to boost its military presence in the region.\n\nA majority of Greenlanders oppose US annexation, according to a January poll.\n\nSaturday saw hundreds of people rally outside the US embassy in Copenhagen, some waving banners with slogans including \"Trump/Putin stealing countries\" and \"Yankees go home\" or \"Make ice cubes not war\".\n\n\"It's very important that we are as numerous as possible today,\" said demonstrator Kista Lynge Hoegh, a Greenland native.\n\n\"We are worried for our families who live in Greenland and we are concerned about what will happen to them if annexation occurs, as Trump has threatened.\"\n\nThe Pituffik base is an essential part of Washington's missile defence infrastructure, located in the Arctic on the shortest route for missiles fired from Russia at the United States.\n\nKnown as Thule Air Base until 2023, it served as a warning post for possible attacks from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nIt is also a strategic location for air and submarine surveillance.\n\nGreenland is home to 57,000 people, most of them Inuits.\n\nIt is believed to hold massive untapped mineral and oil reserves, although oil and uranium exploration are banned.\n\nWhile all of Greenland's political parties are in favour of independence, none of them supports the idea of becoming part of the United States.\n\nA new four-party coalition government was announced in Greenland just hours before the US delegation's arrival, following elections this month.\n\n\"It is very important that we put aside our disagreements and differences because only in this way will we be able to cope with the heavy pressure we are exposed to from outside,\" said incoming prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.\n\nA statement from the office of Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said that during her April 2 to 4 visit she would greet the incoming government, with whom she promised to \"pursue close and trustful cooperation\".","summary":"Leaders in Denmark hit back at US Vice-President JD Vance after his trip to the Pituffik Space

After the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) said it referred Maine’s \"noncompliance\" with Title IX rules to the Justice Department Friday, Maine Republican state Rep. Laurel Libby placed blame on Gov. Janet Mills and the state's Democratic lawmakers. \"Governor Mills and the Democrat majority refusal to comply with federal Title IX protections has now resulted in Maine being officially referred to the Department of Justice. This is a direct consequence of their radical policies that put ideology ahead of fairness and safety for Maine girls and the education of our students,\" Libby told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Mainers believe in common sense, fairness and protecting the rights of women and girls in sports and spaces. While this extreme stance does not reflect the values of our state, it is ultimately Maine’s schools, students and taxpayers who will suffer the consequences of their reckless decisions and ongoing feud with biological reality.\" Libby brought national attention to her state's issue of trans inclusion in girls sports with a social media post revealing a transgender track and field athlete at Greely High School had taken first place at a Maine girls pole vault competition after competing as a boy just one year earlier. TRUMP ADMIN RESPONDS TO MAINE'S RELUCTANCE TO BAN TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS SPORTS Libby's revelation of the trans athlete ignited national conversation and coverage of the state's policy on trans inclusion after Maine announced it would not comply with President Donald Trump's recent \"No Men in Women's Sports\" executive order. Trump then vowed to cut funding to the state for refusing to follow his order during a gathering of governors at the White House Feb. 20. The next day, Mills' office responded with a statement threatening legal action against the Trump administration if it did withhold federal funding from the state. Then, Trump and Mills verbally sparred in a widely publicized argument at the White House during a bipartisan meeting of governors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Just hours after that dispute, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would be investigating the state for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls sports and potential Title IX violations. Police protection was later assigned to the high school attended by the trans athlete Libby identified in her Facebook post. Libby was then censured for her Facebook post by Maine's Democratic majority because she posted a photo of a minor. She has since filed a lawsuit seeking to have her censure overturned.

The biggest portion of Musk’s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which continues to run while also working alongside Trump.\n\nAfter earlier demonstrations that were somewhat sporadic, Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker’s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company’s sales.\n\nBy early afternoon crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker’s home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media showed protesters brandishing signs such as “ Honk if you hate Elon ” and “ Fight the billionaire broligarchy.”\n\nAs the day progressed, the protests cascaded around the country outside Tesla locations in major cities such as Washington, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Seattle, as well as towns in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado. Smaller groups of counterprotesters also showed up at some sites.\n\n“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!” several dozen people chanted outside a showroom in Dublin, California, about 35 miles (60 miles) east of San Francisco, while a smaller cluster of Trump supporters waved American flags across the street.\n\nA much larger crowd circled another showroom in nearby Berkeley, chanting slogans to the beat of drums.\n\n“We’re living in a fascist state,” said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from neighboring Oakland, “and we need to stop this or we’ll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.”\n\nAnti-Musk sentiment extends beyond the U.S.\n\nThe Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protesters at more than 230 locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe were not as large, the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.\n\nAbout two dozen people held signs lambasting the billionaire outside a dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.\n\nOne sign displayed depicted Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute — a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk’s straight-arm gesture that said, “You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don’t buy a Swasticar.”\n\n“We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we’re facing,” said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.\n\nTesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker’s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.\n\n“I’m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,” Crockett said during an organizing call this month.\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, showed up at a protest in Seattle, which she represents in Congress.\n\nMusk backlash has included some vandalism\n\nSome people have gone beyond protest, setting Tesla vehicles on fire or committing other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. In a March 20 company meeting, Musk indicated that he was dumbfounded by the attacks and said the vandals should “stop acting psycho.”\n\nCrockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday’s protests remaining peaceful.\n\nBut police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Teslas in northwestern Germany in the early morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the protests.\n\nIn Watertown, Massachusetts, local police reported that the side mirror of a black pickup struck two people at a protest outside a Tesla service center, according to the Boston Herald. The suspect was promptly identified by police at the scene, who said there were no serious injuries.\n\nMusk maintains that the company’s future remains bright\n\nA growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade them in, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from him.\n\nBut Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in new sales in the March meeting, during which he reassured the workers that the company’s Model Y would remain “the best-selling car on Earth again this year.” He also predicted that Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million currently.\n\n“There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,” Musk said.\n\nAfter Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk’s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars.\n\nThat optimism helped lift Tesla’s stock by 70% between the election and Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.\n\n“This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a recent research note.\n\nAssociated Press writers Terry Chea in Berkeley, California, Mustakim Hasnath in London and Stefanie Dazio in Germany contributed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of the U.S.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Demonstrators Rally Against Elon Musk&#8217;s US Government Cuts, Target Tesla Showrooms first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/demonstrators-rally-against-elon-musks-us-government-cuts-target-tesla-showrooms/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/HAKUN4YGWBAARBMYL6EZ2ZPLLI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-30 00:00:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.085},{"id":305623020,"title":"Trump claims tariff-induced price hikes by automakers are irrelevant, expects boost in American car purchases","text":"President Donald Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday that he would not fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat where military attack plans were inadvertently divulged to a journalist, and later added he “couldn’t care less” if automakers raised prices due to new tariffs.\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Trump also discussed his commitment to annexing Greenland and reiterated that a military option was not off the table.\n\nFollowing a week of headlines about Signal, tariffs and Greenland, the president waved off concerns that his agenda is causing volatility on Wall Street or decreasing consumer confidence, pointing to polling that shows that the share of Americans who believe the country is on the right track is at record highs.\n\n“What I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,” the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.\n\nMore from Trump’s interview with NBC News:\n\nNo concern if automakers raise their prices\n\nThe president said he “couldn’t care less” if foreign automakers raised prices after he announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles.\n\nAsked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, “The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you’re going to make a lot of money. If you don’t, you’re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.”\n\nWhen pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal, Trump added, “No, I never said that. I couldn’t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.”\n\nTrump continued, “I couldn’t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.”\n\n Asked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, “No, I couldn’t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they’re going to buy American cars.”\n\nNBC News reported earlier this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the White House.\n\nUntil that time, USMCA-compliant auto parts will remain tariff-free.\n\nThe president also said the tariffs would be permanent.\n\n“Absolutely, they’re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we’re doing is being fair, and frankly, I’m being very generous,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 “Liberation Day,” when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nIn remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were “unjustified” and that “the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.”\n\nTrump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point “only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there’s no room for negotiation.”\n\nSignal incident\n\nTrump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.\n\n“I don’t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump said, calling the story “fake news” throughout the interview.\n\n“I do,” the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.\n\n“I think it’s just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it’s just a witch hunt, and it shouldn’t be talked [about],” Trump added. “We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It’s fake news.”\n\nTrump’s comments come as he has faced calls — including from his allies — to fire Waltz after The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.\n\nIn the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified.\n\n“I have no idea what Signal is. I don’t care what Signal is,” Trump said on Saturday. “All I can tell you is it’s just a witch hunt, and it’s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it’s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.”\n\nEverything is on the table to obtain Greenland\n\nThe president on Saturday also said he has “absolutely” had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” Trump said.\n\nHe added that there’s a “good possibility that we could do it without military force” but that “I don’t take anything off the table.”\n\nThis comes one day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland with his wife, Usha, and spoke to service members at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland.\n\nWhile there, Vance said, “Our message to Denmark is very simple — you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.”\n\nAsked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, “I don’t really think about that. I don’t really care. Greenland’s a very separate subject, very different. It’s international peace. It’s international security and strength.”\n\n“You have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places.

His orders have, in turn, made it harder for the firms to continue conducting business as usual. Several have alleged in lawsuits that the executive orders intended to chill free speech and deter clients from doing business with the firms.He has called out a string of law firms that he believes have wronged him in some capacity, have worked with his political opponents, or have had diversity initiatives that are counter to his anti-DEI efforts.What's more, Trump instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify firms with \"frivolous\" cases against the administration so that they could be targeted for further executive action.Whether they're on the ropes or down for the count, here's the top firms Trump is taking on, as well as a look at where the legal process stands.Earlier in March, Trump issued an executive order directed at the prominent New York City-based law firm Paul Weiss, where he railed against the attorney Mark Pomerantz and decried what he said was \"unlawful discrimination\" from diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the firm.Pomerantz previously left Paul Weiss to aid the Manhattan District Attorney's office as it probed Trump's finances. When Pomerantz resigned as special district attorney in February 2022, he wrote in a departing letter that he believed Trump was \"guilty of numerous felony violations.\"In the order, Trump sought to revoke security clearances and bar access to government buildings for attorneys of the firm. Such a sweeping directive could also include federal courthouses, a scenario that would be detrimental to the firm's work.However, Trump just days later rescinded the executive order and announced an agreement with Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp. Trump said the firm would provide $40 million in pro bono work for causes that the administration supports and end its DEI policies.Karp received a heap of criticism, with many questioning why Paul Weiss didn't challenge Trump's order. In an email to the firm's attorneys, he said there was a desire from the outset to challenge the directive. In the same email, though, Karp argued that even if Paul Weiss won in court, it would become \"persona non grata\" with the Trump White House, which could prompt a wave of clients to switch to other firms and subsequently threaten the viability of the firm.\"It was very likely that our firm would not be able to survive a protracted dispute with the administration,\" Karp wrote in the email.In early March, Trump targeted the law firm Perkins Coie, issuing an executive order to suspend the security clearances of the firm's attorneys and criticizing its diversity and inclusion policies.In the order, Trump called out what he said was the firm's \"dishonest and dangerous activity.\"The president, in his order, noted the firm's representation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — his rival in the 2016 presidential election — during that year's tumultuous campaign.However, Perkins Coie struck back, filing a lawsuit against the administration for actions that it said \"violates core constitutional rights, including the rights to free speech and due process.\"\"At the heart of the order is an unlawful attack on the freedom of all Americans to select counsel of their choice without fear of retribution or punishment from the government,\" Perkins Coie managing director Bill Malley said in a statement in March. \"We were compelled to take this action to protect our firm and our clients.\"The day after Perkins Coie filed its suit, a federal judge agreed to temporarily block part of the president's executive order.Perkins Coie, in a statement, said the ruling was \"an important first step in ensuring this unconstitutional Executive Order is never enforced.\"Trump in late February signed a memorandum to evaluate federal contracts and direct the suspension of security clearances for some employees at Covington & Burling, a DC-based law firm known for its antitrust work.The president in the memo said he was suspending the clearances of individuals who advised former special counsel Jack Smith.Smith brought two federal cases against Trump — one for election interference in the 2020 presidential election and the other for retaining classified documents — but both were dropped after the president won reelection to a second term in November 2024.In the memo, Trump went after individuals whom he said were \"involved in the weaponization of government\" and named Peter Koski, a lawyer at Covington representing Smith.A Covington spokesperson earlier in March said it was representing Smith in an \"individual\" capacity.\"We recently agreed to represent Jack Smith when it became apparent that he would become a subject of a government investigation,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"We look forward to defending Mr. Smith's interests and appreciate the trust he has placed in us to do so.\"Skadden made a deal with Trump, acting before it was singled out in any executive orders. The firm promised to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services \"to causes that the President and Skadden both support,\" Trump announced on Friday.Skadden also affirmed its commitment to merit-based hiring and employee retention, Trump said. The firm also agreed that it would refrain from engaging in \"illegal DEI discrimination,\" according to a copy of the agreement that Trump shared on Truth Social.In a statement, Jeremy London, Skadden's executive partner, said the firm \"engaged proactively\" with the administration to reach the agreement.\"We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm,\" London said.Speaking from the White House, Trump referred to the deal as \"essentially a settlement.\"Within the firm, some associates and employees expressed frustration about the deal, calling it the beginning of the end for Skadden.In the weeks leading up to the agreement, Skadden associate Rachel Cohen publicly resigned and circulated an open letter among associates at top firms calling out their employers for what she has described as inaction in the face of the administration's attacks.After the deal was announced, another employee, Brenna Frey, also resigned publicly in an announcement on LinkedIn.The chair of Elias Law Group took a different approach after it was targeted by the administration.Trump named the Elias Law Group in his \"frivolous\" lawsuits memo, formally titled \"Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court.\"It claimed that the law firm was \"deeply involved in the creation of a false 'dossier' by a foreign national designed to provide a fraudulent basis for Federal law enforcement to investigate a Presidential candidate in order to alter the outcome of the Presidential election.\"The memo went on to say that the firm \"intentionally sought to conceal the role of his client — failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — in the dossier.\"Marc Elias, the Democratic election lawyer who founded and chairs the group, released a statement swinging back at Trump, whose actions target \"every attorney and law firm who dares to challenge his assault on the rule of law,\" he said.\"President Trump's goal is clear,\" Elias said in the statement. \"He wants lawyers and law firms to capitulate and cower until there is no one left to oppose his Administration in court.\"Adding that American democracy is in a state of \"peril,\" Elias said his law firm would not cower.\"Elias Law Group will not be deterred from fighting for democracy in court,\" he said. \"There will be no negotiation with this White House about the clients we represent or the lawsuits we bring on their behalf.\"Trump signed an order naming Jenner & Block on Tuesday that revoked security clearances from the firm's attorneys and ordered a review of the firm's contracts with the federal government.Trump's order singled out Andrew Weissmann, a former Jenner attorney who Trump accused of building his career around \"weaponized government and abuse of power.\" Weissmann was a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller's Special Counsel's Office, which investigated Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and its ties to Russia.Jenner issued a statement calling the order an \"unconstitutional executive order that has already been declared unlawful by a federal court.\"\"We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies,\" the statement from Jenner said.Jenner also fought back with a lawsuit filed on Friday. The firm is represented by Cooley LLP, a liberal-leaning firm that has hired lawyers from Democratic administrations.On Friday, Judge John D. Bates of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order that keeps the Trump administration from taking action against Jenner.Following the ruling, Jenner said in a statement that the order holds \"no legal weight.\"\"We will continue to do what we have always done, our job as lawyers and fearless advocates for our clients,\" the firm said.The Trump administration has also targeted WilmerHale, which employed Mueller and other lawyers who worked with the Justice Department to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order that suspended security clearances for WilmerHale employees and limited their access to federal buildings. The order also revoked WilmerHale's government contracts for engaging in \"partisan representations to achieve political ends\" and \"efforts to discriminate on the basis of race.\"In contrast with other firms that have inked deals with the president, WilmerHale filed a lawsuit.The firm hired Paul Clement, the conservative legal superstar of the firm Clement & Murphy, to fight back against the Trump administration.\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Clement told Business Insider in a statement.On Friday afternoon, Judge Richard J. Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia approved a motion for a temporary restraining order to halt executive actions against WilmerHale.\"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,\" Leon wrote.A spokesperson for WilmerHale called the executive order unconstitutional and praised the court's \"swift action.\"","summary":"President Trump has taken aim at law firms that he believes have wronged him.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAMEER SURI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:17 GMT, 29 March 2025 |Updated:23:56 GMT, 29 March 2025 \n\nCharlie's Angels star Crispin Glover announced on Friday that his father, actor Bruce Glover, has died at the age of 92.\nCrispin broke the news on his Instagram page, lovingly sharing a string of throwback photos of his father, whom he lost on March 12.\nBruce was known for playing assassin Mr. Wint, one of the villains of the 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever starring Sean Connery as 007.\nThree years later, Bruce featured as an assistant to the Jack Nicholson character in the seminal Roman Polanski movie Chinatown.\nHe also acted on a variety of classic television shows ranging from Gunsmoke and Perry Mason to Murder, She Wrote and The A-Team.\nA representative for Crispin confirmed the news of Bruce's passing this Friday but did not disclose a specific cause of death, according to TMZ.\n\nCharlie's Angels star Crispin Glover announced on Friday that his father, actor Bruce Glover, has died at the age of 92; Bruce and Crispin pictured in 2019\nBruce was born in Chicago in 1932 and grew up there as 'a tough working class kid,' he told the website The Original Van Gogh's Ear Anthology.\nHe worked from the age of six as a grocery delivery boy, growing into a school football star but also honing his artistic instincts by selling paintings as a child.\n\n Michael J. Fox poses for an adorable photo cuddled up with his new pup Blue - who fans think resembles the dog from Back to the Future \nAfter serving in the Korean War, he landed his first job onstage, dressing as a gorilla and tossing a stripper around as part of a nightclub act in Florida - which prompted a local magician to advise him that 'you are an actor' because of how 'believable' he was as the ape.\nHe set off for New York and embarked on a Broadway career in the early 1960s, including in Tennessee Williams' play The Night Of The Iguana with Bette Davis and Bertolt Brecht's drama Mother Courage And Her Children with Anne Bancroft.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, he also worked extensively in television, featuring on some of the top shows of the era including Mission: Impossible and Gunsmoke.\nBruce's small screen credits during that period included The Dukes Of Hazzard, Perry Mason, The Mod Squad, Barney Miller and CHiPs.\nHis best-remembered role arrived in 1971 when he and jazz bassist Putter Smith played assassins Mr. Whit and Mr. Kidd - heavily implied to be lovers - who are after the blood of Sean Connery's James Bond in Diamonds Are Forever.\nBruce later said Guy Hamilton, the director of Diamonds Are Forever, 'was wide open to every idea I had and a lot of the success of the humor of that film was me.'\n\nBruce was known for playing assassin Mr. Wint, one of the villains of the 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever starring Sean Connery as 007\n\nBruce's greatest fame arrived in 1971 when he and jazz bassist Putter Smith (left) featured as assassins Mr. Whit and Mr. Kidd - heavily implied to be lovers\n\nBruce's other movies included the 1972 blaxploitation thriller Black Gunn starring James Brown; the two men are pictured in the movie together\nHe maintained: 'Those were all my ideas. The final moment in the film where Sean Connery does that rude thing pushing the hooha up my yaha and giving that character his final great sexual moment is the biggest laugh in the movie.'\nIn 1974 he played Duffy, a taciturn assistant of Jack Nicholson's detective character Jake Gittes in the seminal film Chinatown also starring Faye Dunaway.\nBruce's other movies included the 1972 blaxploitation thriller Black Gunn led by James Brown and the 1975 Charles Bronson vehicle Hard Times. \nHis television career continued through the 1980s with roles on programs like Hart To Hart; The A-Team; Murder, She Wrote and T.J. Hooker.\nBruce welcomed Crispin with his second wife, ballerina Betty Krachey, whom he was happily married to for 56 years from 1960 until her death in 2016.\nHe once explained that his and Betty's method of raising Crispin was 'not to make him conform to your way of doing things but to help them find their way of doing it which is what I believe any teaching has to be.' \nShortly before the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, Bruce and Crispin acted together for the first time in a movie shot at the latter's castle in the Czech Republic.\nIn 2019, Bruce revealed that the movie was in the process of being edited, but at the time of his death the finished product had yet to be released.\nBruce, who taught acting classes for decades, once remarked: 'Acting isn’t important, what is important is being a real entity.' \nJack NicholsonRoman PolanskiSean Connery\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCrispin Glover's dad Bruce dead at 92: Actor played a James Bond villain and featured in Chinatown\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The two met for an unofficial visit over breakfast, a round of golf, and lunch, according to a readout from Stubb’s office, as President Trump spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.The United States previously announced pauses in attacks on energy infrastructure and in the Black Sea between the warring nations, although both countries have been accused of breaking these agreements. While Ukraine indicated it would agree to a ceasefire, Russia has yet to follow suit without conditions.“Our message to the United States is that we will work together with Ukraine to achieve a full ceasefire and a lasting peace,” Stubb shared on X in part after meeting with European leaders earlier in the week.RELATED STORY | Trump touts progress on Ukraine war negotiations, but details remain unclearStubb has called Trump a “seasoned negotiator” and described a ceasefire as the first step toward peace but previously called for potential pressure on Russia.“Ukraine accepted a ceasefire without any forms of conditions. If Russia refuses to agree, we need to increase our efforts to strengthen Ukraine and ratchet up pressure on Russia to convince them to come to the negotiating table,” Stubb said earlier in the month after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.“If we can get it stopped, and I think we’re making progress, but there’s a lot of ill will between the parties,” President Trump said on Friday, referencing the death toll among Ukrainians and Russians from the conflict.President Trump indicated a desire to strengthen the partnership between the U.S. and Finland, including the purchase of more icebreakers.“President Stubb and I look forward to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Finland, and that includes the purchase and development of a large number of badly needed icebreakers for the U.S., delivering peace and international security for our countries and the world,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.This comment comes as President Trump has focused on the U.S. role in Greenland, suggesting that the U.S. needs it for security purposes. Vice President JD Vance visited a military base in the country on Friday.Vance rejected that there were immediate plans to expand the US military presence, but said, “Are there general objectives that we want to accomplish that will certainly require us investing more resources, investing in additional military icebreakers, investing in additional naval ships that will have a greater presence in Greenland? Absolutely.”President Trump was also expected to meet with Ecuador’s president over the weekend, according to a White House source.RELATED STORY | Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER \n Published:23:27 GMT, 29 March 2025 |Updated:23:35 GMT, 29 March 2025 \n\nStrictly Come Dancing's Gorka Marquez has detailed the struggles of juggling his family life with his glittering career, claiming that it's 'not easy.'\nThe Spanish dancing pro, 34, who joined the BBC show back in 2016, often has a hectic schedule due to work commitments.\nOpening up about how he manages to balance everything whilst maintaining a level of happiness, Gorka - who shares daughter Mia and son Thaigo with Gemma Atkinson - says it's about 'making the right choices.'\n'When I was in my 20s, it was just about me, me, me,' he told the Mirror.\nHe continued: 'It's easier because you kind of don't have anything to worry about more than yourself. \n'When you have a partner and children, sometimes work is great. I always say, there's a difference between living for work and work for living.'\n\nStrictly Come Dancing's Gorka Marquez has detailed the struggles of juggling his family life with his glittering career, claiming that it's 'not easy'\n\nThe Spanish dancing pro, 34, shares daughter Mia and son Thaigo with Gemma Atkinson\nGorka has worked with some big names over the years - partnering with the likes of Katie Piper, Maisie Smith and Helen Skelton.\nBut he's made it clear that there's a boundary between working hard and making time for his wife and children.\nGorka admits that his family are priority and that 'the only thing we cannot get back is time,' and he aims to 'make the right choice.'\nHe shared that sometimes he's worried he'll 'miss out on so many things that will never come back,' and it's important to 'work out if its worth it being that far away or for a long period of time.'\nHis revelation comes after Strictly fans were left very unimpressed after Gorka and co-star Karen Hauer cancelled their performance in Cheltenham just hours before getting on stage.\nVenezuelan dancer Karen and fellow Strictly star Gorka are touring the world with their dazzling Speakeasy tour, and earlier this month took to their Instagram sharing the news on a written story.\nGorka admitted to be 'gutted' to disappoint fans with the last-minute announcement, explaining 'technical difficulties' would make it unsafe for them to perform.\n'We are so upset to have the curtain pulled down on tonight's show.\n\nGorka, who joined the BBC show back in 2016, often has a hectic schedule due to work commitments\n\nGorka and fellow dancer Karen Hauer (right) are touring the world with their dazzling Speakeasy tour (pictured earlier this month)\n\n Strictly fans fume as stars cancel show just moments before they were due on stage \n'We have been in the venue all afternoon with technical difficulties which have posed real safety concerns and have tried everything we can to be able to go on stage tonight.'\nThey continued: 'Of course the safety of our company comes first and this decision is beyond our control. We hope to see you very soon. The venue will be in touch with ticket holders.\n'We are so upset to have the curtain pulled down on tonight's show.\n'We have been in the venue all afternoon with technical difficulties which have posed real safety concerns and have tried everything we can to be able to go on stage tonight.'\n'Of course the safety of our company comes first and this decision is beyond our control. We hope to see you very soon. The venue will be in touch with ticket holders.\n'We are as disappointed as you are. K & G,' they finished.\n\nThe cancelled performance comes after Gorka's fiancée Gemma Atkinson insisted she has no regrets about her own wild past ahead of settling down with the Strictly favourite.\nThe actress, 40, first rose to fame as sexy siren Lisa Hunter in Hollyoaks, and in recent years has become an advocate for fitness with her gruelling exercise regime.\nLast month, Gemma confessed that during her 20s she was more preoccupied with her sexual conquests than staying in shape, telling Women's Health Magazine she was no stranger to the 'walk of shame'.\nThe star has also been engaged twice before, but hopes to make it down the aisle with Gorka, after they started dating on Strictly in 2017.\nBBCHelen SkeltonGorka MarquezGemma Atkinson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStrictly's Gorka Marquez reveals he 'tries to make the right choices' as he details struggles of juggling family life with his career\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX as well as an advisor to President Donald Trump, bought the site then called Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, gutted its staff and changed its policies on hate speech, misinformation and user verification and renamed it X.\n\nHe launched xAI a year later.\n\n“xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk wrote on X. “The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge.”\n\nIt’s not clear if the move will change anything for X users — xAI already uses data from X user posts to train its artificial intelligence models and paying X users have access to its AI chatbot, Grok, while nonpaying users can ask the chatbot 10 questions every 2 hours.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Email emily.davies@mailonline.co.uk\nBy NICK PISA IN AMSTERDAM \n Published:23:21 GMT, 29 March 2025 |Updated:23:21 GMT, 29 March 2025 \n\nThis is the dramatic moment a hero British tourist sprinted after a knifeman who stabbed five people in Amsterdam.\nThe mystery man – in his 30s – appeared to have a military or policing background several eyewitnesses have said, and he has been held 'the hero of the Dam'.\nIn dramatic footage exclusively obtained by MailOnline the man is seen running athletically along Gravenstraat in central Amsterdam hot on the heels of the knifeman.\nA group of people stood outside a tattoo parlour look on stunned as the dramatic chase takes place and the Briton is also followed by two locals on an electric bike.\nHis arms pumping, he quickly catches up with the attacker identified as a Roman D by Dutch authorities – a 30-year-old Ukrainian - and then sits on him in a street just off the city's famous Dam Square.\nDressed in jeans, with white trainers and a hoodie, he can be seen using a belt as makeshift handcuffs and in another telling sign, his feet are dug into the body of the knifeman preventing him from moving.\nAt all times he remains calm and assured and has hardly broken into a sweat as he calmly tells astonished onlookers to move along, while he waits for police.\nThe British man was recognised for his bravery by the mayor of Amsterdam, who gave him an award for his 'heroic' actions.\nDespite the commendation, mystery has surrounded his identity. Witnesses told MailOnline that his skills and technique in apprehending the knifeman hint that 'he had done it before' and possibly had training in combat.\n\nThis is the dramatic moment a hero British tourist sprinted after a knifeman who stabbed five people in Amsterdam\n\nA group of people stood outside a tattoo parlour looking stunned as the chase takes place\n\nDressed in jeans, with white trainers and a hoodie, he can be seen using a belt as makeshift handcuffs and in another telling sign, his feet are dug into the body of the knifeman preventing him from moving\n\nOne eyewitness told MailOnline: 'This guy was a hero; he stopped the man so quickly and professionally.\n'I was watching from the sandwich shop where I work, and he kicked the man's ankles and when he fell on the floor he sat on him to stop him moving.\n'It looked like he was using a belt to restrain his hands but the way he remained calm and cool and didn't made it obvious to me he was either a policeman or security, maybe a soldier.'\nThe theory he may have some sort of security background was also given credence by Amsterdam mayor Femke Haslema.\nShe met him on Friday afternoon, a day after the attack and awarded him a heldesnspeld or 'Hero's Pin' in recognition of his heroics.\nMs Haslema said: 'I thanked him for his actions, and he was very modest, he said he didn't want to go public and didn't want his name revealed.\n'All I can tell you is that he was British and that he was very concerned for the victims. His actions were very brave. Instinctively he thought something bad is happening here.'\nOn Saturday it emerged one of the victims – a 26-year-old Polish man - has been discharged from hospital.\n\nThe knife rampage near the historic Dam Central Square left five injured\n\nPolice officers gather not far from the area after the stabbing near Dam Square\nBut four others, two Americans a man aged 69 and woman aged 67, a 19-year-old local woman and a 73-year-old Belgian woman remained in hospital.\nAmsterdam police spokesperson Eline Roovers told MailOnline: 'The British man did everything by the book, his actions were perfect, and he did everything in the right sense.\n'He has asked that no personal details be revealed and all I can tell you is that he was here on holiday.'\nShe added the suspect – who was from the Donetsk region of Ukraine would be brought before a magistrate on Tuesday for a preliminary hearing and no motive had been established.\nPolice said he was armed with multiple knives and he had been staying at a hotel close to the scene of the attack.\nThe Mayor of Amsterdam welcomed the British man, who did not want his name to be made public, at her official residence to thank him for his actions.\nA spokesperson for the mayor said: 'Mayor Halsema received the man who overpowered the suspect at the official residence this afternoon.\n'She spoke to him and of course thanked him for his heroic actions.\n'He indicated that he does not need media attention at this time and is mainly concerned about the victims.'\n\nPolice officers stand behind a cordoned off area after the stabbing near Dam Square\nAuthorities said in a statement that no motive had yet been established for the attack and the victims may have been targeted at random.\n'The police investigation is in full swing and has full priority at the moment,' Ms Halsema said in a statement on Thursday.\n'We hope to soon get more clarity about the background of this horrible stabbing.'\nShe added: 'Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and loved ones.'\nLast year, the city experienced several stabbings attributed to people with mental health issues.\nAmsterdam set up a hotline last month for residents to report concerns about irrational behaviour.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWatch British man chase down 'Ukrainian knifeman' through the streets of Amsterdam after horror stabbing rampage - as mystery surrounding identity of hero continues\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Red-faced emoji.\n\nWhoopsie doodle.\n\nBut this scandal is more than just an opportunity for you and I to enjoy a good, long therapeutic crackle, because Chatgate (The Yemen Yeller? The Signal Bingle?) is a much bigger deal for Donald Trump than just being deeply embarrassing.\n\nIt could be a real tipping point. \n\nThis could be the first el scandalo that has some of those whatcha me-call-its. \n\nConsequences.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, no matter the scandal, nothing has affected Mr Trump’s standing with his tireless army of supporters, the former reality show host like a sort of greased up duck: everything has simply slipped off his back.\n\nHowever, unlike the 199 Trump scandals that have come before it, Chatgate is a firestorm that the MAGA-verse – and anyone between the ages of three and 103 – can immediately and simply get: War plans put in a group chat. The end.\n\nAlready, this has caused genuine mass public anger, with 74 per cent of Americans, including 60 per cent of Republicans, saying the war plans fiasco was a very or somewhat serious problem, according to YouGov polling.\n\nTrump & co have been unmasked for all to see as utter dimwits and certifiable drongos.\n\nUsing Signal was only “a few steps above leaving a copy of your war plan at the Chinese Embassy”, one Washington defence expert told Politico.\n\nThere have also reportedly been conversations among national security experts whether such handling of defence information might have violated the Espionage Act.\n\nThe people from the chat with the most egg on their faces? \n\nNational security adviser Mike Waltz who added, god knows how, Mr Goldberg to the group and Mr Hegseth, who shared the specific details of the US’ bombing of Yemen on March 15.\n\nMr Hegseth’s messages were sent 31 minutes before American warplanes took off and two hours and one minute before the Yemen bombing raid began, and clearly endangered the military involved.\n\n“You’re going to kill somebody,” one air force pilot told The New York Times.\n\nAnd that’s what sets the Yemen chat mess apart – it’s a perfectly straightforward s**tshow.\n\nTheir unparalleled buffoonery could have killed military personnel, and Americans can immediately understand that.\n\nMr Waltz and Mr Hegseth might have just achieved what Stormy Daniels and reams of dogged prosecutors and Democrats have largely failed to do until now – to dent Mr Trump’s adamantium armour of a reputation among his followers.\n\nFor people in the US to fully appreciate the severity of the situation, they don’t have to be someone with an active New York Times subscription and be willing to wade into the finer points of campaign finance laws (Mr Trump’s criminal payment to Stormy Daniels) or care about him inflating the value of his real estate holdings or believe he should not have nicked classified documents from the White House and quite literally stored them in the Mar-a-Lago loos.\n\nThis is the first great crisis that might actually stick to Mr Trump, and which might penetrate the craniums of his base.\n\nBecause everyone from diehard MAGA loyalists with ‘Mar-a-Lago Or Bust’ tattooed on their bottoms to a dumbfounded Kamala Harris at her undisclosed location (restorative gong retreat with optional valium smoothies?) can immediately see just how wrong this is. \n\nIt doesn’t get any more devastatingly and blatantly unpatriotic than to risk the brave men and women of the armed services.\n\nWhat next? Mr Hegseth hunting American bald eagles for sport or bad mouthing apple pie?\n\nWhat further sets this fiasco apart from the procession of crises that preceded it is that there is no weaselling out of it.\n\nThere is no dodging of who did what and when, because Mr Goldberg has the screenshots. Literally.\n\nBob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had to meet Deepthroat in a murky DC parking garage to bring down President Richard Nixon; Goldberg just had to casually pick up his phone every time it went ding, ding, ding. \n\nHe actually found out the US was about to bomb Yemen when his phone pinged while he was sitting in his car in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nRepublicans also look like exquisite hypocrites after having mounted the “lock her up” campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016 over her use of an unsecured personal email server. \n\nNow they have been caught with their pants around their ankles doing nearly exactly the same thing.\n\n“Their personal phones are all hackable, and it’s highly likely that foreign intelligence services are sitting on their phones watching them type the s**t out,” a former White House official told Politico. \n\n“It is safe to say that anybody in uniform would be court martialled for this.”\n\nOne member of the chat was actually in Moscow meeting with Vladimir Putin at the time the messages were flying around.\n\nThis disaster comes at a shaky point for the President, whose approval ratings have been falling as Americans turn on him for having unleashed Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has been slashing and burning sections of government like a carving knife-wielding Freddy Kruger having a bad day.\n\nMr Trump’s numbers have also been affected by the fact that, despite his repeated campaign promises that he would whip out his magic wand and somehow fix grocery prices and cost of living pressures on “day one”, he has failed to actually do what he promised. \n\nHe has not even lazily attempted to have a bit of a crack at it, because his plate has been full, shilling for Tesla on the White House front lawn like a used Mazda salesman trying to make his quota.\n\nLet me do as Mike Waltz actually did and simply sum things up with a few emojis.\n\nLaughing emoji.

His brother, Tristan Tate, is also accused in that case.\n\nIn her complaint, Tate’s ex-girlfriend, Brianna Stern, argues that his abusive treatment of her follows a long pattern of making blatant misogyny part of his brand. She said he initially acted effusively loving and generous to lure her into a relationship that later turned abusive.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in Los Angeles, details an encounter earlier this month at the Beverly Hills Hotel when Tate choked and beat her, according to the complaint. Stern said she was later diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome.\n\nTate’s attorney, Joseph McBride, said his client denies all allegations of violence. McBride accused Stern and her lawyers of taking advantage of the recent controversy surrounding Tate, hoping it could win them a lucrative payout.\n\n“This is a money grab,” McBride said in a phone interview Saturday morning. “This is the weaponization of the court system against an innocent man.”\n\nThe Associated Press typically does not identify people who say they are the victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly with their story, as Stern has done.\n\nThe Tate brothers, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny all the allegations against them.\n\nStern met Tate in July 2024 after the brothers invited her to Romania because they were looking for models to help promote their cryptocurrency meme coin, according to her lawsuit. She said he convinced her the media portrayals of him were untrue, that he was actually a supporter of women. It seemed like “a dream come true,” she said in the complaint.\n\nAfter she returned to the U.S., Tate’s communications became threatening and manipulative, including calling her his “property,” Stern alleges. He sent messages saying he wanted to beat and impregnate her: “You have an attitude because you’re not hit enough,” he once wrote, according to the complaint.\n\nTate’s attorney, however, called the messages “doctored, edited and falsified,” saying he doesn’t believe they’ll be admissible in court.\n\n“None of it is true,” McBride said. “All of it is a lie.”\n\nDuring their last encounter at the hotel, Stern alleges, Tate beat and choked her during sex.\n\n“While doing so, Tate told her repeatedly that if she ever crossed him, he was going to kill her,” the lawsuit says.\n\nTate, 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed millions of followers online, many of them young men and boys drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle he projects. He previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech, including that women should bear responsibility for getting raped. He and his brother are vocal supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Tate brothers checked in at a police station near Romania’s capital last Monday, complying with judicial control requirements in the human trafficking case that ordered them to return after weeks in the U.S. The American trip was possible because a travel ban against them was lifted last month after a Romanian court found multiple legal and procedural irregularities — a significant blow to the prosecution and a win for the Tates.\n\nTate has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and claimed there’s a political conspiracy to silence him.\n\nDays after they arrived in Florida, the state’s attorney general opened a criminal investigation into the brothers.\n\nFour British women are suing Tate in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him on sexual violence and other abuse charges. Last March, the brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression dating back several years. The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite them, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.\n\nStern said in a statement posted to social media that she’s terrified of how Tate will respond to her public accusations.\n\n“I considered many times just silently leaving Andrew and saying nothing, doing nothing, because I was scared and because it was honestly hard for me to accept that I was being abused,” she wrote. “But I can now see that doing so would be the cowardly approach.”\n\nHer attorney, Tony Buzbee, praised her “incredible courage to come forward and make her voice heard.”","summary":"Andrew Tate, a hugely successful social media influencer known for expressing misogynistic views online, is facing a new lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend accusing him of sexual assault and battery.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/03/29/andrew-tates-ex-girlfriend-accuses-him-of-sexual-assault-and-battery-in-new-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/APTOPIX_Romania_Andrew_Tate_80136_b3f483.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 23:13:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":305616360,"title":"Top White House aide makes bold prediction about what Trump REALLY thinks of JD Vance: 'No MAGA rizz'","text":"A former spokesman for Donald Trump said he knows what the president really thinks of his second in command JD Vance. \n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the shortest-serving White House press secretary, said Trump believes Vance is 'over-modeling him' by trying to mimic the rambunctious commander in chief while lacking the same 'rizz for his team, MAGA.' \n\nScaramucci held his position as the White House director of communications for just ten days in 2017, but said he thinks Trump is unhappy with Vance's role within MAGA. \n\n'At the end of the day, I predict JD Vance will go the way of Mike Pence,' he told CNN's OutFront host Erin Burnett on Friday. \n\n'The President will make him more irrelevant; he'll do things to Vance that will compromise his position. He doesn't like the attention that Vance is getting,' he continued. \n\nHis claims were followed up by a series of clips of Vance closely echoing the words of Trump during statements and speeches. \n\nAfter travelling to Greenland, which Trump has said the US wants to acquire from Denmark, Vance claimed that 'Denmark hasn't done a good at job keeping Greenland safe.' \n\nA clip of Trump and another of Vance speaking on the topic were rolled back-to-back. \n\n'The expression I use is \"some people don't have the cards,\"' Trump said. 'We're the piggy bank that everybody steals from.' \n\nVance echoed in the following clip and said: 'They just don't have the cards. We're done being the piggy bank of the entire world.' \n\nBurnett pointed out how the two had also begun to dress alike, down to matching ties. \n\n'I understand the modelling and the mimetic nature of the vice president, but I think it's a mistake,' Scaramucci added, furthering that if Vance should shave his beard would be a test of the VP's 'full capitulation.' \n\nScaramucci claimed that in his experience, Trump is rarely a fan of what he called 'sycophants' and noted that the President has dodged questions on whether Vance will be his successor. \n\n'He's not the president,' he continued, and argued that Trump, despite whatever viewers may think of him, 'had the rizz for his team, MAGA.' \n\n'JD Vance hasn't proven that,' he said. \n\n'I think it's probably annoying to the President that [Vance is] over-modelling him,' Scaramucci continued. 'You know, people mistake this about [Trump], I don't think he likes the obsequiousness stuff.' \n\nVance's latest appearance in Greenland, where he delivered the speech echoing the President's words, was met with anger from natives. \n\nThe trip was ultimately cut from a three-day trip to just one day, with polls showing that nearly all Greenlanders oppose becoming part of the United States. \n\nRecently, anti-American protestors have also staged some of the largest demonstrations ever seen on the Arctic island. \n\nThey have been speaking out against 'American pressure against Greenland and Denmark' and 'unwanted visits from the U.S Government,' as well as having planned a rally in front of the American embassy in the Danish capital for Saturday. \n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has firmly opposed Trump's overtures since his return to office, praised Greenlanders' defiance of Washington amid the historic protests. \n\n'The attention is overwhelming, and the pressure is great, but it is in times like these that you show what you are made of,' she wrote in an address to the island's inhabitants. 'You have stood up for who you are.' \n\nShe had previously said Vance's visit to the island created 'unacceptable pressure.' \n\n'It is clearly not a visit that concerns Greenland's needs or wishes. That's why I have to say it's an unacceptable pressure being placed on Greenland and Denmark -- and it's pressure we will stand up to,' Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish broadcasters DR and TV2.\n\n'President Trump is serious,' she said. 'He wants Greenland.'\n\nIn fact, Trump doubled down on his vow to seize the territory from Denmark - once a US ally and a NATO member - on Wednesday.\n\nHe erroneously claimed that the people of Greenland 'want something to happen' with the United States.\n\n'They're calling us - we're not calling them,' the president told reporters from the Oval Office.\n\nWhen he was then asked if the people in the territory were 'eager' to become US citizens, he replied that he did not know 'but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.'\n\nHe went on to explain that the United States needs Greenland 'for national security and international security.\n\n'So I think we'll go as far as we have to go,' he vowed.\n\nBut the trip was greeted with far from welcoming arms, as Second Lady Usha Vance's time in Greenland added even more embarrassment for the Trump administration. \n\nUS officials were left knocking on doors of locals to see if they wanted to meet with her, which received a resounding, 'No, thank you.' \n\nUsha's time there was also scheduled to include attending a popular dog sled race, which was also cancelled. \n\nThe Trump administration had claimed Usha was invited to the semi-autonomous territory to attend the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.\n\nBut Greenland's government has explicitly stated there was no formal or informal invitation for US officials to visit the territory - especially as it is in the middle of negotiations to form a new coalition government, according to USA Today.\n\nIt has since been revealed that the invitation for the Second Lady to attend the dogsled race was sent by an American named Tom Dans, who runs a company called American Daybreak - which seeks to strengthen US and Greenlandic ties.\n\nIn a statement published on social media late Tuesday, he said the company was a major sponsor of the annual dogsled race, and it was in that capacity that he invited Usha and other senior Trump officials to visit Greenland 'to experience this unique and exciting cultural event.'\n\nHe said the visit was always intended to be 'purely personal in nature and in the spirit of the friendship between our two nations.'\n\nIt is unclear who canceled Usha's appearance at the race, but it came amid widespread protests throughout Greenland and Denmark.\n\nNow, the only thing on the agenda for Usha's visit is the trip to the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, in an effort to remove the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos.\n\nIt will also reduce the likelihood that the Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump´s annexation announcements.","summary":"A former spokesman of Donald Trump made a bold prediction of what the President really thinks of his second in command JD Vance.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14550931/White-House-prediction-Trump-JD-Vance-MAGA-rizz.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/29/22/96712249-0-image-m-22_1743287094624.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/27/8201775623830195609/1024x576_MP4_8201775623830195609.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-29 23:12:37","author":"Editor,Lauren Acton-Taylor","authors":["Editor","Lauren Acton-Taylor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":305619044,"title":"UK dreams of US trade deal before Trump tariffs","text":"LONDON (AFP) – Britain’s government is hoping to reach a last-minute post-Brexit trade agreement with Washington to avoid – or at least mitigate – more tariffs set to be announced on Wednesday by United States (US) President Donald Trump.\n\nBritain has set out to strike a trade deal with the US since departing the European Union (EU) at the start of the decade, but had been unsuccessful under the previous Conservative government.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour party that won power in July, visited Washington at the end of February and came away hopeful an accord could be reached.\n\nTrump himself held out the prospect of a “great” deal that could avoid tariffs on Britain, hailing Starmer as a tough negotiator.\n\nTalks have continued, with Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds recently visiting Washington, while Starmer and Trump took up the baton in a phone call earlier this week. It is thought that the United Kingdom (UK) government wants to agree some kind of trade deal ahead of April 2 – termed “Liberation Day” by Trump, when he is set to unveil supposedly “reciprocal” tariffs, tailored to different trading partners.\n\nIt would follow Trump’s announcement this week of imposing steep tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts, vowing retaliation as trade tensions intensify and price hikes appear on the horizon.\n\n“We’re engaged in discussions with the United States about mitigating the impact of tariffs,” Starmer said.\n\nFinance Minister Rachel Reeves on Thursday said Britain would not seek to “escalate” trade wars, in contrast to strong comments by other major economic powers that hinted at retaliation in response to the auto-sector tariffs.\n\nDowning Street has described a potential agreement as an “economic prosperity deal”, indicating it will fall short of a free trade deal ultimately sought by London.\n\nAs it stands, the US is the UK’s single largest country trading partner.\n\n“Some type of arrangement that might let the UK escape some tariffs is possible but it would not be a full-scale trade deal,” professor of economics at King’s College London Jonathan Portes told AFP.\n\n“Brexit is a double edged sword – it gives us more flexibility and we can negotiate with a view to our own interests.\n\n“But equally, it means we have less weight than as part of the EU and moreover we cannot afford to agree to anything that complicates our trading relationship with the EU,” Portes added.\n\nUK media has reported that London may scrap a tax on tech giants to avert US tariffs under Trump and clear a pathway to a trade deal.\n\nStarmer in response stressed that “in the end, our national interest has to come first, which means all options are on the table”.\n\nHis spokesman added that the UK will “make sure that businesses pay their fair share of tax, including businesses in the digital sector”.\n\nThe digital tax is currently worth about GBP800 million annually to the UK Treasury.\n\nReynolds conceded that the digital tax is not “something that can never change or we can never have a conversation about”.\n\nPortes, along with director of the UK Trade Policy Project David Henig pointed to the risk of altering Britain’s tax policy in return for a promise from Trump over tariff exemptions.\n\n“If Trump keeps his word and the UK gains significant benefits as a result, then eliminating a tax could be a good deal,” Henig told AFP. “That, however, is quite a gamble.”","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/uk-dreams-of-us-trade-deal-before-trump-tariffs/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P9-B-AFP_30032025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 23:08:58","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":305622260,"title":"Copyright questions loom  as ChatGPT’s  Ghibli-style  images go viral","text":"NEW YORK (AFP) – The release of the latest image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of online memes featuring images done in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese studio behind classic animated films like My Neighbor Totoro and Princess Mononoke.\n\nThe virality of these images, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even changing his profile picture on X to match the style, immediately raised questions about copyright infringement by the ChatGPT maker, which already faces lawsuits regarding the use of source material without permission.\n\nSince the release on Wednesday, AI-generated images depicting Studio Ghibli versions of Elon Musk with United States (US) President Donald Trump, The Lord of the Rings, and even a recreation of the September 11 attacks have gone viral across online platforms.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House took part by posting on X a Ghibli-style image of a weeping alleged felon being handcuffed by a US immigration officer before her deportation.\n\nOriginally intended to be available on the platform for free, Altman said the huge success of the new generator was unexpected and meant the tool would remain limited to paid users for now.\n\nIt was already possible to generate images with ChatGPT, but the latest version is powered by GPT-4o, the company’s highest-performing model, and allows sophisticated results to be obtained through very succinct requests, which was not the case before.\n\nAfter the viral trend, a video from 2016 resurfaced in which Studio Ghibli’s legendary director Hayao Miyazaki is seen lashing out during an AI demonstration by staff.\n\n“I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.

The executive order also targeted Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), another USAGM entity founded in the early 1950s as two separate CIA front organizations.\n\nIn response, VOA journalists, unions, and press freedom NGOs sued the agency and its leadership, warning that the broadcaster – which has “promoted America’s democratic ideals abroad since World War II” – would suffer “irreparable harm,” while its foreign employees could face “deportation to their home countries.”\n\nOn Friday, District Judge James Paul Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from terminating the contracts of roughly 1,200 VOA employees who were placed on leave earlier this month.\n\nThe judge prohibited USAGM from implementing Trump’s order and from “proceeding with any further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough any USAGM employee or contractor.” The ruling also blocks the agency from terminating federal grants or contracts, or shuttering existing offices.\n\nTrump-appointed senior USAGM adviser Kari Lake defended the cuts earlier this month, calling the agency “not salvageable.” \n\n“From top to bottom, this agency is a giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer – a national security risk for this nation – and irretrievably broken,” she said.\n\nElon Musk, Trump’s government efficiency czar, also advocated for shuttering VOA and RFE/RL back in February.

The core index has barely changed in the past year. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s two per cent target, making it difficult for the central bank to cut its key interest rate anytime soon.\n\nThe report also showed that consumer spending rebounded last month after falling by the most in four years in January. Yet much of the additional spending reflected price increases, with inflation-adjusted spending barely rising. The weak figure suggests growth is rapidly slowing in the first three months of this year as consumers and businesses turn cautious amid sharp changes in government policies.\n\n“Inflation too hot and spending too cold,” said economist at Capital Economics Stephen Brown in an email. “The Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates this year.”\n\nBrown estimates that economic growth could fall to zero in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4 per cent in last year’s fourth quarter.\n\nInflation remains a top economic concern for most Americans, even as it has fallen sharply from its 2022 peak. Donald Trump rode dissatisfaction with higher prices to the presidency and promised to quickly bring down inflation, but the yearly rate is higher now than in September, when it briefly touched 2.1 per cent.\n\nConsumer spending rose 0.4 per cent in February, though the gain was just 0.1 per cent after adjusting for prices. The mild increase follows a sharp 0.6 per cent drop in January.\n\nThe spending and inflation figures steepened a market downturn early Friday. The broad S&P 500 stock market index fell 1.4 per cent. The Dow Jones index fell more than 500 points and the Nasdaq fell as well.\n\nThe spending increase was driven by greater purchases of long-lasting goods, such as cars and appliances, which could reflect an effort by shoppers to buy things before tariffs are imposed. They are the kind of purchases that won’t likely be repeated in coming months.\n\nSpending on services, including discretionary spending such as at restaurants and hotels, fell.\n\n“The fact that consumers chose to increase outlays on goods that are about to see price increases at the expense of the far more economically important service sector provides insight into the mindset of the consumer,” said chief economist at tax and advisory firm RSM Joseph Brusuelas, .\n\nAlso Friday, the University of Michigan released its updated consumer sentiment survey for March, which showed a sharp drop in Americans’ outlook for the economy. The survey also found growing anxiety over inflation and jobs.\n\n“This month’s decline reflects a clear consensus across all demographic and political affiliations,” said director of the survey Joanne Hsu.\n\n“Republicans joined independents and Democrats in expressing worsening expectations since February for their personal finances, business conditions, unemployment and inflation.”\n\nTrump has slapped 20 per cent tariffs on all Chinese imports, 25 per cent import taxes on steel and aluminium, and on Wednesday said he would hit imported cars with another 25 per cent duty. Most economists and the Federal Reserve, now expect inflation to tick higher this year as a result of the tariffs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said elevated inflation from the tariffs could be temporary. But he also added the outlook was unusually uncertain given the swift changes in policy from the White House.\n\nOn a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3 per cent in February from the previous month, the same as in January, while core prices increased 0.4 per cent, the largest increase in more than a year. Increases at that pace, for a full year, would drive inflation far above the Federal Reserve’s two per cent target.\n\nOne bright spot in the report was a big jump in incomes for the second straight month – they rose 0.8 per cent in February from January. Higher income with weaker spending pushed up the savings rate, which can fuel future spending. But it also could reflect greater caution among consumers.\n\n“Savings went up, consistent with reports of flagging consumer confidence, rising uncertainty about the future and reduced expectations for the future,” chief economist at High Frequency Economics Carl Weinberg said.\n\nConsumer and business confidence in the economy has fallen sharply since Trump began rolling out tariffs, and a measure of Americans’ outlook for the future of the economy dropped to a 12-year low on Tuesday.\n\nMany polls find that most of the public sees the economy as fair or poor. A survey last month by the Pew Research Center found that 63 per cent of Americans still see inflation as a “very big problem.”\n\nApparel company Lululemon on Thursday became the latest retailer to warn that slumping consumer confidence will hurt sales, while the parent company of Tommy Bahama, Lilly Pulitzer, and Johnny Was stores said that sales slowed to start the year as consumer sentiment darkened.\n\nNike previously issued a similar warning and expectations from major retailers like Target and Walmart have grown subdued as customers pull back.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/us-consumers-remained-cautious-about-spending-last-month-as-inflation-ticked-higher/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P10-B-afp_30032025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 23:05:21","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":305619046,"title":"Elon Musk says xAI startup buying X platform","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) – Elon Musk said his artificial intelligence startup xAI is buying his social networking platform X in a deal valuing the company once known as Twitter at USD33 billion.\n\n“This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” Musk said in a post on his social network.\n\nX has more than 600 million users, and its future is “intertwined” with that of xAI, launched two years ago, according to Musk.\n\n“Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Musk said of combining the two companies.\n\n“This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.”\n\nThe companies are being combined in an all-stock deal that values xAI at USD80 billion and X at USD33 billion, factoring in the social network’s USD12 billion debt.\n\nMusk bought Twitter for USD44 billion in late 2022 in a transaction that included debt and launched xAI the following year, spending billions of dollars on high-end Nvidia chips for the venture.\n\nxAI in February released the latest version of its chatbot, Grok 3, which the billionaire hopes will find traction in a highly competitive sector contested by the likes of ChatGPT and China’s DeepSeek.\n\nMusk has promoted Grok 3 as “scary smart,” with 10 times the computational resources of its predecessor that was released in August last year.

In fact, the war on public broadcasting goes back decades and has been passed down from Republican to Republican.\n\nPBS and NPR are funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit funded by taxpayers. Programming on the networks is also funded by underwriters, which are sometimes private corporations but also individuals, other nonprofits, or trusts.\n\nBack in the 1970s, President Richard Nixon opposed funding PBS and even vetoed congressional legislation that included money to keep the network going. Coincidentally, PBS led the way in airing uninterrupted coverage of the Watergate hearings, which would eventually lead to him resigning from the presidency. At the time, viewers of the commercial networks complained that hearing coverage interrupted regular programming, while networks like C-SPAN did not yet exist. PBS was a noncommercial venue for educating the public about the most serious issue of the moment.\n\nIn the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan tried to cut public broadcasting funding even though the Democratic-led Congress had voted for money to be appropriated for that cause. Both George W. Bush and Trump (in his first term) attempted to defund the broadcasters as well.\n\nDuring the 2012 presidential election, Republican nominee Mitt Romney joined the crusade against public media, only to be mocked in an ad from then-President Barack Obama. The ad noted that despite the crimes of Wall Street during the Great Recession, Romney had singled out Big Bird—complaining that taxpayers were funding “Sesame Street.”\n\nRomney lost, and Big Bird remains.\n\nBut why are Republicans so focused on attacking PBS and NPR, to the point that the ire transcends the ideological differences within the Republican Party over decades?\n\nA big part of the reason is trust. Public media in the United States has been a resounding success. Both on the radio and on television (and now online), PBS and NPR provide content trusted by a wide swath of Americans, and both services have a very good track record of providing information without corporate or political influence.\n\nFor over 22 years of polling, PBS has been ranked as the most trusted institution in the United States. A January poll from YouGov found that PBS was more highly regarded than courts of law, commercial television and print publications, and above even the federal government and Congress. \n\nSimilarly, according to Harris Interactive in late 2024, NPR was ranked as the most trustworthy news media brand in America.\n\nPBS Kids, which is the programming bloc where “Sesame Street” resides, is trusted by the vast majority of parents (88%), according to a YouGov poll. And 90% of parents agreed that PBS Kids helps to prepare children for educational success. Parents also ranked it as far and away the most educational media brand.\n\n“Sesame Street” has long tackled important topics like racism, making it clear to children that this kind of bigotry is “wrong and unfair.”\n\nIn short, public broadcasting represents the opposite of many conservative beliefs. The networks support accessible information, prioritize education, and strive to produce content opposing bigotry.\n\nConservatives see more utility in divisive, bigoted figures—like Greene and Trump—than in Big Bird, who promotes kindness and friendship.\n\nThat’s why the networks are under attack from one Republican leader to the next.\n\nRelated | You won’t believe Marjorie Taylor Greene’s latest unhinged rants\n\nBut the right’s leadership is out of touch with America on this topic. A March poll from the Pew Research Center revealed that more Americans support continued funding for PBS and NPR (43%) than want to eliminate its federal funding (24%).\n\nA February poll from YouGov showed that even Trump voters value the network, with 65% saying the PBS is underfunded or adequately funded, and 72% saying they value PBS’ educational content.\n\nAmericans, as they have since the character first emerged, are firmly in Big Bird’s corner. Republicans have yet to learn how to get to Sesame Street.","summary":"Congressional Republicans held a hearing on Wednesday to direct their ire at a familiar target: public broadcasting. Led by Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMY LAMARE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:22:31 GMT, 29 March 2025 |Updated:22:56 GMT, 29 March 2025 \n\nHailey Bieber attended a pilates class in West Hollywood with her BFF Kendall Jenner over the weekend. \nThe workout comes amid concern for her husband Justin Bieber's behavior and rumors that their marriage is on the rocks. \nThe model showed off her pilates toned midriff in a white cropped tank with black yoga pants. \nHailey, 28, held her newly darker brown hair back with a black headband and also wore an oversized, black zip-front hoodie. \nKendall, 29, on the other hand, wore black leggings and a red leather bomber jacket.\nShe had her raven hair pulled back into a bun and kept her sunglasses clad face down as she exited the studio behind Hailey. \n\nHailey Bieber attended a pilates class in West Hollywood with her BFF Kendall Jenner over the weekend\n\nThe workout comes amid concern for her husband Justin Bieber 's behavior and rumors that their marriage is on the rocks\nEarlier this week on Wednesday, Justin looked tense on a drive home from church with Hailey after he met with a controversial pastor in Los Angeles.\nThe singer, 31, appeared deep in thought as he sat in the passenger seat while his model wife was seen driving behind the wheel.\n\n Justin Bieber's disrespectful act fuels marriage fears as Hailey blows off steam \nThe strained drive follows Justin's meeting with Churchome pastor Judah Smith amid reported marital issues.\nIn recent years, Justin and Hailey cozied up to Judah outside of church after he previously distanced himself from the disgraced Hillsong pastor Carl Lentz.\nThe trip to church comes after Justin recently admitted to struggling with 'anger issues' in a confessional Instagram post.\nThe message did little to allay fans' fears for Justin's mental and physical wellbeing, which have surged due to his often-disheveled appearance and reports of strain in his marriage to Hailey.\nIn recent years, Justin and Hailey cosied up to Judah outside of church after he previously distanced himself from the disgraced Hillsong pastor Carl Lentz.\nThe trip to church comes after Justin recently admitted to struggling with 'anger issues' in a confessional Instagram post.\n\nThe model showed off her pilates toned midriff in a white cropped tank with black yoga pants\n\nHailey was seen petting an adorable French Bulldog in the parking lot of the pilates studio\n\nHailey, 28, held her newly dark brown hair back with a black headband and also wore an oversized, black zip-front hoodie\n\nKendall on the other hand, wore black leggings and a red leather bomber jacket\nThe message did little to allay fans' fears for Justin's mental and physical wellbeing, which have surged due to his often-disheveled appearance and reports of strain in his marriage to Hailey.\nJudah was pictured appearing to give Justin a pat on the back as he headed into the church.\nThe pop star was once a devotee of the celebrity-courting megachurch Hillsong and its former pastor and co-founder, Carl Lentz, whom Justin once referred to as his 'second father.'\nBut the two had a falling out after Lentz's torrid extramarital affair came to light in 2020, and Justin quickly distanced himself from Lentz.\nMonths later, he confirmed on social media that he was no longer a member of the church, and other celebrity congregants also stopped attending its services.\nInto that cross-shaped void stepped Smith, who leads Churchome, which has aggressively courted celebrities after expanding from its Seattle origins.\nJudah — who has labeled himself the 'Lead Communicator' for Churchome, while his wife Chelsea is its 'Lead Theologian' — took over the City Church that his father founded in Seattle, before he and his wife expanded to Los Angeles and changed the church's name.\nAlthough Justin has increasingly turned to Judah after abandoning Lentz, the singer's connection to him and what would become Churchome goes back around 15 years.\nAccording to Marie Claire, Justin's mother first saw Judah speak at a conference in Toronto in 1999, and she later contacted him and Chelsea in 2010 to ask if they could be 'good influences' for her famous son, whom they were well aware by then.\n\nEarlier this week on Wednesday, Justin looked tense as he and Hailey left the controversial Churchome church\n\nLike Justin's former pastor, Judah has been dogged by controversy over the years.\n He has been accused of homophobia after previously saying that being gay was as serious a 'sin' as committing 'rape and murder.'\nChurchome also came under fire in the past for hiring an employee accused of rape, and a woman previously accused the church of encouraging her not to go to the police after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by one of its interns.\nThen, in 2023, Churchome was hit with a class action lawsuit by more than 100 employees over its practice of requiring them to tithe 10 percent of their gross income — with the lead plaintiff allegedly being threatened with termination if she didn't resume tithing after she fell on financial hardship.\nInstagramKendall

The Kennewick School Board filed a Title IX complaint to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights against Washington state's Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reydkal this week. The complaint includes a plea for \"urgent\" federal intervention against the state's ongoing policies that defy President Donald Trump's recent \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. \"We respectfully request URGENT federal intervention due to open and egregious Title IX violations currently occurring within the state’s student athletics as well as requisite school district policies mandated by the state which are in direct violation of Title IX,\" the complaint states. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"We are particularly concerned the openly discriminatory policies and mandates by the state of Washington, State Superintendent Reykdal, OSPI and WIAA not only directly harm our young women, but also jeopardize our district’s essential federal funding, the loss of which would most severely impact our most impoverished and at risk populations.\" The school board is currently caught in a conflict of directives as Trump's administration has ordered all public schools to ban trans athletes from girls' sports or risk losing federal funding, but Washington's state government has ordered schools to continue allowing trans inclusion. \"This state-imposed restriction erodes the trust between schools and families and unreasonably infringes on the precious fundamental right of parents in guiding their children's development,\" the complaint continues. \"Our school board addressed this by genuinely attempting to find a middle ground between the state mandate and the fundamental role of parents. We did so with slight modifications to the state-mandated policy that shouldn't offend any reasonable person. Nevertheless, OSPI has taken the position that our slight modifications offend the law (as OSPI has interpreted it) and seems to have triggered the State Superintendent Chris Reykdal and OSPI.\" Reydkal previously claimed it was \"inaccurate\" to say there are only two genders during a video address in late February. CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER WARNS DEMOCRATS OF CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT PROTECTING GIRLS' SPORTS FROM TRANS ATHLETES \"It is quite simply inaccurate to say, biologically, that there are only boys and there are only girls,\" Reykdal said. \"There's a continuum. There's a science to this. There are children who are born intersex. There are children whose hormones and whose chromosomes are not consistent with their sex at birth. \"Our state laws make clear that children get to identify and participate based on the gender in which they identify. We're going to uphold that law.\" Reykdal also insisted in that address that Trump does not have the authority as president to issue a ban on trans athletes in girls sports but conceded the U.S. Congress does. Another school district in Washington opted to take matters into its own hands and defy the state government in late February. The Tumwater School District's board of directors voted 3-1 on Feb. 27 to ban trans athletes from playing for girls’ sports teams after a nationaly-publicized controversy involving one of its school's girls' basketball teams. A civil rights complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights on behalf of a teenage girl in Washington state who was allegedly punished for refusing to play a basketball game against a trans athlete. The complaint alleged that the Tumwater School District in Washington is currently investigating 15-year-old Frances Staudt for \"misgendering\" the opponent and violating the district's policies against bullying and harassment on Feb. 7. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The issue of trans inclusion became so concerning for Washginton residents, that in December the WIAA announced a proposal to create a separate open division for transgender athletes to compete in. That proposal came weeks after the Central Valley School Board, which oversees schools in Spokane Valley and Liberty Lake, Washington, voted to send a message to the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) over the issues after much debate at a school board meeting.

The denial Saturday by the Wisconsin court of appeals is the latest twist in Musk's deep involvement in the race, which has set a record for spending in a judicial election and has become a litmus test for the opening months of Donald Trump's presidency. Trump and Musk are backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in the race, while Democrats are behind Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Also Read | Eid al-Fitr 2025: Fasting Month of Ramadan 2025 Ends, Eid To Be Celebrated Across Gulf on March 30. Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit Friday, arguing that Musk's offer violates the law. Kaul on Saturday later appealed to the state Court of Appeals, after a county court judge refused earlier in the day to hear the request for an emergency injunction to block the payments. Musk plans a rally Sunday where he intends to give a pair of Wisconsin voters USD 1 million each for signing an online petition against “activist” judges. He is also offering USD 100 to anyone who signs it; he previously gave USD 1 million to a Green Bay man who signed.

Musk and groups he funds have poured more than USD 20 million into the race, while Democratic megadonors, including George Soros, back Crawford. The race will determine ideological control of the court. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority but a retirement this year puts the majority in play. The election concludes Tuesday. Kaul argued Musk's promised payments violated a state law making it a felony to give voters anything of value in exchange for them voting. Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay USD 1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day. The Wisconsin Supreme Court race comes as the court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to “personally hand over” USD 2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race. Kaul asked the court to order Musk to stop promoting the Sunday giveaway and to not make any future payments to Wisconsin voters. Even though Musk's initial post was deleted, there has been no announcement that the payments will not be made, Kaul argued in the lawsuit.

Grigory Karasin, who led talks with the US in Saudi Arabia on March 24, said on Friday that there may be no decisive results from talks with the US. “It would have been naive to expect any breakthroughs,” Karasin said to Russian state TV Channel Rossiya 24. This goes against previous assertions from the Trump administration that a deal to bring an end to the war could be reached swiftly. It comes after Russia effectively rejected a 30-day pause in the fighting proposed by the US. It also asked for sanctions against food and fertiliser to be lifted - along with the rowing back of EU economic sanctions - after the US said it would “help restore Russia’s access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports” for a ceasefire in the Black Sea. Europe is currently not keen to lift sanctions and Kremlin critics are sceptical Russia wants much progress in peace talks as it makes incremental gains on the battlefield. US President Donald Trump said on March 25 Russia might be “dragging their feet”. Military analysts in Ukraine assess Russia’s forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximise the pressure on Ukraine and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks. They believe the Kremlin is preparing a multi-pronged push across the 621-mile front line. Putin, meanwhile, said on Thursday that Russian forces are close to “finishing off” Ukrainian defenders. “On the entire front line, the strategic initiative is completely in the hands of the Russian armed forces ,” Mr Putin said on Thursday at a forum in the Arctic port of Murmansk. “Our troops, our guys are moving forward and liberating one territory after another, one settlement after another, every day.” Ukrainian military commanders said Russia recently stepped up attacks to improve its tactical positions ahead of the expected broader offensive. “They need time until May, that’s all,” said Ukrainian military analyst Pavlo Narozhnyi, who works with soldiers and learns about intelligence from them. A larger offensive would give Putin reason to delay progress in talks, the analysts said, renewing their country’s repeated arguments that Russia has no intention of engaging in meaningful dialogue to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ’s assessment chimed with that of analysts. Citing intelligence reports, he said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeast Sumy, Kharkiv and Zaporizizhia regions. “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the US stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Mr Zelensky said on Thursday during a visit to Paris. “Putin wants to negotiate over territory from a stronger position.”","summary":"A Russian negotiator involved in peace talks said a ceasefire deal with Ukraine could be further away than a number of Trump administration officials in the US had hoped","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-negotiator-issues-grim-new-34958218","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34958240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_RUSSIA-BUSINESS-PUTIN.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 22:44:07","author":"Benjamin Lynch","authors":["Benjamin Lynch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":305615052,"title":"Wisconsin Appeals Court Allows Elon Musk&#8217;s $1 Million Voter Payments To Continue Amid Lawsuit","text":"A Wisconsin appellate court has denied a request from the state's Democratic attorney general to block billionaire Elon Musk from distributing $1 million checks to two voters at a rally scheduled for Sunday. The decision comes just two days before a high-stakes Wisconsin Supreme Court election, which has drawn unprecedented spending and political scrutiny.\nA High-Stakes Judicial Election\nThe race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court has turned into a political battleground, with both parties pouring significant resources into their preferred candidates. Musk, alongside former President Donald Trump, is backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. Meanwhile, Democrats, bolstered by megadonors like George Soros, support Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. The outcome of the election could shift the ideological balance of the court, which currently holds a 4-3 liberal majority but is at risk of flipping due to an upcoming retirement.\nMusk has already committed over $20 million to the race through organizations he funds. His controversial financial involvement has sparked legal challenges, particularly from Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk’s offer violates state laws prohibiting financial inducements related to voting.\nLegal Challenges and Court Rulings\nKaul initially filed a lawsuit on Friday, asserting that Musk’s plan to award $1 million each to two Wisconsin voters for signing an online petition against \"activist\" judges breaches state election laws. Additionally, Musk is offering $100 to anyone who signs the petition, a tactic he has used previously. On Saturday, Kaul escalated the matter to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals after a county judge declined to issue an emergency injunction against the payments.\nKaul contends that Musk’s actions amount to a felony under Wisconsin law, which forbids giving voters anything of value in exchange for voting. However, Musk’s political action committee has employed similar strategies in past elections without legal repercussions. In a comparable case last year, a Pennsylvania judge ruled that prosecutors failed to demonstrate that Musk’s initiative—offering $1 million per day to voters in battleground states—constituted an illegal lottery, thereby allowing it to continue.\nPotential Impact on Future Elections\nBeyond the immediate legal battle, the Wisconsin Supreme Court election holds significant implications for the state’s political landscape. The court is poised to make rulings on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power, and election laws that could influence both the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.\nMusk’s involvement has only intensified the political tension. Initially, he announced on his social media platform, X, that he would \"personally hand over\" $2 million to two voters who had already cast their ballots. Although the post was later deleted, Kaul argues that there has been no official statement indicating the payments will not proceed. As a result, he has urged the courts to prevent Musk from making any further financial offers to Wisconsin voters.\nWith the election set to conclude on Tuesday, the controversy surrounding Musk’s financial influence continues to fuel legal and political debates, setting a precedent for how billionaires may engage in future electoral processes.\nALSO READ: India-Ukraine Trade Ties Get A Boost As Ukrainian Apples Arrive In Indian Markets","summary":"A Wisconsin appellate court has denied a request from the state&#8217;s Democratic attorney general to block billionaire Elon Musk from distributing $1 million checks to two voters at a rally scheduled for Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/wisconsin-appeals-court-allows-elon-musks-1-million-voter-payments-to-continue-amid-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Elon-Musk-4.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-29 22:41:10","author":"Ashish Rana","authors":["Ashish Rana"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.159}]}
