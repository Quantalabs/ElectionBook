Fundraising. This speaks to Trump's money issues—both he and Vance are spending precious time in New York on Oct. 27.\"According to the invitation, the event features several tiers of \"experiences,\" with the top-tier \"Ultra MAGA Experience\" priced at $924,600. The options include:\n- \"Team Trump 2024 Experience\": $250,000 to give or $500,000 to raise\n- \"Team America First Experience\": $100,000 to give or $200,000 to raise\n- \"Club 47 Experience\": $50,000 to give or $70,000 to raise\n- \"MAGA 24 Experience\": $35,000 to give\n- \"President's Club Experience\": $5,000 to give\nNewsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Monday for comment.Trump's decision to host a rally in New York City, where he lived most of his life until 2019, is a curious move considering recent polling data.According to Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight polling, as of October 14, Harris holds a significant lead over Trump in New York. The poll shows Harris at 53.8 percent compared to Trump's 39.9 percent, a 14-point advantage. The polling average has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.FiveThirtyEight's analysis includes several recent polls that consistently favor Harris. An ActiVote poll conducted from September 4 to September 30 showed Harris leading with 61 percent to Trump's 39 percent.An Emerson College survey from September 23 to September 25 put Harris at 56 percent and Trump at 42 percent. Two Siena College polls conducted from September 11 to September 16 indicated 55 percent and 52 percent support for Harris versus 42 and 40 for Trump, respectively.Madison Square Garden (MSG), known primarily for live sports and entertainment and called The World's Most Famous Arena, is home to the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers.The venue has also played host to numerous political events and controversial gatherings. Its history includes Democratic and Republican national conventions, visits from world leaders and religious figures such as popes, and a Nazi rally in 1939.Trump's relationship with his former home state has been tumultuous in recent years. New Yorkers have held numerous protests against him, sometimes outside Trump Tower, chanting, \"New York hates you\" as he passes by.In May, a jury in New York convicted Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has maintained his innocence, describing the legal proceedings as \"lawfare.\"Despite the challenging poll numbers, Trump expressed confidence during a recent rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \"We just rented Madison Square Garden,\" he told supporters. \"It hasn't been done in many decades. But we're gonna make ... how can New York be run worse than it is right now?\"","summary":"The exclusive event offers a top-tier $924,600 \"Ultra MAGA Experience\" at Madison Square Garden, despite Trump substantially trailing Harris in N.Y. polls.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-exclusive-fundraising-event-new-york-city-1968992","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495201/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 01:02:50","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.193},{"id":259696666,"title":"Meeting the King and Queen?

So it was a mix of historical research plus my own interviews.’ \n\nThe rape scene is based on a divorce deposition from Ivana Trump that she later recanted in 2015 after he announced his first presidential run. \n\nStan plays Trump and the Roy Cohn character is played by Jeremy Strong of Succession fame. \n\nThe movie’s director, Ali Abbasi, was in Washington, D.C. last week and told an audience there that he had initially thought about casting a woman in the Trump part. \n\n‘There was a time before I started talking to Sebastian I thought that maybe it should be an actress playing Trump,’ Abbasi said. ‘Because I thought there was something awkward and off about his body language and I wanted to have that. I wanted to sort of play with that. And we tried it.’ \n\nSpeaking to DailyMail.com, Abbasi wouldn’t reveal which actresses he spoke to about portraying Trump on the big screen, though he did say that he reached out to Cate Blanchett for advice, as she did a ‘great job’ playing Bob Dylan.\n\n‘I did talk to a few people about that and I was serious about it,’ Abbasi said in an interview Monday.\n\n‘I did overlays of young Donald’s face and different actresses that I was considering,’ he continued. ‘I talked to my prosthetics person and tried to figure out how we could solve it if someone had the good proportions or not.’\n\nAbbasi told DailyMail.com that he also conducted a voice test using a woman.\n\n‘And in the end, I think, I just felt like the whole thing became too gimmicky,’ he said.\n\n‘It would go contrary to my goal, which was humanizing and, you know, capturing complexity. And it would become a movie about how you did that stunt,’ the director said.\n\nIt also would have likely angered Trump even more than Stan’s performance.\n\nIn 2017, on the heels of Melissa McCarthy dressing in drag and portraying White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live, the fact that McCarthy was a woman was the ‘most problematic’ part of the skit in the president’s eyes, Politico reported. \n\nCast member Kate McKinnon also played Trump’s first Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally, and former New York City Rudy Giuliani, who became Trump’s personal lawyer.\n\nAidy Bryant played Trump’s second Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\nAbbasi said he wasn’t aware that Trump had been angered by women playing his top aides on the comedy show.\n\n‘We talk about it like it’s a negative thing, but it doesn’t need to be a negative thing,’ Abbasi said of gender-bending performances. ‘But I wasn’t aware, I wasn’t aware of this,’ he said of Trump’s anger related to women playing his aides and allies.\n\nIn the end, the pick of Stan for Trump felt right.\n\n‘I think one important thing with Sebastian is, he – and I’ve said that before – he’s almost specialized in bringing sleazebags and douchebags to life,’ Abbasi said. ‘And give them like humanity and give them sort of, you feel for him. You feel for these characters. Without them being necessarily ridiculed.’\n\n‘And its’ a very interesting talent, you know, it’s not easy,’ the director said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump lost it on Truth Social over the new&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump criticizes the movie The Apprentice featuring Sebastian Stan as &#8216;cheap&#8217; and &#8216;classless&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-criticizes-the-movie-the-apprentice-featuring-sebastian-stan-as-cheap-and-classless/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/14/22/90845435-0-image-a-7_1728943175694.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:50:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":259697034,"title":"Harris turns Trump’s threats on ‘enemy within’ against him as she campaigns in battleground Pennsylvania","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris warned voters in a key Pennsylvania town that Donald Trump intends to take revenge on Americans who fail to support him if he succeeds in his push to win a second term in the White House, calling the former president “increasingly unstable and unhinged.”\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of supporters at an Erie, Pennsylvania, on Monday, Harris called the twice-impeached, felonious former president “someone who will stop at nothing to claim power for himself,” citing his long history of comments that express contempt for the Constitution and the recent Supreme Court decision giving presidents sweeping immunity from prosecution for any crimes committed while carrying out their official duties. \n\nBut Harris told the crowd, which a campaign official estimated at roughly 6,000, that they don’t have to take her word for it when it comes to Trump’s malign intent.\n\nShe asked staff to “roll the clip” on what she said was an example of Trump’s “worldview and intentions” — a segment from an interview he sat for with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \n\nIn it, Trump tells the financial correspondent — a strong and vocal supporter of his who repeatedly broadcast lies about the conduct of the 2020 election — that “the enemy from within,” his term for Americans who do not support him or vote for Republicans, are “more dangerous” than foreign adversaries such as Russia or China. \n\n“We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military,” he said, facing no pushback from the Fox personality.\n\nHarris told the crowd: “He's talking about the enemy within our country. Pennsylvania, he's talking about that he considers anyone who doesn't support him or who will not bend to his will, enemy of our country. It's saying that he would use the military to go after them.”\n\n“Think about this ... we know who he would target because he has attacked them before,” she said, listing journalists whose stories displease him and election officials “who refuse to cheat” for him among Trump’s potential targets if handed power once more.\n\nA second Trump term, Harris added, “would be a huge risk for America” because Trump “is increasingly unstable and unhinged, and he is for unchecked power.”\n\n“He wants to send the military after American citizens. He He has worked to prevent women from making their own health care decisions and threaten your fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride,” she said. \n\nThe vice president called on supporters to “answer the call” by voting for her in November, closing her remarks by telling supporters that they “know what is at stake.”\n\nCiting Erie County’s longtime bellwether status, she said “now is the time” for residents to “make your plan to vote.”\n\n“The election is here, and we need to organize, we need to mobilize, we need to energize folks, and we need to remind everybody that their vote is their voice, and your voice is your power,” she said.","summary":"The Vice President is taking the fight to Trump as polls tighten with just three weeks until Americans go to the polls on Election Day","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-rally-trump-enemy-threats-pennsylvania-b2629221.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/01/SEI225645328.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uAyxLX2X-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:48:57","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":259696486,"title":"Meghan McCain slams ABC’s Martha Raddatz over JD Vance interview: ‘Sounds psychotic’","text":"Meghan McCain slammed ex-ABC colleague Martha Raddatz on Sunday over an interview with Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. \n\nRaddatz, 71, downplayed apartment takeovers by Venezuelan migrant gang members in Aurora, Colo., telling Vance, 40, that the “incidents” involving the ruthless Tren de Aragua crime syndicate were “limited to a handful.” \n\nMcCain, 39, was left in disbelief over the line of questioning by the “This Week” host. \n\n“It’s really insane Martha and her producers didn’t see how awful her line of questioning sounds to a normal person,” she wrote on X. “I’m sure she would have different feelings if she lived next to an apartment complex filled w/ Venezuelan gangs.” \n\nMcCain, a former co-host on ABC’s “The View,” added that Raddatz sounded “psychotic” during her interview with the Ohio senator. \n\n“She sounds psychotic.

Lawmakers and the U.S. intelligence community, meanwhile, argue the app poses a grave threat to national security, if it remains in the hands of the Chinese communist regime.\n\nOn April 24, President Joe Biden signed into law the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), a law that requires apps controlled by foreign adversaries to sever that connection to operate in the United States. This created a countdown for China-based parent company ByteDance to sell off TikTok by Jan. 19, 2025. ByteDance and TikTok sued, arguing the law is unconstitutional on a First Amendment basis.\n\nIn 2019, the U.S. government contacted ByteDance by way of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and flagged national security concerns.\n\nThe committee has very specific authority—to review transactions with foreign investment on the basis of national security—and it was challenged as to whether it had authority to review the purchase of Musical.ly when it had occurred two years prior.\n\nBy July 30, 2020, CFIUS had completed a formal review and announced an investigation into ByteDance’s purchase of Musical.ly.\n\nTwo weeks later, President Donald Trump issued an executive order requiring ByteDance to divest from its American apps, namely TikTok. ByteDance sued, and the government lost on procedural grounds. The court questioned why an executive order was needed when CFIUS had yet to complete its investigation. The order was stayed, and the lawsuit was frozen.\n\nFrom November 2020 on, the executive branch held ongoing meetings with ByteDance and TikTok, reviewing dozens of proposals and having in-depth technical discussions to find a resolution short of divestment.\n\nBut after years of discussion, ByteDance was unwilling to agree to terms that would mitigate risks posed by the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) access to user data and its ability to influence the app, he said.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 2022, ByteDance submitted its final proposal and has publicly touted the nearly $2 billion it invested in “Project Texas,” meant to house data on U.S. soil. However, extensive review from the government and experts found this proposal was “insufficient” to address core national security concerns.\n\nIt would ultimately require the government to trust that Oracle was reviewing TikTok’s actions in an impossible timeframe and rely on TikTok to voluntarily remedy any wrongdoing only after the government identified it.\n\nThe CCP has passed several laws that require all individuals and organizations operating in China to aid the CCP’s digital authoritarianism, claiming “digital sovereignty” gives it the authority to enforce these laws even overseas, and even if they conflict with foreign laws.\n\nThe CCP’s 2015 National Security Law defines security as a state where the country and CCP’s interests are “relatively free from danger and internal and external threats.” It requires people and organizations in China to report any evidence that would endanger this state and assist authorities in national security efforts.\n\nA 2015 Anti-Terrorism Law defines terrorism broadly as “propositions and actions that ... coerce state organs or international organizations to achieve their political, ideological, or other objectives” and authorizes state surveillance while requiring all people and organizations in China to assist the CCP in this work.\n\nThe 2016 Cybersecurity Law requires companies operating in China to store data in China and allow full access to such data to CCP authorities, requiring networks to “accept supervision from the government.”\n\nThe 2017 National Intelligence Law gives the CCP the authority to conduct intelligence work through any “necessary methods, means, and channels ” and requires all individuals and organizations in China to cooperate with these operations.\n\nThese laws also contain provisions prohibiting these individuals or organizations from disclosing whether they were required to comply with CCP operations.\n\nPut together, the laws create conditions for ByteDance to be called to secretly share with the CCP data pulled from TikTok while publicly denying this, or even without TikTok’s knowledge.\n\nTikTok did not respond to an inquiry from The Epoch Times.\n\n“Because Chinese laws enable the PRC [People’s Republic of China] to exert control over Chinese companies’ U.S. subsidiaries ... the PRC has and can benefit from those companies’ commercial successes as the Chinese government can leverage its legal regime and other tools to co-opt those companies for geopolitical gain,” stated FBI counterintelligence assistant director Kevin Vomdran in a court filing.\n\nThe law TikTok is now challenging in federal appeals court is a U.S. national security law.\n\nTikTok argues that the law effectively bans the app in the United States, as divestment is not an option because the Chinese regime will not allow ByteDance to sell TikTok.\n\nCommunications attorney Joel Thayer told The Epoch Times that this is not what the law targets and it would indeed violate the First Amendment if it did.\n\n“Even after you divest, if you want to be the arm of the CCP PR campaign, you can do that. You just can’t be tethered to a company that has this many ties to the CCP,” he said. Thayer, president of the Digital Progress Institute, represented two groups that filed separate amicus briefs arguing PAFACA’s constitutionality.\n\nPro-CCP content is probably rather low on the list of national security concerns when it comes to TikTok, Thayer said.\n\n“What the divest law is saying here is, we actually are really worried about the data transmissions that are occurring because of this relationship, and also the ability for these individuals to set their algorithms over in China to essentially not just their point of view, but also conduct espionage campaigns,” Thayer said.\n\n“That is an enormous national security concern, and it’s got nothing to do with whether or not the content is favorable or disfavorable to the American population, to the American government.”\n\nSome critics of the law have argued that most social media platforms collect much of the same data TikTok collects, and the bill does not remedy this. Indeed, PAFACA does not target TikTok’s data collection either, which would require a much more complex law.\n\n“If you shoot a high-definition video, I can do a facial dynamic analysis of you. If you have pictures of your fingers that are at high definition, I can collect your fingerprints,” Steinberg said.\n\nSteinberg says one can’t rule out that spies within American tech and social media companies could help foreign adversaries obtain the same data, or worse, that there are hardware vulnerabilities in popular devices like phones or used by American companies that can collect and do much more than software ever could. He added that the data has value to businesses and foreign adversaries, but it is impossible to say just how valuable it could be.\n\nConsider all that the teens and pre-teens of TikTok document through the app, Steinberg said. Should a foreign government, decades later, have incriminating or exonerating evidence of a high-profile individual, wouldn’t that put them in a position for blackmail?\n\n“Storage is cheap. Storing everything about everybody can be valuable to adversaries,” Steinberg said.\n\nCybersecurity expert Steve McKeon, CEO of Macguyver Tech, told The Epoch Times that he has seen TikTok send data to China. McKeon recalled one job where he helped a company deal with ransomware and found that the malicious software was sending TikTok-collected data to China.\n\nHis associates in Quokka Cybersecurity separately found that TikTok engages in what they call “app collusion,” collecting data where it shouldn’t and sending it to China, as they told members of Congress last year during a risk briefing. App collusion means TikTok obtains data gathered by other apps, which is usually a hallmark of malware.\n\n“We can see where the data is going,” but not what it’s being used for, McKeon said.\n\nMcKeon pointed to federal charges against CCP hackers for intellectual property theft and said with the amount of information the average person overshares online, it’s possible for a malicious actor to impersonate key personnel to deceive perhaps an employee of a targeted company to obtain key information or access—a situation he’s encountered more than once.\n\nMcKeon said that the TikTok app functions very unusually compared to industry best practices, but it’s not necessarily illegal activity because technology moves at a speed far swifter than lawmaking. Plus, software updates mean an app can act maliciously for a period of time before updating to remove evidence of that behavior before it can be proven. Intelligence officials stated similar concerns in court filings in the TikTok lawsuit.\n\n“There’s just a cloud around this app,” McKeon said.\n\nThe suspicious behavior includes the way TikTok contacts networks. Normally, when an app connects to the internet, it reaches out to the closest server.\n\n“TikTok’s not doing that. TikTok’s going halfway around the world to the first target in China,” he said, and there isn’t a particularly good reason to do that. “It’s not going to a couple of different servers and eventually making it there.”\n\nHe added that housing data on American soil doesn’t mean much if personnel in China receive the data before it is even stored, which would explain why TikTok’s final proposal did not persuade the government.\n\nIf the CCP has easy access to this vast dataset, digital surveillance is possible. Because the CCP enforces laws extraterritorially, a CCP-tethered TikTok poses the risk of allowing the regime to track Chinese dissidents and human rights activists whom the regime has vocally declared should be extradited to China for punishment by force if necessary. The FBI and international human rights groups call this “transnational repression.”\n\n“It’s not just a national security issue, it’s a human rights issue,” said Thayer. One of the amicus groups he represented was a coalition of several human rights groups advocating for Uyghurs, Hong Kongers, and Tibetans—groups deeply familiar with the CCP’s digital surveillance and persecution.\n\nRushan Abbas is the founder and executive director of the nonprofit Campaign for Uyghurs, and for this, the CCP has labeled her a “terrorist.” On Sept. 5, 2018, Abbas spoke out about the regime’s persecution of Uyghurs, including 24 members of her husband’s missing family members, at a panel event in the United States.\n\nFive days later, Abbas’s sister, Gulshan Abbas, disappeared. It was only in December 2020 that Abbas received confirmation that her sister had been abducted and detained by the Chinese regime, given a 20-year sentence on charges of terrorism and social disruption.\n\n“I am the target of the CCP’s ongoing harassment, threats, libel, and blackmail, both in-person and online, aimed at discrediting my activism for the Uyghur people suffering genocide,” Abbas told The Epoch Times.\n\nTikTok’s ability to track not just users, but people in their network, creates real safety concerns for human rights activists and their family members who may be in China, Abbas explained.\n\n“TikTok, under the control of the CCP, is legally required to share user data with the Chinese government. This creates a serious risk to our privacy, exposing sensitive information while facilitating the CCP’s transnational repression.”\n\nTikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, also has a record of targeting dissenters.\n\nLast year, former ByteDance executive Yintao “Roger” Yu sued his former employer for damages after allegedly being fired for raising concerns about the company’s intellectual property theft. In court filings, he also alleged that personnel in China had direct access to American data and broad admin powers to influence the apps.\n\n“Under extreme fear, my mother was crying and informed me that my father had been detained,” reads the statement, which was submitted to support Yu’s argument that certain witnesses should have their identities protected from ByteDance. “Based on personal experience, I believe that ByteDance considers employees who speak out against the company’s practices as ‘traitors’ who need to be destroyed at any cost.”\n\nTikTok and its supporters argue that the U.S. government has not provided any proof that it is a bad actor to warrant a divestiture law, but lawmakers argue this misunderstands the role of policymaking.\n\nWe should, instead, be looking for “loaded guns” like companies beholden to the CCP’s national security laws, he said.","summary":"TikTok is currently facing several legal battles, but its fight in a federal appeals court is an existential one.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/tiktok-mired-in-legal-battles-as-deadline-looms-over-ban-5733972","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/14/id5741231-Tiktok-threat-6-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:40:02","author":"Catherine Yang","authors":["Catherine Yang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.454},{"id":259696090,"title":"Glenn Youngkin Humiliates Himself Trying To Cover For Trump","text":"Gov.

It was terrible.”\n\nWhen asked if the Secret Service failed to protect Trump, 78, and rally-goers at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds, Dutch responded: “Big time.”\n\n“The whole security setup was poor,” he added.\n\nCopenhaver agreed with Dutch’s assessment.\n\n“I’m sure there was negligence,” he said. “It wouldn’t have happened, had it been secure.” \n\nLawyers for Dutch and Copenhaver intend to file a lawsuit after they conclude an investigation into the parties potentially responsible for the tragedy. \n\nA Senate probe into the shooting determined last month that would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks’ attempt to kill Trump was “foreseeable” and “preventable” and the result of “failures in planning, communications, security, and allocation of resources” by the Secret Service. \n\nCrooks, 20, had been at the rally site for about 70 minutes on the morning of the assassination attempt.

He also had a phony license plate on his unregistered car that contained a pile of passports and driver’s licenses that listed others’ names, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said.\n\nThose circumstances, as well as possession of a VIP pass that appeared to be fake, led Bianco to conclude that with Miller’s arrest before the rally, “We probably stopped another assassination attempt.”\n\nBianco said he and family members sat about 40 yards from Trump at the rally.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice issued a statement that Trump “was not in any danger,” but the agency could not clarify on Monday, a federal holiday, why officials believed that. Was it because Miller was in handcuffs or was it because the DOJ and Secret Service do not believe that Miller planned to attack Trump?\n\nBianco said Monday that any new insights into Miller’s motives would have to come from federal officials.\n\nMiller on Sunday told the Southern California News Group that he went to the rally to support Trump and not to assassinate him. Miller said he began carrying a Glock handgun and shotgun in his car in 2022 when he began receiving death threats for “peeling back the tyranny” in content on his “America Happens” website.\n\n He said he had a special-access pass to Trump’s Coachella rally from a Republican organization in Clark County, Nevada. No one at the organization could be reached for comment Monday.\n\nIn response to his arrest, Miller on Monday posted an hourlong video to the website, AmericaHappens.com, that took viewers along on his political journey.\n\nMiller said he created the America Happens Network in 2007 in response to “cancel culture 1.0.” The website offers documentaries, podcasts and news that “rage against the mainstream media.”\n\n“I always knew we would go viral in a very big way and some of our episodes have been going viral, but I never thought the most explosive story would involve myself and the false statements that are currently circulating on the internet,” Miller says in the video.\n\nMiller said he does not align himself with any political party “except for one that supports our freedoms, our Constitutional rights, our medical freedoms and gets rid of the tyranny of corrupt politicians that is plaguing our nation. President Donald Trump has been near and dear to our hearts because he is one of the few people to stand up to the tyranny against we the people.”\n\nMiller appeared to further show support for Trump in an online video posted to his website where he listens as political operative Ivan Raiklin discusses a plan to install Trump as the winner of the 2020 presidential election by urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject the Electoral votes from a state – – Arizona — won by Democratic candidate Joe Biden. \n\nIf Pence were to similarly reject votes from other states that Trump lost, Raiklin says, that he would prevent either candidate from receiving the required 270 Electoral votes and place the decision in the hands of the House of Representatives, where the GOP-led House could choose Trump as president.\n\nMiller appears to approve of the scheme.\n\nDifferent circumstances\n\nIn Florida, Ryan Routh was ordered held without bail in September after being arrested on suspicion of weapons violations before he was charged with the attempted assassination of Trump at a golf course, where the Secret Service opened fire on him after spotting him with a rifle. Routh, prosecutors say, wrote a letter that said he wanted to kill Trump.\n\nIn Miller’s case, bail on the misdemeanor weapons accusations against him was only $5,000, and he was released less than four hours after being booked. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\nLaurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor of law at Loyola University School of Law in Los Angeles, said it’s still possible that Miller could face federal charges.\n\nHis immediate release, Levenson said Monday, is “an indication by the feds that he didn’t pose an immediate threat but it’s something worth investigating. I think if you have pretty clear evidence of his intent, it’s easier to hold him. It’s harder to do on the inferences on what his intentions and conduct would be.”\n\nLevenson added: “They are going to keep an eye on him. They are not going to deal with this lightly.”\n\nShe said that the Sheriff’s Department’s priority had to be ensuring Trump’s safety. But she cautioned that overstating the seriousness of what happened Saturday could erode trust in law enforcement.\n\n“It’s not as simple as it appears,” Levenson said. “It could range from an attempted assassination to just someone who has his own opposition to society’s rules.”\n\nUnhappy with government\n\nIn a way, Bianco — like the man his deputies arrested Saturday — also feels disaffected by the government.\n\nThe sheriff has repeatedly flown to the state Capitol to urge lawmakers to toughen penalties on criminals and has repeatedly left frustrated.\n\n“We’re at a culmination of horrible, bad policies that have come out of Sacramento for the last dozen years,” Bianco said in an interview this year with television station KESQ. “Every law they can come up with actually hurts us in our ability to keep our residents safe and quite honestly, I’ve had enough.”\n\nApparently unknown to either person at the time, both Miller and Bianco attended the Oct. 9 premiere in Newport Beach of the movie “Line in the Sand,” which addresses the issue of illegal immigration into the United States. The film, directed by James O’Keefe, is a “bold, first-hand documentation of life on the front lines — riding Mexican freight trains, exploring cartel tunnels, and visiting US-funded child detention camps… a gripping exposé of a corrupted system and demands change,” according to the film website.\n\nBianco said Sunday that he has never met Miller.\n\nBianco’s wife, Denise, wrote in an Instagram post afterward, “My head hurt watching this. … Our Government is failing them, and failing us.”","summary":"Vem Miller posts a video saying he did not plan to assassinate Trump, and in fact supports the ex-president for standing up to 'tyranny.'","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/14/man-arrested-with-weapons-near-trump-rally-in-coachella-doubles-down-on-support-for-ex-president/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RPE-L-MILLER-1015-01-16x9-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:22:21","author":"Brian Rokos","authors":["Brian Rokos"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":259697406,"title":"Lessons from the US election: The growing gender gap — and the surging backlash","text":"Ahead of the US election, the Democrats are trying to pull off the trickiest of political manoeuvres for centre-left parties in the modern populist era: leaning into the surging support from women without triggering a backlash among men.\n\nBut the hardest part is doing it without centrist media outlets exacerbating the response by making it all a “thing”, as they did with Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and in Australia with the Gillard government a decade ago).\n\nIt’s simple electoral maths. Women now lean far more to the left than men and are significantly more likely to vote for center-left and left parties like the Democrats in the US or Labor and the Greens in Australia — by up to 10 percentage points. Men? In a modern retaliation against women’s gains, they’re twisting the other way, counteracting identities like generation, class and race that usually determine how people vote.\n\nSignified and signifiers\n\nIt’s more than votes (or the fact that in both the US and Australia there are just more women voters than men). Women are also more likely to be doing the hard grind of activism on the ground, knocking on doors and getting the vote out.\n\nCentre-left strategists look over their shoulders at examples like South Korea’s 2022 presidential election, where the populist right overtly mobilised incel-style misogyny to split the once reliably progressive youth vote along gender lines. \n\nThink of the Democrat strategy as the balance between the signified and the signifiers: when Vice President Kamala Harris talks policy, she talks (like Labor in Australia) to women about the care economy, domestic violence and abortion (contextualised into women’s health); when she talks symbols, she nods to men by pulling out her Glock (metaphorically speaking, at least).\n\nThe difference showed up in her media blitz last week, when she talked to women on Call Her Daddy and The View, and when she reached out to men (and women) through free-to-air 60 Minutes or to radio host Howard Stern. \n\nMeanwhile, the right-wing media is working hard at pumping the misogyny that’s driving the backlash. “Of course Kamala hates men,” says The American Spectator. “Too Stupid to be President”, reckons The Federalist.\n\nIt’s no surprise that the Murdoch family media is at the heart of it, with Fox News’ prime-time host Jesse Watters smirking Harris would be “paralysed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her”. \n\nIt’s not Rupert anymore. It’s Elon\n\nThe right’s media misogyny teaches us another lesson. Suddenly, it’s not Rupert — and much less Lachlan — who’s pulling the strings.\n\nThose Fox bedtime stories might still work with the network’s carefully nurtured grumpy-old-man demographic. But now, it’s Elon Musk, using the X algorithm and his personal rocket-thrusting image to send the Donald Trump macho vibe resonating through the far more dangerous — and younger — manosphere with the perception of “a permissive environment” for the creation of new accounts that followed “known abusive and misogynistic channels”.\n\nThe platform formerly known as Twitter has become Musk’s loud hailer. “Musk has spent nearly two years installing his own account as X’s main character and shaping the platform’s architecture in his own image. The politics of X are inextricably linked to Musk’s own politics,” as Charlie Warzel wrote head-shakingly in The Atlantic last month. \n\nMusk is also bringing his clout into Australian politics with high-profile attacks on Anthony Albanese.\n\nBut unlike Rupert, Musk is not content with pulling strings behind the scenes. The Republican Party has contracted out its get-out-the-vote strategy to Musk’s America Political Action Commission while Trump has foreshadowed appointing his fellow billionaire as a government efficiency czar.\n\nThe migrant obsession\n\nIt’s not just misogyny: central to the right-wing narrative in both Australia and the US (and across much of Europe) is the obsession with migration. The US campaign exposes the global right’s far more racist campaign against all migrants and migrant communities.\n\nTrump has long centred attacks on migrants in his campaigns, but he’s hurried past the keep-’em-out “build the wall” mantra, this year embracing the ugliest aspects of kick-’em-out race-thinking, threatening mass deportations, including revocation of citizenship and residency.\n\nAustralia’s not there yet, but we’re not far off. From semiotics to slogans, the shocking weekend demonstration in Corowa came straight out of America. The Trumpist attacks on Haitian Americans in Ohio and Venezuelan Americans in Colorado rhymed with 2018’s “African gangs” in western Melbourne. Dutton’s call in August to ban all Palestinian migrants clapped back at Trump’s own Muslim ban. \n\nThe strategy works so well that some emerging left parties in Europe (such as Germany’s Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance) are embracing anti-migrant rhetoric as part of their populist agenda.\n\nIn more “macho posturing” (as Tanya Plibersek recently characterised the current dominant political style in Australia), the Murdoch tabloids and Liberal Party have embraced selective visa cancellation of people they don’t like as a test of strength. The Democrats, like centre-left parties everywhere, are trying to walk both sides, avoiding the subject when they can, leaning into a soft restrictionary rhetoric when they can’t.\n\nWhy is the right so obsessed with migration?

Nonsense.\n\nThere is not a single world in the story to suggest that Trump appointees would be \"loyal\" to Trump. These judges have a constitutional vision that far surpasses whatever ephemeral issues matter to Trump. Judicial appointments can last up to forty years. Trump will be in office for, at most, four years. And if Trump prevails, he will not have to stand for any more elections, thus no more Trump-election-related litigation. More likely than not, anti-Trump litigation will be brought in blue circuits, where Trump-appointees are a discrete and insular minority. Does anyone think that a handful of Trump appointees on the Ninth Circuit will make a difference? Judges Katsas, Rao, and Walker will be flying solo on the D.C. Circuit for some time. And the Fourth Circuit is lost for a generation. I truly do not understand the thrust of this \"loyalist\" meme. It is not accurate, and even if accurate, will have no practical effect.\n\nInstead, the true thrust of the piece comes in a quote from Mike Davis:\n\n Future Trump judicial nominees must be \"even more bold and more conservative and more fearless,\" than those appointed in the first administration, said Republican legal activist Mike Davis, one of the conservative lawyers pushing for a harder line in a potential second Trump administration. \n\nAs I've written \"judicial courage,\" should be an important metric for any future judges. I think any plausible judicial nominee will profess fidelity to textualism and originalism. Or at least they will pretend to. That is a given. The better question is what a judge will do with that jurisprudence. To use an analogy, what quantum of originalist evidence is sufficient to upset the status quo. This is not merely a question about stare decisis. I've written at some length how Justice Barrett has imposed extremely onerous burdens on litigants seeking to change things. And the Barrett mode is common enough on the lower courts. Of course lower court judges cannot reverse Supreme Court precedent. And individual panels cannot reverse circuit precedent. But between those lines, there is some space for lower-court originalism.\n\nThe article goes on to say that conservatives were \"surprised\" by Justice Gorsuch's Bostock majority and Justice Kavanaugh's concurrences.\n\n Some were shocked in 2020, for instance, when Gorsuch, the most libertarian of the Trump three, joined with liberal justices and Chief Justice John Roberts to extend federal civil-rights protections to LGBT employees. Others have expressed exasperation at Kavanaugh's practice of filing concurring opinions that credit the concerns of liberal dissenters even when he votes with the conservative majority—something he did in the 2022 decision eliminating women's federal right to abortion before fetal viability. \n\nNo one should have been surprised by anyone the Trump appointees have done. They are behaving now exactly as they behaved below. To the extent that conservatives are frustrated with these Justices, they should reconsider the criteria for appointment.\n\nThe rest of the article tries to sketch some divide between the \"old guard\" and the \"new guard\" within the Federalist Society.\n\n The movement's old guard, including lawyers who helped found the Federalist Society in the 1980s, is pushing back, fearful of discrediting the conservative principles they worked for decades to legitimize within a legal profession that leaned left. Since losing the 2020 election, Trump has broken with Federalist Society leaders who had eagerly boosted his blitz of judicial appointments during his first term but later balked at his efforts to thwart President Biden's victory and didn't openly support him as he faced dozens of criminal charges. Trump has gravitated to more-combative lawyers outside the conservative legal establishment who have said they want to hobble regulatory agencies and concentrate power in the White House. The shift has sidelined the old guard in favor of groups like America First Legal, run by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who isn't a lawyer but said he set up the group to fight what it called \"an unholy alliance of corrupt special interests, big tech titans, the fake news media and liberal Washington politicians.\" . . . . Longtime Federalist Society members said the group was designed not to advocate for specific positions but to promote conservative and libertarian thought more broadly—and provide a career network for right-leaning lawyers interested in government and the judiciary. \"I'm one of the traditionalists who believe the strength of the Federalist Society is that it doesn't take positions, it allows its members to take positions,\" said former Solicitor General Ted Olson, who took part in the 1982 conference at Yale Law School where the group was founded. . . . Sarah Isgur, who was a spokeswoman for the Trump Justice Department and considers herself more of a traditional conservative, said that while the Federalist Society historically sought to associate its movement with the most prestigious law schools and professional accomplishments, the upstarts have other criteria. \n\nThe direction of FedSoc seems separate from the question about potential Trump nominees. But I do think that FedSoc is standing at something of a turning point, given the pending search for President.","summary":"The Wall Street Journal published an article titled, \"Trump Loyalists Push for a Combative Slate of New Judges.\" The first&#8230;\nThe post The WSJ Story About Future Trump Judicial Nominees appeared first on Reason.com.","url":"https://reason.com/volokh/2024/10/14/the-wsj-story-about-future-trump-judicial-nominees/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:14:26","author":"Christian Britschgi,Josh Blackman","authors":["Christian Britschgi","Josh Blackman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":259695132,"title":"Trump rally shooting survivors blame Secret Service for Butler assassination attempt: ‘100% negligence’ ","text":"The two men seriously injured in the July 13 assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump accused the Secret Service of “negligence” Monday in their first public comments since the rally shooting. \n\nJames Copenhaver, 74, and David Dutch, 57, sustained critical wounds after they were both shot twice at the Butler, Pa., Trump rally, during which a bullet also grazed the former president’s ear. \n\nFirefighter Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed as he shielded his family from the sniper’s shots. \n\n“I believe there was 100% negligence on the Secret Service, probably everybody involved in setting that security, down to inter-department communications,” Dutch told NBC News. “The negligence was vast. It was terrible.”\n\nWhen asked if the Secret Service failed to protect Trump, 78, and rally-goers at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds, Dutch responded: “Big time.”\n\n“The whole security setup was poor,” he added.\n\nCopenhaver agreed with Dutch’s assessment.\n\n“I’m sure there was negligence,” he said. “It wouldn’t have happened, had it been secure.” \n\nLawyers for Dutch and Copenhaver intend to file a lawsuit after they conclude an investigation into the parties potentially responsible for the tragedy. \n\nA Senate probe into the shooting determined last month that would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks’ attempt to kill Trump was “foreseeable” and “preventable” and the result of “failures in planning, communications, security, and allocation of resources” by the Secret Service. \n\nCrooks, 20, had been at the rally site for about 70 minutes on the morning of the assassination attempt. He was able to fly a drone over the fairgrounds before Trump’s arrival and at least eight Secret Service agents were made aware of a “suspicious” person with a rangefinder — later identified as Crooks — nearly a half-hour before the shooting. \n\nDutch told NBC News that during the shooting he was “angry” about the security lapses and that the sniper “tried to shoot the president, shot into a defenseless crowd.”\n\n“I was just angry that the whole situation even happened,” Dutch said. “It should have never happened.”\n\nDutch, who was shot in the liver by Crooks, said the bullet’s impact felt “like getting hit with a sledgehammer right in the chest.”\n\nHe noted that he could see metal and chunks of the bleacher “flying all around” until the shooting ceased.\n\n“It’s a struggle every day,” Dutch said of the ongoing health problems he has as a result of the shooting, which include not being able to drive or lift more than 10 pounds. \n\nCopenhaver, who was shot in the tricep and abdomen, said he knew something was wrong when he saw a piece of his sleeve rip away from his shirt. \n\n“I turned around to my friend, and I said, ‘I think I was shot,’ and that’s when I got the second one and then I went down,” he said. \n\nCopenhaver said he has lost 30 pounds, still occasionally has pain in his abdomen and must walk with a cane since the shooting. \n\nCrooks was shot and killed by a Secret Service agent moments after he opened fire.","summary":"When asked if the Secret Service failed to protect Trump, 78, and rally-goers at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds, David Dutch responded: “Big time.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/us-news/trump-rally-shooting-survivors-blame-secret-service-for-butler-assassination-attempt-100-negligence/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-bjwr5eooh-1728949546065.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728935260&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4OZeFluG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:12:50","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.734},{"id":259695588,"title":"No indication Trump was in danger at Coachella rally, federal official says","text":"No indication Trump was in danger at Coachella rally, federal official says\n Police arrested an armed man outside of former President Donald Trump's event in Coachella, California, on Saturday.

Elissa Slotkin in the 7th Congressional District in Central Michigan. Slotkin, who is running for US Senate, defeated Barrett by 5 points two years ago. House Republicans are eyeing at least two pickup opportunities in Michigan as they look to defend their narrow majority, including the race for Slotkin’s seat, which Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates a Toss-up.\n\nBarrett campaign spokesman Jason Roe called the mistaken election date “nothing but a proofing error.”\n\n“Our campaign has been committed to outreach to the Black community and Black leaders because it is important to Senator Barrett that every community be heard in this election,” Roe said. “The publisher of the Bulletin notified us of the error on Saturday and we’ve provided him with revised art for next week’s issue.”\n\nMarcus Jefferson, the president of the Michigan Bulletin, told CNN that he reached out to Barrett’s team after the issue had been raised to him and the campaign told him they had used an old template that had been used for Michigan’s August 6 primary.\n\nThe ad, which ran in the October 1 edition of the paper, was the first ad that Barrett had run in the Michigan Bulletin, according to Jefferson.\n\n“I’ve been getting it from all sides,” he said about the reaction to the incorrect ad. Jefferson said he’s been telling his readers, “I’m not in the business of misinforming my readership.”\n\nThe campaign pointed to other mailers sent to Black voters that have the correct date for Election Day.\n\nBut Democratic state Sens. Erika Geiss and Sarah Anthony, who filed the complaint on behalf of the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus, said the fact that Barrett’s ad has the correct date in other publications raises even more concerns and that, as of Sunday, it did not appear that the mistake had been corrected with the Michigan Bulletin.\n\n“At best, Tom Barrett and his Campaign have committed a shocking oversight which will undoubtedly lead to confusion by Black voters in Lansing – in part because they still do not appear to have made any attempt to correct the record,” the lawmakers wrote. “And, at worst, this ad could be part of an intentional strategy to ‘deter’ Black voters by deceiving them into showing up to vote on the day after the 2024 election.”\n\nJefferson said he will be printing a new, corrected version of Barrett’s ad in the next edition of the paper on Wednesday. That paper will also feature an ad purchased by Hertel’s campaign.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Michigan attorney general’s office for comment.\n\nSlotkin defeated Barrett to win the central Michigan district by just 5 points in 2022.\n\nRepublicans in Michigan have been making appeals to minority groups, including Black voters, in an effort to cut into margins among communities that typically comprise the Democratic base.\n\nBarrett has been meeting with Black community leaders in the Lansing area, and former President Donald Trump attended a roundtable at a Black church in Detroit in June.\n\nThe Michigan GOP also ran a radio ad last month featuring Detroit’s former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, whose sentence for federal criminal charges was commuted by Trump as one of his last acts in office.\n\nKilpatrick endorsed Trump earlier this year and talks about supporting the former president in the ad in the interest of “the survival of our nation.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year — with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters — even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Harris campaign’s path to win Pennsylvania capitalizes on Trump’s unprecedented weakness in the suburbs,” reads the memo, which also highlighted the campaign’s focus on Haley voters. “We have flipped the suburbs from red to blue since Trump won them in 2020, and we have also grown our support with women and tripled our support among white college educated voters in the state.”\n\nThe campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs — a notable improvement from Trump’s 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.)\n\nRecent surveys have found the overall race in Pennsylvania to be within the margin of error for polls, with a survey from Quinnipiac University this month finding Harris up 3 points, an Inquirer/Times/Siena survey finding her up 4 points and The Wall Street Journal having Trump up 1 point.\n\nIt’s the most sought-after battleground on the map, offering the most Electoral College votes among the hotly contested states, and it is the most frequent campaign destination for both Harris and Trump.\n\nTrump’s “weakness in the suburbs means that for him to actually win, he has to double and triple down on his base in the reddest counties in the state,” said Brendan McPhillips, a senior adviser to Harris’ Pennsylvania campaign. “And so we are going on offense and going to places where he thinks he has a strength and competing.”\n\nThe campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to “cut margins and stop Trump’s only hope of victory,” noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020.\n\nRecent presidential elections in Pennsylvania have been exceptionally close. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just over 1 point. In 2016, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by an even slimmer margin.\n\n“With most polls showing this to be a margin of error race, we are also going on offense with rural voters to cut into Trump’s margins — a critical advantage as Trump’s team lacks the ground game capacity to conduct persuasion and mobilization campaigns simultaneously,” the Harris campaign memo reads.\n\nMcPhillips said improving on Biden’s margins in those counties by just 1 to 2 points would effectively cut off Trump’s path to flipping the state red.\n\n“We’re eating into his margins in a way that cannot sustain a victory,” he said. “And that is how we’re going to beat him, and it’s how we’re able to play offense on so many fronts.”\n\nThe campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members.\n\nHarris has so far spent far more time in the western part of the state, including rural areas, than she has in the Philadelphia market, which McPhillips said is partly to help introduce her to voters who may be less familiar with her.\n\nFor Trump, billionaire mogul Elon Musk ramped up his political engagement in the state this month through his America PAC, which is working to turn out the vote for Trump.\n\nMcPhillips dismissed the potential impact of that effort.\n\n“They can’t scale up to the level that we’re at,” he said. “Even with Elon Musk’s money, you can’t spend enough money to scale up an operation to match ours. It’s too late. You needed to start in March, February, January, and they’ve just been phoning it in for so long. It’s going to be close, for sure. We’ve always been planning for it to be so. But that planning manifests itself in the fact that we actually had a plan, not a concept of one.”\n\nThe Trump campaign said the Harris campaign is papering over a problem it faces in Pennsylvania cities — particularly Philadelphia, the most vote-rich locale for Democrats in the state.\n\n“They can point to the suburbs, but they’re losing ground in places like Philadelphia,” a Trump campaign official said. “It’s exactly why [former President Barack] Obama was just pleading to African American men to vote for her. They’ve sounded the alarms, and they know they’re losing.”\n\nThe Trump campaign also pointed to Republicans’ having significantly cut into the Democratic voter registration advantage in the state while flipping Bucks, Luzerne and Beaver counties to Republican registration edges. It further highlighted reports that working-class voters in Philadelphia have embraced Trump.\n\nKush Desai, the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania spokesperson, highlighted Obama’s visit as a sign the Harris team was scrambling. “An Obama visit isn’t going to convince Pennsylvanians to vote for another four years of open borders, rising prices, and disaster at home and abroad,” Desai said in a statement.\n\nIn its memo, the Harris campaign said it believes it will be able to “at least match” Biden’s support in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in his victory in those cities four years ago. It went into greater detail about its efforts to reach Black voters in the state, including the staff members it has dedicated to outreach and engagement and its events focused on Black voters.\n\nLast week, Obama offered unscripted remarks during a Pittsburgh campaign stop in which he said his understanding of the race is that “we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. … [T]hat seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.”\n\nSeeking to speak directly to Black men, he pushed for undecideds to get behind Harris, saying her record deserves their support.\n\n“This is excellence on display, and it needs to be rewarded,” Obama said.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Hughes told NBC News he could “understand the frustration” Obama expressed.\n\n“Maybe the tone should have been a little bit different,” he said. “But let’s be real clear about this. Let’s get to the substance of what he said. There’s nothing in Donald Trump’s background, career, anything that should lead any citizen, let alone Black men, to vote for him. He’s not a successful businessman. … He was sued for discrimination in housing.”\n\nHughes said the Harris campaign is going to hit its targets among both Black men and voters in Philadelphia, adding that he has seen a flood of campaign activity there recently that has outpaced what Democrats were doing in 2020 during the worst of the Covid pandemic.\n\n“It’s going in the right way for the vice president,” he said. “Look, for a woman and for a Black woman, it’s always harder. It’s not fair, it’s not right, but it’s always harder. Maybe if we break through with this election, we can finally smash that glass ceiling and not make it so hard for the next one.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris identifies suburbs in Pennsylvania as key to winning strategy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-identifies-suburbs-in-pennsylvania-as-key-to-winning-strategy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-sees-path-to-victory-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 00:03:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259696446,"title":"Trump aims to expand domestic military use if reelected","text":"During his first term as president, Donald Trump tested the limits of how he could use the military to achieve policy goals. If given a second term, the Republican and his allies are preparing to go much further, reimagining the military as an all-powerful tool to deploy on U.S. soil.\n\nHe has pledged to recall thousands of American troops from overseas and station them at the U.S. border with Mexico. He has explored using troops for domestic policy priorities such as deportations and confronting civil unrest. He has talked of weeding out military officers who are ideologically opposed to him.\n\nTrump's vision amounts to a potentially dramatic shift in the role of the military in U.S. society, carrying grave implications for both the country's place in the world and the restraints that have traditionally been placed on domestic use of the military.\n\nAs Trump’s campaign heads into its final stretch against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, he is promising forceful action against immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. Speaking in Colorado on Friday, the Republican described the city of Aurora as a “war zone” controlled by Venezuelan gangs, even though authorities say that was a single block of the Denver suburb, and the area is safe again.\n\n“I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump said at the rally. “We will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country.”\n\nIn an interview aired on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked about the potential of “outside agitators” disrupting Election Day and he pivoted to what he called “the enemy from within.”\n\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump said. He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the phrase “enemy from within” in recent speeches. On Saturday, he used it to refer to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a prominent Trump critic who oversaw the congressional investigation that led to Trump's first impeachment. Schiff is now running for the Senate.\n\nThe former president and his advisers are developing plans to shift the military’s priorities and resources, even at a time when wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East. Trump’s top priority in his platform, known as Agenda 47, is to implement hardline measures at the U.S.-Mexico border by “moving thousands of troops currently stationed overseas” to that border. He is also pledging to “declare war” on cartels and deploy the Navy in a blockade that would board and inspect ships for fentanyl.\n\nTrump also has said he will use the National Guard and possibly the military as part of the operation to deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign declined to discuss the details of those plans, including how many troops he would shift from overseas assignments to the border, his allies are not shy about casting the operation as a sweeping mission that would use the most powerful tools of the federal government in new and dramatic ways.\n\n“There could be an alliance of the Justice Department, Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Those three departments have to be coordinated in a way that maybe has never been done before,” said Ron Vitiello, who worked as the acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement under Trump.\n\nWhile both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations have long used military resources at the border, the plans would be a striking escalation of the military’s involvement in domestic policy.\n\nAdvocates for human rights and civil liberties have grown alarmed.\n\n“They are promising to use the military to do mass raids of American families at a scale that harkens back to some of the worst things our country has done,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.\n\nIn Congress, which has the power to restrict the use of military force through funding and other authorizations, Republicans are largely on board with Trump's plans.\n\n“The reason I support Donald Trump is he will secure the border on Day 1. Now that could be misinterpreted as being a dictator. No, he’s got to secure the border,” said Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nMany Republicans argue that Trump’s rhetoric on immigration reflects reality and points to the need for military action.\n\n“There is a case that this is an invasion,” said North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “You look at 10 million people, many of which are not here for a better future, and, unfortunately, it’s made it necessary.

If given a second term, the Republican and his allies are preparing to go much further, reimagining the military as an all-powerful tool to deploy on U.S. soil.\n\nHe has pledged to recall thousands of American troops from overseas and station them at the U.S. border with Mexico. He has explored using troops for domestic policy priorities such as deportations and confronting civil unrest. He has talked of weeding out military officers who are ideologically opposed to him.\n\nTrump's vision amounts to a potentially dramatic shift in the role of the military in U.S. society, carrying grave implications for both the country's place in the world and the restraints that have traditionally been placed on domestic use of the military.\n\nAs Trump’s campaign heads into its final stretch against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, he is promising forceful action against immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. Speaking in Colorado on Friday, the Republican described the city of Aurora as a “war zone” controlled by Venezuelan gangs, even though authorities say that was a single block of the Denver suburb, and the area is safe again.\n\n“I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump said at the rally. “We will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country.”\n\nIn an interview aired on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked about the potential of “outside agitators” disrupting Election Day and he pivoted to what he called “the enemy from within.”\n\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump said. He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly invoked the phrase “enemy from within” in recent speeches. On Saturday, he used it to refer to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a prominent Trump critic who oversaw the congressional investigation that led to Trump's first impeachment. Schiff is now running for the Senate.\n\nThe former president and his advisers are developing plans to shift the military’s priorities and resources, even at a time when wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East. Trump’s top priority in his platform, known as Agenda 47, is to implement hardline measures at the U.S.-Mexico border by “moving thousands of troops currently stationed overseas” to that border. He is also pledging to “declare war” on cartels and deploy the Navy in a blockade that would board and inspect ships for fentanyl.\n\nTrump also has said he will use the National Guard and possibly the military as part of the operation to deport millions of immigrants who do not have permanent legal status.\n\nWhile Trump’s campaign declined to discuss the details of those plans, including how many troops he would shift from overseas assignments to the border, his allies are not shy about casting the operation as a sweeping mission that would use the most powerful tools of the federal government in new and dramatic ways.\n\n“There could be an alliance of the Justice Department, Homeland Security and the Department of Defense. Those three departments have to be coordinated in a way that maybe has never been done before,” said Ron Vitiello, who worked as the acting director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement under Trump.\n\nWhile both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations have long used military resources at the border, the plans would be a striking escalation of the military’s involvement in domestic policy.\n\nAdvocates for human rights and civil liberties have grown alarmed.\n\n“They are promising to use the military to do mass raids of American families at a scale that harkens back to some of the worst things our country has done,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.\n\nIn Congress, which has the power to restrict the use of military force through funding and other authorizations, Republicans are largely on board with Trump's plans.\n\n“The reason I support Donald Trump is he will secure the border on Day 1. Now that could be misinterpreted as being a dictator. No, he’s got to secure the border,” said Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., a member of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nMany Republicans argue that Trump’s rhetoric on immigration reflects reality and points to the need for military action.\n\n“There is a case that this is an invasion,” said North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “You look at 10 million people, many of which are not here for a better future, and, unfortunately, it’s made it necessary. This is a problem that the Biden administration and Harris administration have created.”\n\nStill, Trump’s plans to move military assets from abroad could further inflame tension within the GOP between those hawkish on foreign policy and Republicans who promote Trump’s brand of “America First” isolationism.\n\nRepublican Rep.

He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016. But Joe Biden, a Scranton native, beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.\n\nHarris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.\n\nHarris, 59, in the rally speech will also criticize Trump for only releasing limited information about his health over the years, according to the campaign official.\n\nThe White House on Saturday released a letter from Harris’ doctor that summarizes her medical history declaring the vice president is in “excellent health” and “possesses the physical and mental resiliency” required to be president.\n\nIf Trump, who is 78, were to be elected next month, he would be the oldest president in U.S. history by the time his term ends in 2029.\n\nHarris also plans to talk up early voting during her rally. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race.\n\nBeforehand, she stopped by a newly opened coffee shop and record store in Erie as she continues to press her case for Black men’s support.\n\nThe visit to LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, came after her campaign unveiled a plan earlier Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances. The campaign is trying to step up outreach to Black men, a key voting bloc that has some Democrats concerned about a possible lack of enthusiasm.\n\nTrump spoke at a town hall Monday in suburban Oaks. Responding to a man who said his dream of homeownership feels out of reach, Trump said regulations make it too expensive to build in some places. He repeated his pledge to increase U.S. oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs, though domestic production is already at record highs.\n\n“We’re going to drill baby drill, we’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down,” Trump said.\n\nHe also claimed that government data from crime statistics to jobless numbers is “fake,” alleging the numbers are manipulated to help the incumbent Democrats.\n\nTom Bonanno, who was waiting in line and said he lived in the area, said he believed there was greater enthusiasm for Trump this year than in the former president’s two previous campaigns.\n\n”I’m feeling a shift because the economy affects everyone,” Bonanno said. “It’s not just going to be on, you’re feeling joy or happiness or whatever they’re running on. It’s about the economy once again.”\n\nPennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events.\n\nMichigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nDemocrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s legislature is closely divided.\n\nCindy Sunday, 67, of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, said she has been disappointed that the Biden administration undid some of Trump’s policies on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“I don’t care that people say ‘he says things that are off color, and this and that.’ Get over that,” said Sunday, who went to Trump’s rally in Oaks. “There are so many more serious things in life to be upset about. I just don’t go for that.”\n\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Associated Press journalists Tassanee Vejpongsa in Oaks, Pennsylvania, Aamer Madhani in Washington and Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report.","summary":"Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular appearances in what is the country’s largest battleground state.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/14/harris-and-trump-campaign-in-battleground-pennsylvania/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_Harris_56564.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:57:40","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":259694862,"title":"Experts call for a Nato bank to 'Trump-proof' military spending","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nunder the radar\n\nExperts call for a Nato bank to 'Trump-proof' military spending\n\nA new lender could aid co-operation between Western allies and save them millions of pounds\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nMark Rutte, the new Nato secretary-general and former prime minister of the Netherlands, outside 10 Downing Street in early October\n\n(Image credit: Dan Kitwood / Getty Images)\n\nBy Chas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK\n published 14 October 2024 \n\nEurope and Ukraine should \"Trump-proof\" their military spending by setting up a \"Nato bank\", according to a report by a German and UK think tank.\n\nAs the White House election looms, there is concern over how a Donald Trump presidency could affect defence spending in Europe. The report asks leaders to \"actively consider\" urgent measures, including a Nato bank, said The Guardian.\nTrump trepidations\n\nThe authors of the joint report said that if Trump wins next month, he could quickly slash US defence spending in Europe, push for a peace deal in Ukraine that surrenders parts of its territory to Russia, and might even withdraw from Nato altogether.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

With that in mind, Europe must \"practically and pre-emptively bolster European defence, security and resilience\" against a second-term Trump presidency.\n\nTo do that, Nato countries should support the creation of an allied multilateral lending institution, or a Nato bank, said the think tanks. The bank would be funded with \"initial subscriptions from Nato members in return for authorised capital stock\".\nA Nato bank could \"save nations millions on essential equipment purchases, offer low interest rates on loans to alliance members and introduce a new line of financing with longer repayment timeframes\", it said.\nSaving millions\nThis isn't the first time a Nato bank has been proposed. Writing for the Financial Times last April, Robert Murray, a former head of innovation at Nato, argued that the alliance's \"current strategy of pleading and arm-twisting allies to spend more is painfully inadequate\". An \"Allied Multilateral Lending Institution – in other words, a Nato Bank\" – could be a \"game-changer\".\nWhen Murray floated the idea of a \"feasible model\" in 2019, he suggested that the bank could \"generate additional resources through interest earned on paid-in subscription capital\", and he \"conservatively modelled\" the bank's balance sheet at about $300 billion.\nBut Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has told the international community to \"stop worrying about a Trump presidency\" and its implications for the war in Ukraine. Speaking during a visit to London, he insisted he is \"absolutely convinced\" that the US is involved in the conflict \"because they understand\" that \"the whole of the US would be less secure if Putin would be successful in Ukraine\".\nRutte's comments \"could raise eyebrows in some European capitals\", said Politico. Trump has recently criticised Washington's involvement in the war in Ukraine, saying the country is \"stuck\" and will be able to \"get out\" if he wins the election, said Kyiv Independent.\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\n\nVladimir Putin\n\n To continue reading this article...\n\nCreate a free account \n Continue reading this article and get limited website access each month. \n\nregister for free\n Already have an account?

Throughout the election, key voting blocs like female, Black, Hispanic and Latino voters have been focused on, but Griffin said one demographic has been overlooked.\"I want to note a specific demographic that is not convinced is properly measuring in polls and could actually end up benefiting Donald Trump, which is young white male voters who are first-time voters,\" Griffin said. \"He has been targeting these folks on podcasts—call them the Joe Rogan, the Barstool Sports voters. Those are people we may not actually be seeing turn out in some of these polls, who are gonna show up for the first time for Donald Trump, so nobody should be resting easy right now.\"Newsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment Monday evening.Griffin is a CNN political commentator and a co-host on ABC's The View. She served as the White House director of strategic communications in 2020, following several communication roles during the Trump presidency, but she left weeks after Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. She has emerged as a Trump critic and testified before the House select committee tasked with investigating the events on and leading up to the January 6 Capitol riot and Trump's alleged involvement in it.A new Pew Research Center poll of registered U.S. voters breaks down voter preferences based on categories of demographics like gender, race and ethnicity and age.The poll, conducted from September 30 to October 6, found that men are more likely to favor Trump than Harris (51 to 43 percent), while women tend to favor Harris (52 to 43 percent). But Harris does better with younger voters. Poll respondents aged 18 to 29 tend to prefer Harris to Trump (57 to 34 percent). On the other hand, white voters are more likely to favor Trump than Harris (55 to 41 percent). Harris does better with Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in the survey.Harris has tried to expand her reach in the past few weeks with a media blitz after being criticized for her lack of interaction with the press. She has appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The View, Howard Stern's radio show, podcasts such as Call Her Daddy and The Shade Room, local media outlets in swing states and CBS News' 60 Minutes.On Wednesday evening, she will sit down with Fox News' Bret Baier where she will reach a more conservative audience base than she's used to.\"Alyssa, what do you think of Harris sitting down with Fox for an interview in Pennslyvania?\" Tapper asked Griffin on Monday.She replied: \"I think it's smart. I think she's going where the voters are. I probably would've advised her to do it a month ago.\"\"Listen, there are reachable voters at Fox News and what she needs to show up and do is make people who've been fed a steady diet of '[Kamala's] unintelligent, she's not serious enough to be president, she couldn't stare down [Russian President] Vladimir Putin'—the lines that they've been hearing from Donald Trump and his allies. And she needs to show up and give a performance like she did in the debate that showed she's prepared, she has command of the issues,\" Griffin said.","summary":"Alyssa Farah Griffin warned on CNN Monday of a group of voters that could help Trump win this year's presidential race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alyssa-farah-griffin-donald-trump-white-young-male-voters-1968966","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495171/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:40:34","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":259693508,"title":"Veterans don’t buy the media’s anti-Trump narrative — and Harris pays the price","text":"Kamala Harris has a problem with veterans.\n\nThey overwhelmingly support her opponent — favoring Donald Trump by a lopsided 61% to 37%, according to the latest Pew Research Center survey.\n\nFor years, civilians have been sold a narrative that just isn’t true.\n\nDemocrats and liberals in the media invested heavily in trying to portray Trump as a leader at odds with America’s men and women in uniform.\n\nBut veterans themselves never bought the story — they’ve been one of the Republican’s most steadfast constituencies.\n\nTrump won about six out of 10 veterans in each of the past two presidential elections, and he’s on track to match that performance this year.\n\nVeterans like JD Vance better than Tim Walz, too.\n\nBoth vice-presidential contenders are veterans themselves, though Harris’ running mate has been criticized by men who served alongside him in the National Guard, who say Walz lied about his rank and exited the service just in time to avoid being sent to war in Iraq.\n\nWhile Walz does well with civilians, Pew’s poll of veterans finds they prefer the ex-Marine on Trump’s ticket: 53% of vets view Vance favorably, while only 34% have a positive impression of Walz.\n\nThe Pew study suggests veteran discontent with Vice President Harris isn’t simply the result of a partisan tilt toward the GOP among vets.\n\nOverall, less than a quarter of those polled — 23% — say Harris would make things better for veterans if she became president, compared to 55% who say Trump would do so.\n\nEven among veterans who support Harris, 33% say she won’t make much difference either way if she wins the White House, and 5% say she’d actually make things worse.\n\nTrump’s supporters, on the other hand, have little doubt — 83% of those backing him say he’d make things better for vets.\n\nWhenever a high-profile general disparages Trump, as former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley recently did in Bob Woodward’s book “War,” his opinion makes headlines.\n\nThe sentiments of ordinary soldiers and veterans get much less attention.\n\nThere’s a cultural gulf between these sides: Politically vocal generals and the national-security officials who sign their names to open letters supporting Harris for president are Washington insiders — creatures of “the Swamp.”\n\nTheir perspectives and interests aren’t those of the regular servicemember or vet.\n\nWhen Milley, now retired, trashes Trump using standard Democratic campaign rhetoric —“now I realize he’s a total fascist,” he told Woodward — he’s speaking the language of his clique.\n\nIt’s also the language of his bank account.\n\nSince leaving the Army, Milley has been making a mint as a consultant and a lecturer on the high-end circuit: “He is represented by the same high-powered speakers’ agency as Hillary Clinton,” notes Ken Klippenstein at The Intercept.\n\nKlippenstein was recently banned from X — the social media site formerly known as Twitter — for sharing hacked information about the Republican ticket: He can’t be suspected of any sympathy for Trump when he exposes Milley’s “cashing in.”\n\nThe kind of institutions that pay top dollar for Hillary Clinton don’t expect to hear anything different from a speaker like Gen. Milley, and he knows it.\n\nIf veterans are a bedrock of Trump’s support, swamp things like Milley are a core constituency for Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is running against them as much as against her, and veterans are well aware of it — yet they’re with Trump, not the Swamp.\n\nThe top brass long misled America about the war in Afghanistan, which they insisted we were winning, and it was the troops who paid the price.\n\nThe fact that Harris has the backing of Washington’s foreign-policy establishment is for many voters a compelling reason to reject her.\n\nVoters across the swing states trust Trump over Harris in matters of war and peace.\n\nFully 50% of those voters say Trump is better suited to handle the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with only 39% expressing more confidence in Harris, according to polling by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump holds an even bigger lead when it comes to which candidate battleground voters trust to handle the Israel-Hamas war: 48% say Trump, just 33% say Harris.\n\nEvery year the Biden-Harris administration has delivered a foreign-policy disaster — the lethally botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Hamas massacre of more than a thousand Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023 and the extension of the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East throughout 2024.\n\nNo wonder voters in the states most likely to decide the election want Trump’s foreign policy, not more of what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have given us these last four years.\n\nVeterans, in particular, know the cost of failed leadership.\n\nThey’ve paid it before — and if Harris wins, their brothers and sisters in arms will pay it again.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.","summary":"Democrats have invested heavily in trying to portray Trump as a leader at odds with America’s men and women in uniform — but veterans themselves never bought the story.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/14/opinion/veterans-reject-medias-anti-trump-narrative-to-harris-cost/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-by33tg7u4-1728947350745.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1728933072&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:39:46","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":259693472,"title":"Unpaid Bills: Minnesota City Claims Trump Campaign Owes Over $200,000 for July Rally","text":"ST.

Nevertheless, the Democrats are aiming to bolster support among Black voters, as seen with former President Barack Obama’s passionate speech on Friday.\n\n Among younger voters aged 18 to 34, Ms Harris leads with 58 per cent to Mr Trump’s 37 per cent. She also enjoys stronger support from white voters with college degrees, leading Mr Trump 55 per cent to 41 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump is dominating among rural voters, claiming 72 per cent of their support to Ms Harris’s 23 per cent. He also leads among white voters overall and white voters without tertiary degrees.\n\nAnother significant divide in the poll is along gender lines. 55 per cent of women are backing Ms Harris, while 56 per cent of men support Mr Trump.\n\nAccording to US outlet The Hill, Ms Harris holds a narrow 2.9-point lead nationally, based on aggregated polling data.\n\nThe NBC News poll, conducted from Oct. 4-8, surveyed 1,000 voters and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nRealClear polling, meanwhile, has Ms Harris at 49 per cent to Mr Trump’s 47.3 per cent, marking a 1.3 per cent gap.\n\nAs always, polling can only get you so far and the real indication of America’s intentions will only reveal themselves on November 5.\n\nChaos has already been sowed in the months leading up to the election. Multiple assassination attempts on Mr Trump’s life have spurred his follower base on, while Ms Harris’ taking over from President Biden in the race has whisked up some much-needed interest from the left. \n\nTo make matters more tense, intentionally-divisive foreign actors are reportedly muddy the water with a slew of disinformation campaigns online, aiming to whittle away at American resolve and encourage conspiracies about an allegedly fraudulent voting system.\n\nObama backs Harris, smashes Trump\n\nFormer President Barack Obama unleashed sharpest critique yet of Mr Trump, accusing the former president of manipulating the public during moments of crisis.\n\nSpeaking to a packed crowd in Pittsburgh, Mr Obama condemned Mr Trump’s misleading statements regarding the government’s aid response to hurricane-hit areas, among several other criticisms aimed at the 78-year-old.\n\nMr Obama has implored Americans to get behind Ms Harris as the November 5 election looms, telling voters that their decision should be made on the “character” of the candidate as much as their proposed policies.\n\n“The idea of intentionally trying to deceive people in their most desperate and vulnerable moments – my question is, when did that become OK?” Mr Obama asked, referencing Mr Trump’s claims that aid was being withheld from Republican areas or diverted to undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut when the crowd cheered, Mr Obama cut them off.\n\n“I’m not looking for applause right now,” he said.\n\nTaking the opportunity to bolster Harris’ presidential campaign, Mr Obama urged voters to get out and vote.\n\n“Whether this election is making you feel excited or scared … do not just sit back and hope for the best. Get off your couch and vote,” he said.\n\nThroughout his impassioned speech, Mr Obama criticised Mr Trump’s policies, especially his handling of the economy, calling the Republican candidate’s economic success claims “ahistorical nonsense”.\n\n“Yeah, it was pretty good when Trump took office in 2017 – because it was my economy,” Mr Obama said, reminding voters that he had spent eight years cleaning up the financial mess left behind by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn a particularly pointed moment, Mr Obama called out Mr Trump’s constant blaming of immigrants for problems in the US, describing his promises to address the issue as “outrageously false or dangerously simple.”\n\nAddressing black male voters, a group that has shown lukewarm support for Mr Harris since she replaced President Biden in the race, Mr Obama urged them to rethink sitting out the election.\n\n“You’re thinking about sitting out… because you think that’s a sign of strength, because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down? That’s not acceptable,” Mr Obama said.\n\nNo group of voters is attracting more attention from the campaigns than the tiny sliver of the electorate that is still undecided.\n\nWhile many people long ago made up their mind between Mr Trump and Ms Harris, a small percentage of the population is still grappling with their choice.\n\nThey will ultimately be the ones that decide the next president of the United States.","summary":"New polls have shown a mighty resurgence for Donald Trump, with analysts still completely in the dark about what the White House will look like in 2025.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/us-election-new-polls-show-donald-trump-resurgence-as-kamala-harris-takes-a-dip/news-story/b954097844ba855eeae66ddfa43718e6?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/af01dc69f77adbb5edaf098661eb6e60","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:28:25","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":259693880,"title":"Trump Is Big Mad That Fox News Is Interviewing Harris","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, increasingly prone to temper tantrums and outbursts of violent rhetoric as the election nears, railed against his former stomping grounds, Fox News, after the network announced that his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, had agreed to an interview.\n\n While Trump himself has been ducking out of any opportunity to answer hard questions, including a second debate with Harris (he resoundingly lost the first one) and a 60 Minutes interview with CBS, he has spent much of his time and energy hyperfocused on fear-mongering about immigration, repeating his desire to be a “dictator,” and insulting Harris over the amount of media attention she has been getting. Harris, meanwhile, has taken numerous opportunities to speak on a variety of different platforms including interviews with radio host Howard Stern, 60 Minutes, the popular Call Her Daddy podcast hosted by Alex Cooper, and the upcoming Fox News interview with chief political anchor Bret Baier.\n\n Trump raged against Harris, Baier, and the conservative network on social media Monday, and lamented, “Kamala Harris has wisely chosen Bret Baier, of FoxNews, to do a much needed interview, because he is considered to be ‘Fair & Balanced,’ though often very soft to those on the ‘cocktail circuit’ Left.” The former president accused Fox of becoming “so weak and soft on the Democrats, constantly polluting the airwaves with unopposed Kamala Representatives, that it all doesn’t matter anymore.”\n\n Despite Trump’s bitter sentiments about the network, he appeared on Fox News on Sunday for an interview with Maria Bartiromo during which she gave him free rein to spout baseless lies and failed to follow up with him when Trump floated using military forces against U.S. citizens who oppose him on Election Day. Unsurprisingly, Trump praised the Fox host for doing a “beautiful job,” while berating “one-sided, negative Democrats” for calling out his fascist plan.\n\n Harris is set to sit down with Baier on Fox News Wednesday in Pennsylvania during the host’s Special Report at 6 p.m. ET. This will be the Democratic presidential candidate’s first formal interview on the network.\n\n Baier previously interviewed Trump in 2023, during which he asked the former president about his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House. During the televised sit-down, Trump essentially confessed to stealing and sharing top-secret government information post-presidency. Trump’s Fox appearance at the time came a week after he was arrested and arraigned on criminal charges in the federal probe over his hoarding of the classified material.","summary":"After the network announced that the vice president would sit down for an interview, Trump raged on social media","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-mad-fox-news-harris-interview-1235133638/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kamala-harris-fox-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:27:24","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.139},{"id":259693484,"title":"'I’m literally reading his quotes!'

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Poppy Atkinson Gibson \n Published:00:14 BST, 15 October 2024 |Updated:00:19 BST, 15 October 2024 \n\nBBC bosses are thought to have reprimanded Strictly Come Dancing stars Katya Evans and Wynne Evans over the fallout from an apparently awkward exchange during Saturday's live show. \nThe broadcasting giant had originally claimed they would not pursue the incident, during which Jones appeared to frostily push her dance partner away - understood to be the result of an unexplained 'in-joke' between the pair. \nBut BBC insiders were privately dismayed by the backlash and hauled them in to explain the incident, The Sun reports. \nA Strictly source told the publication: 'If it was a joke, then Katya really should know better.\n'She has been on Strictly long enough to know how scandals can affect the show and, let’s face it, she been at the centre of them too.'\n\nBBC bosses have reportedly reprimanded Strictly Come Dancing's Katya Evans and Wynne Evans after the pair's awkward exchange on Saturday night\n\nThe broadcaster hauled the duo in to discuss the viral social media moment in an attempt to draw a line under the issue \nA source previously told MailOnline: 'Wynne and Katya have confirmed that their interactions in the Clauditorium were silly jokes they had planned together and have apologised to anyone who may have misinterpreted them. \n'They addressed them on Wynne's Instagram, where their apology can be found. Katya would like to clarify further that she was not offended by Wynne and was not made to feel uncomfortable in the least – she has also clarified on her Instagram. \n'The welfare and production teams have checked in on the pair and there are no further actions planned.'\nThis revelation comes as Katya defended her celebrity partner Wynne Evans declaring he has been ‘portrayed as someone he is not’ on Monday's Strictly: It Takes Two. \nHer emotional defence of the opera singer comes after their appearance on the fourth live show on Saturday, when viewers spotted a toe-curling interaction between Evans, 52, and Jones, 35, as she moved his hand away from her waist and snubbed his attempt at a high-five with her.\nOn Monday evening, the duo appeared emotional as they gave a joint interview on Strictly spin off show It Takes Two.\nEvans, who earlier in the day had said he was ‘heartbroken’, admitted he had watched the footage of the incident back and confessed: ‘I can see how people may have misinterpreted it.’\nClinging to his arm, Jones said she ‘can’t bear’ the flack her co-star is getting and was empathetic that there was no wrongdoing.\n\nThis revelation comes as Katya defended her celebrity partner Wynne Evans declaring he has been ‘portrayed as someone he is not’ in response to a toe-curling incident on Saturday\n\nThe professional dancer doubled down on her claims that their awkward Strictly Come Dancing exchange was an inside joke and added that fan reaction had 'overshadowed' their live performance\nShe said: ‘The idea that it made me feel uncomfortable or offended in any way is total nonsense, and those that have doubts, you guys have got it wrong. So hopefully this will be the end of it, and you just keep making me smile.’\nShe added: ‘I can't sit here watching this man being portrayed as someone he's not. In fact, it couldn't be further away from the truth. \n'So I have to make this absolutely clear that this whole incident, with the hand and the high five on Saturday night, was an inside joke between Wynne and I. Was it a silly joke? Yes, was it a bad joke? Yes.’\nThe incident caused such concern among BBC top brass, who have spent months firefighting accusations of misconduct on previous series, that a welfare investigation was conducted.\nA source said: ‘The Strictly welfare team checked in on the pair individually to confirm that nothing was awry and that both were comfortable continuing with the partnership.\n‘Training room researchers have kept meticulous logs of what goes on during rehearsals between every celebrity couple, and Wynne and Katya are no different.’\n‘If there had been any form of misbehaviour or cause for concern, then it would have been flagged by the welfare team.\n‘There hasn’t been and they consider the matter closed.’\n\nKatya and Wynne both admitted that their 'inside joke' had been silly but refused the idea that there was anything amiss between them\n\nWynne explained that having watched the footage he could understand how fans of the show may have concluded something was wrong between the pair\nThe BBC confirmed that no further actions are planned.\nEvans, who has starred in the GoCompare adverts for over a decade, claims that he has been left ‘heartbroken’ by the fallout after some Strictly fans called for him to be axed from the show.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Wales, where he presents a daily show, Mr Evans said: ‘I’m absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day.\nHe said: 'I'm absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day. \nThe duo had become surprise favourites to win this year’s Strictly, scoring 34 out of 40 from the judges for their tango on Saturday.\n'It's not nice to live in that time, but basically Katya and I are really, really close and we're really good friends, and on Saturday night we made a stupid joke. \n'It was a stupid joke that went wrong, okay, we thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. It has been totally misinterpreted.\n\nKatya said: 'However it was a joke and the idea it made me feel uncomfortable or offended in any way is total nonsense'\n\n'Everything's on Katya's socials. She's talked about it. She's explained that it was a joke. She wasn't offended in the least. She doesn't feel uncomfortable.\n'We've got a brilliant friendship, an absolutely tight friendship, and I'm sorry if anybody was offended by it, but it was a joke and yeah, that's all there is, there is no real story, really.\n'And I feel weird apologising because I feel like I've not really done anything.'\nHe agreed he had 'misjudged it', when interviewed on Radio Wales Breakfast before starting his own show on the station, and confirmed he was 'absolutely still up for' Strictly.\nHe said: 'I'm having the best time of my life. I just don't want this to be the bit that people remember.'\nOn Sunday, Evans and Jones released a video on Instagram saying they were 'just messing around in the 'Clauditorium' the previous evening and just want to say sorry. It was a silly joke'.\nAnd replying to several users on X, formerly Twitter, the dancer said: 'You picked up on our joke!' \nIn another moment on Saturday night, Jones appeared to not want to high five her celebrity partner.\nA caption alongside their video explained that 'high fives is a running joke'.\nBut viewers of Sunday night's results show were not convinced by the explanation, claiming they had spotted Jones appearing to 'glare' at her celebrity partner. \n\nAs the dancing duo gave the downlow about any secret romances going on behind the scenes in a recent interview, Wynne randomly steered the question onto Katya\n\nWynne asked: 'I've not seen anyone [getting close], are you getting close to anyone?'\n\nDuring the show, Claudia asked Evans how he felt, noting he looked shocked.\nWynne replied: 'I am shocked because I didn't think I'd survive week one so to be here after having done a tango is really thrilling.\n'And I had such a good time and thank you to Katya's clever choreography.'\n\n Eamonn Holmes drags Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield into Wynne Evans and Katya Jones drama \nAs Evans gave his answer fans spotted that Katya remained stony faced and even appeared to wince as the opera singer evaluated his performance.\nA Strictly source said: 'Wynne and Katya have confirmed that their interactions in the Clauditorium were silly jokes they had planned together and have apologised to anyone who may have misinterpreted them.\n'They addressed them on Wynne's Instagram, where their apology can be found.\n'Katya would like to clarify further that she was not offended by Wynne and was not made to feel uncomfortable in the least.\n'The welfare team have checked in on the pair and there are no further actions planned.'\nThe duo had their highest score so far on Saturday, with the judges giving them 34 points for their tango to Abba's Money, Money, Money on Saturday.\nPosting on Sunday after the results were revealed, Jones told Instagram followers: 'Thank you so much for your kind support everyone! \n'We are so excited for the next dance. Every day Wynne makes me smile and laugh, but every Saturday he leaves me absolutely speechless when he takes the dance to another level!\n'It is soo impressive and I can’t wait to create another number for you to perform!'\n\nStrictly's Wynne Evans, 52, asked Katya Jones, 35, if she's 'getting close to anyone' on the BBC show during a recent interview together\n\nTaken aback, Katya replied: 'Me?' Wynne said: 'Yeah. I don't know, I've not seen you getting close [with anyone], though you could be'\n\nChaperones have been put in place on Strictly during rehearsals for this year after an review was launched by the BBC following Sherlock actress Amanda Abbington making complaints about her 2023 professional dance partner, Giovanni Pernice.\nThe BBC apologised to Abbington and said: 'We have assessed the complaints and we have upheld some, but not all, of the complaints made.'\nPernice has always denied the allegations, and said he was 'happy' after the investigation cleared him of the majority of abuse allegations.\nOutlining the show's new duty of care measures in September, the BBC said: 'In July, we introduced new measures for training and rehearsals, which are in place for this year's show.\n'These included a production team member present during training room rehearsals at all times; two new roles on the show dedicated to welfare support - a celebrity welfare producer and a professional dancer welfare producer (both started work in August); and additional training for the professional dancers, production team and crew'.\nBBCKatya JonesInstagramStrictly Come Dancing\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStrictly Come Dancing stars Katya Jones and Wynne Evans are hauled in to explain 'in-joke' by 'dismayed' BBC bosses after awkward on-air exchange - despite broadcaster claiming they would not pursue it\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nPhillip Schofield confirms the death of his 'beautiful and dignified' mother Pat after 'holding, hugging and loving her' during her final days\n\nMaya Henry calls in the lawyers as she begins legal action against Liam Payne after accusing the One Direction star of obsessive contact\n\nEXCLUSIVEWhy Nicole Kidman really lost her cool at Paris Fashion Week with Salma Hayek\n\nThe actresses were said to be swapping advice\n\n'I would never do that to my wife': Masterchef star Gregg Wallace posts emotional video denying 'flirting' or 'hitting on' another woman\n\nKatya Jones lashes out at critics for 'attacking' Wynne Evans and doubles down on claim their awkward Strictly exchange was an inside joke\n\nWant to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles?

Trump campaign has spent a whopping amount on fast food - here’s the breakdown","text":"Donald Trump’s campaign’s huge spending at fast food outlets has been revealed - and the president is clearly lovin’ it.\n\nBetween January 2023 and September 20, 2024, the Republican nominee’s campaign spent a whopping $31,000 at McDonald’s, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe outlet reviewed FEC filings for federal candidates in that period. In total, filings showed $35,900 was spent at McDonald’s, meaning the Trump campaign made up for 86 percent of all candidates’ spending at the chain in that time frame.\n\nTrump’s admiration for McDonald’s isn’t new, with two of his former aides revealing his typical meal in a 2017 book: “two Big Macs, two Fillet-O-Fish and a chocolate malt.” The former president also famously ordered McDonald’s to the White House as he welcomed Clemson University’s football team after their win in the College Football Playoff National Championship amid a government shutdown.\n\nBut it wasn’t only Big Macs and McFlurries that Republicans have been chowing down on. The entire GOP operation also spent $200,000 Chick-Fil-A, roughly 20 times more than Democrats, The Post’s analysis found. The Biden-Harris campaign, meanwhile, specifically spent over $7,000 at Panera Bread, topping the list of fast-casual restaurants visited by the Democratic team, according to the outlet.\n\nRepublican campaigns spent 18 times as much as Democrats fast-food restaurants.\n\nDemocrats may not be visiting fast-food joints as often, but it doesn’t mean they don’t want their food quickly. Democrats outspent the GOP by about $80,000 by getting their grub delivered on apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash.\n\nThe Post also found that there was a partisan divide over cuisines. Democrats frequented Mexican, Spanish and Chinese food, while Republicans spent more than twice as much as Democrats on BBQ. \n\nCampaigns on both sides of the aisle seem to equally enjoy Italian, French and, of course, American food.\n\nAll in all, the Post’s analysis looked at a total of 21,000 receipts worth a collective $13 million.\n\nMcDonald’s has been mentioned several times on the campaign trail, with Trump often refusing to believe that Harris worked there.\n\nThe vice president repeatedly mentioned her time working at McDonald’s before her first law job in the 1980s. If elected in November, she’d make history as the first US president to have worked at the fast-food restaurant.\n\nOn August 31, she posted on X: “Two middle-class kids. One, a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother and had a summer job at McDonald’s.”\n\nLater that day, he took to Truth Social to write: “Comrade Kamala Harris lied about working at McDonald’s. SHE NEVER WORKED THERE, they think she’s ‘nuts.’”\n\nWeeks later, he repeated the accusation. “She never worked at McDonalds, it’s a lie,” Trump declared at a California rally. “She said she stood over those french fries when they were being fried, and it was so tough work.”","summary":"Republicans have reportedly spent about 28 times as much as Democrats at McDonald’s","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mcdonalds-trump-sending-republican-democrats-b2629144.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/02/27/02/GettyImages-1128642136.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a3CXt8aI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:18:42","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":259693416,"title":"Kamala Harris to Give First Fox News Interview on ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’","text":"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier will interview presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on Oct. 16 in the battleground state of Pennsylvania where Harris leads presidential opponent Donald Trump by 4 percentage points.

Gavin Newsom celebrated the passage of a new state law that could lower gasoline price spikes by giving regulators the authority to require that California oil refiners store more inventory. Newsom and Democratic lawmakers cast the bill as a solution to high gas prices. With less than 3 weeks until the Nov. 5 election, affordability has become a major political issue and a potential vulnerability for Harris' presidential campaign. \"It's about time we stood up,\" Newsom said after he signed the bill on Monday. \"This is the fourth largest market in the world. This is a big damn deal.\" The newly passed law gives Newsom a win in his political battle with the oil industry, but whether Harris or other Democratic candidates will benefit from the governor's victory remains unclear. Newsom’s law will not immediately lower the cost of gasoline in California. While experts say it could ultimately offer reductions of future price spikes, regulators will have to complete a thorough review process to enact the new controls. Governors in Arizona and Nevada wrote letters warning that the legislation could drive up costs for their constituents, potentially bolstering concerns in pivotal swing states about California's policies. Newsom called lawmakers back to Sacramento for a special session to pass the policy. At the same, however, his administration is expected to adopt stricter limits on carbon fuels that could drive up per gallon costs by almost a half dollar or more just days after the election. The governor declined to answer a question at a press conference about whether he thought the new law would impact Democrats in the election, arguing that the effort wasn't about politics. In a video posted to social media minutes before he signed the bill into law on Monday, Newsom accused the industry of being in \"cahoots\" with Trump by intentionally pushing prices higher to scare voters during election season. Opponents have cast his push to address gas prices as an example of “political theatrics.” “This is politics, not policy,” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, chief executive of the Western States Petroleum Assn. “This is a show. This is anything but good policy.” Newsom and WSPA have been locked in a political battle over gas prices since the summer of 2022. The governor ran ads in Florida calling out Gov. Ron DeSantis' conservative policies, which prompted a response from WSPA blaming Newsom for California’s highest in the nation gas prices. Since then the governor has repeatedly accused the industry of intentionally gouging consumers. His administration has pointed out that prices spike when refineries experience unplanned maintenance problems with their equipment, which limits the amount of gasoline available in the state and drives up prices. Requiring the refineries to increase fuel reserves, his administration says, will help prevent those shortages. Reheis-Boyd has argued that requiring refineries to store more gasoline will increase costs for the companies and drive up prices at the pump. The industry contends that California’s nation-leading gasoline costs are a supply and demand problem in a state that has adopted environmental policies to limit oil drilling and production. The cheapest way to lower gas prices is to allow oil companies to increase crude oil production in California and rely less on supply from overseas, Reheis-Boyd said. The state should be working closely with California’s small number of refineries to ensure the state has enough gasoline, instead of adopting new regulations that restrict profits and pushing the companies out of business, she said. “We have a governor who isn't interested in the conversation,” Reheis-Boyd said. “He's the only governor I've never met with, because he won't meet.” This year marks the second time in two years that Newsom has pushed lawmakers to adopt new oil regulations, an issue that divides Democrats as they navigate desires to fight climate change and lower gas prices. In 2023, lawmakers balked at passing Newsom's proposal to penalize oil companies that earn excessive profits. Instead lawmakers adopted new oversight of the industry and gave regulators the ability to cap profits through a rule-making process that has yet to result in any new restrictions. Democrats in the Legislature were reluctant to pass Newsom’s new oil bill again this year. Two weeks before the regular session concluded at the end of August, Newsom announced a proposal to require that petroleum refiners maintain a stable inventory in order to prevent fuel shortages and price spikes when refinery equipment is taken offline for maintenance. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) refused to take up the bill for a floor vote at the end of session, arguing that his caucus did not want to rush legislation through without properly vetting the policy. He agreed to work on the proposal in a special session. Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg) took the opposite approach. His caucus was ready to pass the bill at the end of session, he said, and he initially refused to participate in a special session before giving in to the governor’s demands. During the special session, the Assembly held a series of hearings before passing the bill earlier this month. The Senate quickly signed off on the proposal the following week. While some liberal Democrats quietly fumed as the governor forced them to vote on another one of his political proposals, many felt the policy could ultimately reduce price spikes on consumers. \"The data is clear: Price spikes happen when refineries fail to plan for supply during scheduled maintenance,\" said Assembly member Gregg Hart (D-Santa Barbara). \"This bill will hold oil companies accountable for resupply plans when refineries shutdowns occur, ultimately saving Californians billions at the pump.\" Several Democratic legislators competing for swing-district seats in November did not vote, or opposed the bill. State Senator Dave Min (D-Irvine), who declined to vote on the proposal, said he supported the goal to address the problem of high gas prices in the state, but did not agree with the approach. Min is currently locked in a tight race for congress against Republican Scott Baugh in Orange County. Min said opponents to Newsom's proposal \"raised serious concerns\" about whether it would be effective in lowering gas prices or even counterproductive. “These concerns deserve a fair and full vetting, which is difficult to do in a special session conducted just weeks before many of the current legislators will be leaving office,” Min said in a statement. Republicans said Democrats would reduce gas taxes if they were serious about the problem of affordability. “So, who's making the money?” asked state Sen. Brian Dahle (R-Bieber). “Who's gouging Californians for every gallon of gas? It's the government. $1.42 for every single gallon of gas goes to taxes, whether it's state, local or federal.” Opposition to the proposal from labor unions representing workers in the industry added to the pressures on Democrats. Tom Baca, the international vice president for western states of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, said giving regulators control over maintenance schedules, instead of relying on the insight of the workers with deep knowledge of the equipment, could put his members in dangerous conditions if work is delayed. David Sikorski, business manager for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 12, called the special session “unnecessary.” His union represents 21,000 workers in California, Arizona and Nevada. He said Newsom's policy could prove to be a liability to Harris in the neighboring swing states of Arizona and Nevada. “We've made some real momentum, hit the ground running in Arizona, and we put a lot of resources into getting friendly politicians, and Kamala Harris, elected in that state,\" he said. \"This is just one more hurdle that we have to overcome with our membership and working people in general.”","summary":"Gov.

Ted Cruz rages at Mitch McConnell over lack of spending on his Texas reelection bid","text":"The Lone Star State senator doesn’t want to be left all alone. \n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) bashed the Senate Minority Leader and expressed frustration over the lack of support he has received from the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund.\n\n“Sadly no, not a penny,” Cruz vented on Fox News’ “Life Liberty & Levin,” when asked if he got any resources from the Senate Leadership Fund. \n\n“McConnell runs the largest Republican super PAC in the country and has $400 million but that super PAC is used to reward the Republican senators who obey him and to punish those who dare to stand up to him,” he added. \n\nTechnically, McConnell is precluded by federal campaign finance law from directly making spending decisions for the Senate Leadership Fund, though he has actively raised money for it. The group is also stacked with loyalists, including his former chief of staff Steven Law who is its CEO.\n\nCruz has a lengthy history of chaffing with McConnell. During his first year in the upper chamber, Cruz championed a push to leverage a government funding fight in a bid to scrap the Affordable Care Act — a ploy that McConnell opposed.\n\nUltimately, that led to a government shutdown in 2013 and the Affordable Care Act remained intact. From there, Cruz and McConnell have repeatedly butted heads on what tactics to employ.\n\n“Chuck Schumer has been explicit on his number one target in the country, and they are spending between $100 and $150 million trying to beat me,” Cruz warned. \n\nRepublicans generally feel outgunned by Democrats on the airwaves in key House and Senate races. The GOP has a favorable 2024 Senate map, only needing to defend 11 seats compared to the Democrats’ 23 seats — including three held by Independents. Still, Democrats have incumbents and a lot of cash to defend those seats. \n\nTexas is ranked as the weakest incumbent Senate seat for the GOP of the 2024 cycle, with a “Lean Republican” rating from the Cook Political Report. \n\nDespite Texas going to former President Donald Trump by over 5.5 percentage points in the 2020 presidential election, Democrats have been optimistic that they have a shot of flipping the Senate seat. \n\nCruz is facing a spirited contest from Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), which comes six years after he eked out a victory over former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) in a blue wave year by about 2.6 percentage points. \n\nFor comparison, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), who is vying to replace retiring McConnell as the GOP Senate leader in November, prevailed in his 2020 reelection bid by just shy of 10 points. \n\n“[Democrats] have been running attack ads nonstop. I just got up on TV three weeks ago. Now it’s not that I didn’t want to be on TV three months ago. We didn’t have the money. We’re being massively outspent,” Cruz warned. \n\n“Poll after poll show this race as a one-point race or a two-point race or a three-point race. There are two public polls that have come out that show me losing,” Cruz stressed. “It is an incredibly close race.”\n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics polling aggregate of the Texas Senate race pegs Cruz with a 4.8 percentage point edge over Allred. \n\nLast month, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) unveiled plans to mount a multi-million-dollar ad campaign against Cruz. \n\nInternal polling and other data from the Senate Leadership Fund revealed that the GOP is privately nervous about Texas and Nebraska, where incumbent Sen. Debbie Fischer (R-Neb.) is facing a tougher-than-expected contest from Independent contender Dan Osborn. \n\nThe group’s internal poll pegged Cruz with a threadbare 1-point lead against Allred. \n\nLast month, the head of the Senate Leadership Fund downplayed risks in Texas.\n\n“I think we’ll be okay in both of them. This is a presidential cycle. Neither one of those states is going to be on the radar of the Democrats,” Law told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n“Senator Cruz and Senator Rick Scott have done what you want incumbents to do, which is to be prepared to raise money, to take their races seriously, and to run good campaigns.”\n\nRepublicans had seen 2024 Senate pickup opportunities in places like West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. They currently possess 49 seats compared to the Democrats’ 51.","summary":"Sen.

Here's a fact check.","text":"Former President Donald Trump claimed Monday that the Department of Justice was attempting to help Democrats \"cheat\" on the election by trying to add \"illegal voters\" to voter rolls in Virginia. \"One of the Greatest Examples of DOJ Weaponization is the fact that they are suing Virginia to put ALL of the Illegal Voters, which were fully exposed and removed by the important work of Governor Glenn Youngkin, back on the Voter Rolls. Obviously, this was done so that they can CHEAT on the Election,\" Trump wrote on social media. But he and other Republicans mischaracterized a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department, CBS News' election law expert says. Trump's statement followed a lawsuit federal prosecutors filed Friday accusing Virginia officials of removing voters from their rolls too close to the general election, in violation of federal election laws. The National Voter Registration Act, or NVRA, prohibits states from removing voters from registration lists within 90 days of a federal election. Election experts say the 90-day quiet period prevents voters from being disenfranchised by giving them a chance to get back on the registration lists if they were removed in error.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, signed an executive order that led Virginia to violate the quiet period by doing list maintenance \"as recently as late September,\" the Justice Department alleged. The department has also sued Alabama for violating the NVRA in recent weeks. Youngkin defended his actions in a statement, saying, \"With less than 30 days until the election, the Biden-Harris Department of Justice is filing an unprecedented lawsuit against me and the Commonwealth of Virginia, for appropriately enforcing a 2006 law signed by Democrat Tim Kaine that requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls.\"David Becker, executive director of the Center of Election Innovation and Research and CBS News election law contributor, said the Justice Department is enforcing a deadline for voter roll maintenance that election officials have followed for about 30 years. \"Governor Youngkin is correct that the Justice Department needing to sue a state like his so close to an election is 'unprecedented,' but that's because no state has sought to violate this law before this year,\" Becker said. GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson also criticized the Justice Department's suit on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday. He claimed the department sued Virginia officials to \"prevent them from cleaning up their voter rolls.\" The speaker said, \"I think noncitizens are going to vote\" and argued the DOJ suit was a \"case in point.\"Voter fraud by noncitizens is very rare, experts have found, and there's no evidence of widespread noncitizen voting in previous elections. After the 2016 election, analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found 30 cases of suspected noncitizens voting reported by election officials out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed. Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting for president or members of Congress. Violators can be fined, imprisoned for up to a year and deported.The federal government has required states to regularly maintain voter rolls since the passage of the NVRA in 1993. But the law mandates they do so ahead of the 90-day quiet period. In the months leading up to the Nov. 5 general election, other Republican-led states including Texas have made announcements about their voter roll maintenance, which highlighted potential noncitizens.Voter maintenance ensures states can remove ineligible voters from their rolls — including those who died or moved out of the state — but sometimes states have identified voters for removal in error. In 2019, Texas faced lawsuits from voting rights groups for mistakenly including naturalized citizens on a list of registered voters flagged for review. Alice Clapman, senior counsel at the Brennan Center's Voting Rights Program, said she is concerned that routine yearly list maintenance is being presented by some states as evidence that there's a problem with voter rolls that does not exist.\"We're concerned that sort of routine updates that happen every year are being presented in a way that is likely to sow doubts about election accuracy that are just baseless and that have the potential to undermine public trust in election outcomes,\" said Clapman.","summary":"Republicans mischaracterized a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to protect voters from being removed from voting lists too close to Election Day, CBS News' election law expert says.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/virginia-trump-claims-justice-dept-sued-to-add-illegal-voters-to-the-rolls-fact-check/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/04/bed5ab45-32f1-4e70-b99d-0250485ddf7a/thumbnail/1200x630/1a250595a2e1d44f56598fdf4c9026d2/cbsn-fusion-inside-efforts-to-purge-voter-rolls-ahead-of-2024-elections-thumbnail.jpg?v=29b5ccc4d237d9b284ce95a42","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 23:07:08","author":"Laura Doan","authors":["Laura Doan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.576},{"id":259692190,"title":"Tim Walz Names Republicans He’d Like to See in Kamala Harris’ Cabinet","text":"Tim Walz agrees with Kamala Harris’ previous statement that, if elected, she “needs to appoint a Republican to the cabinet.” The Democratic vice presidential candidate discussed the pros and cons of a few potential GOP names on Monday’s episode of the “Smartless” podcast.\n\nHarris told CNN last month she would be happy to appoint a Republican, although she had “no one in particular in mind.” She added at the time, “I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion and I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who is a Republican.”\n\n“Well, she said it and I agree with her,” Walz told “Smartless” co-hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett. “She needs to appoint a Republican to the cabinet — I do think it matters to her — to a position of authority.”\n\nThe governor of Minnesota mentioned Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, whom he described as “super conservative, but that man is as honest as anything.” In 2019, during the first impeachment of Donald Trump, Flake wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post, in which he stated, “My fellow Republicans, it is time to risk your careers in favor of your principles. Whether you believe the president deserves impeachment, you know he does not deserve reelection.”\n\nWalz also expressed his admiration for Oklahoma Sen. Jim Lankford, who wrote “a big piece” of the immigration bill. “I served with him. That guy is the most conservative person I ever met, but he’s also one of the most honorable. Some of these people need to be put in a position where they truly have the ability to influence things because they are ethical and they care about this country. And I think that’s something that really sets [Harris] apart to make a high profile appointment. Bring them folks who care about the country and let us look.”\n\n“I don’t want to be surrounded by [yes] people — in my organization, my folks know that I’ll say something. They say, ‘You know, with all due respect, governor, that is a horrible idea and we should not do it.’ And I’m like, ‘OK, good.

(AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris announced a plan on Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances to thrive as she works to energize a key voting bloc that has Democrats concerned about a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nHarris’ plan includes providing forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men.\n\nHarris already has said she supports legalizing marijuana and her plan calls for working to ensure that Black men have opportunities to participate as a “national cannabis industry takes shape.” She also is calling for better regulating cryptocurrency to protect Black men and others who invest in digital assets.\n\nThe vice president’s “opportunity agenda for Black men” is meant to invigorate African American males at a moment when there are fears some may sit out the election rather than vote for Harris or her opponent, Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice president unveiled the plan as she visited Erie, Pennsylvania, where she stopped by LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, for a conversation with Black men from the area.\n\nThe business, opened just five weeks ago, is the project of Ishmael and Allana Trainor, a married couple and Erie natives who returned to their hometown after living for years in Arizona.\n\nLater, Harris was to hold a campaign rally in the northwest Pennsylvania city.\n\nHer push comes after former President Barack Obama suggested last week that some Black men “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nThe Harris campaign also has been working to increase support among other male voting blocs, including Hispanics, by founding the group “Hombres con Harris,” Spanish for “Men with Harris.” The latest policy rollout is notable because it comes with the stated purpose of motivating Black men to vote mere weeks before Election Day.\n\nAs her campaign has done with the “Hombres” group, Harris’ team plans to organize gender-specific gatherings. Those include “Black Men Huddle Up” events in battleground states featuring African American male celebrities for things like watch parties for NFL and NCAA football games. The campaign says it also plans new testimonial ads in battleground states that feature local Black male voices.\n\nCedric Richmond, co-chair of the Harris campaign and a former Louisiana congressman who is Black, said Harris wants to build an economy “where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth.”\n\nBlack Americans strongly supported Joe Biden when he beat Trump in 2020. Harris advisers say they are less worried about losing large percentages of Black male support to the former president than that some will choose not to turn out at all.\n\nTrump, too, has stepped up efforts to win over Black and Hispanic voters of both genders. He has held roundtables with Black entrepreneurs in swing states and will sit for a townhall sponsored by Spanish-language Univision this week. He also has sought to openly stoke racial divisions, repeatedly suggesting that immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are taking jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans.\n\nHarris’ new round of proposals includes a promise that, if elected, she will help distribute 1 million loans of up to $20,000 that can be fully forgivable to Black entrepreneurs and others who have strong ideas to start businesses. The loans would come via new partnerships between the Small Business Administration and community leaders and banks “with a proven commitment to their communities,” her campaign says.\n\nThe vice president also wants to offer federal incentives to encourage more African American men to train to be teachers, citing statistics that Black males made up only a bit more than 1% of the nation’s public school teaching ranks in 2020-21, according to data from the National Teacher and Principal Survey.\n\nHarris also is pledging to expand existing federal programs that forgive some educational loans for public service to further encourage more Black male teachers. She also wants to use organizations like the National Urban League, local governments and the private sector to expand apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities.\n\nThe vice president’s advisers have been urging her to talk more about cryptocurrency as a way to appeal to male voters. Her campaign said that as president, Harris will back a regulatory framework meant to better protect investors in cryptocurrency and other digital assets, which are popular with Black men.\n\nHarris also promised to create a national initiative to better fund efforts to detect, research and combat sickle cell disease, diabetes, prostate cancer, mental health challenges and other health issues that disproportionately affect Black men.\n\nA recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas. There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Harris team pointed to polls showing Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, having made gains in the battleground state’s suburbs — which it dubbed “our own mini ‘blue wall’” in Pennsylvania — compared with President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance there. The campaign also emphasized that a win involves boosting its popularity among educated suburbanites, including those who have voted for Republicans in recent elections. Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year — with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters — even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump. “The Harris campaign’s path to win Pennsylvania capitalizes on Trump’s unprecedented weakness in the suburbs,” reads the memo, which also highlighted the campaign’s focus on Haley voters. “We have flipped the suburbs from red to blue since Trump won them in 2020, and we have also grown our support with women and tripled our support among white college educated voters in the state.” The campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs — a notable improvement from Trump’s 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.) Recent surveys have found the overall race in Pennsylvania to be within the margin of error for polls, with a survey from Quinnipiac University this month finding Harris up 3 points, an Inquirer/Times/Siena survey finding her up 4 points and The Wall Street Journal having Trump up 1 point. It’s the most sought-after battleground on the map, offering the most Electoral College votes among the hotly contested states, and it is the most frequent campaign destination for both Harris and Trump. Trump’s “weakness in the suburbs means that for him to actually win, he has to double and triple down on his base in the reddest counties in the state,” said Brendan McPhillips, a senior adviser to Harris’ Pennsylvania campaign. “And so we are going on offense and going to places where he thinks he has a strength and competing.” The campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to “cut margins and stop Trump’s only hope of victory,” noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020. Recent presidential elections in Pennsylvania have been exceptionally close. Biden defeated Trump in 2020 by just over 1 point. In 2016, Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by an even slimmer margin. “With most polls showing this to be a margin of error race, we are also going on offense with rural voters to cut into Trump’s margins — a critical advantage as Trump’s team lacks the ground game capacity to conduct persuasion and mobilization campaigns simultaneously,” the Harris campaign memo reads. McPhillips said improving on Biden’s margins in those counties by just 1 to 2 points would effectively cut off Trump’s path to flipping the state red. “We’re eating into his margins in a way that cannot sustain a victory,” he said. “And that is how we’re going to beat him, and it’s how we’re able to play offense on so many fronts.” The campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members. Harris has so far spent far more time in the western part of the state, including rural areas, than she has in the Philadelphia market, which McPhillips said is partly to help introduce her to voters who may be less familiar with her. For Trump, billionaire mogul Elon Musk ramped up his political engagement in the state this month through his America PAC, which is working to turn out the vote for Trump. McPhillips dismissed the potential impact of that effort. “They can’t scale up to the level that we’re at,” he said. “Even with Elon Musk’s money, you can’t spend enough money to scale up an operation to match ours. It’s too late. You needed to start in March, February, January, and they’ve just been phoning it in for so long. It’s going to be close, for sure. We’ve always been planning for it to be so. But that planning manifests itself in the fact that we actually had a plan, not a concept of one.” The Trump campaign said the Harris campaign is papering over a problem it faces in Pennsylvania cities — particularly Philadelphia, the most vote-rich locale for Democrats in the state. “They can point to the suburbs, but they’re losing ground in places like Philadelphia,” a Trump campaign official said. “It’s exactly why [former President Barack] Obama was just pleading to African American men to vote for her. They’ve sounded the alarms, and they know they’re losing.” The Trump campaign also pointed to Republicans’ having significantly cut into the Democratic voter registration advantage in the state while flipping Bucks, Luzerne and Beaver counties to Republican registration edges. It further highlighted reports that working-class voters in Philadelphia have embraced Trump. Kush Desai, the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania spokesperson, highlighted Obama’s visit as a sign the Harris team was scrambling. “An Obama visit isn’t going to convince Pennsylvanians to vote for another four years of open borders, rising prices, and disaster at home and abroad,” Desai said in a statement. In its memo, the Harris campaign said it believes it will be able to “at least match” Biden’s support in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in his victory in those cities four years ago. It went into greater detail about its efforts to reach Black voters in the state, including the staff members it has dedicated to outreach and engagement and its events focused on Black voters. Last week, Obama offered unscripted remarks during a Pittsburgh campaign stop in which he said his understanding of the race is that “we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. … [T]hat seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.” Seeking to speak directly to Black men, he pushed for undecideds to get behind Harris, saying her record deserves their support. “This is excellence on display, and it needs to be rewarded,” Obama said. State Sen. Vincent Hughes told NBC News he could “understand the frustration” Obama expressed. “Maybe the tone should have been a little bit different,” he said. “But let’s be real clear about this. Let’s get to the substance of what he said. There’s nothing in Donald Trump’s background, career, anything that should lead any citizen, let alone Black men, to vote for him. He’s not a successful businessman. … He was sued for discrimination in housing.” Hughes said the Harris campaign is going to hit its targets among both Black men and voters in Philadelphia, adding that he has seen a flood of campaign activity there recently that has outpaced what Democrats were doing in 2020 during the worst of the Covid pandemic. “It’s going in the right way for the vice president,” he said. “Look, for a woman and for a Black woman, it’s always harder. It’s not fair, it’s not right, but it’s always harder. Maybe if we break through with this election, we can finally smash that glass ceiling and not make it so hard for the next one.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her path to victory in Pennsylvania in a memo ahead of Monday night’s rally in bellwether Erie County.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-sees-path-victory-pennsylvania-running-suburbs-rcna175307","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240926-harris-walz-ch-1049-f3ecc0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:57:58","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":259691028,"title":"Massachusetts Town Fines Resident Who Projected 'Trump 2024' on Water Tower","text":"A town in Massachusetts has fined a resident for projecting \"Trump 2024\" onto a municipal water tower.According to local officials in the town of Hanson, the unauthorized display ahead of the November election, in which former President Donald Trump will face off against Vice President Kamala Harris, has led to a cease-and-desist order, as the town does not endorse political candidates or allow political signs on municipal property.Town Administrator Lisa Green revealed that officials discovered the projection on October 11, sparking concerns that it might give the impression of a town endorsement.\"This misleads the public into believing that this activity is sanctioned by or condoned by the town,\" Green said in a statement Saturday.While the resident's identity remains undisclosed, the town has imposed a $100 daily fine until the display is halted.In an effort to combat the unauthorized projection, the Highway Department workers installed a spotlight aimed at the tower, hoping to obscure the image at night.However, the fines have been accumulating, and the costs of addressing the situation continue to rise. Officials have said that this countermeasure could lead to substantial expenses, including legal fees and overtime pay for staff. The mounting costs have led some to worry that the fines may fall short of covering the town's financial burden.This issue has also raised questions about free speech and the limitations of displaying political messages on public property, a topic likely to spark further debate as the presidential election approaches.This is not the first time a sign promoting a presidential nominee has caused controversy. Last week, a 100-foot-wide, 12-foot-tall glowing \"VOTE FOR TRUMP\" sign was seen in Amsterdam, New York.The sign, erected atop the headquarters of Sticker Mule, a sticker and T-shirt printing company based in the small upstate city, has become a flashpoint in a national debate over partisan politics, free speech, and the more byzantine matter of local zoning codes.Sticker Mule unveiled the Trump sign at a lighting ceremony last week that went ahead despite the town's concerns that it was against code and would pose a distraction to passing motorists.Sticker Mule's CEO, Anthony Constantino, a Trump supporter, said the sign is a matter of free speech and unity.However, Amsterdam's mayor, Michael Cinquanti, a Democrat, says he just wants the company to abide by the law, arguing the sign violates a city code that states a sign on top of a business must relate to the business it is underneath.The city of Amsterdam, about 35 miles northwest of Albany, filed a lawsuit against Sticker Mule last week in the state Supreme Court, reiterating this argument.\"We're asking him to comply with city codes. Everybody hates negative publicity in the city, and that's what I was trying to avoid,\" Cinquanti previously told Newsweek, adding that he did not want City Hall's issue with the Trump sign turning into a political powder keg.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press.","summary":"The town of Hanson, Massachusetts, has imposed a $100 daily fine until the display is halted.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/massachusetts-town-fines-resident-projected-trump-2024-water-tower-1968963","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495162/donald-trump-campaign-sign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-14 22:44:47","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.261}]}
