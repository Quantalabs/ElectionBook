anywhere but Moscow","text":"Millionaires are increasingly moving out of London as new figures show the proportion of super rich dropped more than anywhere else except Moscow.\n\nAn annual report on global wealth indicates London is one of only two cities in the top 50 that has fewer rich people than 10 years ago.\n\nThe decline has been attributed to tax increases, economic uncertainty and the fall in the value of the pound.\n\nIn total, 11,300 dollar millionaires were lost in London over the past year, including 18 centimillionaires - someone with at least $100million - and two billionaires.\n\nThe study was conducted for the advisory firm Henley & Partners by New World Wealth and defines wealth as 'liquid investable' assets, which translates to cash, bonds and shares but excludes property wealth, The Times reports.\n\nIt was undertaken before the recent stock market falls that came after the announcement of Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nWith its new total of 215,700 dollar millionaires, London is only matched by Moscow in being a city in the top 50 with fewer rich people than 10 years ago.\n\nOverall, London has lost 12 per cent of its richest residents since 2014 - in absolute terms, however, it has more millionaires than anywhere else.\n\nAround 30,000 fled the city over the past 10 years, compared with 10,000 leaving Moscow.\n\nIn October last year, economists warned Britain was set to lose a fifth of its millionaires under the current Labour government, amid increased day-to-day taxation, frozen inheritance tax thresholds and a potential increase in capital gains taxes.\n\nThe policies prompted a forecast from the Adam Smith Institute (ASI) that the 4.55 per cent of British residents with over $1million in assets would fall to just 3.62 per cent by 2028.\n\nWealthy Brits were also said to fear the abolition of the non-dom regime - despite predictions the crackdown would fail in yielding any extra tax income.\n\nAfter coming into force on Monday, the traditional status - that allowed wealthy foreigners living in the UK to shelter their worldwide assets from British taxes for an annual fee starting at £30,000 - was replaced with a far less generous residence-based system.\n\nThey new rules mean any wealthy foreigners who have lived in the UK for longer than four years now have to pay UK income and capital gains taxes on their global earnings.\n\nAnd if they stay long enough in the country, their worldwide assets will also become subject to UK inheritance tax (IHT) of 40 per cent - one of the highest rates in the world.\n\nTax advisors say non-doms are relocating to countries like Portugal, St Kitts and Nevis, Spain, Greece, the United Arab Emirates and Italy, where taxes are much lower or a fixed annual fee can be paid to avoid them.\n\nAndrew Amoils, the head of research at New World Wealth, said: 'Capital gains tax and estate duty rates [IHT] in the UK are amongst the highest in the world, which deters wealthy business owners and retirees from living there. \n\n'It’s worth noting that most of the companies on the FTSE 100 were started by centimillionaires, so the loss of these individuals has a massive impact on an economy.'\n\nHowever, he named other factors too such as the failure to recover from the 2008 financial crisis, the growing dominance of America and Asia in the global hi-tech space, and the impact of Brexit.\n\nMr Amoils added: 'The continued ascendance of nearby financial hubs such as Dubai, Paris, Geneva, Frankfurt and Amsterdam has eroded London’s status as Europe’s top financial centre.'\n\nHe also referenced the 'dwindling importance' of the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n\nAccording to the data, London has been overtaken by Los Angeles and the top 50 is now dominated by American cities.\n\nThe only other British city to make the top 50 list is Manchester, in 46th place with 23,400 dollar millionaires.\n\nDespite the loss, London still ranks as the fourth most expensive city to live in, with its property price per square metre higher than anywhere else apart from Hon Kong, New York and Monaco, which has the most costly homes.","summary":"An annual

MILLION migrants who used Biden-era app to enter the US to leave 'immediately'","text":"Migrants who were temporarily allowed to live in the United States by using a Biden-era online appointment app have been told to leave the country 'immediately.' \n\nMore than 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the CBP One app since January 2023. \n\nThey were generally allowed to remain in the United States for two years with authorization to work under a presidential authority called parole. \n\nKristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security said: 'Canceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security.' \n\nAuthorities confirmed termination notices were sent to CBP One beneficiaries but did not say how many. \n\nThey were urged to voluntary self-deport using the same app they entered on, which has been renamed CBP Home.\n\nIt came down with an announcement that those who are in the U.S. illegally and refuse to leave will be charged $998 per day until they go, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced.\n\n'If they don't [leave], they will face the consequences,' a DHS spokesperson said.\n\n'This includes a fine of $998 per day for every day that the illegal alien overstayed their final deportation order.'\n\nOfficials are planning to roll out the fines under a rarely used 1996 law that allows fines to be imposed on those avoiding removal orders. \n\nThe law was first enforced in 2018 under the Republican's first term. \n\nHowever, Joe Biden's administration suspended the rule in 2021, saying the penalties were 'ineffective and unnecessary punitive measures.'\n\nOne senior Trump administration official said the fines will be retroactive up to five years, dating back to 2019, which could result in penalties totaling over $1 million in some circumstances. \n\nIt was unclear how many beneficiaries would be affected.\n\n'It's time for you to abandon the United States,' the Department of Homeland Security wrote to a Honduran family that entered the U.S. at the end of last year.\n\nOthers shared the same email on social media platforms.\n\nAl Otro Lado, a nonprofit organization that provides legal aid to migrants, said some who received the revocation letters are from Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico.\n\nCBP One was a cornerstone of the Biden administration's strategy to create and expand legal pathways to enter the United States in an attempt to discourage illegal border crossings. \n\nBy the end of December, 936,500 people had been allowed to enter with CBP One appointments at border crossings with Mexico. \n\nPresident Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office, stranding thousands in Mexico who had appointments into early February.\n\nTrump has ended and revoked temporary status for many who benefited under Biden's policies. \n\nHomeland Security said Monday that Biden's use of parole authority — more than any president since it was created in 1952 — 'further fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history.'\n\nThe fines reportedly would only apply to the 1.6 million migrants in the U.S. facing deportation orders.\n\nThe administration also has plans to seize the property of those who refuse to cough up the cash for the fines, according to White House emails reviewed by Reuters.\n\nU.S. officials on those emails discussed how the Department of Justice’s civil asset forfeiture division could be used to help with seizing the migrant's assets. \n\nDHS previously warned in a social media post on March 31 that fines were being considered for migrants found not in compliance with their deportation orders. \n\nDuring Trump's first administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued fines ranging from $300,000 to $500,000 to migrants who refused to depart the U.S. by taking refuge in churches. \n\nIn 2019, Edith Espinal Moreno, a migrant from Mexico, was ordered to pay $497,000 for 'failing to depart the U.S. as previously agreed.' \n\nMoreno had overstayed her deportation order by two years and took refuge at an Ohio church during that time. \n\nEventually, ICE dismissed the fine.","summary":"Migrants who were temporarily allowed to live in the United States by using a Biden-era online appointment app have been told to leave the country

A lot of brand-name drug manufacturing is done in Europe. \n\nPharmaceuticals were one of the carve-outs excluded from the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, as well as rare earth minerals, gold and semiconductors. \n\nTariffs on Chinese pharmaceuticals were to remain at 20 percent. \n\nTrump's commitment to tariffs comes after the Dow ended more than 300 points down. \n\nOverall the tariff-related market drop amounted to more than 4,500 points. \n\nThe stock market briefly rallied Tuesday when it appeared Trump could put a pause on his tariffs going into effect. \n\nThe White House has since indicated that's not going to happen. \n\nTrump delivered his remarks Tuesday to the group that assists Republicans in winning seats in the House of Representatives. \n\nHe want the GOP-controlled Congress to pass a bill that includes major tax cuts - as Trump's 2017 tax cuts are expiring. \n\n'We are one big, beautiful bill signing away from the greatest economy in the history of the world,' Trump said. 'If we don't do it it's going to be a disaster.'\n\n'And you just better hope that people believe that it was the Democrats' fault, because you know, they're very good at saying it was our fault,' he continued. \n\n'It'll be the biggest tax increase in history,' Trump said. \n\nHe also spent portions of the speech beating up on Democrats - including former President Joe Biden, again mocking him for falling asleep on the beach. \n\nTrump mocked, at length, the neck-size of Democratic California Sen. Adam Schiff. \n\n'He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen,' Trump remarked, asking how it holds up Schiff's head. 'It's a mystery.' \n\nThe president also marveled at Democrats using Rep. Jasmine Crockett as a potent surrogate. \n\n'Crockett's gonna bring them back?' Trump mused. 'They are in serious trouble.","summary":"President Donald Trump teased even more tariffs just hours before his 'Liberation Day' tariffs were set to go into effect roiling global markets.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14586027/donald-trump-major-new-tariff-pharmaceuticals.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/09/02/97065939-0-image-m-66_1744160624113.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 01:05:48","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":309131838,"title":"White Lotus star Walton Goggins reveals tragic connection to Thailand in emotional interview","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Apr 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Lively hit with shock twist as co-star turns AGAINST her in battle against Justin Baldoni\n\nFrom 'pimping out a gay worker' to older men throwing teenage staff over their shoulders... former Foxtons employees tell of how the real estate office was like 'The Wolf of Wall Street'\n\nRevealed: Why Prince Harry skipped wedding of one of his 'band of brothers'\n\nHow to rescue your pension from Trump's tariffs - whatever your age: Experts reveal what to do NOW, whether you're decades from retirement, about to take a lump sum or have already given up work\n\nLIZ JONES: Prince Harry is back in Britain and had an invitation, yet STILL swerved the wedding of one of his 'band of brothers' - and I think I know why\n\nWe moved to Dubai for a better life and thought tax-free earning would make us rich - but we're worse off than in UK\n\nTory MP Michael Fabricant opens up about his polyamorous lifestyle to drag queen Danny Beard as he reveals partner of 35 years as well as several 'deep friendships' on Celebrity Big Brother\n\nSARAH VINE: From wooden forks to Ed Miliband... these are the ten pet hates I'd slap tariffs on if I (and not Donald Trump) were Queen of Everything for a day\n\nI've been to all 92 Football League grounds - this is the definitive list from worst to best and where YOUR club ranks, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nKyrgyzstan will fine women for WEARING full-body niqabs under plan backed by Muslim authority which says garments could hide 'attackers in disguise' and are 'alien to our society'\n\nBBC film dubbed 'the most disturbing ever made' with perfect 100% Rotten Tomatoes score rebooted by Adolescence producers - warning 'a whole new generation will get nightmares'\n\nThe world's biggest beauty breakthroughs: From umbilical cord face masks and earlobe fillers to 'MesoBotox' for over-sized pores, KATE SPICER reveals these revolutionary anti-ageing treatments\n\nAMANDA PLATELL: I've been Amanda Abbington's harshest critic, but this is why I FINALLY feel sorry for her\n\nFit and healthy 25-year-old hit by motor neurone disease - a common night-time symptom was the first major sign\n\nChina is hammered with 104% tariffs as defiant Beijing vows it will 'fight to the end' over levies - despite being warned not to retaliate\n\nReviews dismiss Meghan Markle's latest podcast as an 'inane stream of mindless aphorisms' and 'stomach-turning'\n\nPetite blonde jail boss brought down by a pair of Hugo Boss flip-flops and the DNA of her drugs kingpin lover\n\nMy insurer left me with a £10,000 bill for air ambulance mountain rescue I didn't even need: SALLY SORTS IT\n\nLady Colin Campbell, 75, details her 'roaring, rampant affair' with 'gorgeous' Larry Lamb, 77, and reveals how the Gavin & Stacey star 'pumped testosterone in all directions'\n\nA tale of two cities: Birmingham bin strikes hit city's poorest areas hardest as rubbish overflows into the streets...but posh roads just metres away are spotless\n\nI'm Britain's 'biggest victim of identity theft'... romance fraudsters have used my face and body 400 TIMES to con women - and now they are using AI to send fake videos\n\nThe unlikely English village home of a multi-million pound cocaine smuggling empire run by Eastern European gang\n\nThe 29 things you should pack in your 72-hour 'survival kit' in case of a Russian attack: As security officials warn UK families should be 'prepared for all eventualities', here are the indispensable items for YOUR emergency bag\n\nColon surgeon flags must-know sign of bowel cancer that barely anyone knows about...amid epidemic in under 50s\n\nWhite Lotus star Walton Goggins recalls first wife's tragic suicide in emotional interview\n\n Have YOU got a story?

'She was my wife.' \nThe Critics Choice Award winner was married to Leanne Knight from 2001 until her death in 2004.\nKnight had gone missing and when her body was found, 'ultimately it was revealed the decision that she’d made,' the Justified actor explained. \n'I thought it was really unrecoverable for me. Life on the other side of that,' he said.\n'I spent the next three years looking for an excuse—not to end it, but certainly putting myself in situations that were questionable, not with drugs or anything like that, just life experiences and traveling. And I really went all over the world.'\n\nWhen Walton Goggins arrived in Thailand to shoot season three of The White Lotus , the 53-year-old actor experienced more than a bit of Déjà vu, after escaping to the tropical paradise some two decades ago following a dark tragedy; Pictured in Los Angeles in February\nThose travels included India, Vietnam and Cambodia, but the adventure began in Thailand. \n'The first island we were staying on, I realized, I’ve been on this road before,' he said of returning to the surroundings that were more familiar than he had anticipated during production.\n\n White Lotus star Walton Goggins reveals bizarre detail about latest episode of season three \n'And then the next island we went to, I realized, \"I've definitely been on this beach before. I know this boardwalk.\" And all of the things kept coming back.'\nThe eerie experiences continued with each set up and came to a head on his last night of shooting along the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. \n'We pulled up to this dock, and I was like, \"I know this dock.\"'\nThe Emmy nominee found another old familiar site not far off. 'Oh my God. That’s the room I stayed in 20 years ago. That’s my balcony. That’s where I was the very first day I came here, 20 years ago, and in so much f-ing pain, man.'\n'We got out of the boat, and that’s where we were filming, man—all of the equipment was literally right in front of the hotel that I’d picked 20 years ago on the internet, on this little bitty road in this little bitty neighborhood.'\nConsidering the unusual coincidences, the Righteous Gemstones star said, 'I think I haven’t had the time to fully unpack the symmetry between those two people showing up at the same place, separated by 20 years.'\n\nGoggins revealed in an interview with GQ that he had fled to Thailand after the death of his first wife, Leanne Knight, who died by suicide in 2004\n\nThe actor said many of the locations in season three were places he had visited during his trip some 20 years ago.

Life continues, and it continues for everybody if you can just hold on and lean into it and keep walking the walk that you’re walking, and keep looking for the answers.\"'\nGoggins married writer and director Nadia Conners in 2011 and together they share son Augustus, 14. \nToday the actor focuses on living a life filled with gratitude. 'I don’t take it for granted, man. If my life ends tomorrow, don’t weep for me, man, because God, whoever she is, has always been looking out for me.

and Strengthen America’s Coal Sector","text":"WASHINGTON–President Donald Trump signed four executive actions on Tuesday aimed at protecting and bolstering America’s coal industry.\n\nTrump signed the orders during an East Room event, attended by key Cabinet members like Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin.\n\nThe first was an order that “directs all departments and agencies of the federal government to end all discriminatory policies against the coal industry,” White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf announced at the signing ceremony.\n\n“This ends the leasing moratorium that prevents new coal projects on federal land, and it’s going to accelerate all permitting and funding for new coal projects to allow the coal industry to flourish under your leadership,” Scharf told Trump.\n\nThe second action imposes a moratorium on the policies from the previous administration that threaten coal plants around the country.\n\n“There are currently dozens of coal plants in America that are in imminent danger of being forced to close based on unscientific and unrealistic policies enacted by the Biden administration,” Scharf noted.\n\n“What we are going to do is essentially impose a moratorium on those policies taking effect to protect coal plants that are currently operating to ensure they are able to continue producing power, and continue providing jobs to Americans in the coal industry,” he continued.\n\nPer a White House fact sheet, the proclamation “allows certain coal plants to comply with a less stringent version of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule for two years,” rather than the more strict standards the Biden administration implemented.\n\nA third order deals with securing the grid and making it more reliable.\n\n“This executive order is going to promote grid security and reliability by ensuring, in part, that our grid policies are focused on secure and effective energy production and energy transmission as opposed to woke policies that discriminate against secure sources of power like coal and other fossil fuels,” Scharf said.\n\nThe fourth action instructs the Department of Justice to investigate anti-coal policies put forth by Democrat-run states, which the administration believes are unconstitutional.\n\n“One of the biggest problems we have in this space is Democrat states, radical leftist states enacting policies and enacting an agenda that discriminates against coal, against secure sources of energy,” Scharf stated, adding that many such policies are illegal and unconstitutional.\n\n“With this executive order, you’re going to be instructing your Department of Justice to vigorously pursue and investigate these state policies that we believe are illegal or unconstitutional,” he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON–President Donald

Before Upcoming Iran Negotiations","text":"President Donald Trump brushed off warnings about climate change Tuesday and said the real threat is ‘nuclear heat’ in a grave threat about Iran.\n\nTrump made the comments in a rambling White House statement before signing executive orders meant to unleash coal power and wipe away regulations that limit it.\n\nHe began by dismissing scientific warnings about rising temperatures, melting glaciers, and rising sea levels, months after pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement. \n\n‘Because they gave us only a few years left on Earth, right?’ Trump mocked, with hard hat-wearing coal workers as a backdrop. \n\n‘We were going to be gone, we’re all going to be gone – the environment. No, what they have to worry about is the nuclear – nuclear heat. They don’t have to worry about environmental heat. They have to worry about nuclear heat.’\n\n‘And if we’re smart, we’re working on that right now with others, having to do with Iran and some other countries,’ Trump said.\n\nThat was the tip that he was referring to Iran and new talks to deal with its nuclear program. Trump has said those talks will be ‘direct,’ although Iran says they will be ‘indirect.’ Trump’s reference to ‘other countries’ added more confusion.\n\n‘But that’s the that’s the heat you’re gonna have to worry about. You don’t have to worry about the air is getting warmer. The ocean will rise … within the next 500 to 600 years, giving you a little bit more waterfront property. They say this is going to these guys can handle that. The nuclear we have a bigger problem with, right?’ Trump said. \n\nTrump’s latest comments came a day after he sat down with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and told reporters Iran would not be allowed to get a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt was a statement that pleased Morton Klein of the Zionist Organization of America. \n\n‘You couldn’t have had more clarity on Trump saying we can never allow Iran to get nuclear weapons,’ the conservative hawk told DailyMail.com. ‘He’s making it clear to them … that we’re not messing around. We are serious. We’re not going to tolerate your continuing. Once they get nukes, it’s a nightmare,’ he said.\n\nTrump’s surprise comment about direct talks with Iran comes as the Pentagon has been brandishing American firepower by deploying B-2 bombers at a base in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSatellite images have revealed the deployment of six nuclear-capable B-2 bombers on Diego Garcia, a British-owned naval base that has been critical during U.S. military campaigns.\n\nThe Pentagon has unleashed daily attacks on the Iran-backed Houthis, in a move that sends its own message to Tehran.\n\n‘The movement of the aircraft to Diego Garcia definitely sends a signal to Iran about the extent to which they are in jeopardy, and the extent of seriousness the Trump administration feels with regard to its various demands,’ Daryl Press, the director of the Initiative for Global Security at Dartmouth College told ABC News. \n\nThe network analyzed commercial satellite imagery from Planet Labs PBC.\n\nTrump on Monday said the U.S. would hold top level ‘direct’ talks with Iran – while brandishing new threats and repeating demands that Iran could not be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\n\n‘We’re having direct talks with Iran. And they’ve started,’ Trump told reporters while seated in the Oval Office next to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, himself a top Iran hawk.\n\nThe talks are set to take place in Oman, but Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said the talks would be ‘indirect,’ amid longstanding tensions between the two nations.\n\n‘Indirect negotiations can guarantee a genuine and effective dialogue,’ he told Iranian state news agency IRNA, Reuters reported.\n\nThe disclosure came just days after Trump threatened Iran in remarks to NBC News. ‘If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.’\n\nIf he were to order such a bombing campaign, the B-2 bombers are capable of launching bunker buster bombs and other munitions that could be used to take out Iran’s nuclear technology, which is often set up deep underground. The bombers are capable of carrying conventional and nuclear munitions.\n\nOn military blogger, Ken Klippenstein, quoted experts calling it the largest deployment of B-2s to a forward location. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Blaine Holt, the former Deputy U.S. Military Representative to NATO, boiled it down to ‘do you see our sword?’\n\nOver the weekend, Trump fired U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only female officer on NATO’s military committee, for unexplained reasons, the AP reported. \n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Pentagon for comment on the deployment. \n\nWhen speaking to reporters about Iran, Trump said the surprise meeting would take place Saturday, but refused to divulge where.\n\n‘We’ll see what can happen,’ he said.\n\n‘All I can tell you is there’s a major meeting going on,’ Trump said when pressed, adding that it would be ‘top level.’\n\nThe stakes are high. The U.S. has avoided such direct talks for years. The Iran nuclear deal, which Trump scuttled after it was put in place under Barack Obama, was negotiated through multi-party talks.\n\n‘I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with, or frankly, that Israel wants to be involved with, if they can avoid it,’ he added. ‘So we are going to see if we can avoid it, but it’s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful.’\n\n‘And I think it would be in Iran’s best interests if they are successful.’\n\nAsked about the consequence if Iran refuses to give up its nuclear program, Trump responded: ‘I think if the talks aren’t successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger.’\n\n‘Because they can’t have a nuclear weapon. It’s not a complicated formula. Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon,’ Trump said.\n\n‘If the talks aren’t successful, I actually think it’ll be a very bad day for Iran if that’s the case.’\n\nThey would be the first known direct talks since Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018. Trump has repeatedly called it a ‘horrible’ and complained ‘we got nothing.’\n\nTrump made the comments at a meeting that was being closely watched amid a global sell-off after he imposed an across-the-board 10% tariff and slapped additional tariffs on more than 60 countries.\n\nTrump showed no indication of backing down on trade. \n\n‘‘We’re not looking at that,’ Trump said when asked if he was considering a pause after the multi-trillion sell-off.\n\nTrump fielded a series of questions from U.S. and Israeli reporters after cancelling a scheduled press conference planned for the East Room of the White House.\n\nInstead, he revealed the talks on the high-pressure issue, inside the Oval Office facing new pressure on the tariffs. The White House has threatened to veto a Senate bill that would end the emergency designation that the White House cited to impose the tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu was much less revealing on Iran, while confirming the two men discussed it. \n\n‘We’re both United that Iran does not ever get nuclear weapons, if it could be done diplomatically in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing,’ he said. \n\n‘That’s the end of my speech,’ said Netanyahu after remarks that were brief.\n\n At one point an Israeli reporter asked Trump to elaborate on how a new Iran deal was going to be ‘more effective than the JPOA’ – the Obama-era Iran deal that he ripped up.\n\n‘Well, I can’t really say that, but I think it will be different and maybe a lot stronger,’ he said at first – before immediately pivoting to a temporary cease fire with Hamas to free hostages in Gaza.\n\n‘But they were so happy when we made that first deal, because we did get a lot out. You know, I had people right in this office, this beautiful Oval Office. They came in, 10 people, hostages, you know that? And I said to him, so how was it and the stories they told me, I mean, as an example, I said to them, was there any sign of love?’\n\n‘Did the Hamas show any signs of like help or liking you? Did they wink at you? Did they give you a piece of bread extra? Did they give you a meal on the side like you know, you think of doing like what happened in Germany? What happened elsewhere? People would try and help people that were in unbelievable distress. They said no.’\n\nNetanyahu began the meeting by appeasing Trump’s trade complaints, after the U.S. slapped a 17 % tariff on imports from Israel. \n\n‘We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. We intend to do it very quickly. We think it’s the right thing to do. And we’re going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers, that have been put up unnecessarily. And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,’ he said.\n\nThe tariffs had surprised the Israeli government, which signed an agreement the day prior to end tariffs on U.S. products. Israel exports about $22 billion annually to the U.S.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump brushed off warnings about climate change Tuesday and said the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Warns of &#8216;Nuclear Heat&#8217; Before Upcoming Iran Negotiations first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/asia/trump-warns-of-nuclear-heat-before-upcoming-iran-negotiations/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/22/97060299-0-image-m-12_1744148359987.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:49:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":309131190,"title":"Lesotho: the tiny African nation in the crosshairs of Trump's tariff war","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nunder the radar\n\nLesotho: the tiny African nation in the crosshairs of Trump's tariff war\n\nUS president imposes 50% reciprocal levy on the impoverished state: the highest of his so-called 'Liberation Day' tariffs\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe mountainous kingdom, surrounded entirely by South Africa, is heavily reliant on exports\n\n(Image credit: Illustration by Julia Wytrazek / Getty Images)\n\nHarriet Marsden, The Week UK \n\n9 April 2025\n\n\"Nobody has ever heard of\" Lesotho, Donald Trump said last month with his trademark braggadocio.\n\nThat's despite the US' diplomatic mission in the Kingdom of Lesotho, a tiny mountainous enclave surrounded by South Africa. But the US president has since ensured that everyone has heard of Lesotho by imposing a 50% \"reciprocal\" levy on imports from the impoverished nation: the highest of his so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\nThe 'denim capital of Africa'\n\nIf you've ever bought a pair of jeans from an American brand like Levi's, \"chances are they were manufactured at a factory\" in Lesotho, said The Associated Press. The country's annual GDP relies heavily on exports, and textile manufacturing is one of its \"key industries\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Last year, Lesotho exported $237 million (£184 million) worth of clothes and textiles to the US via the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa): about 75% of its textile output.\n\nThe continent-wide trade agreement has allowed eligible African nations tariff-free access to the US for \"thousands of product types\" since 2000, said The Guardian. It has created \"a thriving garment industry\" in Lesotho, accounting for about 20% of GDP. Now, \"all that is at risk\". Of Lesotho's 30,000 garment workers, mostly women, 12,000 make clothes for US brands including Calvin Klein and Walmart.\n\n\"We need to urgently travel to the US to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Lesotho's trade minister Mokhethi Shelile said on Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"\n'Lesotho will be dead'\nTrump claims Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on US goods, based on a formula the White House used to calculate trade deficits. Lesotho disputes the figure, saying it was unaware of how the US arrived at that number. Many economists have explained that the methodology is flawed, and foreign governments decried the resulting levies as unfair and misrepresentative.\nBut the calculation means smaller economies with limited imports from the US, such as Lesotho, were \"hit hardest\" by Trump's tariffs, said Al Jazeera. That trade surplus is \"largely driven by diamond and textile exports\". The measure will deliver \"a severe blow\" to Lesotho's economy. The tariff \"is going to kill the textile and apparel sector\", according to economic analyst Thabo Qhesi, based in the capital Maseru. \"If the closure of factories were to happen, the industry is going to die and there will be multiplier effects,\" he told Reuters. \"So Lesotho will be dead, so to say.\"\nBut the tariff also \"compounded the pain\" of one of Trump's previous moves, said Al Jazeera: cuts to US foreign aid. Lesotho has one of the highest HIV/Aids infection rates in the world, with roughly one in four adults living with the virus, according to government data. Lesotho's health sector was \"reliant\" on US aid.\nSince 2016, Lesotho has received more than $850 million in HIV funding, said Agence France-Presse, via a Bush-era programme called the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief. After a \"complete halt\" to foreign aid in February, only 28% of that support had resumed in Lesotho by mid-March, according to the UN Aids agency. Many HIV patients in Lesotho have been \"cut off from vital medication\".\n\nExplore More\n\nSouth Africa\nDonald Trump\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHarriet Marsden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nHarriet Marsden is a writer for The Week, mostly covering UK and global news and politics.

John Cornyn, setting up what is likely to become one of the GOP’s most contentious and expensive contests of 2026.\n\nPaxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, announced his decision Tuesday in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham after spending more than a year openly flirting with a Senate challenge. During that time, Paxton has sought to position himself as a national leader among the GOP’s ascendant hard right, launching some of the first criminal investigations in the U.S. over abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth.\n\n“I’m running for U.S. Senate to fight for President Trump’s agenda and take a sledgehammer to the D.C. establishment,” Paxton said in a post on X. “Together, let’s send John Cornyn packing.”\n\nHis decision to enter the race highlights his political resiliency and popularity among Texas Republicans after a decade of legal woes that, at times, seemed to imperil his future: felony securities fraud charges, impeachment after an extraordinary revolt by his closest aides and an FBI corruption investigation. Paxton reached a deal to end the criminal case, was acquitted in a historic impeachment trial in the Texas Senate, and the Biden administration quietly decided not to prosecute him.\n\nCornyn, a respected and popular senator within the GOP conference in Washington, will likely now have to face his most competitive campaign since taking office in 2002.\n\nHe recently lost his bid to lead the GOP as Senate majority leader in November after he spent several years as Sen. Mitch McConnell’s No. 2 in leadership. A former Texas attorney general and state Supreme Court justice, Cornyn has helped the party raise millions of dollars throughout his decades-long career and has worked with Democrats on bipartisan bills.\n\nCornyn has received criticism from Paxton and other Republicans after he suggested that Trump might not be the best Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nPaxton has also expressed discontent with Cornyn’s support of a 2022 bipartisan gun bill that strengthened background checks for buyers under 21, increased prosecution for unlicensed sellers and funds for youth mental health services in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers.\n\nAmidst several legal battles, the Texas attorney general has become a well-known figure on the right for his litigation against former President Joe Biden. Notably, Paxton led a lawsuit attempting to overturn Trump’s loss to Biden in 2020, an effort that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected.\n\nIn 2023, the Texas House voted to impeach Paxton for bribery offenses related to a wealthy real estate donor. He was later acquitted in the Senate following a two-week trial. The Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton over the allegations in the final weeks of former President Biden’s term, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.\n\nA district court judge in April awarded $6.6 million combined to four former senior Paxton aides in their lawsuit against his office after they were fired shortly after reporting Paxton’s office to the FBI for bribery allegations.\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nNadia Lathan is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

It requires a great deal of accountability, vulnerability, understanding your triggers – and nothing quite seems to trigger somebody, especially women, like stepmothers,' she said.\nThe Oscar-winning actress revealed she struggled to bring Brad into her children's lives after separating from Chris.\n'What seems to happen every time is the dad is in the middle. The kids are having a hard time understanding and adjusting, they don't want to let go of the family dynamic they had, and the dad is trying to appease both and play both sides.\n'And the woman is like: Hey! Your kids are having a hard time! It's very easy to take it personally.\n'I think women come in wanting harmony and good intentions, and it's like the dream that it all is like the Brady Bunch and it blends really well.\n'But the truth is, the only place to act out is against the stepmother – because they don't want to push the dad away.'\nGwyneth 'consciously uncoupled' from Chris in 2014 after ten years of marriage, when Apple was nine and Moses eight.\nShe started dating film and television producer Brad later that year after they met on the set of TV series Glee, which he produced and in which she had acted.\n\nFalchuk's daughter Isabella — who he shares with ex-wife Suzanne Bukinik, 55, along with 18-year-old son Brody — also chimed in the comments as she called Paltrow 'the best stepmom ever'\n\nPaltrow last posted her husband on social media in honor of his 54th birthday on March 1\nThey tied the knot in 2018 in the Hamptons, – two years after Gwyneth and Chris' divorce was finalised. Brad has a daughter, Isabella, now 20, and a son, Brody, 18.\nSpeaking to Brad, 54, a guest on her podcast this week, Gwyneth claims it was actually his children – rather than her own – who helped her understand what it meant to be a mother.\n'To be maternal… actually, it was your kids who really helped me define this. When I look back, we traversed through some really rough things. The lessons you learn from your stepchildren have been really profound for me,' she said.\n'One of my most profound lessons that I learned from my relationship with your daughter, which is now so fantastic, is that there was testing going on.\n'She was testing me all the time to see at what point I would reject her. And at some point, I decided, I just need to be exactly that – the essence of maternal: without opinions, without words, without corrections.\n'What does it mean to embody the essence of the maternal? I landed on this metaphor of the sun. The sun is incredibly warm and casting off light and sunshine, ray of light, and doesn't need anything back in order to be it.\n'It just gives off – it just emanates. And that's what I thought Izzy needed from me. I was just going to be that presence for her, always loving and forgiving.\n'I was so there for her that she would not question my intentions or think that I was there to take you away from her.'\n\nGwyneth Paltrow has opened up about her 'rough and rocky' time becoming a stepmother to her husband Brad Falchuk's children \n\nGwyneth has two children, Apple, 20, and Moses, 19, (pictured) from her previous marriage to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin\nHowever, it did not come without its challenges. Gwyneth admitted she unintentionally co-created an unhealthy dynamic with her step-daughter at the beginning of their relationship.\n'I fell into this trap a couple of times of being triggered by a child,' she explained. 'It hits at something so core and so primal, which I think is probably specific to each person.\n'But to me, it was: am I lovable? Am I accepted too? It's like my core stuff gets challenged by the child's behaviour. I think a lot of times, the woman can sort of co-create that dynamic.\n'It's interesting because I've never had a clear opportunity to ascend to my highest self more than in my role as a stepmother because I think it required a mastery over my own impulses, my own damage, you know, my own weaknesses, my own my ego, all the things.\n'I had to talk to myself. I had to actively remind myself to be the adult at all times, and there were, like, a few moments that were really, really hard.'\nGwyneth added while it took 'years' for them all to become a fully blended family unit, there are now countless upsides.\n'You get to create something really new and beautiful out of something uncomfortable. I love that everybody in our family had the agency to help co-create what we were doing.\n'Of course, like in every storybook, there were good things and there were rocky things – but it's been amazing for me to watch all four kids kind of grow into this and embrace it.\n\nGwyneth said: 'In an ideal world, the relationship that you have your kids in works out, and your kids never have to experience divorce or blending families or anything like that. But a lot of times, that's not the case' \n\nSpeaking on her Goop pocast , the Oscar-winning actress revealed she struggled to bring Brad into her children's lives after separating from Chris (pictured in 2015) \n'And it's almost like the payoff is kind of greater when it's your step kid than your own kid. I guess because it's not as natural of a relationship – you're able to create something with this kid that is not your kid, but then becomes one of your kids.\n'My dad used to say the only regret he had in his entire life was not having more kids. And I felt like that for a long time until I got[step-children].'\nShe regrets, however, waiting a year to move in with Brad after they got married.\n'I think at the time, we really felt like we were doing the right thing,' she said.\n'We were trying to kind of land the plane very, very gently and slowly and get everybody on board, but I'm not sure that it didn't just prolong that thing of, like, we don't know what we're doing.'\nBrad FalchukGwyneth PaltrowChris Martin\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFans in shock at Gwyneth Paltrow's husband's 'snow leopard' appearance\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It’s great,” he said.\n\nThe president, wearing a tuxedo at the black tie fundraiser held at the National Building Museum, said he is “the only one” who has the smarts to weaponize import taxes as a way of bullying manufacturers into reversing decades of supply chain integration across the globe and reshoring production to the United States.\n\nMost mainstream experts have denounced his plan to use across-the-board tariffs, which are taxes paid by American importers and often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, condemning them as unnecessary and inflationary. \n\nStock markets have dropped precipitously since he announced a baseline levy of 10 percent on imports from all countries and even higher tariffs he falsely describes as “reciprocal” that are based on an unscientific formula derived from trade deficit data, as well as retaliatory tariffs he is imposing on Chinese imports that will effectively double the cost of anything imported from China starting at midnight on Tuesday. \n\nBut Trump maintains that he is correct and everyone else is wrong about the dangers of tariffs.\n\n“I know what the hell I'm doing. I know what I'm doing, and you know what I'm doing too,” he said. \n\n“I'm the only one that would have done the tariffs, because everybody was afraid. They were afraid of being criticized, because the globalists will go after you,” he added. \n\nTrump claimed that other countries are paying the tariffs, including the whopping 104 percent levy on Chinese goods, and said the tariffs are a way of turning the tables on partners who have mistreated the U.S.\n\n“Countries are paying tariffs right now, China's paying a 104 percent tariff ... many countries have, they've ripped us off left and right, but now it's our turn to do the ripping. That's okay,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s claim is nowhere grounded in reality because tariffs are import taxes that are charged to importers by the United States government as a condition of allowing imports into the country. \n\nThe U.S. has no power to tax other governments and there’s no mechanism by which other governments can be forced to pay taxes as a condition of American importers being permitted to import foreign goods. \n\nYet the president kept up the claim as he addressed the well-heeled crowd, telling them that China would “now pay a big number to our treasury” as he threatened to impose “a major tax” on Americans’ pharmaceutical imports. \n\n“Don't let them keep telling you that this is a tax on our people. I hate that,” he said. \n\nThe president’s vow to keep taxing his own people because he believes it punishes foreign governments comes as Wall Street continued a days-long downward trend while Washington and Beijing continue to trade increasingly stormy rhetoric.\n\nThe new 50 percent tariffs on Chinese imports amounts to a near-doubling of the 54 per cent tariffs Mr Trump had initially planned to impose on China — with the US president adding the second 50 per cent on Monday after Beijing vowed to retaliate with levies of 34 per cent on US goods.","summary":"President continues to claim — falsely — that tariffs are paid by foreign governments instead of by American importers who pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-tariffs-stock-market-midterms-b2729901.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/09/0/48/2025-04-08T234934Z_1598825377_RC2ZTDALPQLA_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JuGsDeUM-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:37:53","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":309131144,"title":"Don’t Cut Hydrogen Hubs Funding, California Lawmakers Urge Trump’s Energy Chief","text":"A majority of California’s congressional delegation urged the Trump administration to preserve funding for the state’s hydrogen production hubs after news broke that the state’s project was on the chopping block.\n\n“As the administration evaluates existing energy investments and pathways to make energy affordable, we respectfully urge you to continue supporting [ARCHES],” the lawmakers wrote. “ARCHES plays a critical role in securing American energy dominance, advancing world-leading energy technology, creating new manufacturing jobs, and lowering energy costs for American families.”\n\nThe letter was signed by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Ro Khana (D-Calif.), among others.\n\nARCHES is a statewide public-private partnership to accelerate the development of hydrogen technologies and infrastructure in California.

His remarks came during a rare visit to the country as he stood at a US-funded pier in Panama City. \"Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence,\" Hegseth told news agency Reuters. \"China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.\" Hegseth is the first US defense secretary to visit Panama in decades. His trip comes amid growing American concerns about Chinese commercial projects in the region, including plans by Chinese companies to build a bridge over the canal. More than 40% of US container traffic—worth roughly $270 billion annually—passes through the canal, which is vital for global trade and potential US military operations. While Hegseth emphasized partnership with Panama, former President Donald Trump has gone further, even suggesting military force to \"reclaim\" the canal. Trump has falsely claimed that China operates the canal and has soldiers present—allegations Hegseth himself dismissed. Former US Ambassador to Panama John Feeley also criticized Trump's approach, saying, \"What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been.\" President Jose Raul Mulino, who met privately with Hegseth, has been aligned with the US on several fronts. In February, he pulled Panama out of China's Belt and Road Initiative and has supported US immigration enforcement by accepting deportation flights and working to reduce migrant flows through the Darien jungle. \"Panama is, and will continue to be, Panamanian,\" Mulino said, defending his country's stewardship of the canal. Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, praised Mulino’s stance, calling him a partner who “understood the threat from China.” His visit follows a US-led deal in which BlackRock acquired major port operations from Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, a move Trump hailed as an effort to “reclaim” the canal. Analysts say Panama’s cooperation is key. “On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But with Mulino in office, Washington may have found an ally.","summary":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama. He promised collaboration to curb China's influence on the Panama Canal.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), led by Governor Sanjay Malhotra, began its three-day deliberations on Monday, weighing critical factors such as the repo rate, liquidity conditions, CPI inflation, and the GDP growth outlook.\nAdding to the uncertainty, US President Donald Trump last week triggered global concerns by announcing sweeping ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on nearly all imports from over 180 countries. These hefty 27% tariffs, coming into effect on the same day as the RBI’s policy announcement, have heightened fears of a full-blown trade war and a potential global recession. Some analysts are now urging the RBI to consider a 50-basis-point cut to cushion India’s economy against external shocks.\nIn its previous meeting in February, the MPC had already trimmed the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% — the first rate cut since May 2020 and the first policy revision in over two-and-a-half years. Experts believe the central bank may opt for another 25 bps reduction, citing easing inflation and the urgent need to spur economic growth in light of global trade tensions.\nWhere & When to Watch RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra LIVE\nGovernor Sanjay Malhotra will address the media at 10 am on April 9, 2025, after the conclusion of the two-day MPC meeting. His statement will provide clarity on the central bank’s stance regarding GDP growth, inflation forecasts, and potential rate cuts.\nYou can watch the live broadcast of Governor Malhotra’s first MPC statement on RBI’s YouTube channel starting at 10 am on April 9, 2025.\nFor real-time updates and analysis on the RBI’s decisions and their impact on the economy and loan borrowers, News18.com will be live-blogging the developments.\nMPC Meeting Dates: April 7–9, 2025\n\nRepo Rate Announcement: April 9, 2025 at 10:00 AM\n\nRBI Governor’s Press Conference: April 9, 2025 at 12:00 PM\n\nExpectations for a Rate Cut\nEconomists expect another 25 basis point cut to support growth, especially given recent external pressures. Further, the US has imposed a 26 per cent tariff on Indian imports. This is expected to reduce India’s GDP growth for FY2025- 26 by 20–40 basis points, potentially lowering it to around 6.1 per cent from the RBI’s earlier forecast of 6.7 per cent. Bajaj Broking added that this may push the RBI toward further rate cuts to counter economic strain.\nSBI Research pointed out that while India may not see a significant direct impact of US tariffs, it cannot escape the collateral impact of the global growth slowdown.\n“India’s exports to the US is only about 4 per cent of GDP, so direct impact appears limited, though collateral impact from overall global growth slowdown and heightened global financial volatility will take a toll,” said SBI Research.\nAtul Monga, CEO & co-founder of BASIC Home Loan, stated, “We anticipate a 25 basis point reduction in the repo rate at the upcoming MPC meeting. The move is aimed at stimulating economic growth in light of easing inflation. This will provide the necessary boost to key sectors.”\n“The recent rise in trade tensions, marked by higher tariffs imposed by the United States, has raised concerns about their potential impact on India’s economic growth. A significant 50 basis point rate cut in the near term now appears unlikely,” said Ravi Singh, SVP of retail research at Religare Broking.\nSingh expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points this week, as inflation has been brought under control and the rupee has begun to strengthen again. This gives the RBI more room to support growth.\n“The central bank is likely to monitor domestic economic indicators closely and may opt for a series of smaller, gradual rate cuts to stimulate growth while keeping inflation in check,” said Singh.\nExperts expect a cumulative rate reduction of about 100 bps in the current cycle.\n“During February 2025 to March 2026, we expect at least 100 bps cut in repo rate (25 bps already cut in February and another 75 bps rest of FY26), which will transmit exactly the same to EBLR (external benchmark lending rate) and 60 bps in MCLR (marginal cost of funds-based lending rate),” said SBI Research.","summary":"April MPC Meeting 2025: Governor Sanjay Malhotra will address the media on April 9, 2025, after the conclusion of the two-day MPC meeting; Here's how to watch LIVE","url":"https://www.news18.com/business/economy/rbi-mpc-2025-governor-speech-date-time-live-stream-how-to-watch-9291840.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Sanjay-Malhotra-2025-02-e53806e12e28d371cbc0c957b695aaac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:30:04","author":"Aparna Deb,News18","authors":["Aparna Deb","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.018},{"id":309131524,"title":"Maria Bartiromo says America needs someone with a ‘spine of steel’","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nJesse Watters Primetime April 08, 2025 05:03 \n\n Maria Bartiromo says America needs someone with a ‘spine of steel’ \n FOX Business host Maria Bartiromo discusses President Donald Trump's tariffs and how he needs to act quickly to negotiate deals with other countries to limit the negative impact on America’s economy on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRJESSE WATTERS PRIMETIMEPOLITICS","summary":"FOX Business host Maria Bartiromo discusses President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs and how he needs to act quickly to negotiate deals with other countries to limit the negative impact on America’s economy on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371245263112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/310ab41b-d861-4a8e-9093-25ccdad23a82/2954e707-0757-4e75-909b-5aa8fdfeb49e/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:28:20","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.305},{"id":309127240,"title":"ANDREW NEIL: Radical government can get us through this crisis. Starmer is talking the talk - we'll soon know if he can walk the walk","text":"The gap between Keir Starmer’s rhetoric in response to Donald Trump’s tariffs and the measures he proposes to deal with them is wider than the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe paucity of his ambition when it comes to action is depressing.\n\n‘The world has fundamentally changed,’ the Prime Minister told British car workers on Monday. It certainly has – and not in a good way. So why is he proposing only a tweak here and a tinker there for a major UK export industry that now faces a 25 per cent tariff on all the vehicles it sells in the lucrative American market?\n\nAs companies reel from the scope and scale of Trump’s new protectionist wall, Starmer vowed to back business ‘to the hilt’ – on the very week business had to start paying the £25billion a year more in employer National Insurance contributions that were announced by his Chancellor last October.\n\nHe also insisted he was committed to ‘ripping up red tape’ just as his Government launched a new quango – its 28th since taking power – the Orwellian-sounding Equal Pay Regulatory and Enforcement Unit, whose role, among other things, is to monitor the level of a company’s wages by race.\n\nFor all his fine-sounding words Starmer doesn’t grasp the enormity of the challenges now facing our country. We are confronted with two huge national tasks: the need to rearm quickly in the teeth of great and growing geopolitical dangers; and the need to re-equip our economy to survive in Trump’s new Age of Protectionism.\n\nEverything else – the ruinous drive to Net Zero, expensive and bureaucratic labour law reforms, the destructive obsession with ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’, the rise in public spending – needs to be sacrificed to these overriding objectives.\n\nStarmer’s inadequate efforts to help the car industry graphically illustrate how he has yet to appreciate the gravity of the situation.\n\nBritish carmakers may be somewhat beleaguered but there is still a healthy American appetite for prestige vehicles, such as the Range Rover.\n\nThe US is the second biggest export market for cars manufactured in the UK, accounting for 17 per cent of UK car exports last year – around 100,000 vehicles worth more than £8billion in sales revenues. Trump’s 25 per cent tariff is a body blow to this British success story.\n\nYet all Starmer could offer in amelioration were a few fiddles (some already in the pipeline) to UK Government mandates that force British carmakers to produce more electric vehicles, whatever the consumer demand.\n\nJust consider for a moment what is involved here. At a time when the car industry is struggling to make the transition to EVs and Trump has just whacked a massive tariff on its US sales, Starmer is still proposing multi-million pound fines for carmakers who don’t make the number of EVs that his Government deems acceptable.\n\nIt’s crazy and sets a new definition of self-harm.\n\nIt is also a measure of how far the previous Conservative government had lost the plot that all this fiddly state interference was introduced under its watch. Starmer should sweep away all EV mandates and leave it to the industry and the consumer to determine what cars we buy. I think it’s what’s called the market economy.\n\nEV mandates are part of the wider push to Net Zero carbon emissions. That is an extravagant luxury we can no longer afford.\n\nAs has been argued on these pages before, the whole farrago of Net Zero nonsense should be consigned to the dustbin, the multi-billion pound savings transferred to a proper rearmament programme of scale and substance – with money to spare to bolster British businesses that need help to weather Trump’s tariff tsunami. Many will and the Government should be ready to provide temporary aid in the shape of low-interest loans.\n\nThis week Starmer was still droning on about how Net Zero was Britain’s path to the ‘jobs of the future’, despite overwhelming evidence that the job creation is largely in China, which has a firm grip of the global solar panel industry, the EV market and wind turbines.\n\nStarmer needs to move fast. He must slap hefty tariffs on Chinese EVs which already face high tariffs in Europe and America but not here. If we leave our market unprotected, they will flood into Britain, destroying our car industry in the process.\n\nThere are those in the Labour Government, such as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who prioritise Net Zero over well-paid, blue-collar jobs. They would prefer imported EVs to a healthy British car industry, which only shows how far the party has come from its working-class roots under the white-collar metropolitan classes who now control it.\n\nLabour needs to end its job-destroying green obsessions and speed up the development of new small nuclear reactors as well as issue more gas and oil licences in the North Sea, starting with the massive Rosebank field. That would signal Starmer really does understand things have ‘fundamentally changed’.\n\nOf course, the Government faces today’s challenges from a weak fiscal position not of its own making. National debt is 100 per cent of GDP and the annual budget deficit is over 4 per cent.\n\nThe bond markets where governments go to borrow are no longer as tolerant of fiscal excesses as they once were. But Labour still has scope to kickstart the economy if it is so minded. Trump has placed tariffs on lumber, steel and concrete – precisely the ingredients Britain needs to fuel a housing boom. We should signal to the producers of these products that we are very much open for tariff-free business.\n\nA five-year freeze of judicial reviews on new developments would convince people we are. So would a cut in corporation tax. And welfare reforms that produced real savings would free up cash for more productive kinds of spending.\n\nThe PM is right not to retaliate with UK tariffs against American exports. That way lies madness – and a trade war with the US we can’t hope to win.\n\nHowever, America deciding to leave the free-trade world doesn’t mean the UK has to follow suit. Starmer and his ministers should be scouring the world to enhance the existing trade arrangements we already have with the likes of Singapore, South Korea, Australia, Japan and the European Union.\n\nGlobal free trade is obviously much better if America is on board. But, with or without America, free trade can still flourish and we should be in the vanguard of making it so.\n\nPart of the process could also involve a new trade deal with the US. It will not be the ‘full fat’ free trade deal we once hoped for since it will centre on the emergence of artificial intelligence and digital technology.\n\nIt probably won’t mean the end of the minimum 10 per cent tariffs to which Trump has subjected us. But it is better than nothing and could be built on if and when the current madness in the Oval Office takes its leave.\n\nSo there is no need for despair. Bold and radical government can get us through these difficult times. Every problem is also an opportunity.\n\nStarmer has shown he can talk the talk. We shall discover before the year is out if he is up to walking the walk. I fear disappointment.\n\nBut it would be wonderful to be proved wrong.","summary":"The gap between Keir Starmer's rhetoric in response to Donald Trump 's tariffs and the measures he proposes to deal with them is wider than the Grand Canyon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14585031/ANDREW-NEIL-Radical-government-crisis-Starmer-talking-talk-soon-know-walk-walk.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/19/97047995-0-image-m-28_1744137362707.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:25:07","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":309131836,"title":"90s screen siren drapes her slimmed-down frame in stylish look amid Hollywood's Ozempic craze","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Apr 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Lively hit with shock twist as co-star turns AGAINST her in battle against Justin Baldoni\n\nFrom 'pimping out a gay worker' to older men throwing teenage staff over their shoulders... former Foxtons employees tell of how the real estate office was like 'The Wolf of Wall Street'\n\nRevealed: Why Prince Harry skipped wedding of one of his 'band of brothers'\n\nHow to rescue your pension from Trump's tariffs - whatever your age: Experts reveal what to do NOW, whether you're decades from retirement, about to take a lump sum or have already given up work\n\nLIZ JONES: Prince Harry is back in Britain and had an invitation, yet STILL swerved the wedding of one of his 'band of brothers' - and I think I know why\n\nWe moved to Dubai for a better life and thought tax-free earning would make us rich - but we're worse off than in UK\n\nTory MP Michael Fabricant opens up about his polyamorous lifestyle to drag queen Danny Beard as he reveals partner of 35 years as well as several 'deep friendships' on Celebrity Big Brother\n\nSARAH VINE: From wooden forks to Ed Miliband... these are the ten pet hates I'd slap tariffs on if I (and not Donald Trump) were Queen of Everything for a day\n\nI've been to all 92 Football League grounds - this is the definitive list from worst to best and where YOUR club ranks, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nKyrgyzstan will fine women for WEARING full-body niqabs under plan backed by Muslim authority which says garments could hide 'attackers in disguise' and are 'alien to our society'\n\nBBC film dubbed 'the most disturbing ever made' with perfect 100% Rotten Tomatoes score rebooted by Adolescence producers - warning 'a whole new generation will get nightmares'\n\nThe world's biggest beauty breakthroughs: From umbilical cord face masks and earlobe fillers to 'MesoBotox' for over-sized pores, KATE SPICER reveals these revolutionary anti-ageing treatments\n\nAMANDA PLATELL: I've been Amanda Abbington's harshest critic, but this is why I FINALLY feel sorry for her\n\nFit and healthy 25-year-old hit by motor neurone disease - a common night-time symptom was the first major sign\n\nChina is hammered with 104% tariffs as defiant Beijing vows it will 'fight to the end' over levies - despite being warned not to retaliate\n\nReviews dismiss Meghan Markle's latest podcast as an 'inane stream of mindless aphorisms' and 'stomach-turning'\n\nPetite blonde jail boss brought down by a pair of Hugo Boss flip-flops and the DNA of her drugs kingpin lover\n\nMy insurer left me with a £10,000 bill for air ambulance mountain rescue I didn't even need: SALLY SORTS IT\n\nLady Colin Campbell, 75, details her 'roaring, rampant affair' with 'gorgeous' Larry Lamb, 77, and reveals how the Gavin & Stacey star 'pumped testosterone in all directions'\n\nA tale of two cities: Birmingham bin strikes hit city's poorest areas hardest as rubbish overflows into the streets...but posh roads just metres away are spotless\n\nI'm Britain's 'biggest victim of identity theft'... romance fraudsters have used my face and body 400 TIMES to con women - and now they are using AI to send fake videos\n\nThe unlikely English village home of a multi-million pound cocaine smuggling empire run by Eastern European gang\n\nThe 29 things you should pack in your 72-hour 'survival kit' in case of a Russian attack: As security officials warn UK families should be 'prepared for all eventualities', here are the indispensable items for YOUR emergency bag\n\nColon surgeon flags must-know sign of bowel cancer that barely anyone knows about...amid epidemic in under 50s\n\n90s screen siren drapes her slimmed-down frame in stylish look amid Hollywood's Ozempic craze\n\nHave YOU got a story?

Melanie Krause, who had served as acting head since February, will step down over the new data-sharing document signed Monday by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the US illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records. Two people familiar with the situation confirmed Krause was resigning. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss it publicly.

The IRS has seen a string of resignations over Trump administration decisions to share taxpayer data. Acting chief counsel William Paul was removed from his role at the agency and replaced by Andrew De Mello, an attorney in the chief counsel's office who is deemed supportive of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, according to two other people familiar with the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly. The Treasury Department says the agreement will help carry out President Donald Trump's agenda to secure US borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids, and the use of an 18th century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants. Advocates, however, say the IRS-DHS information-sharing agreement violates privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans. The basis for the agreement is founded in “longstanding authorities granted by Congress, which serve to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals,” said a Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the agency's thinking on the agreement. Tom Bowman, policy counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology, said disclosing immigrant tax records to DHS for immigration enforcement \"will discourage tax compliance among immigrant communities, weaken contributions to essential public programs, and increase burdens for U.S. citizens and nonimmigrant taxpayers. It also sets a dangerous precedent for data privacy abuse in other federal programs.” Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, told reporters at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix on Tuesday that the agreement will help ICE find people who are collecting benefits they aren't entitled to and are “kind of hiding in plain sight” using someone else's identity. Working with Treasury and other departments is “strictly for the major criminal cases,” Lyons said. The IRS had already been called upon once to help with immigration enforcement earlier this year. Noem in February sent a request to Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS' boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back. A collection of tax law experts for the NYU Tax Law Center wrote Monday that the IRS-DHS agreement “threatens to violate the rights that many more Americans have under longstanding laws that protect their tax information from wrongful disclosure or dissemination.” “In fact, it is difficult to see how the IRS could release information to DHS while complying with taxpayer privacy statutes,” they said, “IRS officials who sign off on data sharing under these circumstances risk breaking the law, which could result in criminal and civil sanctions.” The memo states that the IRS and ICE “will perform their duties in a manner that recognizes and enhances individuals' right of privacy and will ensure their activities are consistent with laws, regulations, and good administrative practices.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Email jack.hardy@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JACK HARDY \n Published:01:08 BST, 9 April 2025 |Updated:01:16 BST, 9 April 2025 \n\nThe Birmingham bin strike has divided the city in two - with mountains of rubbish piling up in poorer neighbourhoods, while exclusive roads just metres away remain spotless.\nResidents in Balsall Heath have claimed Asian areas are being disproportionately affected by fly-tipping and rats, but the bin strike is barely noticeable in the leafy streets of Moseley and Edgbaston nearby.\nThe scourge of bin bags being dumped in towering piles has been particularly severe in places such as Balsall Heath and Sparkbrook, which have high proportions of Asian residents, particularly of Pakistani heritage.\nThey are also some of the poorest wards in the entire country.\nYet just yards away sit some of the city's most expensive streets, where houses can sell for upwards of £1.5 million - and there is scarcely a bin bag in sight.\nThe stark contrast between the two worlds has not gone unnoticed by those at the epicentre of Birmingham's escalating rubbish crisis.\nHussian, a 76-year-old who lives on Ernest Road in Balsall Heath, told MailOnline: 'It's only the Asian areas. If you go to a white area, it's fine. If you go to Hall Green, Solihull, Oakley, it's fine - everything nice, no rubbish or anything.\n'It stacks here but they never take it. People add to it. Then the rats too. Help us to remove it.'\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nNot a bin bag in sight: Chantry Road in Moseley, where houses sold for an average of £900,000 last year, is free from the grim fly-tipping associated with the bin strike\n\nBut just round the corner from Chantry Road, enormous piles of discarded rubbish lined the streets of Balsall Heath - including on Beaconsfield Road\n\nOpposite the rubbish-strewn streets of Balsall Heath is Amesbury Road, Moseley, where houses sell for up to £1.5 million - and there was no sign of discarded waste\n\n@asrarrashidofficial \nAs Muslims It Is Our Responsibility To Clean The Streets | Shaykh Asrar Rashid #fyp #explorepages #islamic #Birmingham #Brum #Binmen #strikes #islamic_video #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp #rubbish #shaykhasrar #birmingham #sparkhill #birmingham♬ original sound - asrarrashidofficial \nHis views were echoed by local Muslim influencer Asrar Rashid, who said in a recent viral TikTok video: 'Birmingham as a whole, we Muslims are responsible to keep the city clean - unfortunately, we are one of the main reasons this city has become unclean.'\nHe added: 'Every Pakistani household has three cars nowadays for some reason…go to Tyseley tip, book your slot, take the rubbish and make the effort of taking the rubbish yourselves.'\nOn Chantry Road in Moseley, where houses have sold for up to £1.3 million in recent years, there was not a single bin bag visible when MailOnline visited on Tuesday morning.\nIt was an altogether different story just around the corner, however, as the road borders some of the worst affected parts of Balsall Heath, where terraced houses sell for an average of around £150,000.\nPutrid piles of bin bags blocked pavements on Hallam Street, Beaconsfield Road and Edgbaston Road - a walk of just a few minutes from the grand houses nearby. \nAcross the other side of the street is Amesbury Road, Moseley, where houses have sold for as much as £1.5 million. It too appeared spotless.\nA similar pattern was unfolding on the other side of Moseley, where St Agnes Road - one of Birmingham's most expensive streets, lined by £1.4 million houses - showed little sign of being affected by the bin strike.\nBut turning the corner onto Yardley Wood Road - where the majority of properties sold last year were flats worth an average of £114,000 - several huge piles of bin bags were immediately visible, dumped unceremoniously on two patches of grass, nowhere near any bins.\n\nBalsall Heath is one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the country\n\nMountains of rubbish was dumped on Hallam Street, Balsall Heath, despite the area being infested with rats\n\nSt Agnes Road in Moseley is one of the most expensive streets in the city\n\nThere was no sign of any abandoned rubbish outside the grand properties of St Agnes Road\n\nBut just round the corner, on Yardley Wood Road, huge piles of bin bags had been dumped\n\n Coming to a street near you? Birmingham bin strikes could spread across the COUNTRY, says union \nOver in Edgbaston, there were no bin bags visible anywhere on Wellington Road, where houses sold for an average of £2 million last year.\nThe same could not be said round the corner on Spring Road, where an enormous bin bag mountain has formed at the entrance of a social housing complex.\nThe situation was even more dire on Sherlock Street in Highgate, which is a two-minute drive from Wellington Road.\nThere, houses sell for a much more modest average of £154,000 and fly-tipping had reached such extremes that discarded furniture and shopping trolleys lay alongside the bin bags.\nFor residents in the worst-affected areas, the endless fly-tipping is starting to take its toll, particularly when compared to the situation on more affluent roads nearby.\nMohammed Islam, 45, owns a house which borders a vast pile of rubbish in Balsall Heath.\nHe said: 'We've been neglected here. This area has been neglected by the council. It's probably to do with affluent areas. All you can say is that this area is deprived by the council.'\nAs well as the council, he laid the blame at the door of residents from other parts of the city dumping their rubbish outside his home.\n\nHouses on Wellington Road, Edgbaston, cost an average of £2 million - and there was no sign of any rubbish being dumped on the street \n\nYet round the corner, on the less affluent Spring Road, a huge rubbish pile has formed\n\nThe situation is even more dire in nearby Highgate, where fly-tipping is clearly evident on Sherlock Street\n\nSome fly-tippers had even filled an abandoned shopping trolley with their waste\n\n Blind woman fears for her safety in Birmingham as her cane breaks in mountain of rubbish \n'People come from random places, blocking it up, it's awful,' he said.\n'It's overflowing. Outsiders come here and chuck in it, they think it's a dumping ground. They come with their cars and just dump it here. They don't want to (take it to the tip), they're lazy.\n'I haven't opened my window for four weeks.'\nInsurance worker Tariq, 50, has been left frustrated by the contrast between his own area and the relative cleanliness in nearby neighbourhoods.\n'It just seems to be when someone makes a pile, everybody just piles on like a magnet,' he said.\n'I visit Moseley and there's not piles of it there. It could be due to the residents. I think we have more properties and more numbers in the area. We have a lot more bags and nappies.\n'In other areas, they would be quicker to respond to something like that.'\nHamdi, 48, said rats had bitten through the wires in his car, after an explosion in the rodent population due to the amount of discarded rubbish.\n\nResidents of Balsall Heath have been left despairing at the state of their neighbourhood since the city's bin workers went on strike\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting expressed concern about the public health implications of the bin strike\n\n Coming to a street near you? Birmingham bin strikes could spread across the COUNTRY, says union \n'It's very, very bad. Rats and mice. They come here in the night to dump it. Rats have bitten through wires in my car.'\nMother-of-two Sham lives near the mess and said she too cannot even open her windows due to the stench.\n'People see this is a garbage spot and throw all their garbage there,' she said.\nThe intensifying crisis has forced ministers to take a more active role since Birmingham City Council declared a major incident last week.\nThe council is continuing to negotiate with members of the Unite union, whose members launched an all-out strike last month over pay and jobs, but a breakthrough does not appear close.\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting has now warned about the public health situation in Birmingham where the strike has left bin bags 'piling up' and rats 'crawling around'.\n'I certainly am concerned about the public health situation and the poor conditions we're seeing for people in Birmingham,' the Health Secretary told Times Radio.\n'As the bin bags are piling up, we see rats and other vermin crawling around.\n'That's not good for public health. I think this dispute has escalated way out of hand.'\nBirminghamGraphics\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nA tale of two cities: Birmingham bin strikes hit city's poorest areas hardest as rubbish overflows into the streets...but posh roads just metres away are spotless\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, has sent a letter demanding that USA Fencing retract its policy allowing males to compete in women’s fencing – this after female fencer Stephanie Turner refused to compete against a male competitor last week, instead taking a knee and forfeiting the match.\n\nAs reported by OutKick, Cruz wrote, “It has come to my attention that USA Fencing is still permitting men to compete in women’s fencing in violation of federal law.”\n\nWhile USA Fencing is an independent organization that does not receive federal funds, it is the National Governing Body (NGB) for fencing in the U.S. According to Cruz, that means USA Fencing must comply with federal law – notably, President Donald Trump’s executive order that bans transgender athletes from women’s sports – or risk losing its NGB status.\n\n“Male fencers naturally possess inherent advantages over potential female competitors. Men tend to be taller, have greater muscle mass, and more testosterone – all advantages for fencing movements like lunges, jumping, or leg power measures,” the letter states.\n\n“So when I took the knee, I looked at the ref and I said, ‘I’m sorry, I cannot do this. I am a woman, and this is a man, and this is a women’s tournament. And I will not fence this individual.'”\nIt really can be explained this simply. Amazing.https://t.co/ReT8hksViz\n— Riley Gaines (@Riley_Gaines_) April 3, 2025\n\nA previous statement from USA Fencing explains: “USA Fencing enacted our current transgender and non-binary athlete policy in 2023. The policy was designed to expand access to the sport of fencing and create inclusive, safe spaces. The policy is based on the principle that everyone should have the ability to participate in sports and was based upon the research available of the day. … USA Fencing will always err on the side of inclusion, and we’re committed to amending the policy as more relevant evidence-based research emerges, or as policy changes take effect in the wider Olympic & Paralympic movement.”\n\nMeanwhile, as the New York Post reported, Turner, 31, has received a “courage” award from the women’s rights organization XX-XY Athletics along with $5,000.\n\n“By taking a knee, she became more powerful than any male,” XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey said. “She’s a hero.”\n\nMeanwhile, Texas Attorney General, who announced Tuesday he’ll be running for the U.S. Senate, is launching an investigation of the matter over potential violations of state law.\n\n“The investigation will uncover documents related to USA Fencing potentially engaging in false, deceptive, and misleading acts and practices,” Paxton said.\n\n“USA Fencing is on the wrong side of history and potentially the wrong side of the law due to violations of Texas consumer protection laws. USA Fencing’s policies are not only potentially illegal, but also deeply insulting to the young women like Stephanie Turner who have sacrificed so much and dedicated countless hours to compete and succeed in competitions.\n\n“I will fight to stop these unfair policies, and I will never back down from defending the integrity of women’s sports.”","summary":"'Men tend to be taller, have greater muscle mass, and more testosterone'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/04/in-violation-senator-warns-usa-fencing-after-woman-forfeited-match-to-male-competitor/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fencing-knee-stephanie-turner.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:14:49","author":"WND Staff","authors":["WND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.047},{"id":309129110,"title":"UK braced as more US tariffs kick in amid fears of widespread economic damage","text":"Britain is “accelerating trade deals with the rest of the world,” Rachel Reeves insisted as more of Donald Trump’s global tariffs come into effect on Wednesday after a week of market turmoil.\n\nCountries across the globe are braced for potential widespread economic damage from the import taxes, which are scheduled to hit goods entering the US from midnight Washington time and just after 5am in the UK.\n\nThe Chancellor and Business Secretary will later meet India’s finance minister for talks aimed at negotiating a deal with the country as the Chancellor said she wanted to create “the best possible conditions” for British business in a “changing world”.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday reiterated his call for a calm approach to the changed US trade policy as a sense of optimism returned to the financial markets after several days of heavy losses.\n\nHowever, US stocks slid during evening trading on Wall Street after the White House confirmed a 104% tariff rate on some Chinese imports would become a reality.\n\nBeijing had vowed to “fight to the end” and warned of countermeasures after Mr Trump threatened on Monday to raise his levies even further on the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nBritain faces the lowest 10% “baseline” tariff rate and has resisted imposing immediate retaliatory action, unlike the European Union which is due to see a 20% import tax imposed.\n\nMinisters still hope an economic agreement with Washington can be reached to soften the blow of the levy which will hit UK goods, along with a 25% import tax on cars and separate ones for steel and aluminium.\n\nBut the Government will also seek to strengthen trade ties with other countries, including by trying to rebuild ties with the European Union.\n\nThe Chancellor said: “In a changing world, this Government is accelerating trade deals with the rest of the world to back British business and provide the security working people deserve.\n\n“We are going further, faster to create the best possible conditions for British business by working to reduce barriers to trade.”\n\nDiscussions will focus on areas such as defence and jobs creation, investment and trade opportunities, she said.\n\nThe UK has been through more than a dozen rounds of talks since 2022 over a potential agreement with India, which is forecast to become the world’s largest economy.\n\nKey sticking points were said to include visa rules for Indian students and professionals, as well as access for British service firms.\n\nSpeaking to MPs on Parliament’s Liaison Committee on Tuesday, the Prime Minister reiterated his opposition to immediate countermeasures in response to Mr Trump’s tariffs but said all options remained on the table.\n\n“My instinct is that we shouldn’t jump in with both feet to retaliate. So in that sense, I’m not changing my plans,” he said.\n\n“Obviously we have to keep our options on the table and do the preparatory work for retaliation if necessary. But I think that trying to negotiate an arrangement which mitigates the tariffs is better.”\n\nBut Sir Keir indicated he wants to protect the NHS from US commercial interests, and was also “very clear” that a digital tax on big tech firms should remain in place, despite reports the levy could be abolished as part of a deal.\n\n“I have been very protective of the approach we take to the NHS in any dealings with any other country because it is our greatest asset, and we are not trading it away,” he said.\n\nThe tariffs are not a “temporary passing phase” but part of a “changing world order”, the Prime Minister added.\n\nA 10% import tax on goods coming into America from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning, while a 25% levy on foreign cars had come into force on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House is set to impose specific tariffs on about 60 countries it describes as the “worst offenders” in terms of charging higher tariffs on US goods or implementing “non-tariff” barriers to American trade.\n\nThese include the EU, China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, South Africa and Taiwan.\n\nLondon’s FTSE 100 index was up 2.71%, or 208.45 points, on 7,910.53 at the close of trading on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones index and the S&P 500 also jumped and Asian markets rebounded following steep falls in previous days.\n\nBut after roaring to an early gain of 4.1%, which had it on track for its best day in years, the S&P 500 careened all the way to a loss of 2.6%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 683 points, or 1.8%, after giving up an earlier surge of 1,460 points, while the Nasdaq composite was down 3.2%, as of 3.39pm Eastern time (8.39pm BST).\n\nEven after those jumps, analysts had been warning to expect more swings up and down for financial markets in the days ahead.\n\nMr Trump says the tariffs are necessary to narrow trade deficits, which measure how much more the US imports from other countries than it sends to them as exports.\n\nSpeaking to broadcasters on Tuesday evening, health minister Stephen Kinnock said the global headwinds were “very turbulent” and that rebuilding relations with Brussels would be key to protecting the UK.\n\n“We live in an incredibly deeply integrated global economy with very integrated supply chains and hugely interdependent commercial relationships, so nobody benefits from a trade war,” he told Sky News.\n\nHe said the UK was focused on strengthening ties with the EU, developing an industrial strategy to enable Britain to “stand firmly on its own two feet” and negotiating an agreement with the US.\n\n“I think the combination of those three things is going to help us to weather the storm,” the minister said.","summary":"Countries across the world are braced for potential widespread economic damage from Donald Trump’s global tariffs.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-countries-european-union-b1221448.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/04/09/00/153ba212a0edcc6974f354fe68f001f3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQ0MjM2MTAy-2.79370605.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:12:38","author":"Pa Reporters","authors":["Pa Reporters"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.126},{"id":309132728,"title":"Apple’s iPhone exports from India surge to ₹1.5 lakh crore in FY25: Ashwini Vaishnaw","text":"Apple Inc. exported more than ₹1.5 lakh crore ($17.4 billion) in iPhones from India in the last fiscal year, the nation’s technology minister said Tuesday, underscoring the company’s efforts to diversify away from China.\n\nAs iPhone exports shot up, India has shipped out smartphones worth more than ₹2 lakh crore in the fiscal year through March 2025, a jump of 54% from the previous year, tech minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at a briefing in New Delhi. \n\nApple has rapidly expanded in India after strict Covid shutdowns paralysed manufacturing at its largest iPhone plant in China. The diversification drive has coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub. India’s subsidies have helped Foxconn Technology Group and the electronics manufacturing unit of Tata Group, which bought Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp.’s India factories, scale up local iPhone assembly. \n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n\nUS President Donald Trump’s levies on China — and his threat to impose a further 50% tariff — could push Apple to move more manufacturing toward India and countries in Southeast Asia. Still, a complete shift away from the company’s longtime manufacturing hub is unlikely in the short term.\n\nSeparately, Apple has been stocking up on inventory in anticipation of the tariffs. And it’s steering more devices made in India to the US market, Bloomberg News has reported. The Trump administration announced plans to impose a “reciprocal” tariff of about 27% on India, a lower level than China.\n\nApple still ships roughly four-fifths of its iPhones from China, despite efforts to shift production to countries like India and Vietnam. Rebuilding its complex industrial ecosystem elsewhere has been costly and will likely take years.\n\nChina’s robust supply chain is seen as one of the factors giving President Xi Jinping confidence as he negotiates with Trump and projects a defiant image to a domestic audience.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nPublished on April 9, 2025","summary":"This contributed to India’s total smartphone exports exceeding ₹2 lakh crore for the year, marking a 54% jump from FY24","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/apples-iphone-exports-from-india-surge-to-15-lakh-crore-in-fy25-ashwini-vaishnaw/article69429592.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/odzrxf/article69429595.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/22_Ashwini_Vaishnaw_Briefing_19_03_Delhi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:11:58","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":309128700,"title":"Washington unveils date and agenda of next Russia-US talks","text":"The next round of talks aimed at improving US-Russia diplomatic ties will take place in Istanbul, Türkiye, on Thursday, the US State Department has confirmed.\n\nWashington and Moscow have held several rounds of high-level meetings since US President Donald Trump took office, with the next round of negotiations expected in the coming days, the Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier on Tuesday.\n\n“On April 10, US and Russian delegations will meet for a second time in Istanbul to try to make progress on further stabilizing the operations of our bilateral missions,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce confirmed at a press briefing later in the day.\n\nThe US official emphasized that the upcoming talks are “solely focused on our embassy operations, not on normalizing a bilateral relationship overall, which can only happen, as we’ve noted, once there is peace between Russia and Ukraine.”\n\n“There are no political or security issues on the agenda, and Ukraine is not – absolutely not – on the agenda,” she added.\n\nIn recent years, Russia and the US have cut diplomatic staff at each other’s missions, imposed banking restrictions, and seized diplomatic properties. The escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 further deepened tensions and led to additional measures.\n\nTrump, however, has moved away from many Biden-era policies, calling for a swift resolution to the Ukraine conflict and a reset in bilateral ties. The first meeting between Russian and US high-level delegations took place in Riyadh on February 18, focusing on restoring embassy operations and easing restrictions. A follow-up round in Istanbul on February 27 addressed diplomatic funding and Russia’s proposal to reinstate direct flights.\n\nAccording to Moscow, the venue, format, and participants of this week’s talks will remain unchanged.

Getting countries to discuss new terms on tariffs could be a sign of progress for the Trump administration, which touched off a global trade war that escalated further on Monday when Trump threatened to increase duties on China and the European Union proposed counter-tariffs of its own.\n\nTimeWorld Leaders Scramble as Trump Tariffs Set to Kick in at MidnightA 104% tax on Chinese imports is among the Trump tariffs set to take effect Wednesday.

Despite Trump's push, some of the Republicans told the president they could not support the Senate package without a commitment to steeper cuts.\n\n“I’m tired of the fake math in the swamp,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a Freedom Caucus leader, before heading to the White House.\n\nAfter meeting with Trump, Roy was among those unmoved. “I’m still a no.”\n\nThe standoff between the House and the Senate over what Trump calls his “big, beautiful bill” is exposing the limits of the GOP's long campaign to cut federal spending, especially at a time of economic unrest. Trump's trade wars, the mass layoffs of thousands of federal workers and Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency slashing through government, are all upending the debate.\n\nWith the financial markets roiling over Trump’s tariffs and the economy teetering as worries of a recession flare, the Republican speaker insisted there is no time to waste. Johnson is pulling out all the stops as he scrounges for votes to nudge the process forward before lawmakers leave town Thursday for a two week spring recess.\n\n“We’ve got to get this done,” Johnson said earlier in the day.\n\nRepublicans, in control of the White House and Congress, are trying to muscle Trump's signature domestic policy bill closer to passage, ensuring some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks approved during his first term don't expire at year's end. But House Republicans are demanding as much as $2 trillion in budget cuts over the decade, to help offset the costs of the tax breaks, while Senate Republicans, who stayed up late to pass their package early Saturday morning, are hesitant to go that far.\n\nFacing unified opposition to the package from Democrats, who see the GOP package as a tax giveaway to the wealthy paid for by reductions in Medicaid, food stamps and other vital government services, Republicans are struggling to resolve their differences and craft a final product.\n\nThe uproar has thrown the week's schedule into uncertainty, with a planned Wednesday vote potentially pushing to Thursday, or even later.\n\nTrump weighed in late Monday on social media, urging swift action.\n\n“There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!” the president posted on social media. “Everyone is going to be happy with the result. Passage will make, even the subject of World Trade, far easier and better for the U.S.A. THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nBut Trump's demands failed to move many of the House conservatives unmoved.\n\n“The rest of America has to do math and balance their budget. I think we ought to do math here in Washington D.C.,” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., who attended the White House meeting. “It doesn’t take a calculus wiz to know that doesn’t add up.”\n\nLawmakers said several dozen Republicans are withholding their support.\n\nRep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., said the Senate cuts are “anemic.”\n\n“I couldn’t sleep at night if I was part of exacerbating the federal deficit,” Burlison said. “While there might be some over there who have an appetite for some of the spending cuts, it’s clear that not everyone does.”\n\nWhile Republican senators have agreed to consider as much as $2 trillion in cuts, their counterparts in the House are deeply skeptical, if not distrustful, that the Senate GOP will accomplish anywhere near that level of reductions. The Senate bill sets a much lower floor, just $4 billion in cuts, though Senate GOP leaders insist that number will rise.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he does not believe the Senate has the political will to stomach larger cuts and is unconvinced the GOP senators will reach anywhere near the level the House has set.\n\n“The trustworthiness of the Senate is suspect,” Norman said. “It's like you charge for your house $100,000, And I come back with $1,000. How do you bridge that gulf?”\n\nIn fact, the Senate GOP signaled the tough road ahead for the House's steep spending reductions during their lengthy overnight session.\n\nSeveral Republicans including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voted with Democrats in favor of amendments to preserve the Medicaid health care program from cuts. None of the amendments was accepted, but one that specifically targeted the $800 billion in reductions from the House framework won GOP support.\n\nJohnson is nowhere near the vote tally he would need to pass the package through with his slim majority.\n\nDuring a morning meeting of House Republicans a number of lawmakers spoke out — some saying they should simply accept the Senate resolution for now and keep working out the details toward the final package. Others were refusing to go forward without assurances that senators were committed to the same level of reductions.\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

That has led to programs being cut, restored then cut again, disrupting international humanitarian operations.\n\nUSAID Acting Deputy Administrator Jeremy Lewin, who has previously been identified as a member of billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, asked staff in an internal email to reverse the terminations.\n\nHe asked to restore awards to the World Food Program in Lebanon, Syria, Somalia, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, five sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe administration has also resumed four awards to the International Organization for Migration in the Pacific region, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"Sorry for all the back and forth on awards,\" Lewin said on Tuesday in the internal email seen by Reuters. \"There are a lot of stakeholders and we need to do better about balancing these competing interests — that’s my fault and I take responsibility,\" he added.\n\nReuters reported on Monday that the Trump administration had ended life-saving aid programs for more than a dozen countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Syria, totaling over $1.3 billion.\n\nAccording to Stand Up For Aid, an advocacy group of current and former U.S. officials, WFP contracts canceled on Lewin’s orders last weekend for Lebanon, Syria, Somalia and Jordan totaled more than $463 million.\n\nMany of the terminated programs had been granted waivers by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio following an initial round of cuts to foreign aid programs. The State Department said those did not reflect a final decision.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about restoring the awards.\n\nA 'DEATH SENTENCE'\n\nThe decision to restore some aid followed pressure from inside the administration and from Congress, two sources said.\n\nThe World Food Program said on Monday that the U.S. notified the organization it was eliminating emergency food assistance funding in 14 countries, warning: \"If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation.\"\n\nThe U.S. did not restore aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and to Yemen, most of which is controlled by Islamist militants of the Iran-backed Houthi movement. Washington has been the largest aid donor to both countries, which have suffered years of devastating war.\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce on Tuesday told reporters that the United States had concerns that WFP funding for Yemen and Afghanistan was benefiting the Houthis and the Taliban.\n\n\"There were a few programs that were cut in other countries that were not meant to be cut that have been rolled back and put into place,\" Bruce said, adding that the administration remains committed to foreign aid.\n\nAmong the cuts over the weekend were $169.8 million for the WFP in Somalia, covering food assistance, nutrition for malnourished babies and children and humanitarian air support. In Syria, $111 million was cut from WFP food assistance.\n\nThe cuts have been the latest piece of the Trump administration's drive to dismantle USAID, the main U.S. humanitarian aid agency.\n\nThe administration has canceled billions of dollars in foreign aid since the Republican president began his second term on January 20 in an overhaul that officials described as marked by chaos and confusion.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats on Tuesday wrote a letter to Rubio regarding plans to restructure the State Department, including by folding in USAID, which they said was \"unconstitutional, illegal, unjustified, damaging, and inefficient.\"\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday moved to reinstate at least six recently canceled U.S. foreign aid programs for emergency food assistance, six sources familiar with the matter…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/exclusive-trump-administration-moves-to-restore-some-terminated-foreign-aid-programs-sources-say","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/f6/53/9b5b58171f7d76c1bbd04d04f60fedacd7c0/tag:reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:04:42","author":"Japan Today Editor,Jonathan Landay","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Jonathan Landay"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":309131544,"title":"DOJ releases documents on alleged Trump would-be assassin Ryan Routh","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report April 08, 2025 02:11 \n\n DOJ releases documents on alleged Trump would-be assassin Ryan Routh \n Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins has updates on the investigation into the September assassination attempt on then-candidate Donald Trump on 'Special Report.'\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRSPECIAL REPORTPOLITICSUS","summary":"Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins has updates on the investigation into the September assassination attempt on then-candidate Donald Trump on &apos;Special Report.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371242703112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/a95786f1-4698-47b8-bcd6-f3aa74f4c594/fcb1b00c-2e80-4c21-962e-88cf9a4757ab/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-09 00:04:35","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.646},{"id":309131844,"title":"Inside Brad and Angelina's daughter Shiloh's transformation as 18-year-old moves on from tomboy phase","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Apr 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Lively hit with shock twist as co-star turns AGAINST her in battle against Justin Baldoni\n\nFrom 'pimping out a gay worker' to older men throwing teenage staff over their shoulders... former Foxtons employees tell of how the real estate office was like 'The Wolf of Wall Street'\n\nRevealed: Why Prince Harry skipped wedding of one of his 'band of brothers'\n\nRICHARD KAY: What an outrage that Harry's scene stealing should come at the expense of his cancer-stricken father\n\nWhy Trump's tariffs could open up a golden window to bag bargain TVs, clothes, mortgages and energy deals\n\nWe moved to Dubai for a better life and thought tax-free earning would make us rich - but we're worse off than in UK\n\nTory MP Michael Fabricant opens up about his polyamorous lifestyle to drag queen Danny Beard as he reveals partner of 35 years as well as several 'deep friendships' on Celebrity Big Brother\n\nANDREW NEIL: Radical government can get us through this crisis.

'She said she'd be a horned creature.' Instead, the role of the young Aurora went to her younger sister Vivienne, while Shiloh opted for a voiceover role in Kung Fu Panda two years later for her Hollywood debut. \nWhen her 18th birthday arrived, there was no lavish party. She celebrated by hiring and paying for her own lawyer to drop her father's surname, going from Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt to Shiloh Nouvel Jolie amid her parents' bitter divorce battle. \nIt should have come as no surprise to 'Brangelina' fans as the couple were known before their split who followed the couple's unconventional family set-up as they travelled the world with their posse of six children - three adopted and three biological.\nWhile all the Jolie-Pitt children have provoked fascination, Shiloh has long been the most individual in the family and was determined to forge her own path from the age of two, when she insisted she was a boy called John, and would only wear the same clothes as her brothers.\nWhile she's since evolved out of her tomboy phase, the 18-year-old has been training for years with the Millennium Dance Complex in LA - where staff initially had no idea who her famous parents were. \n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt 's daughter Shiloh could be set to follows in her parents' famous footsteps to stardom \n\nShiloh has also been turning heads with her new look after moving on from her suit wearing tomboy phase where she preferred to be called John (pictured 2014)\n\nIn 2021 Shiloh (L) took to the red carpet in a revamped version of her mother's Dior dress to the Eternals UK premiere in London (R, Angelina pictured 2019) \nShiloh has also been turning heads with her new look after moving on from her suit wearing tomboy phase where she preferred to be called John.\nThe teen's new glam style has seen her grow out her blonde locks and sport gorgeous gowns on the red carpet alongside Angelina, 49. \nLast month fans were sent wild when they spotted Shiloh wearing a 'cool' safety pin earring, which they took as a direct nod to her mum's 90s punk rock style.\nMeanwhile in 2021 she stunned in a revamped version of her mother's Dior dress to the Eternals UK premiere in London. \nShiloh put her own spin on the look, which Angelina wore two-years earlier, and cut the flowing gown to above the knee.\nSpeaking about her daughter's style Angelina told Reuters: 'I think she is fascinating, the choices she is making'.\nThe Oscar winner previously shared insight into Shiloh's tomboy phase saying the youngster considered herself to be 'one of the brothers'.\n\nIn May, her longtime choreographer, Keelan Carter, revealed to DailyMail.com that the teenager could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood ' nepo baby ' (pictured 2023) \n\nThe teen's new glam style has seen her grow out her blonde locks and sport gorgeous gowns on the red carpet alongside Angelina (C) with Shiloh (R) and sister Zahara (L) in 2021\nAngelina and Brad, who reached a divorce settlement in December 2024 following a contentious eight-year legal battle, are also parents to sons Maddox, 23, Pax, 20, Knox, 16, as well as daughters Zahara, 19, and Vivienne, 16. \n'She wants to be a boy,' she told Vanity Fair in 2011. 'So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers.'\nApparently coining a new fashion term, she said: 'Shiloh, we feel, has Montenegro style. She dresses like a little dude. It's how people dress there. She likes tracksuits, she likes [regular] suits.'\nBack in 2008 it was revealed that Shiloh had requested she be addressed as John since the age of two.\n\nShiloh, who dropped her estranged father's surname , is a talented dancer who has been praised by her teacher for her dedication and 'consistency'\n\nThe teen looks a dead ringer for her famous mother (pictured together in 2021)\n\nSpeaking about her daughter's style Angelina said: 'I think she is fascinating, the choices she is making' (pictured 2021)\n\nFans were sent wild when they spotted Shiloh wearing a 'cool' safety pin earring , which they took as a direct nod to her mum's 90s punk rock style (R, Angelina in 1995 film Hackers) \n\nAngelina previously shared insight into Shiloh's tomboy phase and androgynous look, saying the youngster considered herself to be 'one of the brothers' (pictured in 2018)\n\nBrad, 61, told Oprah Winfrey: 'She only wants to be called John. John or Peter. So it's a Peter Pan thing. So we've got to call her John. 'Shi, do you want…' 'John. I'm John.' And then I'll say, 'John, would you like some orange juice?' And she goes, 'No!'.\n'So, you know, it's just that kind of stuff that's cute to parents and it's probably really obnoxious to other people.'\nAddressing the name change at the time, Angelina said that there was no need to 'interpret' anything from the request.\n\n Angelina Jolie, 49, is being confronted with early 'empty nest syndrome' as one kid has already moved out \nIn an interview with The Daily Mail, Angelina said: 'I don't think it's for the world to interpret anything. She likes to dress like a boy and wants her hair cut like a boy and she wanted to be called John for a while.\n'Some kids wear capes and want to be Superman and she wants to be like her brothers. It's who she is. It's been a surprise to us and it's really interesting, but she's so much more than that – she's funny and sweet and pretty. But she does love a tie…'\nAngelina revealed during an interview with Good Morning America that Shiloh is 'extremely private' as are her siblings.\nAngelina stated: 'None of my children want to be in front of the camera [at] this time.' \nWhile Shiloh has spent the majority of her childhood out of the spotlight, she made her acting debut at age two in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, alongside her dad, and had a few lines in her mother's animated film, Kung Fu Panda 3, in 2016.\nAt age eight, she turned down the opportunity to be in her mom's 2014 film Maleficent. \n'I asked Shiloh about being Aurora, and she laughed in my face,' Angeline told Elle at the time. 'She said she'd be a horned creature.' \nHer younger sister, Vivienne, ultimately took on the role and Shiloh has reportedly spent the past few years focusing on a career in dance.\nIn 2022, a source told HollywoodLife that 'Angelina has made a huge effort to nurture her kids' interests in all kinds of things' and 'enrolled them in everything from art classes to computer programming to martial arts and, at one point or another, all the kids have tried out dance lessons.' \n\nBrad, 61, told Oprah Winfrey: 'She only wants to be called John. John or Peter. So it's a Peter Pan thing. So we've got to call her John (pictured 2014)\n\nBrad said: 'So, you know, it's just that kind of stuff that's cute to parents and it's probably really obnoxious to other people' (pictured 2010)\n\nAddressing the name change at the time, Angelina said that there was no need to 'interpret' anything from the request (pictured 2019)\nAfter seeing that Shiloh was a natural at dance, the performer made a 'big point to nurture that.' \n'Shiloh started out with private lessons before she joined a small studio near their house and then all through the pandemic, she was doing zoom classes. She's very committed to it,' the insider revealed. 'Angelina's amazed by how talented Shiloh is, but more than that she loves to see how happy Shiloh is when she's dancing.'\nShiloh, or 'Shi' to her friends and family, first wowed the world with her dance skills in 2021, when a video of her performing went viral. \nShiloh has been a member of Millennium Dance Complex for many years and has gone viral for her moves a number of times. \n\n Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's daughter Vivienne, 16, enjoys lunch date in rare outing after parents' divorce \nIn May, her longtime choreographer, Keelan Carter, revealed to DailyMail.com that the teenager could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood 'nepo baby.' \n'Shiloh is an exceptionally talented dancer, demonstrating dedication and hard work,' the accomplished choreographer, actor and fashion designer continued.\n'She is a sincere and straightforward person who never uses her celebrity status to her advantage.'\n'Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals. Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio.\n'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her. Believe me, it is worth it.'\nKeelan told DailyMail.com that his recent dance videos featuring Shiloh 'were made in the same way I post any dancer who comes to my sessions or classes and whom I believe deserves to be featured.'\nKeelan has posted numerous videos featuring Shiloh, as have several of her other dance class colleagues, but the famous daughter is rarely tagged in any of the videos, as they all respect her privacy, DailyMail.com was told. \nAlthough Angelina - who worked with the the UN Refugee Agency for more than two decades - has not commented specifically on Shiloh's dance, she has spoken out about fostering the unique talents of all of her children. \n\nShiloh, or 'Shi' to her friends and family, first wowed the world with her dance skills in 2021, when a video of her performing went viral (pictured 2023) \n'Children should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish without anybody judging them because it is an important part of their growth,' she once said in an interview with Reuters.\nIn 2022, Shiloh's dad, Brad, gushed about his daughter's dance ability to Entertainment Tonight while promoting his film Bullet Train.\nHe called Shiloh 'very beautiful' and said that her talent 'brings a tear the eye.'\n'I don't know where she got it from. I'm Mr. Two-Left-Feet here,' Brad told ET at time.\nShiloh's dance talent has been recognised since 2021 when a video of her dancing to Vegas by Rihanna was shared on YouTube by LA-based choreographer Hamilton Evans.\nShe took centere stage at Millennium Dance Complex in Studio City to perform an energetic one-minute routine while flanked by two other girls.\nAnother video saw Shiloh busting her best moves to Lizzo's About Damn Time, while the rest of her dance troupe watched on from behind.\n'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time.\n'She's made some good friends through the dancing community too, and they're all in chat groups and share their favoruite playlists and that type of stuff.\n'The teachers are all very impressed with her and say the sky's the limit if she wants to take it to the next level, and Shiloh may just do that.'\nThe source added: 'Brad and Angie are both very proud. They'd have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they're not pushing it on her by any means.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside Brad and Angelina's daughter Shiloh's transformation as 18-year-old moves on from tomboy phase\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 16\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden, a Trump appointee, said that the White House acted against the First Amendment, which prohibits discrimination based on viewpoints, by blocking the longtime publication’s access over its refusal to use the term \"Gulf of America.\" \"The Government offers no other plausible explanation for its treatment of the AP. The Constitution forbids viewpoint discrimination, even in a nonpublic forum like the Oval Office,\" McFadden wrote. \"Under the First Amendment, if the Government opens its doors to some journalists—be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere—it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,\" he added. \"The Constitution requires no less.\" ASSOCIATED PRESS SAYS IT WAS BARRED FROM OVAL OFFICE OVER USE OF 'GULF OF MEXICO' McFadden ruled the White House must restore AP’s press access but delayed the order for one week to allow the White House a chance to appeal. After President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the \"Gulf of Mexico\" to the \"Gulf of America\" on his first day in office, the AP issued style guidance for how the news outlet would refer to the body of water. \"The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,\" the guidelines state. The White House blocked AP from the Oval Office and Air Force One in February over its refusal to use the term \"Gulf of America.\" White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich wrote on X at the time, \"The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation. While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One.\" Days before, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had said that \"it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America, and I’m not sure why news outlets don’t want to call it that.\" In a statement Tuesday, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton expressed gratitude for the decision. \"We are gratified by the court’s decision,\" Easton said. \"Today’s ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. NYT COLUMNIST 'SYMPATHETIC' TO TRUMP ADMIN BARRING AP FROM OVAL OFFICE, AIR FORCE ONE In a comment to Fox News Digital, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression public advocacy director Aaron Terr celebrated the decision as a win for the First Amendment. \"This decision is a clear victory for press freedom,\" Terr said. \"The court held tight to the basic First Amendment principle that the government can’t punish journalists just because it doesn’t like their views or reporting.

John Cornyn - AP News","text":"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is running for the U.S. Senate in a primary challenge against Republican Sen. John Cornyn, setting up what is likely to become one of the GOP’s most contentious and expensive contests of 2026.\n\nPaxton, a close ally of President Donald Trump, announced his decision Tuesday in an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham after spending more than a year openly flirting with a Senate challenge. During that time, Paxton has sought to position himself as a national leader among the GOP’s ascendant hard right, launching some of the first criminal investigations in the U.S. over abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth.\n\n“I’m running for U.S. Senate to fight for President Trump’s agenda and take a sledgehammer to the D.C. establishment,” Paxton said in a post on X. “Together, let’s send John Cornyn packing.”\n\nHis decision to enter the race highlights his political resiliency and popularity among Texas Republicans after a decade of legal woes that, at times, seemed to imperil his future: felony securities fraud charges, impeachment after an extraordinary revolt by his closest aides and an FBI corruption investigation. Paxton reached a deal to end the criminal case, was acquitted in a historic impeachment trial in the Texas Senate, and the Biden administration quietly decided not to prosecute him. \n\nCornyn, a respected and popular senator within the GOP conference in Washington, will likely now have to face his most competitive campaign since taking office in 2002. \n\nHe recently lost his bid to lead the GOP as Senate majority leader in November after he spent several years as Sen. Mitch McConnell’s No. 2 in leadership. A former Texas attorney general and state Supreme Court justice, Cornyn has helped the party raise millions of dollars throughout his decades-long career and has worked with Democrats on bipartisan bills.\n\nCornyn has received criticism from Paxton and other Republicans after he suggested that Trump might not be the best Republican candidate for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nPaxton has also expressed discontent with Cornyn’s support of a 2022 bipartisan gun bill that strengthened background checks for buyers under 21, increased prosecution for unlicensed sellers and funds for youth mental health services in the wake of the Uvalde, Texas, elementary school shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers.\n\nAmidst several legal battles, the Texas attorney general has become a well-known figure on the right for his litigation against former President Joe Biden. Notably, Paxton led a lawsuit attempting to overturn Trump’s loss to Biden in 2020, an effort that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected. \n\nIn 2023, the Texas House voted to impeach Paxton for bribery offenses related to a wealthy real estate donor. He was later acquitted in the Senate following a two-week trial. The Justice Department decided not to pursue its investigation into Paxton over the allegations in the final weeks of former President Biden’s term, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.\n\nA district court judge in April awarded $6.6 million combined to four former senior Paxton aides in their lawsuit against his office after they were fired shortly after reporting Paxton’s office to the FBI for bribery allegations.\n\nAssociated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report. \n\nNadia Lathan is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

It would take years for the United States to build the number of factories necessary to produce the goods that we currently import.

Some industry lobby groups, including export bodies, have told the government to expedite BTA talks, the first part of which is to be concluded in six months.India is keen on pushing ahead with the BTA and wants it to be firmed up by fall 2025. It had been announced during talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump during the former’s US visit in February.Both sides are aiming to more than double two-way trade to $500 billion by 2030.Currently, the PLI scheme covers 14 sectors, including mobile phones, drones, white goods, telecom, textiles, automobiles, specialty steel and pharmaceuticals, with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.Officials said local manufacturers in several of these sectors can withstand zero import duty. One official said that duty concessions could be offered to those products where labour costs favour India.“The Indian industry for most sectors is robust enough, specially post-manufacturing incentives like PLI, and should be amenable to lower tariffs, making the current scenario an opportunity to become competitive in the global value chains,” said Bipin Sapra, tax partner, EY India. “Offering zero for zero tariffs would allow India to capture the US market in sectors it has been pushing to increase its exports and will in turn boost Make in India.”Another person said the US is also keen on stringent value addition norms to ensure thirdcountry goods are not routed through India. In some sectors, a higher level of value addition could be examined.Most trade pacts, including free trade agreements that New Delhi has inked, mandate a value addition of about 35% with a change in tariff heading at the four-digit level, ensuring substantial transformation.","summary":"India is considering zero-duty imports from the US in various sectors, including those under the PLI scheme, to expedite a bilateral trade agreement and reverse reciprocal tariffs.

This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution,” she said in a statement.\n\nThe news organisation sued three senior aides to the Trump administration in February, saying the restrictions were unlawful and infringed upon press freedom.\n\nThe lawsuit specifically named Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration have argued that the Associated Press does not have a right to “special access” to the president.\n\nSoon after taking office in January, the Trump administration signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”, a move the White House said reflects the gulf’s status as “an indelible part of America”.\n\nThe AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration’s efforts to rename it.\n\nIn response, the administration began clamping down on the AP’s access to White House events covered by the “pool” of journalists that cover smaller events and report back to other media outlets.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press&#8217;s access to presidential events after the White House blocked the agency in a dispute over the term &#8220;Gulf of America&#8221;.

The weekend event at the school in Sarasota is set to be a conversation about free speech and cultural power. “While the justice system independently addresses other matters, our responsibility is to ensure a space where ideas — especially those that invite dialogue such as the topic of cancel culture and free speech, can be explored with respect, critical thought, and intellectual integrity,” Alexandra Nicole Islas, New College’s director of public policy events, said in a statement Tuesday. Representatives for Brand, who has denied the rape and sexual assault charges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Brand was charged with two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault, North London Chief Crown Prosecutor Jaswant Narwal said Friday. The charges are related to allegations of incidents from 1999 to 2005 involving four women, she said. He denied the allegations in a video on his social media platforms, including X, and said he intended to fight the charges. “I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,” he said in the video. “I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in nonconsensual sexual activity — I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.” Detectives began investigating Brand, the “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” star, in September 2023 after The Sunday Times newspaper and British broadcaster Channel 4 reported accusations by four women.  On Saturday, Brand will appear at the New College of Florida for an interview by Mark Famiglio, chairman of the Sarasota Film Festival and founder of a biotech company. “This is a reflection of our commitment to civil discourse,” Islas said. Famiglio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brand, once an admitted hell-raiser and Hollywood malcontent, and public New College of Florida have both taken rightward turns toward conservative politics. Brand, who was once married to the pop star Katy Perry, has deepened his involvement in conservative politics, appearing in September onstage with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and showing up at the Republican National Convention in July. More recently, he has regularly used his social media platforms to support President Donald Trump. He converted to Christianity and swore off the vices of his days as a big-screen star. He’s due in court in London on May 2. In early 2023, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, appointed a conservative majority to the liberal-leaning New College board of trustees, beginning a makeover of the institution and aligning it with the political right.","summary":"New College of Florida on Saturday will host actor, comedian and right-wing wellness influencer Russell Brand, days after he was charged with rape and sexual assault in the United Kingdom.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/russell-brand-new-college-florida-free-speech-rape-rcna200311","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250408-russell-brand-2024-ac-511p-c1e989.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:58:43","author":"Austin Mullen,Dennis Romero","authors":["Austin Mullen","Dennis Romero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":0.091},{"id":309132726,"title":"Oil plunges to 4-year low as trade war threatens global demand","text":"Oil extended a brutal selloff that’s driven prices to a four-year low as an intensifying trade war threatens to batter global energy demand.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate fell for a fifth day, losing as much as 3.3% to $57.64 a barrel, after Brent closed below $63 on Tuesday.

He also wrote that weapons get lost \"all the time on the battlefield\" and \"one missing would not be noticed,\" Fox News reported.\n\nFederal authorities believe that the plot orchestrated by Routh was not impromptu, and he had been planning it for at least six months.\n\nEarlier, US media reported that Routh contacted the armed forces of Ukraine several times, and travelled to Ukraine after 2022.\n\nOn September 15, the FBI announced a new investigation into the shooting incident at the Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump was staying at the moment. The incident is seen as a possible assassination attempt on the politician.

John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) lamenting that the United States has not been able to sell hamburgers in Australia.\n\nThe post also says that Australia has sold $29 billion worth of beef in the United States, and suggests that Wyoming ranchers are happy with Trump’s tariff move.\n\nA number of countries have been hit with much higher reciprocal tariffs including China, the EU, Switzerland, Vietnam, and Taiwan.\n\nDubbed “Liberation Day” tariffs, they apply to all imports entering the United States, impacting $3 trillion worth of goods.\n\nThe post comes after Trump praised the Australian people while, at the same time, arguing the United States should protect its own farmers.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates the major type of beef, 70 to 80 percent, exported to the United States is lean grinding beef. It also imports the more premium Wagyu beef from Australia.\n\nWhile the new tariff is becoming a domestic political issue and weighing on local markets, the Australian Treasury predicted on April 7 that their impact on the economy would be modest.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers asked the secretary of the Treasury to release modelling spelling out how the economy will react.\n\n“However, this modelling does not fully capture the negative impact of trade hostilities. It does not capture the impact of uncertainty, volatility in financial and economic markets, or the potential for additional trade disruptions,” Treasury added.\n\nAustralia’s gross domestic product (GDP) is predicted to fall by 0.1 percent and inflation to increase by 0.2 percent due to the tariffs, according to the Treasury.\n\n“Over the medium-term, Australia’s GDP is permanently lower, while the effect on inflation is temporary,” it said.\n\nThe treasury suggested that the impacts of tariffs on GDP in China would be higher than in Australia.\n\n“The effects on GDP in China and other countries facing relatively high U.S. tariffs are also expected to be significant. Retaliatory actions further amplifies the impacts. GDP in China is estimated to be around 0.6 percent lower relative to a no tariff scenario, almost entirely reflecting the U.S. tariff changes,”\n\nChina was hit with a 34 percent U.S. tariff on “Liberation Day” and responded with the same on all U.S. goods. Trump is now threatening to impose an additional 50 percent tariff.","summary":"Trump took to social media to endorse the view of Sen.

Seeing how it all works out is going to be fascinating. \n'The team making the show are expecting it to be quite different to the regular version because the celebrities will be less motivated by the prize fund but care far more about how they come across. \n'It will be really interesting to see how the gameplay compares, along with which tactics they employ. Hopefully one thing that will remain the same is that it will be a lot of fun to watch.' \n\nCharlotte Church has reportedly signed up for the upcoming series of Celebrity Traitors (host Claudia Winkleman pictured)\n\nThe Welsh singer, 39, is thought to be joining the likes of Kate Garraway and Bob Mortimer in the famous Scottish castle\nA representative for Charlotte and the BBC have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. \nIt comes after last week it was reported that BBC bosses are taking desperate measures to keep the star-studded cast under wraps after a string of leaks. \nAccording to The Sun, executives have put in place a military-style operation to transport the all-star cast to Ardross Castle. \nInstead of flying into Inverness Airport from their homes across the globe, the celebrities will travel by several means including rail, air, car, and boat. \nAnd a no-fly zone is officially in place over host Claudia Winkleman's, 53, Highlands HQ to stop drone photographers from securing any images. \nA source told the publication: 'For a show with secrecy and shocking plot twists at its heart, navigating the celebrity version has been a real puzzler.\n'Casting the likes of TV presenter Kate Garraway, former rugby star Joe Marler, and singer Paloma Faith creates a situation which is a lot more open to leaks and gossip than recruiting a call centre manager from Liverpool or a retired opera singer.\n'So execs have worked really hard to lock down every inch of the production.' \n\nThe Mirror reports that Charlotte will be part of the line up which includes a 'huge mix of personalities \n\nStephen Fry is also rumoured to be taking part in the upcoming celebrity series\nThe source added that instead of a simple travel process, celebrities will arrive via various methods of transport. \nThe source also claimed that a no-fly zone has already been put in place to stop any preparations from being snapped. \nA spokesperson for the BBC declined to comment. \nLast month, the spin-off show suffered yet another huge blow after an 'ITV legend pulled out of the game show last minute'.\nLorraine Kelly, 65, was allegedly in 'secret talks' with bosses after being 'flattered' when she was approached by producers.\nBut sadly the presenter was forced to pull out after her busy schedule clashed with the filming for the show.\nThe hotly-anticipated celebrity version of the BBC show will see stars going head-to-head in the psychological game. \n\nLast month, the spin-off show suffered yet another huge blow after ITV legend Lorraine Kelly reportedly pulled out of the game show last minute\nA source told The Sun: 'BBC bosses were really keen to sign Lorraine Kelly up for Celebrity Traitors.\n'She loves the show and was super flattered to be asked, so she had a meeting with them which went really well.\n'Producers were hoping she would sign on the dotted line, but in the end, Lorraine couldn’t make it work with her schedule at the moment so had to pass.'\nA spokesperson for The Traitors said: 'The Traitors is a game that includes lies and deception, thus it would be foolhardy for any Faithful to speculate before the game has begun.'\nMailOnline contacted ITV for a comment. \nIt is also rumoured Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie had to quit the series over her commitments to her family. \nMeanwhile, an EastEnders icon has been tipped for Celebrity Traitors with bookies revealing the big names that could be set to join the game show.\nDanny Dyer, 47, reportedly has 4/9 odds of taking part, while Stephen Fry has 1/3 odds, figures obtained by The Mirror from Gambling.com show. \n\n Celebrity Traitors lockdown as BBC takes desperate measures to keep star-studded cast under wraps after string of leaks \nOther stars that could be set to join the cast include Clare Balding (4/6), Tom Daley (Evens), Ricky Gervais (11/10) and Jonathan Ross (11/8). Alan Carr, Jennifer Saunders and Paloma Faith. \nProducers of the reality TV show were said to be desperate to bag the EastEnders star - but he has form for turning down such gigs. \nDanny has repeatedly said no to reality TV stints, including for both ITV's I'm A Celebrity and BBC's Strictly Come Dancing. \nWhen the much-anticipated celebrity version of The Traitors films, the line-up will not feature any reality TV stars - despite the persistence of their agents. \nThe Mail on Sunday reported in December that the show has been inundated with requests to include less well-known names from shows such as The Only Way Is Essex and Love Island.\nAn industry source said the phones had been 'ringing non-stop' with agents trying to get their D-list clients a prime seat at The Traitors' notorious Round Table - and the primetime exposure and publicity it would guarantee them.\nBut only bona fide celebrities and genuine household names will make the cut.\n\nElsewhere, it is rumoured Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie had to quit the series over 'schedule concerns' (pictured 2023)\nThe source said: 'The team behind The Traitors have never seen anything like it. Ever since the celebrity series was announced in the summer, the phones have been ringing non-stop with agents desperate to pitch their talent for the show.\n'But it has been made loud and clear that they only want high-profile household names and aren't looking for the usual fodder from the reality TV circuit.'\nThe show, which is filmed at the atmospheric Ardross Castle in the Scottish Highlands and is hosted by Claudia, splits the cast into Faithfuls and a small handful of Traitors.\nThe Traitors must conspire to eliminate the Faithfuls by 'killing' one every night - without being identified - to get their hands on a cash prize.\nBBCCharlotte ChurchKate GarrawayPaloma Faith\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSinging sensation 'signs up for Celebrity Traitors' - as BBC 'take desperate measures to keep star-studded cast under wraps'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

So getting the least bad - why did they get whacked with a tariff in the first place?” Credit: CSPAN via Storyful\n\nVideo transcript\n\nThe interesting thing with Australia is We have a free trade agreement with Australia.\n\nWe don't have tariffs.\n\nWe even have One of the few industrial countries, we have a trade surplus with Australia.\n\nSo Ambassador, can you explain to me how it helps America's national security or our trading balance when we have, and I loved your fancy Greek formula, which was basically bad math on steroids, formula.\n\nHow with the trade surplus, with this strong relationship, Australia got hit with a 10% tariff as well.\n\nSenator, Australia has the lowest rate available under the new program.\n\nThey imports of Ambassador, excuse me.\n\nThere is a trade.\n\nWe already have a free trade agreement.\n\nWe have a trade surplus.\n\nSo getting the least bad, why did they get whacked in the first place?\n\nWe're addressing the $1.2 trillion deficit, the largest in human history that President Biden left us with.\n\nWe should be running up the score in Australia the question on Australia.\n\nWe have a trade surplus with Australia.\n\nWe have a free trade agreement.\n\nWhy they are.\n\nIncredibly important national security partner.\n\nWhy were they whacked with a tariff, Senator, despite the agreement, they ban our beef, they ban our pork.\n\nThey're getting ready to impose measures on our digital companies with your Greek letter formula, the fact that we have a trade surplus.\n\nWe have a global tariff on.\n\nWe're trying to address the $1.2 trillion dollar that Biden left us with.\n\nI think that answer, sir.\n\nYou're a much smarter person than that answer.\n\nThe idea that we are going to whack friend and foe alike.\n\nAnd particularly friends with this level is both, I think, insulting the Australians undermines our national security and frankly makes us not a good partner going forward.\n\nThe lack of trust from friends and allies based upon, This ridiculous policy that goes into full effect at midnight tonight.\n\nIt is extraordinary.\n\nI go back to what the market believers believe today is happening, a good day in hospice.\n\nI'm afraid if we keep these tariffs in effect we're looking like an economy that will be in hospice.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nSenator Das.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/why-did-whacked-row-erupts-235032307.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.storyful.com/e1c3c00b00c0083fab47bb809efda0b9","video":"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/d23ef203-b8cd-39f3-9341-6b62dafde368.m3u8?site=news&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi","publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:50:32","author":"Storyful","authors":["Storyful"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":309123902,"title":"Celebratory mood at Mar-a-Lago despite market drop after Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs: ‘Felt like a rally’","text":"As the country reels over President Donald Trump’s tariffs, it’s a party at the “winter White House.”\n\nA source tells Page Six that on Thursday — the night after “Liberation Day,” when Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan — there was a celebratory mood at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach. \n\n“Members and their guests were in great spirits despite the total collapse of the stock market,” says a source. \n\nFollowing Trump’s announcement the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had the sharpest one day declines since the pandemic, according to reports. \n\nBut we hear those hobnobbing at the private club were optimistic. \n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has been on the press circuit defending the tariffs, even got a standing ovation when he walked in, according to the source.\n\n“It felt like a rally,” says the source, who noted that this was before the market crashed again on Friday.\n\nThe spy tells us that singer Andy Ross — who recently launched his American Rebel Light Beer at Kid Rock’s Big Ass Honky Tonk and Rock ‘n’ Roll Steakhouse in Nashville, Tenn. — was heard telling a table of wealthy investors that the new tariffs were a blessing for his American-made brand.\n\nEntrepreneur Unik Ernest and other guests were also overheard talking about economic policy. \n\nAlso making the rounds, we hear, were Argentina President Javier Milei, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Donald Trump Jr.’s ex fiancée and now-Ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who were attending the American Patriots Gala in the ballroom.\n\nDonald Trump himself tried to stop by the event, said the source, following his day in Doral for LIV Golf.\n\nBut we hear there was a snag!\n\nThe source tells us a DJ played Trump’s favorites by the Village People before Trump was about to enter, but it created too big a stir with the crowd.\n\n“They kept playing his songs and people would not sit. They were all mobbing at the door where he was supposed to come in,” says the spy. \n\n“Security was telling people to please sit and they wouldn’t. They told people it was not secure for the president to come in.”\n\nTrump was, however, seen mingling later in the members area of the club.","summary":"A source tells Page Six that on Thursday, the night after \"Liberation Day,\" in which Trump announced his tariff plan — guests were in \"great spirits.\"","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/04/08/society/celebratory-mood-at-mar-a-lago-despite-market-drop-after-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-felt-like-a-rally/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/newspress-collage-s0m1ccxnx-1744156519106.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744142180&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DsNlQvEr-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-08 23:50:16","author":"Mara Siegler","authors":["Mara Siegler"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.061}]}
