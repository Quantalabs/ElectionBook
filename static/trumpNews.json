He's refusing","text":"When Donald Trump took to the stage in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention last month, many of those sitting inside the packed arena felt as though the former president was unstoppable. He'd survived an assassination attempt, unveiled his vice-presidential pick, and been treated to a hero's welcome from an adoring crowd — all while damaging speculation about the political future of his opponent continued to swirl. But in the weeks since Joe Biden withdrew from the race, his replacement at the top of the ticket has re-energised Democrats, giving the party new optimism about its chances of winning this year's election. The former president has complained about Kamala Harris's ascension, accusing her party of orchestrating a \"coup\" to oust Biden and arguing his campaign should be compensated for the money it spent opposing the wrong candidate. He's mocked her laugh as being that of a \"crazy person\", questioned her racial identity and alleged the vice-president isn't smart enough to hold a press conference, let alone run the country. Trump's approach to Harris isn't surprising, given his long history of making personal attacks central to his campaigns. But as Harris pulls ahead of the former president in the polls, an increasing number of Republicans are urging their nominee to change tack or risk losing in November. 'Fewer insults, more insights' Former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy — an outspoken supporter of Trump's, even when he was running against him — is among those encouraging the Republican candidate to rein it in. \"I do think we have not actually gone after [Harris] heavily enough on her policy record, and I think that's how we're going to win this,\" he told Fox News. \"The less we make it about policy, I think the worse it's going to be for us. And so that's my warning to our side. If we heed it, I think we're going to be successful.\" Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who later served as an advisor in his White House, called for \"fewer insults, more insights, and that policy contrast\". And former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, another one-time rival of Trump's, argued Republicans needed to \"quit whining\" about Harris. \"The campaign is not going to win talking about crowd sizes, it's not going to win talking about what race Kamala Harris is, it's not going to win talking about whether she's dumb,\" Haley said. Trump has spread debunked claims that artificial intelligence has been used to inflate the size of the crowds turning out to hear the vice-president speak. And he ignored pleas to keep to policy discussions, going off topic in a speech that was billed as being focused on his economic agenda. \"Today we're going to talk about one subject and then we'll start going back to the other, because we sort of love that, don't we?\" he told supporters in North Carolina on Wednesday, local time. \"They say [the economy's] the most important subject, I'm not sure it is.\" On Thursday, Trump appeared to exercise more discipline in his second press conference in as many weeks, at least initially. At his golf club in New Jersey, he detailed price hikes on various food products as he stood between tables piled with groceries. But when he was asked about the calls from within his party to dial down the attacks on Harris, he argued he was \"entitled\" to them. \"I don't have a lot of respect for her, I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president,\" he said. \"She certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird.\" Trump added that while he appreciated Haley's advice, he wouldn't change the way he campaigned. \"I fought Nikki very hard. I beat her in her own state by legendary numbers,\" he said. \"I have to do it my way.\" Harris avoids questions, looks ahead to Democratic convention Trump continues to pressure Harris over her reluctance to engage in similar media appearances, with the vice-president mostly sticking to scripted rallies. (Harris has suggested she'll sit down for an interview sometime this month – meaning it might not be for another couple of weeks.) The VP campaigned alongside her boss for the first time since the switch at the top of the ticket, sharing a stage in Maryland as they announced lower prices for prescription drugs. The pair exchanged compliments, with Biden telling the crowd that Harris would \"make one hell of a president\". But the new Democratic candidate will be looking to try to differentiate herself from the current commander-in-chief, scheduling her own economic address for later this week. And next week she'll take centre stage at the party's national convention, a four-day affair that the party hopes to use to build on Harris's early momentum. Biden will reportedly make a speech on the opening night, in what's expected to be sold as a symbol of the Democratic transition. Less than a month ago, he thought he'd be the one formally accepting the party's nomination. Now he'll need to watch on as the balloons drop on the woman he's \"passed the torch\" to. Loading One to watch: Abortion on the ballot The presidential election will obviously dominate attention in November, but a growing number of Americans will also be asked to decide on reproductive rights at the same time. Missouri this week joined at least half a dozen states where a question over abortion access will be added to the ballot. In most of them, voters will be asked whether to enshrine protections in their state's constitution. Similar measures have been backed in other states where the question has already been put to the people in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to scrap the nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v Wade. Florida — where Donald Trump is registered — is one of the states where voters will have their say in November. The former president nominated three of the conservative judges who overturned Roe, but has since argued in favour of exceptions to abortion bans and urged Republicans to moderate their stance on the issue. Trump won't say how he plans to vote on Florida's ballot measure, but suggested the result might go the same way as the states that have come before it. \"I think probably the vote will go in a little more liberal way than people thought,\" he said. \"But I'll be announcing that at the appropriate time.\"","summary":"As Kamala Harris pulls ahead of the former president in the polls, an increasing number of Republicans are urging their nominee to change tack or risk losing in November. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-16/donald-trump-kamala-harris-week-in-us-politics-macmillan/104227190","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cbcd480a24f8a45f5083238da88ed100?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2559&cropW=4549&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 00:11:53","author":"Jade Macmillan","authors":["Jade Macmillan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":254217630,"title":"How effective are Trump's economic attacks on Harris?","text":"How effective are Trump's economic attacks on Harris?

In an interview with Semafor, Adams said, “The Democratic Party has a tendency to run away from public safety, but it is a very attractive criterion and is a very attractive part of your resume.” According to the outlet, Harris “built her career in California as a ‘smart on crime’ prosecutor,” taking stances to the right of typical Democrats regarding criminal justice. Harris, of course, downplayed much of her role in law enforcement during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, which killed at least 25 people and tallied $2 billion in nationwide damages. Semafor said she “took positions intended to win her friends” by aligning with the so-called “defund the police” movement. If you’re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) June 1, 2020 According to Newsmax, Harris encouraged much of the protesting during the riots. They’re not going to stop before Election Day in November and they’re not going to stop after Election Day. And that should be — everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn’t — they’re not going to let up and they should not. Adams, a retired transit police officer of 22 years, told Semafor, “She ran away. I don’t think she should have moved away from it. I think that now, you see, she’s leaning into it.” Harris was also a part of law enforcement as district attorney of Alameda County in California and San Francisco before becoming the state’s attorney general and then senator. The vice president has leaned into her law enforcement background when grilling former President Donald Trump. I took on perpetrators of all kinds – predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type. Still, much of Harris’s efforts have been on railing against banks for foreclosures from over a decade ago. She has yet to discuss any substantial plan with law enforcement. Although, in July, she jilted her BLM friends, touting her tough-on-crime prosection. Harris has promoted herself in ads as pro-law, harking on President Joe Biden’s bipartisan Senate border deal, which would have actually increased illegal immigration across the southern border.

At his New Jersey golf club, the Republican nominee blended falsehoods about the economy with misleading statements and deeply personal attacks about his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Here’s a closer look at the facts. Inflation did not take the toll Trump claimed. Growth surged under Biden TRUMP: “As a result of Kamala’s inflation, price hikes have cost the typical household a total of $28,000. … When I left office, I left Kamala and crooked Joe Biden a surging economy and no inflation. The mortgage rate was around 2%. Gasoline had reached $1.87 a gallon. … Harris and Biden blew it all up.” THE FACTS: Trump made numerous economic claims that were either exaggerated or misleading. Prices did surge during the Biden-Harris administration, though $28,000 is far higher than independent estimates. Moody’s Analytics calculated last year that price increases over the previous two years were costing the typical U.S. household $709 a month. That would equal $8,500 a year. Separately, the U.S. economy was growing quickly as it reopened from COVID in 2020, as Trump’s term ended, and it continued to do so after Biden took office. Growth reached 5.8% in 2021, Biden’s first year in the White House, as the rebound continued, faster than any year that Trump was in office. Mortgage rates were low when Trump left because of the pandemic, which caused the Federal Reserve to cut its key rate to nearly zero. Gas prices fell as the economy largely shut down and Americans cut back sharply on their driving. ‘Foreign born’ is not the same as ‘migrants’ TRUMP: “Virtually 100% of the net job creation in the last year has gone to migrants.” THE FACTS: This is a misinterpretation of government jobs data. The figures do show that the number of foreign-born people with jobs has increased in the past year, while the number of native-born Americans with jobs has declined. But foreign-born is not the same as “migrants” — it would include people who arrived in the U.S. years ago and are now naturalized citizens. In addition, the data is based on Census research that many economists argue is undercounting both foreign- and native-born workers. According to a report by Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson at the Brookings Institution released this week, native-born employment rose by 740,000 in 2023, while foreign-born rose by 1.7 million. Much of the disparity reflects the fact that the native-born population is older than the foreign-born, and are more likely to be retired. In addition, the unemployment rate for native-born Americans is 4.5%, lower than the 4.7% for foreign-born. A thief is not allowed to steal up to $950 TRUMP: “You’re allowed to rob a store as long as it’s not more than $950. … If it’s less than $950 they can rob it and not get charged.” THE FACTS: Trump was referring to regulations in California that allegedly allow for theft under $950. But his claim is not correct — a 2014 proposition modified, but did not eliminate, sentencing for many nonviolent property and drug crimes. Proposition 47 raised the minimum dollar amount necessary for theft to be prosecuted as a felony, instead of a misdemeanor, from $400 to $950. Alex Bastian, then-special adviser to Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón, who co-authored Prop 47, told The Associated Press in 2021 that the minimum was raised “to adjust for inflation and cost of living,” but that most shoplifting cases were already prosecuted as misdemeanors any since they didn’t exceed $400. Prop 47 was enacted to comply with a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court order, which upheld that the state’s overcrowded prisons violated incarcerated individuals’ Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment. It instructed California to reduce its state prison population by 33,000 individuals within two years. Harris has not said in this campaign she wants to defund police TRUMP, on Harris: “You know, she wants to defund the police.” THE FACTS: Harris expressed praise for the “defund the police” movement after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, questioning whether money was being effectively spent on public safety. However, she has not said during her current campaign that she is in favor of defunding law enforcement. The Biden administration tried to overhaul policing, but the legislation stalled on Capitol Hill, and Biden ultimately settled for issuing an executive order. It also pumped more money into local departments. Trump did not win Pennsylvania in 2020 TRUMP: “I won Pennsylvania and I did much better the second time. I won it in 2016, did much better the second time. I know Pennsylvania very well.” THE FACTS: False. Trump did win the state in 2016, when he beat Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the presidency. But he lost the state in 2020 to President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. According to the official certified results, Biden and Harris received 3.46 million votes, compared to Trump and Vice President Mike Pence with 3.38 million votes, a margin of about 80,000 votes. Oil production in U.S. hit record under Biden Trump says he will bring energy prices down by reversing President Joe Biden’s policy of encouraging renewable energy at the expense of fossil fuels. TRUMP: “We’re going to drill baby drill, we’re going to get the energy prices down, almost immediately.” THE FACTS: Oil production in the U.S. hit an all-time high under Biden’s administration. The U.S. Department of Energy reported in October that U.S. oil production hit 13.2 million barrels per day, passing a previous record set in 2020 by 100,000 barrels. Department statistics also show that the U.S. has produced more crude oil per year than any other nation — for the past six years. Economy has shown recent signs of strength, not evidence of collapse TRUMP: “We’re going to have a crash like the 1929 crash if she gets in.” THE FACTS: The economy has shown recent signs of strength — not evidence that America is on the edge of economic collapse. On Thursday the S&P 500 jumped 1.6%, its sixth gain in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also increased Thursday, as did the Nasdaq composite. Recent economic reports show that shoppers increased their retail spending last month and fewer workers sought unemployment benefits. Fears the economy was slowing emerged last month following a sharp drop in hiring and higher unemployment rates. But those worries were assuaged earlier this month when better-than-expected jobless numbers led to Wall Street’s best rally since 2022. Harris was not named border ‘czar’ TRUMP: “She was the border czar but she didn’t do anything. She’s the worst border czar in history. … She was the person responsible for the border and she never went there.” THE FACTS: Biden tapped Harris in 2021 to work with Central American countries to address the root causes of migration and the challenges it creates. Illegal crossings are one aspect of those challenges, but Harris was never assigned to the border or put in charge of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees law enforcement at the border. Black unemployment is lower under Biden TRUMP: “The Black population had the best numbers they’ve ever had on jobs, on income, on everything. The Hispanic population had the best numbers.” THE FACTS: It’s true that Black and Hispanic unemployment fell to then-record lows under Trump, but that was upended by COVID. When Trump left office, Black unemployment had soared to 9.3% and Hispanic unemployment to 8.5%. Under Biden, Black unemployment fell to a new record low of 4.8% in April 2023, while Hispanic unemployment in September 2022 matched the all-time low of 3.9% it had reached under Trump.","summary":"At his New Jersey golf club, the Republican nominee blended falsehoods about the economy with misleading statements and deeply personal attacks about his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/15/fact-focus-trump-blends-falsehoods-and-exaggerations-at-rambling-nj-press-conference/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24228796468684.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 00:02:57","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":254217444,"title":"‘The Daily Show’ Mocks Former Never-Trumper JD Vance for ‘Men in Black’-Style MAGA Memory Wipe | Exclusive Video","text":"A new “Daily Show” video mocks JD Vance for flip-flopping on major issues — including going from being a “Never-Trumper” to being Donald Trump’s running mate. How’d that happen? “Men in Black”-style memory wipes, of course.

In one segment, the GOP vice presidential nominee tells a crowd, “I didn’t come from the elites. I didn’t come from San Francisco,” which is followed up by an older interview in which Vance confirms he’s now based in San Francisco and is working for tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel. Trump himself didn’t seem to mind that Vance previously called the former president “noxious” and “maybe America’s Hitler.” It’s just too bad Trump can’t seem to remember Vance’s name, introducing him at one point as, “JP… JD… Mandel.” “JD’s moral flexibility propelled him into the MAGA A-list,” notes narrator Grace Kuhlenschmidt. Watch the video in full below: After we hear a heartwarming anecdote from Vance about how they discovered a cache of guns hidden in every room after his grandmother died, Kuhlenschmidt quips, “Once he hit the campaign trail, his former friends in the media discovered that his mouth had left around more loaded guns than his Mamaw.” She then quickly recaps his recent PR gaffes, including criticizing childless couples and Olympics star Simone Biles for taking a mental health break from the Tokyo Olympics … that’s not to mention the dolphin Google searches, the now-infamous couch jokes or photos of the younger anti-LGBT candidate in drag at a party.

Anna Paulina Luna modeling a MAGA bikini circulated on X. Since the video of Luna resurfaced on Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz’s wife Ginger has posted a series of ‘thirst trap’ style photos of Republican woman ‘patriots.’ One is a shot of Rep. Lauren Boebert in a bikini at the beach in Palm Beach, Fla., showing off a massive tattoo that lines the side of her stomach. ‘We love confident, healthy, patriotic women like Lauren,’ the post read. ‘We all love Anna Paulina Luna!’ Boebert had posted earlier. Ginger and Boebert recently hosted a ‘Hot Girl Summer’ happy hour with the D.C. Young Republicans’ club. Boebert filed for divorce from husband Jayson, with whom she has four kids, earlier last year. She made headlines after vaping and groping a new beau at a Denver production of Beetlejuice last year. She became a grandma last year at age 36 when her 17-year-old son Tyler’s girlfriend gave birth. Tyler Boebert was arrested in late February in connection to a string of recent vehicle trespasses and property theft in Rifle, Colorado. The Republican lawmaker’s son is facing nearly two dozen different charges, including four counts of criminal possession of a financial device, three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and three counts of theft of under $300. He is also facing four felony counts of criminal possession of ID documents of multiple victims, one felony count of conspiracy to commit a felony and over 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses, according to local law enforcement. He and three underage accomplices are accused of breaking into four cars to steal wallets in order to make purchases at local businesses. Boebert’s ex-husband Jayson had originally claimed that Lauren punched him during an altercation when they met up to try to get on better terms in January when he was arrested for a domestic violence incident. He later recanted that claim. In a separate incident, Jayson Boebert was accused of assaulting their 18-year-old son and taking out a gun as the son moved to call the authorities in a fight over laundry. Ginger also posted a photo of Manhattan Republican Party chair Andrea Catsimitidis – daughter of wealthy Republican donor John Catsimitidis. ‘Another gorgeous patriot for your feed,’ Ginger said, along with a shot of Andrea in a bikini on a boat off the coast of Manhattan. The original clip showed Luna showing off her curves in a blue one-piece emblazoned with Donald Trump’s campaign slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ She posed with the white knee-high socks as part of an ensemble that swept conservative social media during the summer of 2016. The swimsuit modeled by conservatives across the country was available online for $39.95. ‘I’m confirming that I have indeed worn swimsuits and you can tell I am biologically a woman. #MAGA,’ Luna wrote on X as the video resurfaced on Wednesday. ‘I was also in featured by sports illustrated and MAXIM. Designed swimsuits and women’s shirts,’ she added in a follow-up tweet. The clip seemed to gain steam after it was posted by X user Phillips Holz. ‘Anna Paulina Luna should be working at my local Hooters, NOT in Congress!’ Holz wrote. The swimsuit video generated praise, some with X users deeming Luna the ‘hottest member of Congress,’ and some criticism. ‘[Luna] single-handedly bringing back Women Crush Wednesday,’ Ginger Gaetz wrote on X, along two other beach shots of Luna. ‘Anna Paulina Luna is a married congress woman with children and still can’t help but dishonor her family and the country by stripping down half naked for the world to see. Please don’t claim she’s a Christian either,’ wrote Christian activist Morgan Ariel on X. ‘Holy Anna Paulina Luna MAGA WOMEN ARE THE HOTTEST ON THE PLANET,’ wrote an X user by the name of MAGA Elvis. Right wing political commentator Richard Hanania wrote on X along with the clip: ‘I’ve heard that this is a member of Congress.’ ‘I don’t understand your point. Anna Paulina Luna is better at her job than most members of Congress and she’s fighting for your right not to be suppressed and censored by the federal government,’ wrote back activist Ian Cheong. ‘I have a confession to make since the TikTok Democrats are onto me : I wear bikinis to the beach and mineral sunscreen,’ Luna also shot back on X. Luna became the 12th member of Congress to give birth while in office after she had her son in August 2023. The brunette bombshell, 35, was a social media influencer before she came to Congress.’ She joined the House in 2023 and became a part of the right wing Freedom Caucus. In Congress, she’s advanced a number of bold and seemingly far-fetched ideas – like forcing members of Congress who advocate for military support for Ukraine to fight on the front lines of the war with Russia and having Attorney General Merrick Garland arrested for failing to hand over audio of the Biden special counsel interview. Luna served in the US Air Force from 2009 to 2014. She also modeled on the side – appearing on Sports Illustrated’s website in 2013 and as a swimsuit model in Maxim magazine in 2014.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nConservative women are posting bikini shots on social media after a clip&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Lauren Boebert&#8217;s large abdominal tattoo exposed following an uproar on social media regarding Anna Paulina Luna showcasing a MAGA swimsuit. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/lauren-boeberts-large-abdominal-tattoo-exposed-following-an-uproar-on-social-media-regarding-anna-paulina-luna-showcasing-a-maga-swimsuit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Lauren-Boeberts-massive-stomach-tattoo-revealed-after.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 23:50:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.204},{"id":254216748,"title":"Wisconsin Democrats’ effort to prevent Jill Stein from appearing on ballot may benefit Kamala Harris among supporters of Palestine","text":"In Wisconsin, the decision of just a few votes can sway the outcome of the presidential election. With a history of about 20,000 votes, less than 1% has determined the winner in four of the state’s past elections. The state’s 10 electoral votes are highly sought after, and even a small number of votes diverted to a third-party candidate could impact the final result. Recently, David Strang, the Democratic National Committee deputy operations director in Wisconsin, raised concerns about the ballot access of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who received over 30,000 votes in the 2016 election. The complaint alleges the Wisconsin Green Party, which qualified for ballot status in 2022 when a candidate garnered 1% of the stateâs vote, does not have qualified electors to put forward and therefore runs afoul of Wisconsin election law. The Green Partyâs virtual convention happens this week, where Stein is expected to win the partyâs presidential nomination. Her platform includes left-leaning positions such as codifying Roe v. Wade, abolishing student debt, opposing school choice and supporting the Equality Act, which would add sex, sexual orientation and gender identity to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Wisconsin Green Partyâs website features an article from May titled âStanding with the students standing with GAZA,â which praised student protests at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and endorsed the studentsâ demands. Stein and her campaign manager were arrested in April at Washington University in St. Louis while taking part in an anti-Israel protest. Removing an option for pro-Palestinian voters in Wisconsin would likely be a boon for the Democratic Party. In the April presidential primary, almost 48,000 voters cast an âuninstructed ballotâ as a protest against President Bidenâs handling of the Israel-Gaza conflict. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) have all faced anti-Israel protests and hecklers when campaigning in Wisconsin. WisDem Chair Ben Wikler said after the primary that then-Democratic presidential candidate Biden had work to do to earn those uninstructed votes. Now booting other options for pro-Palestine voters off the ballot may be the Democratsâ key to pushing those voters toward Harris. Harris responded to a question in March about the uncommitted protest vote in neighboring Minnesota. Ã¢ÂÂThey matter,Ã¢ÂÂ the VP declared, Ã¢ÂÂand we care about them.Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWe respect the fact that people feel very strongly about what we are witnessing,Ã¢ÂÂ Harris said, referring to the Israel-Hamas war. The DNC employee filed a complaint against former Green Party member and independent candidate Cornel West last week, attempting to deny his ballot access as well. âThis is a fishing expedition conjured up by the DNC,â Steinâs campaign manager Jason Call told The Post. âAnd [itâs] in line with their statements back in March that they will hire an army of lawyers and infiltrators to find any angle of attack to prevent Green Party ballot access.â âThe American people are tired of these anti-democratic shenanigans, and we absolutely will be hiring counsel to defend our ballot line in Wisconsin,â Call continued. In a poll out Wednesday, Harris took a strong lead over Donald Trump in Wisconsin when third-party candidates were factored in, leading the former prez 48% to 43%. The unelected, six-member bipartisan Wisconsin Election Commission will determine the fate of Stein, West, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and two other independent candidates in an Aug. 27 commission meeting.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, the decision of just a few votes can sway the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Wisconsin Democrats&#8217; effort to prevent Jill Stein from appearing on ballot may benefit Kamala Harris among supporters of Palestine first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/wisconsin-democrats-effort-to-prevent-jill-stein-from-appearing-on-ballot-may-benefit-kamala-harris-among-supporters-of-palestine/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wisconsin-Democrats-move-to-block-Jill-Stein-from-ballot-A¢AAAA-which.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 23:46:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":254216786,"title":"E.

But can the Democrats actually win this? That’s the question our debaters are throwing around in this week’s Friday Fight. Arguing for the negative team we have Crikey’s very own Charlie Lewis. And in the affirmative corner we have Ava Kalinauskas, research associate at the United States Studies Centre. On November 8, 2016, the Hillary Clinton campaign took part in the then-viral trend of the mannequin challenge. And who could forget her warmly received cameo on the hit comedy Broad City, which did so much to sure up her vote in California? It was the kind of knowing, media-savvy stuff that played brilliantly to knowing, media-savvy types in Democratic strongholds and, as it turns out, absolutely no one else. I’m not sure what it is about the Democrats’ lusty embrace of Charlie XCX’s endorsement and jokes about JD Vance sticking his dick in a couch that reminded me of the 2016 campaign, except perhaps everything. To say that the Harris team’s embrace of meme culture feels easier and less corpse-stiff than Clinton’s is to clear a bar so low it’s currently liquefying in the earth’s core. Meanwhile, how many times did Trump do or say something that made you certain his campaign could never recover? Access Hollywood? His misogyny toward Fox News’ Megyn Kelly? His mockery of a disabled reporter? His many legal troubles, including his explicit contention that a judge could not be trusted to do their job because they were of “Mexican heritage”? For me, it was his mockery of a dead soldier’s family and of Republican senator John McCain for his years of torture during the Vietnam War. There was surely no more sacrosanct convention in US politics: mocking members of the armed forces or their families is Inland Taipan-like political poison. After this, I thought Trump’s campaign would be dead before it hit the ground. And remember what an unmitigated joke Donald Trump’s campaign seemed in 2016? The laughter over “Drumpf” and “Covfefe”. The way talk show hosts essentially gave up on non-Trump material for the year, figuring to make “scathing” assessments of his buffoonery while they still could. Trump’s candidacy wasn’t just an unpleasantness that could be gotten out of the way, he was tipped to lose so hard that it would disqualify the Republican party from office for a generation. The New York Times gave Clinton an 85% chance of winning, and just as he would four years later, Trump prepared for a loss by claiming the process was rigged. And after the roiling, uninterrupted scandal factory that was Trump’s time in office, Trump’s popular vote increased by nearly 12 million. So the apparent panic and chaos in the Trump camp doesn’t necessarily mean much about what voters will decide in November. I take absolutely no joy in bringing any of that up. I only do so because large swathes of the media seem to be so intent on forgetting it, caught up in the vibes of the last three weeks. “Kamala Harris must mobilize stan armies” writes Vulture, and like a lot of the coverage of Kamala’s brat summer, it’s borderline impossible to work out if it’s sincere, or an Onion headline that’s escaped into the real world. Harris has inarguably arrested and reversed Biden’s slide in national aggregate polls in the bright autumn of his campaign, and the media, audibly breathing a sigh of relief at the prospect of a contest rather than whatever the hell a Trump/Biden rematch would have become, have been hyping it. CNN this week reported on the “surprising” bump in support for Harris in a key demographic: White non-college-educated voters in swing states. Biden’s improvement among that cohort (as opposed to Clinton) was huge in 2020, and they were the only cohort keeping him afloat in 2024. So Harris now trails Trump by 14 points, rather than 25. Harris is now very marginally ahead in four of the seven closest swing states and 538 puts her ahead by 2.6% in its most recent national aggregate. Bear in mind that we are likely nearing the peak of Harris’ honeymoon period: next week’s Democratic National Convention. After that, the vigour and novelty of her entry and selection of her running mate will likely wear off, and questions of policy and communication will come to the fore. If we recall Harris’ first pitch at the presidential nomination — where early hype about her chances dissipated amidst high-profile policy backdowns and inconsistent messaging — there are very serious questions about how that will go. A lot of what Harris is up against is no fault of hers. However hard they try to avoid doing so, Trump is held to a different set of standards by a mainstream media which has never known how to effectively hold him to account. And one of the fears that kept Democrats largely behind Biden (at least in public) for so long — that a decent, possibly crucial chunk of the United States might not vote for any black woman — is presumably as true now as it was in June. Oh, and… DING! DING! DING! CRIKEY EDITORS DECLARE LEWIS HAS PASSED HIS ALLOCATED WORD COUNT …then there’s the fact in both 2016 and 2020, pollsters significantly underestimated Trump’s vote. There is a long way to go, of course, and none of this is terminal for the Democrats. But a lot has to improve before the current sense of triumphalism pervading the party matches up with any kind of reality. Read the opposing argument by Ava Kalinauskas.

Even a few thousand votes siphoned off by a third-party presidential candidate could determine which direction Wisconsin’s coveted 10 electoral votes will go. David Strang, the state’s Democratic National Committee deputy operations director, filed a complaint Wednesday challenging the ballot access of Wisconsin Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who won more than 30,000 votes here in the 2016 presidential election. The complaint alleges the Wisconsin Green Party, which qualified for ballot status in 2022 when a candidate garnered 1% of the state’s vote, does not have qualified electors to put forward and therefore runs afoul of Wisconsin election law. The Green Party’s virtual convention happens this week, where Stein is expected to win the party’s presidential nomination. Her platform includes left-leaning positions such as codifying Roe v.

After delivering prepared remarks on the economy over a 30-minute span during which he repeatedly criticized Vice President Harris and President Joe Biden over inflation, immigration and other topics, Trump took a handful of questions from reporters gathered at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. During the segment, he was asked if he if agreed with those in the Republican Party who are urging him to refrain from lobbing personal insults at Harris even as many polls show her surging ahead of him in key battleground states. Trump responded by saying he is justified in doing so. \"As far as the personal attacks -- because of what she has done to the country, I am very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people. Very angry. \"I think I am entitled to personal attacks. I do not have a lot of respect for her or her intelligence and I think she would be a terrible president,\" he said. Trump claimed Harris called him and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, \"weird,\" adding, \"She is weird. Weird with her policy.\" The comments about Harris' persona came after a lengthy opening statement in which Trump labeled the pro-consumer policy proposals of Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as \"communist\" while standing in front of a table with an array of consumer products to demonstrate the effects of inflation. Harris is reportedly planning to issue a call for a ban on price-gouging in the food industry during a campaign stop in North Carolina on Friday. The former president also criticized Harris for changing her position on oil fracking in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, where she advocated it be banned due to environmental concerns during her failed run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. \"I think she will do very badly in Pennsylvania,\" Trump said. \"You have to frack.\" Following the New Jersey event, the Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement characterizing Trump's remarks as revealing his \"opposition to lowering food costs for middle and working class Americans and prescription drug costs for seniors. \"No surprise, Trump doesn't want to defend his agenda that would raise costs for families by $3,900 a year, cut Social Security, and eliminate the Affordable Care Act -- all so he can give his rich donors tax breaks,\" the campaign said, adding that Harris \"has spent her life taking on fraudsters, cheaters, and criminals like Donald Trump.\"","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump again leveled personal attacks on Democratic opponent Kamala Harris on Thursday during what was promoted as a news conference at his New Jersey country club.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/15/Trump-press-conference-economy-veers-personal-attacks-Harris/8281723760150/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8281723760150/2024/upi_com/8fd56a906f1b14389391726c35b5fd02/v1.2/Trump-press-conference-on-economy-veers-into-more-personal-attacks-on-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 23:37:01","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":254216354,"title":"Trump expected to resume outdoor rallies protected by bulletproof glass, sources say","text":"Trump expected to resume outdoor rallies protected by bulletproof glass, sources say The U.S. Secret Service is arranging for former President Donald Trump to resume outdoor campaign rallies by surrounding his podium with bulletproof glass, two federal law enforcement officials told CBS News.

This is Trump’s second press conference in about a week as he aims to pressure Harris into sitting down for a substantial press interview, which she has so far avoided. Last week’s press conference was held at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The former president claimed Harris is “not smart enough” to face media questioning. Trump has struggled to adapt to a newly energized Democratic ticket and party after President Joe Biden suspended his campaign last month. The former president, flanked by a table full of food and coffee, blasted Harris as a “radical-left person” who “wants to put price controls all over the place.” In a surprise moment of kindness toward journalists, Trump praised CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper for their hosting duties during the June debate against Biden. “I have to say Jake Tapper and Dana Bash were unbelievably straight and honest. I give them a lot of credit for that,” Trump said of the debate where Biden did so poorly he was pressured into bowing out of the race. Before Trump’s press conference, the Harris campaign mocked the former president in an email with the subject line “Donald Trump To Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home.” Citing previous cases where Trump’s preference for incendiary comments overshadowed his message, the campaign warned readers that “Donald Trump intends to deliver another self-obsessed rant full of his own personal grievances to distract from his toxic Project 2025 agenda, unpopular running mate, and increasing detachment from the reality of the voters who will decide this election.” Here are the Washington Examiner’s five takeaways from the press conference. Trump tells Israel’s prime minister to end the war The last time Trump spoke with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was during a 2 1/2 hour meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in late July, Trump told reporters Thursday. The assertion rebuts reporting that the two leaders spoke by phone Wednesday about the Gaza hostage and ceasefire deal. Trump did, however, encourage Netanyahu to hurriedly end the war against Hamas that has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and led to 115 hostages still in the hands of Hamas. “He knows what he’s doing. I did encourage him to get this over with,” said Trump. “You want to get it over with. It has to get over with fast but have victory, get your victory, and get it over with. It has to stop. The killing has to stop.” Officials from the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and Israel are in the midst of high-level negotiations in Doha to bring out a deal that would end the fighting between Israel and Hamas. Trump calls early voting ‘ridiculous’ One day after early voting in Florida, Trump reverted to denouncing the voting strategy even as the GOP is pushing for the base to embrace early voting. Trump encouraged people who are struggling in credit card debt to vote for his campaign but segued into attacking early voting. “They should on Nov. 5 or sooner, if it’s early voting, which largely it is which is ridiculous, we should have one-day voting paper ballots,” Trump said. “We should have voter ID, and we should have proof of citizenship because people are voting.” On Wednesday, Trump cast an early vote ballot in Florida as a convicted felon. Trump was convicted of 34 felonies for falsifying business records, but depending on sentencing in New York and other legal cases, his right to vote could be curtailed. Trump ‘entitled’ to personal attacks against Harris For weeks, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), have poked fun at Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), via Generation Z-inflected memes, harsh campaign emails, and media appearances brandishing the GOP as “weird.” These attacks, according to Trump, allow him to lob criticisms right back at Democrats. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks,” Trump said when asked about a more disciplined approach. “I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she’ll be a terrible president, and I think it’s very important that we win,” Trump added. “And whether the personal attacks are good, bad, I mean, she certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird. ‘He’s weird.’ It was just a sound bite, and she called J.D. and I weird. He’s not weird. He was a great student at Yale. He went to Ohio State, graduated in two years at the top of his class, and all of these different things.” The GOP has continued to implore Trump to move away from attacks against Harris’s race and gender and focus more on pocketbook issues, to mixed results. Trump keeps commenting on Harris’s Time magazine cover In a Monday interview with Elon Musk on X, Trump claimed that Harris’s Time magazine cover reminded him of his wife and former first lady, Melania. Two days later, Trump brought up the magazine cover again at a rally in Asheville, North Carolina. “And now they’re putting her on the covers of Time magazine with an artist sketch. They don’t use a picture, they don’t use a picture, they use an artist sketch,” Trump said as the crowd booed. “I want to use that artist. I want to find that artist. I like him very much.” Thursday marked the third time that Trump publicly referenced the cover. “What was that all about? The whole thing is crazy. I just want to win for the country,” Trump said. “Some people say, ‘Oh, why don’t you be nice?’ But they’re not nice to me.” Trump’s openness to Nikki Haley Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley recently slammed Trump’s attacks against Harris as “whining” and urged the campaign to focus on the liberal policies that Harris has endorsed and times pivoted away from. When asked about Haley’s comments, Trump appeared agreeable to his former primary rival joining him on the campaign trail. “Sure,” Trump said when asked about Haley as a campaign surrogate. “I think that we’ve done very well. I think that we’re hitting a nerve. I think this is a different kind of a race. All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody that’s going to destroy our country.” The former president then segued into discussing how he defeated the South Carolina lawmaker in her home state during the primary season. “I beat her in her own state by legendary numbers, and I get along with her fine. I appreciate that she endorsed me and all of that,” he said. “I think, relatively to what they’re doing and how radical they are and how, in many ways how sick they are. I think I’m doing a very calm campaign.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Trump has spent several campaign events attacking Harris but also engaging in rambling moments that diluted the impact of his criticisms. “I’m a very calm person, believe it or not. If I wasn’t, probably wouldn’t be around anymore you know,” he emphasized. But ultimately, while Trump appreciated Haley’s advice, he said, “I have to do it my way.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump&#8216;s press conference at his Bedminster golf club&#160;in New Jersey featured a roughly 46-minute monologue with frequent attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris while repeating key topics from the campaign stump.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped over 1,000 points in a day, investors around the world were shouting “sell,” and Donald Trump was very, very happy. The Republican presidential nominee was gloating because just one week into Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ surging campaign, the idea that he might be able to run during a real economic downturn, rather than the wishful doom and gloom he sells at his rallies, seemed like an unexpected reprieve. Trump took to his failing social media platform to pound out a series of messages blaming the downturn on his political opponent. In his standard all-caps shout, Trump declared that “VOTERS HAVE A CHOICE—TRUMP PROSPERITY, OR THE KAMALA CRASH & GREAT DEPRESSION OF 2024…” Just one day later, Trump was silent as markets began a swift recovery. As of Thursday, stocks were enjoying an extended rally that put the Dow at over 40,500. The reality: There is no looming depression—and the economy is looking great. Since that market blip, a great inflation report has made it seem more likely that the Federal Reserve Bank will cut interest rates at its next meeting. There was more good news on Thursday as the retail sales report showed that consumers are purchasing as if there are few economic concerns. Bank of America’s CEO told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that recession is no longer in the cards, according to the financial institution’s research team. The result is not just that sharp rise in the Dow, but a six-day rally of the S&P and NASDAQ stock indexes that has completely erased earlier losses. While Trump has repeatedly proven that he absolutely sucks at predicting the market, the markets are absolutely perfect at predicting Trump. When the markets are up, Trump will claim credit. When they’re down, he’ll spread blame on Democrats. In 2020, Trump predicted that the stock market would crash if Joe Biden was elected. That was before he began claiming credit for stock increases under Biden, even laughably insisting that stocks were rising only because Trump was ahead in the polls. Now Trump is making the same “if you don’t elect me” threats that he made last time. But the market has gone up by 30% since Trump left office. Under Biden, a record number of Americans have become 401(k) millionaires as those rising markets have buoyed their retirement accounts. Trump’s market predictions are one of his biggest and most obvious lies.

Vice President Kamala Harris did, too. Neither candidate backs the idea now. This easily accessible history didn’t stop Trump from attacking Harris on Thursday as if she still supports single-payer — with the former president arguing that it would be bad to do so. During a rambling press conference at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump said of Harris: “She cosponsored legislation to abolish very popular private health insurance, which 150 [million] Americans rely on, dumping everyone onto inferior socialist government run health care systems with rationing and deadly wait times, while massively raising your taxes. She wants to take away your private health care.” “It’s the best health care in the world,” he continued, adding: “You’re all going to be thrown into a communist system … You’re going to be thrown into a system where everybody gets health care.” None of this is true. Harris did previously support eliminating private health insurance in favor of enacting “Medicare for All,” or a universal health insurance program. She has since backed away from this idea. While Harris has not offered her health care plan yet, her spokesperson recently told NBC News, “The VP will not push single payer as president.” The United States’ health care system is exceptional, but not because it provides the best care in the world. Americans pay far more for health care than residents of other high-income countries — like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Australia — and experience the worst health outcomes. Our life expectancy is lower; infant, maternal, and avoidable deaths are all higher. While taxes would increase under a Medicare for All-style system, studies show Americans would save money in the aggregate. Today, more than 8 percent of Americans are uninsured, and tens of millions are underinsured, meaning they have insurance but cannot afford to access the health services they need. On a financial level, forgoing medical care ultimately creates larger health expenses. Insurers also regularly deny patients’ care, because it helps pad their profits. Trump claimed Thursday that, if the U.S. were to have a universal health care system, “You wait for your doctor, like 10 months, 12 months, 11 months, you gotta see some of these plans, how they work in other countries, it’s disgraceful.” Wait times in the U.S. are already long — not the absolute worst among wealthy countries, but poor nonetheless. Trump reiterated at the end of his health care rant that Harris “could change” her position. “She’s changed on everything,” he said. So has Trump. Years ago, he was a full-blown proponent of single-payer health care. “If you can’t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it’s all over. I mean, it’s no good. So I’m very liberal when it comes to health care,” Trump told Larry King in 1999. “I believe in universal health care. I believe in whatever it takes to make people well and better.” He added that health care should be considered “an entitlement.” In his 2000 book, The America We Deserve, Trump wrote that America should “reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing.” He wrote favorably about the Canadian single-payer system: “Administrative costs across America make up 25 percent of the health care dollar, which is two-and-a-half times the cost of health care administration in Canada. Doctors might be paid less than they are now, as is the case in Canada, but they would be able to treat more patients because of the reduction in their paperwork. The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than Americans.” Trump did not support a single-payer health care system during his 2016 campaign, but he still defended the idea in a Republican debate. “As far as single payer, it works in Canada,” he said. “It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age.”","summary":"Donald Trump repeatedly lies about single-payer health care — an idea he and Harris both previously supported but no longer do","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-kamala-harris-wins-everybody-gets-health-care-1235081328/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-harris-healthcare.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 23:22:50","author":"Andrew Perez,Charisma Madarang","authors":["Andrew Perez","Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":254217510,"title":"Trump says he's 'entitled' to make personal attacks on Harris, citing lack of respect","text":"At a news conference Thursday afternoon at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey -- his second in a week - former President Donald Trump said he's \"entitled\" to insult his Democratic opponent -- Vice President Kamala Harris -- because he doesn't respect her. \"I think I am entitled to personal attacks. I do not have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she'll be a terrible president. And I think it is very important that we win. And whether the personal attacks are good, bad – I mean, she certainly attacks me personally. She actually called me weird. 'He's weird,'\" he said. \"She's not -- she's not smart. I don't believe she loves our country,\" he added. \"Some people say, 'Oh, why don't you be nice?' But they're not nice to me. They want to put me in prison,\" Trump complained. \"They don't want me to be a little bit nasty. They want to put me in prison. Me!\" Asked about how his personal attacks on Harris could affect his standing with suburban women, moderates, and independents, Trump doubled down, saying he's running \"a very calm campaign.\" \"No, I think that, I think relatively to what they're doing and how radical they are and how, in many ways, how sick they are, I think I'm doing a very calm campaign. I mean, we're here. There's no shouting.\" Trump began by highlighting inflation and hitting Harris on the cost of grocery prices as he stood between two tables full of food store items such as cereal, deli meat, milk, eggs, baby formula and bread with a sign saying, \"Price Increases since Kamala Harris took office.\" \"Harris has just declared that tackling inflation will be a Day 1 priority for her. It's going to be Day 1. But Day 1, really, for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Where has she been?\" Trump said. He ticked off a long list of what he said were higher costs for a variety of common grocery items but offered no sourcing for his claims, other than saying the numbers came from \"the government.\" Inflation peaked at 9.1% during the Biden-Harris administration but since cooled to 2.9% in July compared to a year ago --- the lowest inflation reading since March 2021. He eventually veered off into talking about immigration, energy and other favorite topics, making numerous false claims and speaking for 45 minutes before taking any questions. Thursday's news conference follows one that Trump held at his Mar-a-Lago estate last Thursday, fielding questions for more than an hour on a range of topics including his recent attacks on Harris, immigration and reproductive rights. During that long and, at times, rambling exchange with reporters, Trump often pushed false claims on several topics, including the outcome of the 2020 election and size of the crowd at his Jan. 6, 2021, rally before the attacks on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. \"She refuses to do any interviews or press conferences, almost 30 days now, she has not done an interview,\" Trump said of Harris on Wednesday in North Carolina. \"You know why she hasn't done an interview? Because she's not smart. She's not intelligent,\" he said. His campaign says she's trying to \"duck and hide\" from the news media. Trump's recent news conferences appear to be part of the campaign's attempt to draw a contrast between the two candidates. On Thursday, ABC News' Rachel Scott asked him about comments he made to Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk earlier in the week about striking workers, saying, \"they go on strike, and you go, 'You're all gone.'\" \"Are you really comfortable with companies threatening to fire workers who go on strike?\" Scott asked. \"No, I want companies to get workers that are going to love them and work for a wage that lets the company make a profit so they can go and expand,\" Trump said. Trump argued that his comments praising Musk for being the \"greatest cutter\" was not comparable to assertions he was advocating for companies to threaten to fire workers who go on strike -- and then went on to repeat rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are threatening union workers and Black and Hispanic communities. The Harris campaign has been using Trump's news conferences to highlight flubs he has made and criticize policies he advocates. \"Trump did the only thing he knows how to do -- he went out and lied, made up stories, mixed up dates, attacked the media, and, overall, reminded Americans that he is a deeply unwell man,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement reacting to Trump's previous news conference. During her time out on the campaign trail since announcing her White House bid, Harris has held a few exchanges with reporters aboard Air Force Two and answered a few shouted questions; however, her campaign says she will participate in a sit-down interview before the end of the month. \"We will commit to directly engage with the voters that are actually gonna decide this election and that is gonna be complete with rallies, with sit-down interviews, with press conferences, with all the digital assets we have at our disposal,\" Michael Tyler, communications director for the Harris-Walz campaign, said on CNN Wednesday when pressed multiple times to commit to press conferences and media interviews.","summary":"\"She's not smart.

Behind him aides had arranged boxes of Cheerios, tubs of instant coffee and packets of Wonder Bread. The point was to illustrate how prices had risen under the Biden-Harris administration. But the event had also been designed as a chance to paint a picture of his new opponent as a dangerous leftist intent on destroying the country. And he said he would pay no heed to allies who warn him that negative attacks turn off wavering voters. Donald Trump addressed the media at his Bedminster golf club on Thursday. He was surrounded by grocery items designed to show how prices had risen under Kamala Harris Read More EXCLUSIVE Trump STILL leads Harris says Daily Mail poll - as voters reveal biggest hesitation about Kamala... 'I'm very angry at her because of what she's done to the country,' he told an decidedly unconventional press conference at his Bedminster golf club. 'I'm very angry at her that she would weaponize the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. 'I think I'm entitled to personal attacks.' There is never anything normal about a Trump press conference. And this was far from normal, from the moment he walked down the three steps from his clubhouse accompanied by whoops from supporters to the moment he finished taking questions in order to sign caps. His campaign has been in the doldrums since Harris replaced Joe Biden, depriving Trump of a frail, fragile 81-year-old target. Confidants said Thursday's press conference was long scheduled, along with the launch of 'Jewish Voices for Trump' afterwards. The whole point was to begin the business of defining Harris for the chunk of the population that don't know her well. Yet it also had the air of a live-streamed pick-me-up, giving Trump the chance to set aside recent travails and revel in a typically freewheeling speech (almost an hour and 10 minutes) before sparring with journalists for almost as long. He stuck close to his script at times, reeling off inflation statistics. 'Electricity prices are up 32 percent,' he said. 'Gasoline prices are up 50 percent and going higher. Meanwhile, real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year.' Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump after a news conference at Trump National Golf Club Trump had a spring in his step as he spoke for about 47 minutes before taking questions from journalists, some friendly and some hostile At times his supporters, corralled by the side of the live cameras, whooped and cheered. They arrived as if it was just another cocktail-hour mingle on the Bedminster scene. Staff whisked them around on golf buggies. Full-lipped ladies in party frocks rubbed shoulders with polo-shirted golfers and a Greek Orthodox priest whose gold chain outgleamed anything worn by the women. The ninth hole on the old course provided a backdrop to the whole surreal scene, and (at least in the eyes of his supporters) did nothing to undermine Trump's positioning as a man of the people. His plan, he said, was simple. He would open up gas and oil production ('We will drill, baby, drill' in his words), driving energy prices down and bringing with them the cost of the weekly shop. He offered no numbers to support the scheme. Trump positioned himself as a champion of working people as he went about defining Kamala Harris as a vice president who presided over rising prices Republican presidential candidate, former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a news conference outside the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster on August 15, 2024 in Bedminster, New Jersey In contrast, he described Harris's effort to go after 'price-gouging' corporations as 'communist price controls.' 'If they worked, I'd go along with it too,' he said. 'But they don't work. They actually have the exact opposite impact and effect. It leads to food shortages, rationing, hunger, dramatically more inflation.' He said she was bent on turning the U.S. into a northern Venezuela. It was the latest event held to illustrate how Trump is prepared to meet the media head on, in contrast to Harris who has yet to sit down for an interview since becoming the Democratic candidate. Trump reels off the prices of various goods during his press conference And it came as Trump tries to regain the initiative after three weeks of surging donations and enthusiasm for Harris. This week the Trump campaign shook up its top staff. It brought back Corey Lewandowski, who was Trump's first campaign manager back in 2015, as well as Tim Murtagh from his 2020 campaign, two figures from the MAGA Inc super PAC, and others. Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, a former Trump spokesman, Alex Pfeiffer, who was a producer for Tucker Carlson at Fox News before joining the super PAC, online campaigner Alex Bruesewitz and Tim Murtaugh will all advise senior campaign officials. Trump has often proven impatient with staff when his numbers stutter. This week a DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners poll found that Harris's entry into the race left him clinging to a two-point lead. Other polls were even less kind, showing him trailing his new rival. J.L. Partners polled 1001 likely voters from Aug 7 to 11, using a mix of online, landline, cell phone and in-app techniques. The results come with a margin of error of +/- 3.1 points Against that backdrop he has stepped up his appearances in front of the media, and on Monday held a two-hour online conversation with X owner Elon Musk. But he has struggled to stay on message. An address in North Carolina on Wednesday, that was billed as a big economic set piece, included a list of his usual grievances and claims that California was now 'unliveable.' Trump shrugged off the data as the sun dropped over Bedminster. 'I tend to poll low,' he said, reminiscing about how he shocked the world with his unexpected 2016 election win. And he said the shake-up was not a sign of failing campaign. 'It's a sign that we want to close it out,' he said. Every now and again, he admitted, his eye was drawn to the display of groceries. With the maple ham in plastic packaging sweating beside tubs of mayonnaise and Oreos, it was like a 1950s nostalgia trip. 'I haven't seen Cheerios in a long time,' said Trump in between describing his vote haul in the 2020 election. 'I'm going to take them back to my cottage.'

The attack, which led to the deaths of five people and caused injury to an estimated 140 police officers, was the deadliest attack on the Capitol since 1998. While Trump denied involvement directly following the attack, he has since embraced it as an act of patriotism, going so far as to describe the pre-riot rally as a \"love fest\" in an interview with Fox News. Leading up to the election, he has promised to pardon those who have been \"unfairly\" arrested. Since March 2024, Trump has publicly referred to the convicted rioters as hostages, thus altering the terminology to strengthen his campaign. This revisionist approach has fueled his supporters, many of whom now view those incarcerated as martyrs for the cause—some Trump followers have declared him a martyr as well after his surviving an assassination attempt on July 15. In a statement, Judge Royce C. Lamberth warned not to let Jan. 6 become \"a precedent for further violence against political opponents or governmental institutions.\" Right-wing terrorism in the U.S. has found tragic, deadly, and racist expression in crimes. Take the 2022 shooting in which a white nationalist murdered 10 Black people inside Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York. Or when, in 2023, three Black people died at the hands of a far-right 21-year-old inside a Dollar General in Jacksonville, Florida. A report by the Anti-Defamation League linked white supremacists to 21 of the 25 domestic-extremist-related murders in 2022. As a singular event, the Jan. 6 riot was the culmination of years of political division and mounting activity and violence by right-wing extremists. As far back as 2009, the Department of Homeland Security noted a cyclicality to the emergence of right-wing extremism, which was catalyzed in the 2000s by an economic downturn and the election of America's first Black president. To paint a picture of how widespread such activity has been across the U.S., Stacker investigated where the most Jan. 6 rioters have been arrested using data from the Department of Justice as of July 30, 2024. States are ranked by the number of rioters arrested in that state; ties are broken by rioters per million residents, though some ties remain. Of the 1,297 arrests documented on the Department of Justice's database, 104 were not included in the ranking because they did not include arrest locations. Wyoming and North Dakota were also excluded because the states reported no arrests. An estimated 2,000 to 2,500 people entered the Capitol Building during the Jan. 6 riot. As of January 2024, the DOJ has charged more than 1,424 people in association with the riot, either for actions occurring that day or for having a connection to those who performed them. Of those, roughly 820 have pleaded guilty, and about 884 have been adjudicated and sentenced. The DOJ is still actively pursuing cases; full details on all of the current cases associated with the Capitol siege are publicly available from a variety of sources. In July 2024, the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to narrow the obstruction charge for Joseph Fischer in Fischer v. United States. This decision affects the prosecution of 350 convicted defendants with the same charge in the Jan. 6 riots. On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump is \"entitled to some immunity\" from the four felony counts to overturn President Joe Biden's 2020 election and returned the case to the trial court. His trial is now delayed until after the 2024 election. In her dissent, which she read aloud from the bench, Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor wrote: \"When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution ... With fear for our democracy, I dissent.\" Meanwhile, arrests related to the insurrection continue: William George Knight, a man with distinctive blonde dreadlocks and tattoos on his face, was arrested on May 26, 2024. He is accused of \"ramming a giant metal-framed 'TRUMP' sign into a line of police officers\" and then shoving an officer. Videos show him as one of the first to break through the barriers at the Capitol. Read on to see where the most rioters have been arrested so far.

JD Vance, “weird.” Trump lobbed the same insult at Harris’ policies, calling them weird and propping up his own policies regarding the border and taxes. Trump’s comments come after figures such as former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro and former Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have called for the former president to focus on policy instead of trading blows with Harris, with Navarro arguing in a podcast appearance this week that personal attacks hurt Trump among swing voters. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox News this week he believes Trump has to, “Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her positions.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Key Background Trump’s personal attacks on Harris have revolved around her intelligence, laugh and race, as the former president suggested earlier this month she cannot be Black because of her acknowledgment of her Indian heritage. Trump received bipartisan scrutiny over his comment, which he defended in a Truth Social post calling Harris a “phony” and “not black” alongside a video of Harris and Indian American actress Mindy Kaling cooking Indian food. Harris is leading Trump in several polls by two to five points, including ones taken by Monmouth University, Economist/YouGov and Reuters/Ipsos, and is ahead of the former president by one point in a national-head-to-head contest, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average, though Trump led Harris by one point in a recent Fox News poll.

Trump believes parents are the primary decision-makers for their children and supports the money following the child to the school that best meets their needs and aligns with their family’s values. In a May Truth Social post, President Trump said, “School Choice is the CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE of our time, and parents must have a voice in their child’s education! When I am your President again, I will protect Parental Rights, support Teachers, and expand Educational Freedom for all American Families!” At a June campaign rally in Philadelphia, President Trump said, “I will support universal school choice. It’s such a big thing.” Red states are already unleashing education freedom. When teachers unions fought to keep the public schools closed for so long starting in 2020, parents were able to see what was happening in the classroom through “remote learning” and they were not happy about schools focusing more on far-Left indoctrination than education. We’ve seen more advancement on school choice in the past three years than in the preceding three decades. Twelve states have passed universal school choice — meaning all families are eligible — since 2021. School choice is a rising tide that lifts all boats. Public schools up their game in response to competition because it gives them an incentive to cater to the needs of children and their families. In Florida, for example, 10 out of 11 rigorous studies on the topic find school choice improves outcomes in public schools. Florida’s results have improved substantially as they’ve expanded school choice, with the latest U.S. News and World Report ranking putting the Sunshine State at number one for education. They are also now at the top of the pack for student achievement as measured by the Nation’s Report Card after adjusting for differences in student demographics across states. Florida boasts these results despite spending 27% less per student than the national average. Kamala Harris is in lockstep with the teachers unions and thinks your kids belong to the government. A teacher at a Harris campaign rally in August said she originally wanted to get into teaching because she “saw education for what it really was: the greatest instrument of social justice in this country.” Call me crazy, but I thought education was supposed to be about education. Harris further demonstrated her allegiance to the teachers unions by speaking at the American Federation of Teachers convention in July, just a few days after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. At that event, Harris called their president, Randi Weingarten, “a force” and “an incredible friend and an adviser.” That relationship should be disqualifying. No one did more to hold children’s education hostage by fighting to keep schools closed during the COVID era than Randi Weingarten and the teachers unions. Weingarten’s union lobbied the CDC to keep schools closed, threatened strikes over reopening, and engaged in fearmongering every step of the way. In fact, the Chicago Teachers Union posted and later deleted a tweet in December 2020 ridiculously claiming that, “The push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism and misogyny.” The problem is the Democratic Party is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the teachers unions. More than 99% of the campaign contributions from Weingarten’s union went to Democrats in the 2022 election cycle, and it has been that way for decades. The coziness explains why Kamala Harris skipped over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her pick for Vice President. Shapiro seemed like the obvious choice as the governor of a swing state that she needs to win, but he has voiced support for school choice over the past few years. Instead, she picked Minnesota’s far-Left Gov. Tim Walz, who opposes school choice and has downplayed the harms of school closures. In a November 2022 interview, Walz said, “I don’t buy it” when questioned about school closures harming kids, and even said that children benefited from being locked out of the classroom. He said, “these kids learned resiliency, these kids learned compassion […] These kids learned problem solving.” No, sir, they only learned that union-controlled politicians don’t care about them. Harris and Walz apparently only have one solution, which is throwing more money at the problem. We’ve already tried that. New York City’s public schools are a bottomless money pit. They spend more than $35,000 per student per year. Are their public schools the best in the nation? Of course not. NYC’s charter schools outperform their traditional public schools despite spending 20% less per student. Meanwhile, Education spending has skyrocketed in Minnesota under Gov. Walz while the state’s math and reading proficiency has plummeted. We spend nearly $20,000 per student per year in K-12 public schools in the United States, much more than just about any other country in the world, and that amount has increased by 164% since 1970. Have our outcomes gotten 164% better? Of course not. It also degrades the United States’ standing on the world stage. Of 37 countries tested by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the US ranked a dismal 28th in math. It’s the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. The money doesn’t make its way to the classroom because the one-size-fits-all union-controlled government school system is a monopoly with no incentive to spend additional dollars wisely. Average teacher salaries have only increased 3% in real terms since 1970. We are spending plenty of money but it’s wasted on administrative bloat. In fact, school district administrative staff has increased 95% since 2000, whereas student enrollment has only increased by 5% since then. The government school system has become more of a jobs program for adults than an education initiative for kids. The only way out of this mess is to empower families with education freedom. Only then will the government school system have real incentives to cater to the needs of families as opposed to the other way around.

The 45th president hosted an almost 2-hour speech and press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey. The tables were filled with cans of food, meat, milk and cereal, highlighting how much groceries have skyrocketed since Harris became vice president. Trump said that meat, poultry and fish are up 23%, children’s food is up by 24.1%, baking goods by 27.2% and cereal and bakery goods have gone up 26% under the Biden-Harris administration. He predicted that an economic crash will happen if Harris is elected in November, blasted her for wanting to take away his tax cuts and claimed she wants to end private health care in favor of a “Communist system.” Trump noted that the economy was in better shape when he was in office, and asserted that Harris has a “Communist lean.” To solve the price problem, he offered one large solution: “drill baby drill.” “So when I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one. We will end Kamala’s war on American energy, and we will drill baby drill. We’re going to drill, baby drill that’s going to bring down prices of everything, because energy brought it up,” Trump went on. He also reiterated his vow to reduce energy prices in half and no taxes on tips or Social Security, which he said the economy would be able to make back through “growth.” “Within a 12 month period, we’ll be able to reduce prices between regulation and having a tremendous supply which we have,” he said of energy. The no taxes on Social Security is due to the rising inflation, he said, adding that he won’t raise the minimum age. To solve the housing crisis, Trump said he would open up some federal land to build more houses on to increase supply. “We’re going to open up tracks of federal land for housing construction. We desperately need housing for people who can’t afford what’s going on now, and when we open it up and we take off some of the restrictions and regulations.” It comes after Trump on Wednesday outlined his second-term vision to support the middle class, featuring his plans to slash energy prices in half, dramatically claw back taxes and beat back inflation. In the press conference that followed, Trump responded to questions about Republicans pushing him to focus on issues and not personal attacks against Harris, pointing out that she also attacks him and arguing he’s “entitled” to make them. He said, “I’m very angry at her that she’d weaponized the justice system against me and other people very angry at her.” “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks. I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence, and I think she’ll be a terrible president, and I think it’s very important that we win, and whether the personal attacks are good bad. I mean, she certainly attacks me personally.” Trump later said he thinks he’s running a “calm campaign” and that this race is different in terms of strategy and defining his opponent, since “all we have to do” is call them “a communist or a socialist or somebody that’s going to destroy the country.” He barely mention Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, but did criticize him for putting tampons in boys bathrooms in the state. The press conference was Trump’s second in two weeks as he continues to pan Harris for “hiding” and doing zero interviews since taking over for Biden.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump talked at length about the state of the economy on Thursday, slamming Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; soon-to-be-revealed economic agenda as a socialist plan that will continue Biden-Harris policies that have ravaged the cost of living. &#8220;We call it the &#8216;Maduro plan,&#8217; like something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union,&#8221;...","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/15/us-news/trump-blasts-kamala-harris-high-grocery-prices-and-maduro-plan-while-standing-in-front-of-cheerios-meat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87826433.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 23:10:45","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.06},{"id":254215668,"title":"WaPo: Secret Service allows Trump to continue outdoor rallies","text":"WASHINGTON >> The U.S. Secret Service has approved a new plan for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to continue outdoor rallies in the wake of a July assassination attempt, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

The former U.S. president survived an assassination attempt on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The Secret Service has said it was “ashamed” of the security lapse and its chief stepped down in the assassination attempt’s aftermath. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Washington Post report. A rally attendee was killed in the shooting and two others were wounded. FBI officials have yet to identify a motive for the suspected shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, who was shot dead by a Secret Service agent after opening fire. Following the attack, the Secret Service recommended that Trump avoid large outdoor events.

Trump was responding to a question about whether his campaign needs more discipline during a news conference at his New Jersey golf club, where he looked to saddle Harris with the unpopular economic record of US President Joe Biden. “As far as the personal attacks, I’m very angry at her because of what she’s done to the country. I’m very angry at her that she would weaponise the justice system against me and other people, very angry at her. I think I’m entitled to personal attacks,” Trump said. “I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence and I think she’ll be a terrible president,” he added. Trump stuck close to his scripted economic message for more than half an hour, reading from a binder in front of him in a news conference at his New Jersey golf club. Later, he veered into familiar stories he enjoys telling at his rallies. A day earlier, he had struggled to make a sustained case for his economic policies during a meandering speech that his campaign had billed as a major policy address. “Kamala Harris is a radical California liberal who broke the economy, broke the border and broke the world, frankly,” Trump told reporters. Trump was flanked by popular grocery store items, including instant coffee, sugary breakfast cereals and pastries, laid out on tables as he highlighted the cost of everything from food to car insurance to housing. At one point, as he talked about the 2020 election he lost, he noticed a box of cereal. “I haven’t seen Cheerios in a long time,” Trump said. “I’m going to take them back to my cottage.” The event came one day after the US Labour Department announced year-over-year inflation had reached its lowest level in more than three years in July – the latest sign that the worst price spike in four decades is fading. But consumers are still feeling the impact of higher prices – something Trump’s campaign is banking on to motivate voters this fall. Harris is planning her own economic policy speech Friday in North Carolina, promising to push for a federal ban on price gouging on groceries. A small crowd of Trump supporters watched his news conference from the periphery, occasionally cheering him on. But without a crowd of thousands to please with red meat attacks on his enemies, Trump stuck closer to his prepared remarks. Hours before the news conference, Trump’s campaign leaders announced they were expanding his staff, bringing a number of former aides and outside advisers formally into the fold. Corey Lewandowski, Taylor Budowich, Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz and Tim Murtaugh will advise the campaign’s senior leadership. Lewandowski was Trump’s first campaign manager during his 2016 campaign. Budowich and Pfeiffer are moving over from MAGA Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC. Bruesewitz produces pro-Trump content for a large social media following. And Murtaugh was the communications director for Trump’s 2020 campaign. Summer has traditionally been the time for shake-ups in Trump’s two prior campaigns. This year’s change comes weeks after the campaign itself was transformed by Biden’s decision to end his reelection campaign and endorse Harris. Trump gave his top advisers a vote of confidence Thursday, writing on his social media platform that his management team headed by Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles is “THE BEST.” Trump spoke to the press as he steps up his criticism of Harris for not holding a news conference or sitting down for interviews since Biden made way for her.","summary":"The Republican US presidential candidate also says he does not ‘have a lot of respect’ for his Democratic rival’s intelligence.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3274678/donald-trump-says-hes-entitled-personal-attacks-kamala-harris","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/16/4302f95f-ad70-48a5-84b4-fd11b872e43e_e2e1ac35.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:46:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":254214820,"title":"Donald Trump, not Kamala Harris, is the candidate of the working class in Pennsylvania poll","text":"New Keystone State polling shows interesting coalitions lining up behind Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a race the vice president leads by just 3 points, inside the +/- 3.8% margin of error. The Democratic presidential nominee is better regarded by well-educated, affluent voters regardless of race, especially in major metropolitan areas. And the Republican nominee’s base seems to be the less-educated, rural working class, at least according to a Franklin & Marshall survey conducted between July 31 and Aug. 11, with responses from 920 registered voters — 411 Democrats, 378 Republicans and 131 independents. Among white voters without a college degree, Trump dominates Harris, leading 53% to 35%, with Robert Kennedy Jr. at 7% and the Green Party’s Jill Stein at 1%. But while Harris lags against white voters who didn’t finish college, she makes up for it with those who did, taking 62% support, with Trump at 28%, Kennedy at 5% and Libertarian Chase Oliver at 1%. Among all voters, the educational divide is only reinforced. Trump leads Harris 59% to 29% with people with a “high school or less” education and 49% to 37% with those who had “some college.” Yet among those with a college degree, Harris leads 61% to 30%. And while many polls suggest a major ethnic gap in presidential preference, this survey tells a different story. Harris leads by 3 points with white voters, 46% to 43%, with Kennedy at 6%. Among nonwhite voters, Trump leads Harris 44% to 43%; Kennedy’s at 7%. Beyond suggesting education matters more than ethnicity in Pennsylvania, the poll offers further indications voters in the Keystone State see Trump, not Harris, as the working-class hero. The former president does best among those respondents who make less than $35,000 a year, with 48% support against 38% for Harris, 6% for Kennedy, 3% for Jill Stein, 1% for Oliver and 2% for someone else. But those making higher incomes like Harris. She leads Trump 48% to 36% with those making between $35,000 and $75,000 a year, with Kennedy at 8% and no other candidate above 1%. And among those making more than $75,000 a year, Harris is at 52%, with Trump 14 points behind. Some theorize that blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania and other states feel abandoned by the Democratic Party as organized labor’s power has waned, and the data speak to that. Underscoring that theory also in this survey: the concentration of Harris’ support in urban areas. Harris will hope to rack up the votes in what pollsters call “large central metro” areas, where she leads Trump 70% to 20%. She also leads Trump by 3 points in fringe metro areas. For the former president, it’s a shame trees can’t vote, as he dominates in more rural areas. He leads Harris 51% to 39% in medium metros, 56% to 30% in small metros, 54% to 32% in micropolitan areas and 54% to 37% in “noncore” areas. Harris will also rise or fall based on ability to turn out the vote in Philadelphia, which takes its time counting mail ballots like few other cities in the country. She leads 59% to 38% in that area of the state and by 8 points in Allegheny/southwest (the Pittsburgh region). Trump leads Harris in the northwest, northeast and central areas of the state. What’s clear from this survey: Pennsylvania will be hard fought, and for Trump to win, he and his team must be aggressive in turning out voters in more isolated areas to counter Harris’ advantages in population centers. And along those lines, just as in 2020, late-counted votes from urban areas may again make the difference in a close election.","summary":"New Keystone State polling shows interesting coalitions lining up behind Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in a race the vice president leads by just 3 points, inside the +/- 3.8% margin of error.

Former President Donald Trump can win it, however, if he can do what many national polls suggest he can: get up to 20% of the black vote. Democrats win in Michigan because they dominate the urban vote. Just ask President Biden, who carried the state by nearly 3% in 2020 despite winning only 11 of its 83 counties. Those were the ones with Michigan’s large cities: Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Ann Arbor, Flint. These cities and their neighboring suburbs accounted for all his edge and then some. Biden won them with massive margins, too: Ann Arbor voted 87-11 for Biden; Grand Rapids went 70-28. Detroit topped the list with a 94-5 Biden margin, but places like Southfield (87-12) and Flint (82-16) weren’t far behind. These Democratic super-cities all share two characteristics: They are dominated either by college-educated whites in the state capital or large university towns (Lansing, Ann Arbor, East Lansing), or they have high populations of blacks and Latinos. Cut the margins among one or more of these groups, then, and Trump has a path to victory. He won’t do that with bureaucrats or university elites. America’s government managers and large educational institutions are the bastions of the so-called Resistance. Vice President Kamala Harris is the perfect candidate for Zoe from Ann Arbor, and Trump shouldn’t waste his time trying to change their minds. Black and Latino voters, however, have been shifting away from Democrats. Exit polls showed Biden beat Trump 92-7 with Michigan black voters, but the most recent New York Times-Siena poll showed Harris winning that demo by only 80-14. That may not seem like a big difference, but blacks were 12% of the total electorate in 2020 per the exit poll. If Harris wins them by 20 points fewer than Biden, that alone would cut 2.4% off Biden’s 2.8% statewide margin, reducing Harris’ expected lead to a mere 0.4%. Cutting her lead with Latinos and other nonwhite voters would do even more damage. They cast a combined 8% of the vote, with Latinos going 55-44 for Biden and other races backing him 66-30 — roughly 61-36 combined. The NYT/Siena poll had Harris winning by only 50-43 among Latinos and other nonwhites. Decreasing the Democrats’ margin with other nonwhites from 25 to 7 points would, along with the drop in black support, flip the state to Trump if his share of the white vote stays constant. Some of that decline may be due to the state’s Arab population. Hard numbers are difficult to come by, but it appears there are between 300,000 and 400,000 Arab and other Middle Eastern residents in Michigan. Many are not citizens, and they are not a large enough demographic to flip the state to Trump on their own. But they are numerous enough to contribute to a Trump victory if they abandon Harris over the administration’s policy towards Gaza. Harris will surely try to regain support among these traditionally Democratic groups, but she also hopes to expand the growing Democratic support in educated suburbs too. The NYT/Siena poll shows her ahead by 55-40 among whites with a college degree compared with Biden’s 53-46 margin. College-educated whites cast 29% of the state’s votes in 2020; expanding the Democratic lead with this demographic by 8 points roughly offsets the polling decline among blacks. That will give Harris the win if she maintains that level of support. Trump will win most places in the state because of his massive backing from its white working-class voters. Michigan is still home to a large population of whites without a college degree, and they abandoned their long-standing Democratic heritage to back Trump in 2016 and 2020. Gogebic County on the state’s remote Upper Peninsula best exemplifies this trend. It had not backed a Republican for president since 1972, when Richard Nixon swept to a historic landslide. Yet it gave Trump 54% in 2016 and 56% in 2020, creating a 20-point shift in the margin from Obama’s 8-point win there in 2012. Trump’s problem is that non-college whites are a shrinking share of the Wolverine State’s electorate. They cast 52% of the vote in 2020 but were only 50% of the sample in the recent NYT/Siena poll. Whites without a college degree are much older than other demographics, and merely the passage of time is reducing their political power. Michigan will be a reach for Trump, but it is a must-win state for Harris. Expect her to try to nail it down as early as she can. If she’s still spending lots of time here in October, it’s a sign her campaign is faltering.

Trump spoke for roughly 40 minutes before taking questions at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf resort. His lengthy diatribe touched on his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, his former opponent, Joe Biden, and a wide range of other issues — trucks, domestic energy policy, China and the wars in Gaza and Ukraine — all while flanked by two tables covered in groceries including Cheerios, a pack of quickly-warming raw bacon and tins of coffee. It was a spectacle that was clearly focused by his campaign to provide a platform for the GOP contender to attack Harris over economic issues, particularly inflation and the cost of consumer goods. However, the lack of any central focus in Trump’s remarks led to the event dragging on and losing some of its edge. In his first question, he was asked about Israel and his communications with Benjamin Netanyahu, rather than the economy. Questions were largely softballs and teed up the ex-president to launch attacks at Harris and set out a plan for his second-term agenda. But the president didn’t offer much of a vision for the future or how he would tackle the issues. Instead, he opted to look to the post to talk about the conditions when he was in the White House. Journalists failed to ask about newly uncovered remarks from JD Vance, his running mate, declaring “the whole purpose” of post-menopausal women to be assisting with child-rearing. “You've spoken very passionately about how God saved your life. And I'm wondering, have you put much thought into why God saved your life? As in, for what purpose has he been shielding you?” one reporter, veering closely towards cheerleading, asked Trump. The ex-president responded by riffing about his teleprompter and a chart displayed behind him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was nearly assassinated in July, before quipping: “Yeah, God has something to do with it. It's, it's a miracle, and God had something to do with it. And maybe it's [because] we want to save the world.” One change of pace for Trump appeared to be his apparent newfound acceptance of the fact that Harris will indeed be his opponent in the fall. While he derided the pressure campaign calling on Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race as a “coup”, there was no mention of his past suggestion that Biden would appear at the upcoming Democratic National Convention to attempt to “take back” his party’s nomination. The former president also attempted to back away from his remarks in support of Elon Musk firing striking workers, though he vaguely suggested that he wanted workers to accept wages that would allow companies to make profits. But more than anything else, this was a rehashing of the same flustered response to the newly-crowned Harris’s sudden recovery in the polls: none of his criticism of Harris or Tim Walz, her running mate, was any different from what Republicans have been slinging at the Harris campaign over the past few weeks since the incumbent president stepped aside from the campaign. Perhaps the clearest sign of that was Trump’s ongoing inability to pronounce Harris’s name — “Kamala”, he repeated several times, with different pronunciations at different moments during his remarks. He also claimed that people did not know Harris’s last name: “it’s Harris”, he informed reporters at his presser. Harris’s campaign, meanwhile, was busy pounding away at their opponent hours before the ex-president even took the microphone. “TODAY: Donald Trump To Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home,” the vice president’s campaign declared in a news release ahead of his remarks. It then presciently advised: “Tune in for the same old thing.”","summary":"Analysis: John Bowden details how the latest press conference from Donald Trump offered nothing new or different as the president continues to use the same messaging that has seen him drop in the polls.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-press-conference-bedminster-harris-b2597145.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/15/23/SEI217524298.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HbhLMibu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:41:24","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":254214640,"title":"Donald Trump 'Flailing Wildly' During Presser, Ex-Obama Advisor Warns","text":"Former President Donald Trump was \"flailing wildly\" while attempting to attack Vice President Kamala Harris during a press conference on economic policies, according to a former key adviser to ex-President Barack Obama.Speaking at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday, the former president told reporters that he feels \"entitled to personal attacks\" on Harris because he does not \"have a lot of respect for her\" or \"her intelligence.\"While Trump blamed Harris for President Joe Biden's economic policies and illustrated inflation with a display of cereal boxes, he also strayed off topic by repeating false claims that his 2020 election loss was illegitimate and re-airing grievances about his legal troubles.In a series of posts to X, formerly Twitter, David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for both of Obama's successful presidential campaigns, compared Trump's display to \"a rattled old boxer\" desperately attempting to attack a younger fighter in the form of Harris.\"'I think I'm entitled to personal attacks.'

After attacking Vice President Kamala Harris both on policy and by stating “I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence,” he turned to the Democratic pair’s use of the term “weird” to describe Republicans, which Walz popularized. “She certainly attacks me, personally. She actually called me ‘weird,’” Trump began, before going on to defend both himself and particularly his running mate. “‘He’s weird.’ It was just a soundbite — and she called J.D. and I ‘weird.’ He’s not weird — he was a great student at Yale, he went to Ohio State, graduated in two years, at the top of his class and all of these different things.” Turning to criticize Minnesota Gov. Walz, Trump continued, “And we have this guy that’s running a failed, really, a very failed state, who’s had a terrible career. I mean, you have him saying, ‘They’re weird’ — no, he’s a weird guy.” Trump then pivoted, looking to turn the “weird” term around on Harris in a different way. “And she’s weird in her policy. Who wouldn’t want to have strong borders? Who doesn’t want to have lower taxes?” Among other attacks of his own, Trump continued the standard conservative talking point of calling liberal policies “communist,” including remarking that under Harris, “You’re all going to be thrown into a communist system. You will be thrown into a system where everybody gets health care.” Trump spoke next to a table full of common groceries, which he joked about taking back to his cottage at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey — particularly the Cheerios. The props were used to drive home the Trump-Vance campaign’s argument about inflation under President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris. The former president also defended his stylistic approach during the long press conference, which featured numerous tangents throughout, including more talk about batteries — but this time, the batteries in electric vehicles as opposed to batteries and sharks. “I think I’m doing a very calm campaign,” he said. “We are here. There is no shouting. Some of you will say he ranted and raved. I didn’t rant and rave. I’m a very calm person.” As far as personal remarks of his own, Trump again brought up the illustration of Harris on the cover of Time Magazine after previously stating that it was so beautiful that it made her look reminiscent of his own wife, Melania. “They got a great artist to do it. What was that all about? The whole thing is crazy,” he said. This is Trump’s second press conference in a week as the Trump campaign criticizes Harris for still not giving a press conference since taking over the top of the Democratic Party’s ticket. She has been running for less than a month and will be speaking at rallies and the Democratic National Convention next week, while her campaign has also committed to doing a sitdown interview by the end of the month.

It was a more subdued Trump than we saw last week, when he used every question from reporters to unload a new personal attack on Vice President Kamala Harris. His campaign and close associates have reportedly been trying to get him to shift his gears for days — with some MAGA allies urging him publicly to stop making racist remarks about Harris and to start talking about his policy platform. While this afternoon’s grievancefest was clearly an attempt to get Trump back on track, it was also obvious the former President was bored by his own discipline. Glancing down to ramble off what sounded like bullet points on Harris’ supposed failings as part of the Biden administration, Trump didn’t even try to hide the fact that he was reading off of a piece of paper. He’d occasionally veer in the direction of off topic — ranting about “bird cemeteries” while trying to remind voters that he’s going to push to expand fracking, “drill baby drill” — but the entire display was of a man reluctant to stay on message, forced to talk about the economy rather than crowd sizes. At one point, he appeared to remember that he had to make use of the props his team had set out for him, perhaps to keep him on script. “You are looking at things behind me — they did a nice job,” Trump said, beholding some groceries his team had set up. “I don’t like the tags very much. Look at that. Up 46 percent. Eggs. Wow.” “I think I’m going to take some of them back to my cottage,” he said of the groceries. “And have a lot of fun. Like the Cheerios. I haven’t seen Cheerios in a long time, I’m gonna take them back with me. Bacon is through the roof, they’re all through the roof! The milk. Everything is bad,” he said. When a reporter asked a question about his campaign’s effort to keep him focused on policy, he made it clear who, he thinks, is in charge. “I think I’m entitled to personal attacks.” The Best Of TPM Today Yesterday’s Most Read Story What We Are Reading","summary":"Donald Trump held another press conference on Thursday, this time outside of his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/where-things-stand/trumps-latest-press-strategy-reading-off-a-piece-of-paper-in-front-of-reporters","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2166231401.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:30:37","author":"Nicole Lafond","authors":["Nicole Lafond"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":254216850,"title":"How Democrats are raising the stakes in war on Project 2025","text":"A small group of House Democrats launched a task force in June to counter Project 2025, the fascistic, dystopian blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration. Now that the specter of the very unpopular scheme has broken through to the general public, Democrats ranging from leadership to the local level are ramping up their efforts to make the issue central to elections up and down the ballot. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries started coordinating with the group before the August recess and is working on shaping a strategy for House Democrats to tackle in the remaining weeks before the election, including field hearings and forums. But they’re not waiting for Congress to come back into session to go on the attack. Leaders of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee issued a challenge to members to use the rest of the August recess to hold information sessions with constituents and warn about the danger of a second Trump term, which could make the very scary goals of Project 2025 a reality. It’s working. In Pennsylvania, Rep. Susan Wild is talking to local media. “I serve with a whole bunch of members in the House of Representatives who see this as their mission – Project 2025 is their mission,” she told The Keystone. Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington held a town hall meeting this week to talk about it, after holding another town hall in late July that included fellow Washingtonians Rep. Adam Smith and Sen. Patty Murray. Even Democratic candidates for state races in Indiana are using it as a campaign issue. \"People want to talk about it as though it's this abstract thing; it's not,\" state House candidate Heidi Beidinger said in a forum earlier this month. \"They're talking about getting rid of the Department of Education. What are we doing here in Indiana? We're crippling public education. They want to get rid of veteran's rights and healthcare. It's not so great here in Indiana.\" The Democrats on the House Budget Committee are using their bully pulpit to send out fact sheets about the plan’s tax cuts for the rich and goals to slash health care. And a group of members are trying to highlight how much of the plan has been kept secret from the public, particularly Project 2025's so-called \"Fourth Pillar,\" the yet-to-be-released outline for the first six months of a second Trump administration. “This is the Insurrection Act. This is potentially deploying the military in different parts of the United States, domestically, possibly even invoking martial law,” Rep. Jared Huffman, one of the members asking for information about the Fourth Pillar, told The Hill. “I mean, none of this is out of the realm of authoritarian possibility for these people.” House Democrats are also using social media to get the word out, like in this tweet commemorating the 89th anniversary of Social Security. “This is a deeply resonant issue with the public because everyone stands to be impacted by it, and it’s a matter of life and death for our democracy and our communities,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told The Hill. The plan essentially wages war on abortion rights, public education, health care, and the LGBTQ+ community, among other things. While Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, it was written with the help of 140 current and former members of his campaign and White House staff. The plan was produced by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, and its leaders have been tripping over each other in a clumsy effort to mitigate the public fallout. “They’ve just given us this awesome opportunity to paint full contrast on every single issue of importance and we intend to continue totally taking advantage of it,” a senior aide told The Hill. Expect Democrats to push that advantage hard at the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which will be their biggest stage yet to lay out the stakes for this election.","summary":"A small group of House Democrats launched a task force in June to counter Project 2025, the fascistic, dystopian blueprint for a second Donald Trump administration.

We will bring back ‘Merry Christmas.’ Remember the stories saying, ‘We need to refuse to say “Merry Christmas?”‘ We brought it back. She’s against saying ‘Merry Christmas.’ When you defund the police, you’re against ‘Merry Christmas,’ and you want open borders. That’s enough. Oh, and she wants to take away your guns.

A recently unearthed video of Harris from that 2017 incident shows her bashing Trump for wishing people a Merry Christmas when illegal alien children did not have citizenship amnestied upon them. “And when we all sing happy tunes and sing ‘Merry Christmas,’ and wish each other ‘Merry Christmas,’ these children are not going to have a Merry Christmas,” Harris said. “How dare we speak ‘Merry Christmas.’ How dare we?

Trump held a press conference Thursday at his Bedminster, New Jersey property. The former president and Republican presidential nominee stood at the podium with groceries on display, and delivered remarks focused on the rising costs under the Biden-Harris administration. \"Harris has just declared that tackling inflation will be a ‘Day One priority’ for her,\" Trump said Thursday. \"But Day One for Kamala was three and a half years ago.\" TRUMP ARGUES HARRIS IS MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE SANDERS — HERE'S WHAT THE VERMONT SENATOR TOLD FOX NEWS \"Where has she been and why hasn't she done it? Why hasn't she done it?\" Harris has been the Democratic presumptive presidential nominee for 25 days and has not held a press conference or a sit-down interview with the media. Trump said Harris' campaign is \"hiding\" her, in a similar way he said the Biden campaign was \"hiding\" him. \"They're hiding her no different than him, because I believe she's grossly incompetent,\" Trump said. \"And I don't think that when people hear what she has to say, they're going to buy it.\" Sources in Trump's political orbit tell Fox News that top advisers to the former president are quietly aiming to persuade him to tamp down the insults to Harris and the questioning of the vice president's racial identity and instead focus on branding her an ultra-liberal and spotlighting her stance on the border, crime and inflation. But Trump, during the press conference Thursday, was asked about the \"personal attacks\" against Harris. \"Because of what she’s done to the country, I'm very angry at her – that she had weaponized the justice system against me and other people. Very angry at her,\" Trump said. \"I think I'm entitled to personal attacks.\" Trump added: \"I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she'd be a terrible president.\" \"I think it's very important that we win,\" he continued. \"And whether the personal attacks are good or bad, I mean, she certainly attacks me personally.\" Trump said Harris \"actually called me weird… And she called JD and I weird. He's not weird. He was a great student at Yale. He went to Ohio State, graduated in two years at the top of his class, and all of these different things.\" Trump pointed to Harris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, saying he is \"a weird guy\" and Harris is \"weird in her policy.\" \"Who wouldn’t want to have strong borders?\" Trump said. \"Who doesn't want to have lower taxes?\" TRUMP CAMPAIGN PLANS COUNTER-PROGRAMMING DURING DEMOCRATS' CONVENTION \"You know, all my life I've watched as politicians campaigned and I've always been on, you know, for the most part on the other side, on the side that these people are on and they always talked about, we're going to reduce taxes — this is the only campaign I've ever heard where they're saying, we're going to increase your taxes,\" Trump continued. Trump stressed that the voters \"don’t know who she is.\" \"She is a radical left socialist,\" Trump said. \"But beyond that, I mean, she's way beyond socialism, who's going to destroy our country and when they find out, I think you're going to see something.\" Trump defended his attacks against Harris. \"I just want to win for the country. Some people say, oh, why don't you be nice? But they're not nice to me,\" he said. They want to put me in prison. You know, just so you understand. You know, they tell me I should be nice. They want to put me in prison. It's never happened before in the history of our country. I did nothing wrong.\" Trump was referring to his legal challenges--many cases have been thrown out or delayed. As for his campaign, Trump said he wished he didn't have to run. \"If our country were run by Democrats and it was run beautifully, where we were really being productive and everything else, I would have never done this,\" Trump said. \"I wouldn't have done it if I thought I couldn't have won. I think I can win, I think I can win easily once they're exposed for what they are, which is, you know, radical left lunatics. And that's what they are.\" Trump said Harris is \"going to ruin our country.\" \"And I just hope the people of our country, and I believe they are, because I see it already happening,\" Trump said. \"But I hope they are able to think for themselves, because if they think for themselves, if they look at the destruction that's going to be caused by Kamala and this, this person from out of nowhere, he came out of nowhere, a state that I love that state, but a state that's doing so poorly where he's the one that signed to put tampons in boys bathrooms…signed a bill that boys bathrooms, all boys bathrooms in Minnesota will have tampons and what's going on?\" \"What's wrong with us? What's wrong with us as a country?\" Trump said. \"So no, if we had somebody doing a phenomenal job, I would be extremely happy.\" Trump said that even while he campaigns and hopes to win in November, what he wants is the country to do \"really well\" in the final months of Biden's term, even though he said it \"would make it probably a little bit harder to win.\" \"I hope the country does really well. It's country first. I want our country to do great,\" Trump said. \"If they were great leaders, I would be the first to say they're doing a fantastic job.\" Meanwhile, Trump was asked why he felt God saved his life on July 13 after the assassination attempt at his Butler, Pa. rally. \"That was a miracle,\" Trump said. \"God has something to do with it. It's a miracle and God has something to do with it.\" \"Maybe it's--we want to save the world,\" he continued. \"This world is going down.\" Hours before Thursday's news conference, the Harris campaign put out a mock email advisory titled \"Donald Trump to Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer told Fox News that \"Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are talking to voters, laying out a vision of the middle class, and letting Americans know they will fight for their freedoms.\" He argued that \"Donald Trump can talk to whoever he wants, but he can't explain away his toxic Project 2025 agenda, speak in coherent thoughts, or offer anything but insults and higher prices to the middle class.\"","summary":"Former President Trump held yet another hours-long press conference Thursday—his second this month—in an effort to draw a stark contrast between his candidacy and his opponent.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-conducts-no-holds-barred-press-conference-while-harris-continues-dodging-media","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/52e91caa-bff0-4e28-b187-b9605f54fe63/c969bdb7-7e6e-41d9-8ed6-c990eda2dba2/1280x720/match/896/500/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:17:45","author":"Brooke Singman","authors":["Brooke Singman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":254214096,"title":"Trump uses second press conference to rehash same complaints but offers few details on vision for 2025","text":"One week after a rambling press conference in Florida, Donald Trump held another almost identical one in New Jersey where he rehashed previous complaints about Kamala Harris, but offered few new details on his own vision for the presidency. The former president appeared outside his Bedminster golf club on Thursday afternoon and began by declaring he could take his time because of the weather. “The rain is not imminent, based on the fact there are no clouds,” he said. Trump then moved onto a selection of his favorite subjects, Kamala Harris’ record, immigration and the economy – at one point listing off a number of everyday grocery items and their price increases. The press conference was staged in front of two tables loaded with products including coffee and Froot Loops breakfast cereal. “A radical left person wants to put price controls all over the place, which will end up driving up your prices, not down,” he said. “Harris has just declared that tackling inflation will be a day one priority for her. It’s going to be day one. But day one really for Kamala was three and a half years ago. Where has she been and why hasn’t she done it?” His comments come as Wall Street rallied to one of its best days of the year on Thursday after data showed the US economy is holding up better than expected. \"We’re gonna have a crash like a 1929 crash,\" Trump said, while Fox News’ onscreen chyron showed the Dow up by 554 points. He later spent around five minutes discussing trucks and the change to electric vehicles. After blasting Harris as the “worst border czar in history,” the former president went on to claim that “virtually 100 percent” of net job creation in the last year has gone to migrants, but later added that the number was “beyond that number.” Trump’s remarks were punctuated by jeering and laughter from a group of supporters gathered at the press conference. The former president often glanced down at prepared remarks on the lectern, but appeared to go off topic multiple times. Republican donors and allies have urged Trump to stay on message during his public speaking events. During previous campaign rallies, he has strayed into conspiracy theories that allies reportedly believe stunt his ability to tackle the recent wave of momentum of Harris’ campaign. Hours before the press conference on Thursday, the campaign sent out a media advisory trolling Trump. “TODAY: Donald Trump to Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home,” the title of the email read. The release referred to Trump as the “loser of the 2020 election by 7 million votes”, who would hold “another public meltdown” at his golf club and took aim at his recent pattern of going on long-winded, lie-filled rants. During last week’s recent press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump spent nearly an hour ranting about how the media covers the size of his rallies compared to Harris, attacking her record and complaining about the Democrats replacing Biden with Harris. In his interview with Elon Musk earlier this week, the former president spent more than 90 minutes going over talking points he often highlights in his rallies – the US-Mexico border, Biden’s failure to control the number of migrant crossings and more.","summary":"The former president appeared outside his Bedminster golf club on Thursday afternoon, and began by declaring he could take his time because of the weather","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-press-conference-bedminster-harris-election-b2597139.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/15/22/SEI217522761.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HbhLMibu-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:16:21","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":254214072,"title":"Trump relies on complaints as his popularity decreases: News from the Political Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.

Trump ramps up false attacks on election integrity as he slides in the polls By Matt Dixon and Jonathan Allen As he peers out at a new political reality, with Vice President Kamala Harris having reversed Democrats’ slide in the race for the White House, former President Donald Trump is rolling out pre-emptive excuses for a possible second defeat. Most are demonstrably false. Trump has said in recent days that President Joe Biden’s exit from the race, prompted by Democratic concerns that he would lose, is unconstitutional. It is not. The Constitution is silent on party nominations. He and his allies have accused Harris of generating fake pictures of crowds through the use of artificial intelligence as a means of boosting perceptions of her electoral strength. Her audiences are real. On Thursday, Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that Judge Juan Merchan is using a partial gag order to prevent him from talking to reporters in the midst of a campaign. The narrow order allows him to speak to the media so long as he doesn’t attack the families of the officers of the court. For instance, Trump held a news conference at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club today after holding one at Mar-a-Lago last week. Trump’s renewed focus on building a false case that Democrats are trying to cheat him — almost four years after his effort to overturn the 2020 election results ended with his supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College votes — speaks to his insecurities, according to people familiar with his behavior, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from the most powerful figure in the Republican Party. Those insecurities aren’t about election integrity but rather about his chances of winning — and his frustration at not being the center of the national political discussion at all times, these people said. Some Republicans worry that he has once again become distracted from issues important to voters, including inflation and immigration, as he pursues grievances that don’t resonate with swing voters. “He can’t ever be a loser,” one former senior Trump adviser said of the former president’s push to cast the election as unfair. “He’s just going to do anything he can that he knows gives him attention,” the former adviser said, explaining that Trump views domination of media coverage as a sign of his political strength. Inside the rift that could define the future of Pennsylvania politics By Allan Smith John Fetterman was angry. The Democratic senator from Pennsylvania was readying to speak at a disaster response press conference in Bucks County on July 16, 2023, just hours after flooding in Upper Makefield, Pennsylvania, that ultimately killed seven people. Local officials spoke for a few minutes to offer an initial update for the assembled press. Then, Gov. Josh Shapiro provided information on what his administration was doing to respond to the emergency. After a few minutes, Shapiro tossed the microphone back to the local responders — not Fetterman. Moments later, the event wrapped without Fetterman ever speaking. Already deeply skeptical of Shapiro, Fetterman swore off appearing at events alongside the governor going forward, as three sources familiar with the incident told NBC News. The episode highlighted what has become an increasingly volatile relationship between Pennsylvania’s two most ambitious elected officials. It’s a Democratic Party rivalry that is suddenly spilling out into full view and has the potential to shape state politics — and maybe even the national political scene — for years to come. Earlier this month, as Harris was wrapping up her search for a running mate and was considering Shapiro among her final choices, Politico reported that Fetterman aides told Harris’ team the senator had concerns about Shapiro. Days later, Fetterman sat stone-faced with his arms crossed as Shapiro delivered a rousing speech at the Philadelphia rally where Harris introduced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her No. 2. Seated among a delegation of Pennsylvania politicians right in front of the press section, the 6-foot-8 Fetterman stood out as a lone member who did not join in the clapping and cheering for Shapiro. “For most PA politicos, it’s pretty well known that the two clashed,” one Pennsylvania Democrat said. “It was obvious that those two were always on the collision course and the only thing that kept them apart was that they were going for different types of offices.” “It almost feels like our dirty laundry is being let out to air,” this person added. Multiple people said the feud appears to be much more about Fetterman training his ire at Shapiro than the other way around, particularly as the senator has taken public steps to express his displeasure while Shapiro has not. Two unconnected Pennsylvania Democrats separately compared the ordeal to a popular meme from the hit TV show “Mad Men,” in which one person standing in an elevator criticizes Don Draper, the series’ main character, who responds, “I don’t think about you at all.” That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

In a press conference at Trump National Golf Club, in Bedminster, New Jersey on Thursday intended to focus on inflation and economics, Trump kicked up his prop game a handful of notches, standing next to a table full of a wide range of pantry items — Folgers Coffee, Fruit Loops and a package of uncooked bacon, etc. — to further illustrate a point that he never quite made due to frequently distracting himself with talk of being \"a big fan of electricity,\" ICE agents brawling with migrants and Harris being a communist. Claiming at one point that, in California, there's a law that says you can rob stores as long as you don't rob more than $950 worth of stuff, Trump went on in this fashion for nearly 30 minutes before taking a single question from press, with CNN cutting away in their coverage as he rambled. Reading the bulk of his statements from a binder in front of him, Trump leaned in hard on Harris while standing next to his groceries, saying she has \"a very strong communist lean\" and wants to \"end detention of illegal alien migrants, releasing vicious monsters into our communities to rape, maim and murder.\" Prior to Trump's presser, the Harris campaign issued a media advisory that was heavily shared on social media, writing: Not so fresh off NABJ, Florida, and Twitter glitches, Donald Trump intends to deliver another self-obsessed rant full of his own personal grievances to distract from his toxic Project 2025 agenda, unpopular running mate, and increasing detachment from the reality of the voters who will decide this election. These remarks will not be artificial intelligence, but they certainly will lack intelligence. Banning abortion, raising costs on families, confusing basic facts, cutting Social Security and Medicare, blocking border security, and being publicly unstable, unfit, and unwell will not help his struggling campaign for president. Tune in for the same old thing. In contrast to Trump's efforts at the presser, on Friday, Harris is set to unveil “the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries — setting clear rules of the road to make clear that big corporations can’t unfairly exploit consumers to run up excessive corporate profits on food and groceries,” according to a campaign statement sourced by to The Washington Post.

An Emerson College poll released Thursday shows that former President Donald Trump’s long-standing lead over President Joe Biden has evaporated, disappearing about as quickly as Biden’s candidacy did after his historically bad performance in the first presidential debate. “The first Emerson College Polling national survey following President Biden’s decision not to seek re-election finds Vice President Kamala Harris leading Donald Trump 50% to 46%. Five percent of likely voters are undecided. With undecided voters’ support allocated, Harris continues to lead by four, 52% to 48%,” pollsters wrote. “With third-party candidates on the ballot, Harris and Trump’s support evenly decreases by two points, Harris to 48% and Trump to 44%. Four percent support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,” they wrote. According to Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling, the slight shift in support among all voters from Trump’s camp to Harris’ is underscored by remarkable movement among voters under 30, those over 70, and independents. “Likely voters under 30 have shifted toward Harris by nine points, 56% of whom supported Biden, 65% now support Harris. Voters over 70 also support Harris over Trump, 51% to 48% — last month they broke 50% to 48% for Trump,” he said. “Independents break for Harris, 46% to 45%, flipping since last month when likely independent voters broke for Trump 45% to 44%.” Emerson College’s poll of about 1,000 likely voters shows Harris leading outside of the 3% margin of error, and tracks closely with a much larger Morning Consult survey of 11,778 registered voters which was released earlier in the week. According to that poll, Harris is up by three points over Trump, a slight slump over the previous week. “Harris leads Trump, 47% to 44%. That margin is down 1 percentage point from her record 4-point lead in our last update. Harris has not trailed Trump in a single daily tracking survey since we first updated this page with their head-to-head matchup in late July,” pollsters wrote. According to Morning Consult, the “Harris Honeymoon” is far from over. “For the third week running since launching her presidential campaign, voters remained more likely to say they heard something positive (47%) than negative (33%) about Harris by a double-digit margin. Her net buzz rating (the share of voters who heard something positive minus the share who heard something negative) bests Trump’s rating from last week by a whopping 33 points,” they wrote. Trump would need to turn to more friendly territory in order to find a recent poll that shows him winning. A Fox News survey released Thursday shows the former president up by a single point, but that’s only in a theoretical race that doesn’t include third party options. “Vice President Kamala Harris trails former President Donald Trump by one percentage point in the latest Fox News national survey, 49-50%. Last month, she was also behind Trump by one point, 48-49% — as was President Joe Biden, with the same 48-49% result,” Fox wrote. “In the expanded presidential ballot, Harris and Trump received 45% each, while support for Kennedy stands at 6%. All others are at 1%,” they wrote. The general election is scheduled for Nov. 5.","summary":"Kamala Harris leads Trump by 4 points in new 2024 poll","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/15/kamala-harris-leads-trump-by-4-points-in-new-2024-poll/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BHR-Z-LOWRY-01_73c00b.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:07:21","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":254213460,"title":"Let Humans Drive The Bus: Insights On LLM Limitations And More","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin We often ponder the calculus of AI and its interactions with ourselves – or, maybe more specifically, the context of its use in business applications. How does it work? How should it work? And how are these aligned? Some of that has to do with fears around job displacement. Some of it has to do with how AI might influence our decision-making. Then there’s the competition theory of it that keeps executives up at night… Shot of a young businesswoman looking stressed out while working in an office getty Usama Fayyad, Chairman and Founder of Open Insights, gave a lecture on AI at a science dinner recently that I found to be applicable to the above questions. Some of his beginning remarks focused on enthusiastic ‘hype’ for the near term, and how that can be problematic. “It sets expectations that get us in trouble,” he said, conceding that there are real transformations happening. In looking at how to govern projects, he set up a fundamental assertion that two things are critical in the rollout of AI/ML systems – data, and human input. As for algorithms, he said, as “stochastic parrots,” all they know is data without context. So that requires what he called “armies of generalists” using the technology for insight and application. In other words, don’t forget the human in the loop!

As for job displacement, Fayyad suggested we will be integrating AI into many workflows. “A human using AI will replace your job, unless you’re using AI yourself,” he said. The best way for people to learn, Fayyad proposed, is to lay out and compare AI results to human results, and start to understand the differences. As for ChatGPT and its genesis, which quickly shocked the world, he noted that it was the user base that propelled this technology to such great heights – despite challenges like the cost to train the model. A human and bionic arm connecting, forming a heart. getty “It’s essentially a chatbot that’s sitting on top of an LLM,” he said. Noting some of the dangers of powerful AI, he contrasted what he called “amusing applications” (i.e. an astronaut riding a horse) to others that could be more subtle and insidious, for example, celebrity and political deepfakes. Some demos he presented illustrated how this works, with ChatGPT generating images of the pope wearing designer gear, or Donald Trump being arrested. More Quotes from Usama Fayyad: “(of algorithms): They're not thinking. They don't have a purpose. They don't understand when they're doing harm, or not just trying to answer the question. Therefore, they should become very easy to manipulate into coming up with anything like: tell me how many times I should eat rocks to maintain my health, … and so forth.” “We can enable a lot of stuff, and that allows us to use all the open source (models) available out there for use. Ease of use and integration is becoming a big deal.” “The techniques now are maturing … smaller (models) can be more affordable, more stable, and of course, give you the chance of building your own private one where you don't have to rely on public large language models … so that narrowing of specialization is becoming important.” Other examples showed genAI producing items like Bloomberg queries with startling efficiency. In discussing a way forward, in addition to promoting human involvement in AI projects, Fayyad said academia can assist business in figuring out the best way forward for states. One of the more interesting points of this presentation came near the end, where Fayyad talked rather specifically about what LLMs do and do not do. They don’t hallucinate, he said, they make errors. They don’t think, they mimic conversation. They don’t have opinions, they reflect them, and they produce outcomes that are not specifically “intended” in the way that we humans understand. It’s good to get a refresher on the limits of LLM “behavior” in this way. Partly because we’re seeing so much hype, we may need to put on the brakes a little, and re-evaluate what we are abdicating to LLMs. After all, it’s our future we’re deciding. Follow me on LinkedIn.

Trump ramps up false attacks on election integrity as he slides in the polls By Matt Dixon and Jonathan Allen As he peers out at a new political reality, with Vice President Kamala Harris having reversed Democrats’ slide in the race for the White House, former President Donald Trump is rolling out pre-emptive excuses for a possible second defeat. Most are demonstrably false. Trump has said in recent days that President Joe Biden’s exit from the race, prompted by Democratic concerns that he would lose, is unconstitutional. It is not. The Constitution is silent on party nominations. He and his allies have accused Harris of generating fake pictures of crowds through the use of artificial intelligence as a means of boosting perceptions of her electoral strength. Her audiences are real. On Thursday, Trump claimed in a Truth Social post that Judge Juan Merchan is using a partial gag order to prevent him from talking to reporters in the midst of a campaign. The narrow order allows him to speak to the media so long as he doesn’t attack the families of the officers of the court. For instance, Trump held a news conference at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club today after holding one at Mar-a-Lago last week. Trump’s renewed focus on building a false case that Democrats are trying to cheat him — almost four years after his effort to overturn the 2020 election results ended with his supporters storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College votes — speaks to his insecurities, according to people familiar with his behavior, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation from the most powerful figure in the Republican Party. Those insecurities aren’t about election integrity but rather about his chances of winning — and his frustration at not being the center of the national political discussion at all times, these people said. Some Republicans worry that he has once again become distracted from issues important to voters, including inflation and immigration, as he pursues grievances that don’t resonate with swing voters. “He can’t ever be a loser,” one former senior Trump adviser said of the former president’s push to cast the election as unfair. “He’s just going to do anything he can that he knows gives him attention,” the former adviser said, explaining that Trump views domination of media coverage as a sign of his political strength. Read more from Matt and Jon → Inside the rift that could define the future of Pennsylvania politics By Allan Smith John Fetterman was angry. The Democratic senator from Pennsylvania was readying to speak at a disaster response press conference in Bucks County on July 16, 2023, just hours after flooding in Upper Makefield, Pennsylvania, that ultimately killed seven people. Local officials spoke for a few minutes to offer an initial update for the assembled press. Then, Gov. Josh Shapiro provided information on what his administration was doing to respond to the emergency. After a few minutes, Shapiro tossed the microphone back to the local responders — not Fetterman. Moments later, the event wrapped without Fetterman ever speaking. Already deeply skeptical of Shapiro, Fetterman swore off appearing at events alongside the governor going forward, as three sources familiar with the incident told NBC News. The episode highlighted what has become an increasingly volatile relationship between Pennsylvania’s two most ambitious elected officials. It’s a Democratic Party rivalry that is suddenly spilling out into full view and has the potential to shape state politics — and maybe even the national political scene — for years to come. Earlier this month, as Harris was wrapping up her search for a running mate and was considering Shapiro among her final choices, Politico reported that Fetterman aides told Harris’ team the senator had concerns about Shapiro. Days later, Fetterman sat stone-faced with his arms crossed as Shapiro delivered a rousing speech at the Philadelphia rally where Harris introduced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her No. 2. Seated among a delegation of Pennsylvania politicians right in front of the press section, the 6-foot-8 Fetterman stood out as a lone member who did not join in the clapping and cheering for Shapiro. “For most PA politicos, it’s pretty well known that the two clashed,” one Pennsylvania Democrat said. “It was obvious that those two were always on the collision course and the only thing that kept them apart was that they were going for different types of offices.” “It almost feels like our dirty laundry is being let out to air,” this person added. Multiple people said the feud appears to be much more about Fetterman training his ire at Shapiro than the other way around, particularly as the senator has taken public steps to express his displeasure while Shapiro has not. Two unconnected Pennsylvania Democrats separately compared the ordeal to a popular meme from the hit TV show “Mad Men,” in which one person standing in an elevator criticizes Don Draper, the series’ main character, who responds, “I don’t think about you at all.” Read more from Allan’s exclusive report → That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

Their top concern is the possibility that government agencies may have pressured tech companies to suppress information about the July 13 shooting. Both Meta and Google faced scrutiny in the wake of the shooting when users observed irregularities with their platforms’ responses to the incident. While associated Google queries omitted references to Trump and returned news articles about Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Meta’s AI chatbot told users that the assassination attempt was a “fictional” event, the letter stated. Earlier in August, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sought Google’s explanation for its search function’s errors. Now, Comer is seeking the same from Meta, requesting all documents concerning its AI chatbot’s design and the internal policies governing its approach to search results Meta deems “harmful or dangerous.” “In a small number of cases, Meta AI continued to provide incorrect answers, including sometimes asserting that the event didn’t happen,” the company said, adding that it was working to address the issue, which has since been resolved. Meta also stated that a fact-check label was incorrectly placed on an authentic photo of Trump taken minutes after he was shot. The company attributed the error to its system confusing the image for a doctored version of the photo that was circulating on the platform. Referencing those explanations in his letter, Comer said the committee appreciated them but remained concerned, “especially against the backdrop of an alarming pattern of speech suppression and censorship peddled through technology and social media companies.” As an example, the congressman cited Facebook’s suppression of the New York Post exposé on Hunter Biden’s laptop ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Zuckerberg has since revealed that the social media company’s decision to censor the story was based on misinformation warnings from the FBI. “On behalf of the American people, the Committee is dedicated to fully understanding when and how information is being suppressed or modified by social media companies, whether it be due to technical error, a policy intended to ensure safety, or a specific intent to mislead,” Comer wrote. A Meta spokesperson told The Epoch Times that the company is working with the Oversight Committee to respond to its requests. “Americans rely upon prominent internet search engines such as Google to gather news and information critical to their understanding of national politics and events—and never more so than during a Presidential election season,” Comer wrote. The Epoch Times has contacted Google for comment.","summary":"Lawmakers are investigating whether federal agencies pressured tech companies to censor Trump-related search results.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/house-gop-probes-metas-search-results-related-to-trump-shooting-5706441","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/11/id5627230-Meta-logo-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-15 22:03:35","author":"Samantha Flom","authors":["Samantha Flom"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203}]}
