Tennis legend Martina Navratilova, a vocal Donald Trump critic, is among those who have spoken out about their displeasure with the attack on social media.Navratilova expressed disbelief and dubbed the operation a violation of international law, calling it 'completely illegal.' She also called out the US President for being 'absolutely insane' for his recent decisions after Trump boasted of the operation's success and warned, 'Nobody can stop us.''He is Absolutely Insane'Martina Navratilova, a Czech American professional tennis player who dominated women's tennis in the late 1970s and the 80s, took to X (formerly Twitter) to share her thoughts on the American military strikes on Venezuela.Olga Nesterova, a foreign affairs journalist, shared a recording of Trump's statement to Fox News about the US attack in Venezuela. In the recording, Trump can be heard taking pride in his latest feat, saying what happened the previous night was 'incredible.' 'We have to do it again [in other countries]. We can do it again, too. Nobody can stop us,' Trump said.Apparently, Navratilova disagreed with Trump's plan and did not hold back her disdain about the issue. 'He is absolutely insane,' the tennis legend wrote on X in response to Trump's statement. 'Not to mention this is completely illegal.''Not Pro-Women'It's not the first time Navratilova has blasted Trump. In October 2024, she also announced on X that she would not vote for Trump. According to the tennis player, she grew up in a 'totalitarian authoritarian country' and would 'not vote for that now or ever.' She alleged that Trump 'is not pro-women.'She also called Trump a 'rapist and assaulter' who is 'against all things trans.' Navratilova is a well-known advocate for women's sports and LGBTQ+ rights.'What is the Legal Authority?'Navratilova is not the only one who questioned America's intervention in Venezuela. When Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared on ABC to discuss the same operation, host George Stephanopoulos asked him about the US's authority to run Venezuela.Rubio explained their goals in Venezuela and their intention to make the country a 'narco-trafficking paradise.' Stephanopoulos was not satisfied with the response and asked Rubio the same question, 'What is the legal authority for the United States to be running Venezuela?'Rubio, a staunch supporter of the action, stressed that they have 'court orders.' 'So, I don't know, is a court not a legal authority?' he asked back.The interview and Navratilova's statement calling the move 'illegal' highlighted deep domestic divisions over the operation's legitimacy under the United States Constitution.Reaction to Maduro's CaptureThe capture of Nicolás Maduro, who ran Venezuela for over 10 years, triggered a complex wave of emotions across the streets of Caracas and beyond. While some citizens celebrated the end of his decade-long rule, others viewed the US involvement with deep suspicion.Many Venezuelans expressed relief at the prospect of economic recovery after years of hyperinflation and scarcity. Proponents of the change hope that Maduro's removal will finally lead to transparent democratic elections.Conversely, a significant portion of the population remains wary of foreign occupation and the potential for civil unrest. There are fears that the military strikes may have destabilised the region further, rather than providing a clear path to peace.Conflict ContinuesVice President Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as the new president and Trump claimed that she was 'willing to do what we think is necessary.' However, her latest statement didn't sound like she was supportive of the Americans running their nation.'What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law. History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay,' Rodríguez said, per The Guardian.

Reilly's commentary, detailed in his book Commander in Cheat, has been amplified by recent viral videos allegedly showing rule-bending on the golf course.Throughout his career, Trump has cultivated the image of a decisive and superior thinker, routinely claiming personal victories in golf and at times alluding to mental acuity that surpasses his critics. But there exists no publicly verified record of Trump having taken a standardised intelligence quotient (IQ) test, and no credible evidence has emerged that places his IQ anywhere near the established benchmarks used by psychologists and neuroscientists. Any suggestion tying Trump's cognitive ability to a toddler's is metaphorical and arises from satirical critique rather than empirical data.Instead, the controversy centres on Trump's conduct on the golf course and the starkly critical response from Reilly, whose remarks have now become a focal point of the broader debate over honesty, credibility, and personal branding.Reilly's Scathing Critique of Trump's Golfing ClaimsRick Reilly, a seasoned American sportswriter and author, has long been a vocal critic of Donald Trump's portrayal of his own golfing achievements. Reilly chronicled his experiences and observations in his 2019 book Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump.Reilly has described Trump as a habitual exaggerator whose public claims about winning club championships are not supported by independent records. According to Reilly, Trump often declares himself a winner in tournaments where there were no official contests or where he did not compete under formal conditions. One method attributed to Trump, he alleges, is buying a golf course, playing the first round alone, and then declaring himself the club champion.Reilly also casts doubt on Trump's claimed handicap, a statistical measure indicating a golfer's skill, which the former president has asserted to be around 2.8. According to Reilly, this figure is highly questionable and appears inconsistent with records publicly available through official golf handicap indexes.Viral Videos Spark Renewed ScrutinyThe debate has intensified in recent months with the circulation of viral videos allegedly showing questionable actions during Trump's golf games. In late July, during a visit to his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, a clip emerged showing what appeared to be a caddie placing a golf ball in a more favourable position near a bunker before Trump took his shot. Observers pointed out that under the Rules of Golf, a ball must be played as it lies and cannot be repositioned in this manner.Similarly, footage from Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey showed a caddie seemingly dropping a ball on the green, which also raised eyebrows because, under official golf rules, only the player, not the caddie, is permitted to replace or drop a ball, and only under specific circumstances.These videos have been seized upon by critics as potential evidence that might support Reilly's longstanding assertions about Trump's disregard for the customary honesty expected in golf, a sport where self-refereeing and strict adherence to etiquette are paramount.While neither the White House nor Trump's representatives have officially engaged with these particular allegations, the controversy has resonated across social media and sports commentary circles, with many observers discussing the broader implications of a public figure's credibility when zealously protecting personal narratives that are challenged by independent accounts.A Metaphor for Leadership?The intersection of golf, personal branding, and political leadership has acquired an unexpectedly symbolic dimension. For many critics, Trump's insistence on recounting his own successes, whether in business, politics, or sport, has become a shorthand for a larger debate about integrity, truth-telling, and public trust.Reilly's critique, though rooted in sportsmanship, thus transcends golf. His contention that exaggeration and self-aggrandisement on the golf course reflect personality traits that could influence leadership decisions has struck a chord with commentators and analysts alike.Although direct comparisons between athletic conduct and political governance should be treated cautiously, the persistence of these narratives in the public consciousness underscores the enduring importance of accountability for figures in positions of power.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-savaged-brutal-iq-jab-critics-say-even-toddler-might-outthink-him-1768106","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779679/trump-claims-national-guard-intervention-reduced-crimes-chicago-portland.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ef604868fd9e4214d8973fb0a6ca0ddd","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 00:00:04","author":"Christelle May Napiza","authors":["Christelle May Napiza"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.159},{"id":391215612,"title":"This content can be edited under Website Copy - Metered Paywall","text":"EFF statement on the US attack on Venezuela and capture of President Nicolas Maduro\n\n3 January 2026\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) unequivocally condemns the United States of America's military assault on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the reported capture and forcible removal of President Nicolås Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in what amounts to the most blatant act of imperial aggression in the Western Hemisphere in decades.\n\nThis morning, the United States launched a coordinated series of airstrikes and special operations inside Venezuelan territory, including in Caracas and other regions, resulting in explosions, widespread alarm among civilians, and the reported seizure of President Maduro and his wife. United States President Donald Trump personally took to social media to declare that Venezuela's head of state had been captured and flown out of the country to face indictment in New York, framing the operation as a strategic triumph and boasting about future American control over Venezuela's oil resources. \n\nLet it be clear to the world that this is not a lawful operation under international law, nor is it an act of self-defence. It is a naked exercise of unilateral military power that tramples on the sovereignty of a nation and sets a dangerous and destabilising precedent. If allowed to stand, it signals that any powerful state may invade, bomb, abduct, and remove the leadership of sovereign countries without consent, oversight, or legitimacy.\n\nPresident Trump's boastful and reckless rhetoric, including his public celebration of the attack and crude references to Venezuela's natural resources, exposes the arrogance and impunity with which the United States acts when it believes itself above international law. His conduct reflects a worldview in which military force replaces diplomacy and domination replaces cooperation, continuing the history of the United States' imperial posture toward resource-rich nations of the Global South. \n\nThis attack follows months of escalating threats and military pressure against Venezuela, including the deployment of US military assets to the Caribbean, repeated warnings that \"all options\" were on the table, and sustained economic warfare through illegal sanctions. These actions were always designed to weaken Venezuela and prepare the ground for regime change by force in order to install a puppet government, and the EFF warned that such escalation would inevitably lead to open military aggression.\n\nVenezuela has, for decades, stood tall against imperial domination and refused to surrender its commitment to socialism and freedom to foreign powers. Under relentless political, economic and financial sanctions, deliberate economic sabotage, and sustained international isolation, the Venezuelan people have endured immense hardship. President Nicolås Maduro has remained steady in defending his country's independence, protecting its national resources, and resisting external attempts to dictate Venezuela's political future. \n\nThe EFF recognises that leadership forged under siege is tested not by comfort but by resistance. We believe that President Maduro's commitment to his people and to the principles of sovereignty and socialism will not be broken by abduction, intimidation or foreign force. History has shown that leaders and movements rooted in popular struggle do not disappear simply because imperial powers declare them defeated.\n\nHistory also leaves no room for doubt about the United States' preferred method of dealing with defiant sovereign leaders. In 1989, the United States invaded Panama and forcibly removed President Manuel Noriega under the guise of restoring democracy. In 1961, Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba was assassinated through a conspiracy involving the CIA and the Belgian state because he refused to surrender Africa's mineral wealth to Western control. \n\nIn 2003, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was illegally overthrown and executed by the United States under George Bush on the fabricated pretext of weapons of mass destruction — weapons that have never been found to this day. In 2011, Libya was destroyed and Colonel Muammar Gaddafi brutally killed through a NATO-led assault sanctioned by Barack Obama, plunging one of Africa's most stable states into permanent chaos. \n\nThese incidents are a clear pattern of imperial violence against leaders who resist Western domination. Today Venezuela joins this list, and tomorrow it will be another sovereign nation. If the world remains silent, even President Cyril Ramaphosa could one day be targeted on the basis of fabricated narratives, including the current dangerous and dishonest propaganda of a so-called \"white genocide\" in South Africa, weaponised in retaliation to our support of Palestine. \n\nThe international response has been swift as countries such as Russia, Iran ,and Cuba have condemned the United States' actions while several European governments and institutions have expressed deep concern and called for restraint and de-escalation, and regional actors including Mexico have urged dialogue and respect for international law. These responses reflect a growing global unease with unchecked US militarism and its destabilising consequences.\n\nWithin Venezuela, the government has denounced the assault as an act of war, declared a state of emergency, and called on its people to remain united in defence of their country. Reports of explosions in residential areas and widespread panic among civilians highlight the human cost of this aggression and expose the falsehood of claims that such interventions are \"surgical\" or humanitarian in nature. \n\nThe EFF reiterates that history has consistently shown that foreign military intervention does not bring democracy or peace. It brings chaos, suffering, and prolonged instability, paid for by the working class and the poor. The forcible capture of a sitting head of state by a foreign military power is an unprecedented escalation that threatens the very foundations of international order and collective security.\n\nThe EFF therefore calls on the United Nations and all states committed to sovereignty and peace to condemn this illegal act in the strongest terms, demand the return of the President and his wife unharmed, and to retreat from this military action. South Africa, given its own history of colonial domination and foreign interference, has a moral obligation to reject this aggression and stand firmly with the Venezuelan people. \n\nIssued by Sinawo Thambo, National Spokesperson, EFF, 4 January 2026","url":"https://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/capture-of-president-nicolas-maduro-imperial-aggre","image":"/politicsweb/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=2671","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 00:00:00","author":"Sinawo Thambo","authors":["Sinawo Thambo"],"language":"en","source_country":"za","sentiment":0.086},{"id":391215608,"title":"This content can be edited under Website Copy - Metered Paywall","text":"SACP condemns US military invasion of Venezuela and reported criminal abduction of President Maduro and his wife\n\n3 January 2026\n\nThe South African Communist Party (SACP) condemns and denounces in the strongest terms possible, the Trump administration's criminal military invasion of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, an act in complete violation of international law.\n\nThe SACP has also learnt with shock and horror of the Trump administration's brazen act of international piracy of abducting Venezuela's democratically elected president Nicolás Maduro together with his wife.\n\nThe US’s latest criminal aggression in Venezuela is the culmination of a series of threats and political rhetoric by Donald Trump towards Venezuela and its president and deserves only the strongest condemnation.

'I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law,' Mamdani said.DSA Launches 'Hands Off Venezuela' CampaignThe Democratic Socialists of America, the political movement with which Mamdani is affiliated, released a lengthy statement demanding 'the return of President Nicolas Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores to Venezuela'. The left-wing organisation is launching a 'Hands Off Venezuela' campaign to get what it calls the 'imperialist' United States out of the socialist, oil-rich country.'Solidarity with the people of Venezuela! Solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution!' a separate DSA International Committee policy statement declares. In its statement on Maduro's removal, the DSA claims the Trump administration has started 'an illegal war' against Venezuela. 'This is a nakedly imperialist war to install a US puppet government that will give Venezuela's oil resources over to US corporations and to force US hegemony over Latin America,' the group's statement says.'Act of War and Violation of International Law'Mamdani said in a post on X that he was briefed on the US military capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, 'as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City'. 'Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law,' the mayor wrote.The mayor later claimed the 'blatant pursuit of regime change' will directly affect New Yorkers and Venezuelans living in New York City. 'My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,' Mamdani continued.DSA Demands Maduro's ReturnThe DSA statement likened the US military's action to the 'failed' war against Iraq, claiming it will only 'impoverish the people of Latin America'. 'Trump's war has nothing to do with drug trafficking. There is no substantiated evidence that high-level members of the Venezuelan government are narco-terrorists. Yet, the Trump administration is using this claim as the pretext for this illegal war,' the organisation stated.The group issued a list of demands including a return of Maduro to Venezuela and restoration of diplomatic relations with Venezuela, an immediate end to 'military violence' against Venezuela and a total withdrawal of all US forces and operations from the Caribbean, and ending sanctions against Venezuela.Maduro and his wife arrived in New York on Saturday evening and are being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. They are expected to face an arraignment on Monday in Manhattan on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, according to an unsealed indictment released by Attorney General Pam Bondi.Understanding Democratic Socialism and US-Venezuela RelationsThe controversy highlights the deep ideological divide over US foreign policy in Latin America. Democratic socialism, the political philosophy embraced by Mamdani and the DSA, advocates for democratic political systems alongside socialist economic policies. Critics of the Venezuela operation, including legal scholars, have questioned whether the military action violated international law principles of sovereignty.However, according to Cornell Law Professor Brian L Cox, the United States doesn't recognise Maduro as a legitimate head of state, which means the operation may not have violated the UN Charter. The controversy also underscores tensions between progressive politicians who view the action as imperialism and those who support removing what they consider an illegitimate narco-terrorist regime. Venezuela has been under US sanctions for years due to concerns over democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and alleged involvement in drug trafficking under Maduro's leadership.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nyc-mayor-zohran-mamdanis-allies-dsa-push-trump-maduros-release-1768095","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780192/new-york-city-mayor-zohran-mamdani.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=805c242eba3f0c89cdabc9b2b5081ef6","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 23:45:02","author":"Bernadette B.

With thinly veiled threats, Trump is rattling hemispheric friends and foes alike, spurring a pointed question around the globe: Who’s next? “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic in which he described the strategically located Arctic island as “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” Asked what the U.S.-military action in Venezuela could portend for Greenland, Trump replied: “They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don’t know.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump, in his administration’s National Security Strategy published last month, laid out restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” as a central guidepost for his second go-around in the White House. Trump has also pointed to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which rejects European colonialism, as well as the Roosevelt Corollary — a justification invoked by the U.S. in supporting Panama’s secession from Colombia, which helped secure the Panama Canal Zone for the U.S. — as he’s made his case for an assertive approach to American neighbors and beyond. Trump has even quipped that some now refer to the fifth U.S. president’s foundational document as the “Don-roe Doctrine.” Saturday’s dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas and Trump’s Atlantic interview heightened concerns in Denmark, which has jurisdiction over the vast mineral-rich island of Greenland. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in a statement following Trump’s latest comments on Greenland said he has “no right to annex” the territory. She also reminded Trump that Denmark already provides the United States, a fellow member of NATO, broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements. “I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said. Denmark on Sunday also signed onto a European Union statement underscoring that “the right of the Venezuelan people to determine their future must be respected” as Trump has vowed to “run” Venezuela and pressed the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, to get in line. Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON.” “And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Amb. Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark’s chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump’s influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. During his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House, Trump repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has pointedly not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island that belongs to an ally. The issue had largely drifted out of the headlines in recent months. Then Trump put the spotlight back on Greenland less than two weeks ago when he said he would appoint Republican Gov. Jeff Landry as his special envoy to Greenland. The Louisiana governor said in his volunteer position he would help Trump “make Greenland a part of the U.S.” A stern warning to Cuba Meanwhile, concern simmered in Cuba, one of Venezuela’s most important allies and trading partners, as Rubio issued a new stern warning to the Cuban government. U.S.-Cuba relations have been hostile since the 1959 Cuban revolution. Rubio, in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said Cuban officials were with Maduro in Venezuela ahead of his capture. “It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,” Rubio said. “He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.” The secretary of state added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of “internal intelligence” in Maduro’s government, including “who spies on who inside to make sure there are no traitors.” Trump on Saturday told reporters that he viewed the Cuban government as “very similar” to Venezuela. “I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now, a very badly failing nation, and we want to help the people,” Trump said. Cuban authorities called a rally in support of Venezuela’s government and railed against the U.S. military operation, writing in a statement: “All the nations of the region must remain alert, because the threat hangs over all of us.” Rubio, a former Florida senator and son of Cuban immigrants, has long maintained Cuba is a dictatorship repressing its people. “This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States,” Rubio said.

The members of Turning Point USA have been adamant in saying that they are nothing more than friends. However, the public still believes there's something more to their story.Erika's recent endorsement of Vance fueled the allegations of a possible romantic relationship between the two. The TPUSA CEO made it clear during the endorsement that this is what her late husband, Charlie Kirk, would have wanted her to do.A Friendship Forged in PoliticsErika and Vance wouldn't have been introduced to each other if not for the her late husband. Charlie and Vance became friends first, which started after the former messaged the latter on Twitter.'Afterwards, a name I barely knew sent me a DM on Twitter and told me I did a great job. It was Charlie Kirk, and that moment of kindness began a friendship that lasted until today. We talked through everything, from the strategy to the fundraising to the grassroots of the movement he knew so well,' Vance shared, according to OK! magazine.The 'Touchy' Hug That Sparked RumoursAfter Charlie was killed, Vance immediately came to Erika's rescue to ensure that she had all the support that she needed. The vice president even offered to send his helicopter to where Charlie's casket was.Following Charlie's death, Vance and Erika made headlines due to their 'touchy' interaction at an event. The recently widowed Kirk was photographed touching the back of Vance's head while they were in a tight embrace. She later explained that there was nothing going on between her and Vance. She even told Megyn Kelly that her love language is physical touch.According to Erika, she whispered 'God bless you' into Vance's ear, and was why she held the back of his head. After all, this is something that she does when she whispers the statement in the ears of other people.'Our Marriage is as Strong as It's Ever Been'Vance also reacted to the speculations regarding his marriage to Usha Vance after the latter was spotted without her wedding ring on multiple outings.'With anything in life, you take the good with the bad. You accept that there are some sacrifices and there are some very good things that come along with it, too. But our marriage is as strong as it's ever been, and I think Usha's really taken to it, and it's been kind of cool to see how she's developed and evolved in this new role,' he told NBC News.Endorsement SealedErika also endorsed Vance for president in 2028. While at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest last month, she said that they would ensure Donald Trump has the Congress for all four years. She would also ensure that Vance would be elected in the upcoming elections.'That was the thing that my husband was very direct about. Interestingly enough, one of the last few conversations we had was how intentional he was about supporting J.D. for 28,' she said.Erika and Vance are nothing more than friends and allies.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/erika-kirk-jd-vance-relationship-how-turning-point-usa-members-became-friends-whats-real-score-1768103","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1771804/erika-kirk.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=42e1c6fecda9482b0dd8df31adb37125","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 23:15:06","author":"Mimi Heimbrod","authors":["Mimi Heimbrod"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":391215196,"title":"Trump Promised Oil Chiefs $1 Billion Deal for Their Wish List, Now Venezuela's Resources at Stake, Critics Say","text":"US Congressman Dan Goldman has accused President Donald Trump of rewarding oil executives with Venezuela's natural resources after they donated approximately £370 million ($500 million) to his campaign following promises of favourable policies, calling the military operation a violation of international law.The New York Democrat released a scathing statement claiming Trump's 'true motivation' for the Venezuela operation was to seize the country's vast oil reserves 'as a favour to American oil executives who helped get him elected'. Goldman condemned what he called a 'blood for treasure' rationale, describing Trump's unilateral military operation as a violation of the US Constitution that 'should scare every American'.Trump's Mar-a-Lago Fundraiser and $1 Billion RequestThe accusations stem from a controversial April 2024 fundraiser at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club where the then-presidential candidate met with approximately 20 top oil and gas executives. Trump explicitly requested £743 million ($1 billion) in campaign contributions from the industry executives in exchange for promises to roll back environmental regulations if elected.'You all are wealthy enough' and 'you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House', Trump reportedly told the assembled executives, adding that giving £743 million ($1 billion) would be a 'deal' because of the taxation and regulation he would help them avoid. Following the fundraiser, oil and gas tycoons made significant contributions to Trump's campaign, with the industry ultimately donating at least £56 million ($75 million) to his campaign and affiliated PACs.'Blood for Treasure' Rationale CondemnedGoldman, who served as lead counsel in Trump's first impeachment inquiry, condemned what he called a 'blood for treasure' rationale. 'Such a rationale – blood for treasure – is unconscionable and anathema to every value this country holds dear,' the congressman stated. He described Trump's unilateral military operation as a violation of the US Constitution that 'should scare every American'.The congressman added that the action 'has nothing to do with helping' issues central to Americans like groceries, healthcare, wages, or rent. 'Trump is taking us into uncharted territory now with taking over another country,' Goldman warned.Trump announced on Saturday that the United States will 'run' Venezuela for an unspecified period. 'We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,' Trump said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago.Oil Industry Campaign Contributions SurgeCampaign finance records show the oil and gas industry dramatically increased its political spending during the 2024 election cycle. According to analysis from OpenSecrets, industry affiliates contributed at least £110 million ($147.7 million) to party committees and outside groups through October 2024, more than twice the £48.8 million ($65.9 million) donated during the entire 2020 election cycle.Executives who attended Trump's oil industry fundraisers later made significant contributions to Trump-aligned political committees. Cheniere Energy CEO Jack Fusco donated £186,000 ($250,000) to the joint fundraising Trump 47 Committee in June, whilst Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren gave £3.7 million ($5 million) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.Congressional Democrats Launch InvestigationsSenate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse launched a joint investigation into what they described as Trump's 'quid pro quo propositions to Big Oil executives'. 'This policies-for-money transaction is particularly concerning given other reports that the oil and gas industry is drafting ready-to-sign executive orders eviscerating environmental policies,' the senators stated.Goldman is among several Democratic lawmakers who have condemned the Venezuela operation as unconstitutional. 'Congress has the sole power to declare war, and Congress has not done so, nor have we been provided with any satisfactory explanation for the President's invasion of another sovereign nation. This violation of the United States Constitution is an impeachable offense,' he said.Venezuela's Oil RichesVenezuela, a founding member of OPEC, possesses the world's largest proven oil reserves at 303 billion barrels, representing approximately 17 per cent of global reserves. However, years of underinvestment and economic sanctions have left the country's oil infrastructure in disrepair, with current production standing at around 800,000 barrels per day, well below its 1990s peak of 3.5 million barrels per day.The question of whether political contributions influence policy decisions remains a contentious issue in American democracy, with campaign finance reform advocates calling for stricter limits on corporate political spending.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-promised-oil-chiefs-1-billion-deal-their-wish-list-now-venezuelas-resources-stake-1768107","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780211/us-congressman-dan-goldman.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=fa24467b5289aae840b6368c5968aa28","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 23:03:31","author":"Bernadette B.

Rubio&apos;s statements on TV talk shows seemed designed to temper concerns the assertive action to achieve regime change in Venezuela might lead the US into another prolonged foreign intervention or failed attempt at nation-building. They stood in contrast to Trump&apos;s broad but vague claims the US would at least temporarily \"run\" the oil-rich nation, comments that suggested some sort of governing structure under which Caracas would be controlled by Washington. Rubio offered a more nuanced take on Sunday, saying the US would continue to enforce an oil quarantine that was already in place on sanctioned tankers before Maduro was removed from power early on Saturday, and use that leverage as a means to press policy changes in Venezuela. \"And so that&apos;s the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said on CBS show Face the Nation. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking.\" The blockade on sanctioned oil tankers - some of which have been seized by the US - \"remains in place, and that&apos;s a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is No.1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela,\" he added. Leaders in Venezuela have so far pushed back, at least publicly, calling on the Trump administration to release Maduro. Even before the operation that nabbed Maduro, experts were already questioning the legality of aspects of the administration&apos;s pressure campaign on Venezuela, including the deadly bombing of boats accused of trafficking drugs that some scholars said stretched the boundaries of international law. Trump&apos;s vow to \"run\" Venezuela, repeated more than half a dozen times at a news conference in Florida on Saturday, sparked concerns among some Democrats. It also drew unease from parts of his own Republican coalition, including an \"America First\" base that is opposed to foreign interventions, and from observers who recalled past nation-building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rubio dismissed such criticism, saying Trump&apos;s intent had been misunderstood. \"The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan,\" Rubio said. \"This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere.\" Australian Associated Press","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9145197/venezuela-not-iraq-or-afghanistan-top-us-envoy-says/","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/ec3a6d53-a2c1-4b11-a15f-e90abcfcb45e.jpg/r0_0_800_600_w800_h600_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 23:03:28","author":"Regina Garcia Cano And Matthew Lee","authors":["Regina Garcia Cano And Matthew Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":391215186,"title":"Could Nicki Minaj Face Deportation? 120,000 Sign Petition Against the 'Queen' Rapper","text":"The digital landscape is currently witnessing an unprecedented campaign directed at one of the music industry's most prominent figures – Nicki Minaj. The 'Bang Bang' singer has found herself at the centre of an aggressive effort to have her removed from the United States after she publicly embraced her support for Donald Trump and JD Vance's administration.There are two petitions calling for Minaj's deportation and both have gained significant momentum, receiving thousands of signatures each. The outcry follows recent public appearances and statements she made that many deemed polarising, leading them to scrutinise her right to reside in the United States.Deport Nicki MinajTwo petitions calling for Minaj's deportation have seen support grow over the past few days. One has received over 47,000 signatures, while the other has over 88,000. As of this writing, both petitions have a total of over 120,000.One petition wanted Minaj to be deported back to Trinidad and Tobago, claiming that she has spiraled 'out of control and seems to be experiencing psychosis.' They also called out her alleged 'erratic behavior' for harassing the Carters.'This is not just a personal grievance—it is a matter of public concern,' the petition read. 'Nicki Minaj's influential status does not grant her the right to overstep legal and moral boundaries. Her actions have demonstrated that she poses a threat not only to the individuals she has targeted but potentially to the broader community.'The other petition claimed that Minaj betrayed the LGBTQ+ community after saying, 'boys should just be boys.' The petition said the Grammy winner's platform 'carries weight and responsibility' but her 'recent statements are a stark contrast to the solidarity she once showed.'This level of public mobilisation is rare for a celebrity of her stature, yet the sheer volume of participants has forced the topic into the mainstream news cycle. While such petitions carry no legal weight on their own, they often serve as a barometer of public sentiment and, in some instances, prompt investigations or official responses from government agencies.Could Minaj Be Deported?Despite the fervour of the 120,000 signatories, the legal threshold for deporting a long-term resident is exceptionally high. Deportation proceedings generally require a violation of visa terms or a significant criminal record warranting revocation of residency status.Being the subject of public distaste, such as the case of Minaj, does not constitute a legal basis for removal. Furthermore, the deportation process involves lengthy judicial proceedings, including hearings before an immigration judge and multiple opportunities for appeal.Also, the call for Minaj's deportation only began after she spoke publicly of her support for MAGA. According to the ACLU, 'Criticizing U.S. foreign policy, or voicing any other opinion, is protected by the First Amendment – no matter your immigration status.'Minaj's Citizenship and Immigration StatusMinaj's attendance at the Turning Point USA (TPUSA) AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona, in December, during which she publicly expressed her support for Trump, reignited discussion about her immigration status and citizenship. Many claimed that the self-proclaimed Queen of rap is an illegal immigrant, and some questioned why she's able to remain in the country without being a US citizen.Minaj admitted in a post on Instagram that she 'came to this country as an illegal immigrant' when she was just 5. Also, in a 2024 TikTok live, she confirmed that she was still not a US citizen.'You would think that with the millions of dollars that I've paid in taxes to this country that I would have been given an honorary citizenship many, many, many thousands of years ago,' she added.Despite her previous statement, Minaj holds a green card, which is issued to non-US citizens and allows them to work and remain in the US. The green card grants Minaj permanent residency in America.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/could-nicki-minaj-face-deportation-120000-sign-petition-against-queen-rapper-1768115","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1778285/nicki-minaj.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=abec38ce79d23879615f9eb6e1a3a52a","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 22:50:00","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":391215230,"title":"Trump's celebration of power could backfire on Israel","text":"U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio was tasked at Saturday’s Trump press conference with explaining to the world what “Trump 2.0” is really like and how to deal with him. “The 47th president of the United States doesn’t play games,” he said. “When he tells them he’s going to do something, he means it. He acts.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Rubio said, \"could've been living somewhere else right now, very happy, but instead he wanted to play big boy, and so now he's got other sets of problems on his hands. This president isn’t looking for a fight. He’s willing to get along with anyone. But don’t play games. Don’t play with this president, because it will end badly.” In international relations, what Rubio calls “playing games” is simply diplomacy: Party A meets with Party B. Each comes with needs, interests, its own power and its own sovereignty. Sometimes there’s agreement, sometimes there isn’t, but negotiators never deny the legitimacy of the process. Rubio says Trump sees it differently. In a Trump world, there is no room for sovereignty and little respect for diplomacy. Take someone like Maduro, until recently the president of Venezuela. He was a corrupt dictator whose regime turned one of Latin America’s richest countries into a dying state that saw its best citizens emigrate. But it wasn’t that alone that led the Trump administration to seize and imprison him in New York. His ultimate crime, in Trump’s eyes, was thinking he was big. Rubio’s message to world leaders is simple: look and learn. He speaks from experience: during the Republican primary campaign a decade ago, Trump repeatedly mocked him as “Little Marco,” a thinly veiled jab at his height. Rubio was humiliated and learned a lesson: to Trump, size matters. Why should this matter to the rest of us? Because in the world being shaped by Trump, Putin, and Xi—the president of China—no one is immune except those three and the power behind them. Sometimes the projection of their power works to our advantage. The capture in Caracas has potential deterrent effect on Iran, and perhaps even a direct blow to the Iran‑Hezbollah axis. That’s good. But there’s no guarantee that Trump’s display of force won’t turn against us. Netanyahu told Trump that others are “playing games” with him: Iran is, Hamas is, Hezbollah is. This is where his persuasive power faltered. Standing before cameras at Mar‑a‑Lago, Trump praised Netanyahu: “He’s tough.” That compliment resonated—every Israeli wants the U.S. president to praise its prime minister. But consider this: the gap between being “tough” in a positive sense and “he chose to be a big boy” in a negative one is terrifyingly small. One comment from Jared Kushner at a family dinner—that Netanyahu was “playing games” with Trump and risked becoming like Zelensky—shows just how fragile such compliments are. In Donald’s casino, only the house wins. The world is changing before our eyes. After World War II, international relations aspired to be ideological. The United Nations boasted shared values, a collective pursuit of justice, human rights, the rule of law, a global community of good‑willed nations. That wasn’t entirely true—but rhetoric matters. The United States invested enormous resources in teaching democracy to nations in Europe and Asia, assuming it would bring global support for the West. The Soviet Union spent lavishly promoting communism. Trump, Putin, and Xi don’t care about that. They seek to divide the world among themselves—pure power and money. They don’t need ideological cover stories. Governments under their influence can do whatever they want—even kill masses—so long as it doesn’t threaten what each defines as their “national security interest.” That definition is broad: for Putin and Xi, it includes provocations unseen from neighboring states or minorities for Trump, it includes kidnapping a sitting president, regime change by force, territorial demands of allied states—Greenland, even Canada—interference in elections and judicial systems of sovereign states, including Israel. No one has limits. The most common handgun of the Wild West, made by Colt and called the Peacemaker, was ironically named. That’s the image Trump wants to project. Israel will have to contend with this reality in the years ahead. Power alone will determine outcomes, and therefore Israel needs a lot of power. But it must not be confused: in the eyes of its patron, it is little more than a protectorate, a banana republic. One of the biggest hits by the Israeli band Green Onion was the song “Venezuela,” written by Dan Almagor and composed by Moshe Vilensky. Its catchy line was “There’s nothing like Venezuela—oh la.” Well, there is someone like it: every small and medium‑sized state, from Ukraine to Taiwan, must now reckon with this reality. Including us.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/opinions-analysis/article/b1paiponwg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/12/29/HkzZwkulEbx/HkzZwkulEbx_0_43_961_1220_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 22:45:00","author":"Nahum Barnea","authors":["Nahum Barnea"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":391214640,"title":"Interim Venezuelan government backs leader seized by US","text":"A top Venezuelan official has declared the country&apos;s government would stay unified behind President Nicolas Maduro, whose capture by the United States has sparked deep uncertainty about what is next for the oil-rich South American nation. Maduro is in a ‍New York detention centre awaiting a Monday court appearance on drug charges. US President Donald Trump, who went golfing on Sunday, ordered his seizure from Venezuela on Saturday and said the US would take control of the country. But in Caracas, top officials in Maduro&apos;s ​government, who have called the detentions of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores a kidnapping, were still in charge. \"Here, the unity of the revolutionary force is more than guaranteed, and here there is only one president, whose name is Nicolas Maduro Moros. Let no one fall for the enemy&apos;s provocations,\" ⁠Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said in an audio recording released by the ruling PSUV socialist party. Images of the 63-year-old Maduro blindfolded and handcuffed on Saturday stunned Venezuelans. The operation was Washington&apos;s most controversial intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama 37 years ago. Without providing specifics, Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino said on state television the US attack killed soldiers, civilians and a \"large part\" of Maduro&apos;s security detail \"in cold blood\". Venezuela&apos;s armed forces have been activated to guarantee sovereignty, he said. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez - who also serves as oil minister - has taken over as interim leader with the blessing of Venezuela&apos;s top court, though she has said Maduro remains president. Because of her connections with the private sector and deep knowledge of oil, the country&apos;s top revenue source, Rodriguez has long been considered the most pragmatic member of Maduro&apos;s inner circle. ‌But she has publicly contradicted ​Trump&apos;s claim she is willing to work with the US. Trump said Rodriguez may pay a bigger price than Maduro \"if she doesn&apos;t do what&apos;s right\", according to an interview with The Atlantic magazine on Sunday. The Venezuelan ‍communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that remark. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Venezuela&apos;s next leader should be aligned with US interests. Those include keeping Venezuela&apos;s oil industry out of the hands of US adversaries and stopping drug trafficking. He cited an ongoing US blockade on tankers under sanctions as leverage. \"That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interest of the Venezuelan people are met,\" he said on ABC&apos;s This Week. The Venezuelan government has said for months Trump was seeking to take the country&apos;s vast natural resources, especially its oil, and officials made much of his comment on Saturday that major US oil companies would move in. \"We are outraged because in the end everything ​was revealed - it was revealed that they only want our oil,\" added Cabello. Once one of the most prosperous nations in Latin America, Venezuela&apos;s ‌economy tanked in the 2000s under President Hugo Chavez and nosedived further under Maduro, sending about one in five Venezuelans abroad in one of the world&apos;s biggest exoduses. Some Maduro supporters gathered at a government-sponsored protest march on Sunday afternoon in Caracas. Maduro opponents in Venezuela have been wary of celebrating his seizure, and the presence of security forces seemed, if anything, lighter than usual on Sunday. It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela and he runs the risk of alienating some supporters who oppose foreign interventions. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the White House has failed to say how long the US intends to be in Venezuela and how many American troops might be required. While many Western nations oppose Maduro, there were many calls for the US to respect international law and questions arose over the legality of seizing a foreign head of state.

The Venezuelan president was escorted off a plane at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state and taken to a Brooklyn jail.\n\nHe is due to make his first appearance on Monday in Manhattan’s federal court.\n\nUS to use oil blockade to leverage change in Venezuela\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday suggested that Washington would not take a day-to-day role in governing Venezuela other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine”, using that leverage to press policy changes in the country.\n\nRubio’s statements seemed designed to temper concerns, a day after Trump announced the US would “run” the oil-rich nation. The Trump administration’s actions drew unease from parts of his own Republican Party coalition, including an “America First” base that is opposed to foreign interventions, as well as from observers who recalled past nation-building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nRubio dismissed such criticism, saying that Trump’s intent had been misunderstood by a “foreign policy establishment” that was fixated on the Middle East.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Phil Lavelle, reporting from Doral, Florida in the US, said Trump had been elected on an “America First” policy centred around no engagement in foreign wars or sending US service personnel into danger.\n\n“Now we’ve got this situation where he said, less than 24 hours ago, ‘We’re not afraid of putting boots on the ground,’” Lavelle said.\n\nProtests took place in cities across the US against Trump’s military action in Venezuela. Hundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles, carrying signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil”.\n\n“I stand against US imperialism altogether. They want oil … They want to help the corporate billionaires. Bombing is just their means to building power like that, of taking control. So again, I’m against it,” said one protester named Niven.\n\nTrump on Saturday delivered a speech in which he made little mention of the so-called “war on drugs” – which for months had been his main justification for bombing Venezuelan ship and assets – but argued that Venezuela had “stolen” oil from the US and that it would now be taken back.\n\nThe United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, Ben Saul, said the US actions in Venezuela were illegal, calling on Trump to be investigated and impeached. “Every Venezuelan life lost is a violation of the right to life. President Trump should be impeached and investigated for the alleged killings,” he said in a social media post.\n\nThe UN Security Council (UNSC) was set to meet on Monday to discuss the situation in Venezuela. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply alarmed” by the US strikes, which a spokesperson said could “constitute a dangerous precedent”.\n\nUncertainty in Venezuela after Maduro’s abduction\n\nSome Venezuelans in Caracas have welcomed the US’s seizure of Maduro, but others said the action could worsen conflict in the country, with protests denouncing the US taking place.\n\n“There should be a positive change for all Venezuelans, because it has been 28 years of government, and now is the time for transition in this country,” said Ronald Gaulee, a motorcycle rider in Caracas.\n\nMerchant Juan Carlos Rincon was more cautious. “The truth is that there is a lot of manipulation behind all this,” he told the Reuters news agency. “We want to be at peace, move forward, and for Venezuela to have, like any other country, the right to choose its own destiny and its own leaders.”\n\nBaker Franklin Jimenez said he would heed the government’s call to defend the country. “If they took him away, I think they shouldn’t have done so, because this will create an even worse conflict than the one we have now,” he said. “And as for the bombings and all that, we have to go out, we all have to go out into the streets to defend our homeland, to defend ourselves.”\n\nSome Venezuelans decided to flee the country amid the uncertainty, crossing the Venezuela-Colombia border to reach the Colombian town of Cucuta. Karina Rey described a “tense situation” in the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal, just across the border.\n\n“There are long lines, and people are very paranoid, or on edge, over food. Supermarkets are closing,” Rey told Al Jazeera. “The lines are very long just to stock up on food, because we don’t know what will happen in the coming weeks. We’re waiting to see what happens.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Alessandro Rampietti, reporting from Cucuta, said many Venezuelans there initially felt jubilant after Maduro was ousted. “But that quickly shifted to uncertainty,” he said.\n\n“Several people said they expected the United States to immediately bring opposition leader Maria Corina Machado back into the country, along with Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who many Venezuelans believe won the last presidential election,” Rampietti continued.\n\n“Instead, with much of the existing leadership still in place and with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez appointed as interim leader, there is growing fear about what could happen next.”\n\nTiziano Breda, a senior analyst at the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, said what happens next hinges on the response of Venezuela’s government and armed forces.\n\n“So far, they’ve avoided direct confrontation with US forces, but deployments on the streets point to efforts to contain unrest,” he said. “A smooth transition remains unlikely, and the risk of resistance from pro-regime armed groups – including elements within the military and Colombian rebel networks active in the country – remains high.”","summary":"US secretary of state backtracks claims that the US will ‘run’ Venezuela, as Trump threatens country&#039;s acting president.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/4/venezuela-decries-cowardly-kidnapping-as-officials-back-maduro?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_695aca79ddb8-1767557753.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:56:14","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":391216482,"title":"Who Is Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's Deputy?","text":"Venezuela’s former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez is now president of the country, U.S. President Donald Trump said, hours after a U.S. military operation captured former leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Jan. 3.\n\n Trump said.He said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio “is working on that directly.

Very simple.”\n\nThe overnight surprise attack resulted in Maduro and Flores being shipped to New York to face charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.\n\nCourtesy of Jacki Thrapp via The Epoch Times, here is what we know about Rodríguez.\n\nWho Is Rodríguez?\n\nRodríguez was born and raised in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, on May 18, 1969.\n\n​The 56-year-old leader graduated from Universidad Central de Venezuela, became a lawyer, and quickly rose through the political system in the past decade.\n\nRodríguez served as the Communication and Information Minister in 2013 before she pivoted to a Foreign Ministry position from 2014 to 2017 and eventually served as the head of the Constituent Assembly, which expanded Maduro’s powers.\n\nVice Presidency\n\nMaduro selected Rodríguez as his vice president in June 2018, describing her as “a young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary, and tested in a thousand battles.”\n\nIn August 2024, Maduro assigned Rodríguez to manage sanctions on oil between the United States and Venezuela.\n\nActing Leader\n\nTrump announced from Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 3 that the United States will “run” Venezuela until a peaceful transition can be made, while saying that Rodríguez has agreed to work with the United States after being “sworn in” as Venezuela’s new president.\n\nTrump said Rodríguez had spoken with Rubio but didn’t provide details on how the United States would work with Rodríguez to run the country.\n\n“She really doesn’t have a choice,” Trump said. \n\n“We’re going to have this done right. We’re not going to just do this with Maduro, then leave like everybody else, leave and say, ‘Let it go to hell.’ If we just left, it has zero chance of ever coming back.\n\nIn an address broadcast on state television shortly after Trump’s briefing, Rodríguez - who was identified as vice president by a ticker at the bottom of the screen - did not address Trump’s claims that she was now acting president. Instead, she demanded that the United States free Maduro, who she called the country’s rightful leader.\n\n“Here, we have a government with clarity, and I repeat and repeat again … we are willing to have respectful relations,” Rodríguez said.\n\n“It is the only thing we will accept for a type of relationship after having [been] attacked.”\n\nMaduro’s Exit Plan\n\nBefore Maduro was captured, he floated the idea of staying in office for three more years before having Rodríguez take over and finish his term through January 2031.\n\nThe proposal was rejected by the White House, which openly questioned the legitimacy of Venezuela’s 2024 election and accused Maduro of overseeing a narco-terrorist state.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/who-delcy-rodriguez-maduros-deputy","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/image%20-%202026-01-04T073721.941.jpg?itok=g9z-l3w1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:55:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":391214192,"title":"Venezuela’s oil, not alleged drug trafficking, caught Trump’s eye  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St Lucia News","text":"For weeks, United States President Donald Trump and his officials said the rhetoric and military posturing against Venezuela was aimed at countering the flow of narcotics.\n\nBut abundant evidence, including Trump’s own words in the aftermath of the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro, suggests that Washington’s true interest lies in Venezuela’s vast proven oil reserves – the largest in the world, estimated at about 303 billion barrels.\n\nThe US president initially framed Saturday’s attacks on Caracas as an anti-drug operation, with officials calling it an arrest of “two indicted fugitives” on narcotrafficking charges. Maduro was indicted in the Southern District of New York courts for alleged “narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy”, among other charges.\n\nBut within hours of the US attacks on Caracas that killed dozens of civilians, officials and military personnel, Trump pivoted to openly discussing oil and US control of Venezuela.\n\nIn a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the US president claimed the US would “run the country” for now, rebuild oil infrastructure, and “take out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground” to sell to global customers, including rivals China and Russia.\n\nMaduro has consistently denied involvement in the drug trade and has accused Washington of using this charge as an excuse to get to oil and other resources, even as the Trump team labelled Venezuelan-trafficked fentanyl a “weapon of mass destruction” and launched air strikes on boats accused of moving narcotic substances.\n\nOil vital to Venezuela’s recovery\n\nThe sudden abduction of the Venezuelan president has not yet translated to any major shift in the power structure of the South American nation.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez has been ordered by the constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s Supreme Court to serve as acting president “to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defence of the nation” as a legal framework is devised for the future.\n\nShe had also been serving simultaneously as finance minister and oil minister, giving her enormous influence over the nation’s embattled economy and efforts to vitalise the underdeveloped oil sector that produces less than it should as a result of sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump said the US would not occupy Venezuela if Rodriguez “does what we want”. He also declined to endorse the opposition leader, exiled Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, saying she does not have the approval or “respect” of the people.\n\nWhat the US wants from Rodriguez is likely to revolve around Venezuela’s oil, which Trump and other US officials have characterised as US oil – based on the South American country’s nationalisation of its oil industry between the 1970s and the 2000s, forcing most US oil companies out.\n\n“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights, they took all of our oil from not that long ago. And we want it back,” said Trump in December.\n\nIn his typically forthright manner, Trump has also said that Venezuela’s oil reserves would cover any costs the US incurs from its attack on the country, and “the damages” allegedly caused by Venezuela to the US.\n\nOil is vital to Venezuela, and the US had used its importance to pressure the country prior to the abduction of Maduro.\n\nUS sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil have been a core element of US policy toward Venezuela since 2017, especially under combined Trump-era directives. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) is blacklisted, and Washington has taken measures restricting the shipment of diluents that are needed for heavy crude.\n\nA host of oil traders, companies and ships that transport the goods have been sanctioned, including last month, while Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters, which led to at least two tankers being confiscated.\n\nUS sanctions and pressure are some of the main reasons why Venezuela’s oil exports are not comparable to the country’s oil reserves.\n\nVenezuela’s oil exports averaged about a meager 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and the US “oil embargo” knocked them down to around 500,000 bpd last month, according to preliminary figures based on ship movements.\n\nIn comparison, major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia export millions of barrels per day on average.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, the former head of the economic advisory of the Venezuelan National Assembly, said gold and oil reserves are among the country’s main hopes for economic recovery.\n\n“If the US moves to remove the sanctions and clear the hurdles for investors to come back in, you can get the oil output to 2.5 million barrels per day in the scope of three to five years,” he told Al Jazeera from the US state of Colorado, pointing out that production currently stands at below one million barrels per day.\n\n“I think what the Trump administration is saying is that we need to prioritise the recovery of the oil sector and get the economy on a manageable basis so that we think about more orderly political transition,” the former official said.\n\n“But if you try to directly hand over the power to the opposition right now without having set the basis for economic recovery, that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to chaos.”\n\nWhat does this mean for OPEC and others?\n\nAt least in the short term, the Venezuela developments do not mean a major change for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But things could drastically change with time.\n\nVenezuela cannot quickly raise production due to its ageing infrastructure, and unilateral US seizures of tankers near Venezuela’s waters only led to an uptick in oil prices before another stabilisation.\n\nVenezuela’s upstream oil infrastructure, particularly under PDVSA, has suffered from more than a decade of underinvestment, so some wells are mechanically compromised, restarting shut-in wells often requires full workovers or redrilling, not simple reactivation, and routine preventive maintenance largely ceased after the US embargoes.\n\nThe crude cannot flow or be exported without diluents, which are being blocked by the US, while storage, blending, and upgrading facilities are bottlenecked, with many operating well below nominal capacity.\n\nBut theoretically, if a US-directed Venezuela manages to rapidly boost output in the future, OPEC will face a supply glut or will have to adjust quotas. This would give Washington indirect but major influence inside the group and over global supply, disrupting the delicate balance members have been trying to keep for years.\n\nWest Asia neighbours like Iran and Saudi Arabia are also directly affected if Caracas leans towards the US in the long term.\n\nThe anti-US and Israel establishment in Iran has lost another major ally in Maduro, after the fall of top leaders of the Tehran-backed “axis of resistance” over the past two years.\n\nIran has also been hampered in efforts to develop its oil sector due to stringent Western sanctions, and like Venezuela under Maduro, Iran sends most of its oil at heavily discounted prices through a shadow fleet of ships to China. A robust return of Venezuelan oil to the market would further undermine Iranian oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia was not a close ally of the Maduro establishment like Iran, but it also risks future oversupply that may push global prices down if Venezuela makes a comeback. That may force Riyadh to cut production and weaken its price leadership in the global market.","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2026/01/getty_6955860136-1767212545-gzUaww.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:49:09","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":391211490,"title":"China is likely to thread the needle after US attack on Venezuela","text":"China will be patient and play the long game as it views the new geopolitical chessboard, recalibrating carefully in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move on Saturday to decapitate Venezuela’s leadership, analysts said.\nin a daring predawn raid, US forces descended on ousted Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and airlifted him shackled and blindfolded to New York to face charges of “narcoterrorism conspiracy” and illegal weapons trafficking.\n“China is likely to thread this needle effectively. Beijing will condemn US actions,” said Bonnie Glaser, vice-president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “But I doubt that China will do much more than that. Venezuela isn’t among China’s core interests, and there is more downside than upside to taking actions that would complicate Trump’s ability to achieve a win.”\nIn part, this wait-and-see strategy is wise, analysts said, especially given how much uncertainty and contradictory developments are coming out of Venezuela. These include questions over the country’s future leadership, what form of government will follow, how much Washington will be involved in governance and how big a role the nation’s long-suffering opposition will have.\n\nTrump provided something of a blueprint for his view of the region when he released his National Security Strategy last month that espoused an aggressive “Trump corollary” to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which two centuries ago warned foreign nations to stay out of the western hemisphere.\nTrump has “updated” the doctrine with a call on global powers to view the Americas as Washington’s sphere of influence and that the US will back away from playing global policeman. This inferred that China had more leeway to exert influence over East Asia and that Europe – and potentially Russia – had more latitude to exert influence over Europe.\nAnalysts said China may well introduce a resolution at the United Nations condemning the US as early as Monday when the Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on the Venezuela crisis.\nUN resolution would dovetail with China’s ongoing bid to cast itself as globally responsible at the multilateral body at a time when Washington has sharply cut aid, insulted member nations and withdrawn from UN agencies.\n“They will use this opportunity to contrast the US’ rogue behaviour with China’s,” said Glaser, as Beijing presents itself as “a law abiding state that never uses military force and doesn’t intervene in other countries’ internal affairs”.\nBeijing may also seek to leverage alarm in Brazil and other Latin American countries to build antipathy towards Trump.\n“But it’s hard to see any meaningful coalition of countries forming to resist this,” said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst with the Eurasia Group.\nBut analysts questioned whether China would steer clear of the western hemisphere, despite a veiled warning in the national security strategy document warning Beijing not to exert “adversarial foreign influence” in the region.\n“Trump is likely to think that the action against Maduro will signal resolve to the rest of the world and oust Russia and China from LatAm,” said Rafael Ch, a partner with Signum Global consultancy.\nThe problem is that the authoritarian leadership in Moscow and Beijing does not have the tools or “smart power” – including massive loans and major infrastructure deals – to convince countries to “switch sides”, Ch added, with the possible exception of Panama and Mexico, who are more susceptible to US pressure.\n\nAnd Beijing might even benefit under a new Venezuelan leadership, whether led by interim president Delcy Rodríguez or someone else.\n“If anything, under a new Delcy Rodríguez administration that is likely to be transactional and US-lenient, I would expect lower odds of oil disruptions than during the prior period of tanker targeting,” Ch said.\n“The problem with Chinese influence in Latin America is that it’s primarily economic, and successful – so ousting it won’t be easy,” he said.\nAnalysts also pointed out that China had scaled way back in Venezuela in recent years as the regime became less popular domestically as the economy and oil output cratered, hardly making the troubled nation worth fighting for, politically or otherwise.\n“I don’t think the Chinese will reduce their activities in the western hemisphere — they have deep commercial interests,” said Glaser, so they’ll walk a careful line. “They recognise that the region is more important to the United States than to China, and is Trump’s number-one priority.”\nGlaser said that her recent conversations with Chinese scholars suggest that Beijing does not believe or expect that any Trump sphere of influence strategy will cede influence to China in the Indo-Pacific, even if it tries to stem China’s influence in the western hemisphere.\nmid-December, senior US officials signalled as much, indicating that their Latin American push did not mean they were giving up on the Indo-Pacific.\n“The United States is a Pacific power, and the future of the Indo-Pacific is directly tied to our core national interests,” said Allison Hooker, US under secretary of state for political affairs, at an inaugural Indo-Pacific Foreign Assistance Conference. Washington’s commitment to the region remains “unwavering”, she added.\nAdditional reporting by Khushboo Razdan","summary":"China will be patient and play the long game as it views the new geopolitical chessboard, recalibrating carefully in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s move on Saturday to decapitate Venezuela’s leadership, analysts said.\nin a daring predawn raid, US forces descended on ousted Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and airlifted him shackled and blindfolded to New York to face charges of “narcoterrorism conspiracy” and illegal weapons trafficking.\n“China is likely to thread this needle...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3338703/china-likely-thread-needle-after-us-attack-venezuela","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/05/bae25f87-1c26-44e6-adae-61452fe72417_3963701d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:44:37","author":"Mark Magnier","authors":["Mark Magnier"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":391215222,"title":"US-brokered security talks between Israel and Syria set to resume in Paris","text":"Negotiations on a security agreement between Israel and Syria are set to resume Monday in Paris, an Israeli official has confirmed. Talks were frozen about two months ago but the resumption of talks was agreed upon in a meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Journalist Barak Ravid first reported the planned resumption of negotiations. Israel’s delegation will include Netanyahu’s military secretary and nominee for Mossad chief Roman Gofman, Israeli Ambassador to Washington Yechiel Leiter, and Acting National Security Council head Gil Reich. Netanyahu assigned them to lead the talks with divided responsibilities: Gofman on security issues, Leiter on U.S. relations, and Reich on diplomacy and coordination. Notably, the Israeli team will have no formal head of delegation. From the Syrian side, Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani will participate, with U.S. envoy Tom Barrack serving as mediator. After his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu said he wants a security agreement with Syria that “preserves the border and guarantees the safety of Druze and Christian communities in Syria.” Trump expressed confidence that Netanyahu and Syrian leader Ahmed al‑Sharaa will “get along,” praising al‑Sharaa as “a tough guy”—a quality Trump said is necessary in the region. In the past year, al‑Sharaa and al-Shaibani have repeatedly criticized Israel’s actions. At the Doha Forum in early December, al‑Sharaa accused Israel of exporting its crises to other countries to distract from what he called “the massacre in Gaza,” and claimed that since Syria’s “liberation,” it has sent positive messages of regional stability but was met with “extreme violence” including, he said, more than 1,000 air strikes and 400 incursions into Syrian territory. Al‑Sharaa has said Syria is working with influential countries worldwide to pressure Israel to withdraw from territories it occupied after December 8, 2024, and insists that Damascus expects Israel to honor the 1974 disengagement agreement. He argues that any future deal must safeguard Syria’s interests.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/syijq800nwx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/12/23/Hy21S11dmbl/Hy21S11dmbl_4_128_491_276_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:42:52","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.046},{"id":391214044,"title":"This Past Year Was Pretty Great.

Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let's take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.\n\n First, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation's capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos -- wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage, and more -- the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests -- not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.\n\n That reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump's law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.\n\n Still, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.\n\n 1. Peace in Eastern Europe. The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which thus far remains elusive. A durable peace -- one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration -- should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader, and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful -- if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious -- concessions.\n\n 2. Victory on Birthright Citizenship. Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration's righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally \"required\" birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet -- granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally -- is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress's rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.\n\n 3. Improved Affordability and Housing Costs. Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 -- from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it -- cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline -- the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.\n\n 4. Justice for Minnesota Somali Fraud Scandal. The burgeoning massive fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, involving many businesses run by Somali immigrants, has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris -- who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate -- know, and when did she know it? The American people deserve answers to all these questions.\n\n 5. Tamed Communist China. Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible, and emboldening key regional allies -- such as Japan -- who share America's interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump's presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.\n\n This past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more -- a lot more -- of that same success in this new year.\n\n To find out more about Josh Hammer and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate website at www.creators.com.\n\nEditor's note: We now have the room to run syndicated commentary by some of our favorite and most provocative thinkers on the Right.

While nominally a leftwing insurgency, analysts describe its presence in Venezuela as more a paramilitary force that acts in support of the Maduro government.\n\nAt the security meeting, Sánchez said contingency plans had been put in place in case of a humanitarian emergency.\n\nAs part of that plan, a team of volunteers with the Colombian Red Cross set up a tarp under some shade trees early Sunday at the border, with an ambulance parked to the side.\n\nPedro Casanova, one of the team, said it was a preventive measure in case of a large outflow of Venezuelans if violence breaks out, though he was quick to add that they have had no indication of any large-scale movements. “The worst case scenario is that 120,000 people could cross,” he said.\n\nReporting inside Venezuela is severely restricted. Authorities have declined visas for foreign journalists to enter the country, and at least 21 Venezuelan reporters were arrested in the first 11 months of 2025 and face charges of treason or terrorism for their work, according to the National Association of Journalists (CNP).\n\nNubiola Fanco, 60, who crossed into Colombia early Sunday morning to restock her general store said there was a tense calm on the Venezuelan side.\n\n“People cleaned out the whole store yesterday,” after Maduro’s arrest, she said as she piled her shopping cart high with cans of tuna, packs of beans and lentils, cat food and cleaning supplies. “No one knows what could happen next.”\n\nBehind her at the register at a discount supermarket, construction worker Oxiel Pérez, 57, was shopping for his extended family in San Antonio where he said many shops were closed after Venezuelans rushed to buy essential goods Saturday after the US military action. “Just in case,” he said.\n\nAmid lingering uncertainty over the future, many exiles held muted celebrations. At a rally on the riverfront walk in downtown Cúcuta, Colombia, Saturday evening, Venezuelans forced to leave their homes chanted “Freedom, freedom!” and sang their national anthem, their shoulders wrapped in their country’s yellow blue and red flag.\n\nWhen an emcee asked who had already packed their bags to return to Venezuela, Rynna Mora, 41, energetically raised her hands and shouted. In reality, however, she says she’s not quite ready to do that.\n\n“I would love to go back tomorrow but I’ll have to wait and see how things settle.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/things-complicated-tense-calm-spreads-212154575.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I_JtaBkLu_3yQvsay689fA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xOTIwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/7f5f89df653da00c67743058b123a9f0","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:21:54","author":"Sibylla Brodzinsky In Cúcuta","authors":["Sibylla Brodzinsky In Cúcuta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.113},{"id":391214236,"title":"Exclusive: Sen.

First of all, our men and women of the military did an absolutely incredible job,” he said. “I had a minute to talk to Secretary of War Hegseth — he briefed me on some of the details.

Maduro was indicted in the Southern District of New York courts for alleged “narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy”, among other charges.\n\nBut within hours of the US attacks on Caracas that killed dozens of civilians, officials and military personnel, Trump pivoted to openly discussing oil and US control of Venezuela.\n\nIn a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the US president claimed the US would “run the country” for now, rebuild oil infrastructure, and “take out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground” to sell to global customers, including rivals China and Russia.\n\nMaduro has consistently denied involvement in the drug trade and has accused Washington of using this charge as an excuse to get to oil and other resources, even as the Trump team labelled Venezuelan-trafficked fentanyl a “weapon of mass destruction” and launched air strikes on boats accused of moving narcotic substances.\n\nOil vital to Venezuela’s recovery\n\nThe sudden abduction of the Venezuelan president has not yet translated to any major shift in the power structure of the South American nation.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez has been ordered by the constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s Supreme Court to serve as acting president “to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defence of the nation” as a legal framework is devised for the future.\n\nShe had also been serving simultaneously as finance minister and oil minister, giving her enormous influence over the nation’s embattled economy and efforts to vitalise the underdeveloped oil sector that produces less than it should as a result of sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump said the US would not occupy Venezuela if Rodriguez “does what we want”. He also declined to endorse the opposition leader, exiled Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, saying she does not have the approval or “respect” of the people.\n\nWhat the US wants from Rodriguez is likely to revolve around Venezuela’s oil, which Trump and other US officials have characterised as US oil – based on the South American country’s nationalisation of its oil industry between the 1970s and the 2000s, forcing most US oil companies out.\n\n“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights, they took all of our oil from not that long ago. And we want it back,” said Trump in December.\n\nIn his typically forthright manner, Trump has also said that Venezuela’s oil reserves would cover any costs the US incurs from its attack on the country, and “the damages” allegedly caused by Venezuela to the US.\n\nOil is vital to Venezuela, and the US had used its importance to pressure the country prior to the abduction of Maduro.\n\nUS sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil have been a core element of US policy toward Venezuela since 2017, especially under combined Trump-era directives. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) is blacklisted, and Washington has taken measures restricting the shipment of diluents that are needed for heavy crude.\n\nA host of oil traders, companies and ships that transport the goods have been sanctioned, including last month, while Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters, which led to at least two tankers being confiscated.\n\nUS sanctions and pressure are some of the main reasons why Venezuela’s oil exports are not comparable to the country’s oil reserves.\n\nVenezuela’s oil exports averaged about a meager 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and the US “oil embargo” knocked them down to around 500,000 bpd last month, according to preliminary figures based on ship movements.\n\nIn comparison, major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia export millions of barrels per day on average.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, the former head of the economic advisory of the Venezuelan National Assembly, said gold and oil reserves are among the country’s main hopes for economic recovery.\n\n“If the US moves to remove the sanctions and clear the hurdles for investors to come back in, you can get the oil output to 2.5 million barrels per day in the scope of three to five years,” he told Al Jazeera from the US state of Colorado, pointing out that production currently stands at below one million barrels per day.\n\n“I think what the Trump administration is saying is that we need to prioritise the recovery of the oil sector and get the economy on a manageable basis so that we think about more orderly political transition,” the former official said.\n\n“But if you try to directly hand over the power to the opposition right now without having set the basis for economic recovery, that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to chaos.”\n\nWhat does this mean for OPEC and others?\n\nAt least in the short term, the Venezuela developments do not mean a major change for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But things could drastically change with time.\n\nVenezuela cannot quickly raise production due to its ageing infrastructure, and unilateral US seizures of tankers near Venezuela’s waters only led to an uptick in oil prices before another stabilisation.\n\nVenezuela’s upstream oil infrastructure, particularly under PDVSA, has suffered from more than a decade of underinvestment, so some wells are mechanically compromised, restarting shut-in wells often requires full workovers or redrilling, not simple reactivation, and routine preventive maintenance largely ceased after the US embargoes.\n\nThe crude cannot flow or be exported without diluents, which are being blocked by the US, while storage, blending, and upgrading facilities are bottlenecked, with many operating well below nominal capacity.\n\nBut theoretically, if a US-directed Venezuela manages to rapidly boost output in the future, OPEC will face a supply glut or will have to adjust quotas. This would give Washington indirect but major influence inside the group and over global supply, disrupting the delicate balance members have been trying to keep for years.\n\nWest Asia neighbours like Iran and Saudi Arabia are also directly affected if Caracas leans towards the US in the long term.\n\nThe anti-US and Israel establishment in Iran has lost another major ally in Maduro, after the fall of top leaders of the Tehran-backed “axis of resistance” over the past two years.\n\nIran has also been hampered in efforts to develop its oil sector due to stringent Western sanctions, and like Venezuela under Maduro, Iran sends most of its oil at heavily discounted prices through a shadow fleet of ships to China. A robust return of Venezuelan oil to the market would further undermine Iranian oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia was not a close ally of the Maduro establishment like Iran, but it also risks future oversupply that may push global prices down if Venezuela makes a comeback. That may force Riyadh to cut production and weaken its price leadership in the global market.","url":"https://trinidadtribune.com/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye/","image":"https://trinidadtribune.com/app/uploads/2026/01/getty_6955860136-1767212545-daANyv.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 21:06:06","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"tt","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":391214668,"title":"Beckles: Where is Kamla?","text":"OPPOSITION Leader Pennelope Beckles criticised the absence of Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar from the UNC's press conference on January 4 attended by Foreign Affairs Minister Sean Sobers and Housing Minister David Lee.\n\nThis follows the US military's seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro amid the positioning of its fleet in the southern Caribbean including a radar presence in TT, the latter fact incurring open threats to TT from top members of the Maduro regime.\n\n\"Where is the Prime Minister?\" asked Beckles in an online statement hours later.\n\n\"The nation would reasonably have expected the Prime Minister to be present at today’s press conference.\"\n\nBeckles alleged the two ministers appeared unable to provide clear answers on matters of national importance.\n\n\"Trinidad and Tobago cannot be expected to accept a Prime Minister who seems unwilling to make herself available to the media and, more importantly, to the people she was elected to serve.\n\n\"What makes this situation even more unacceptable is the UNC’s poorly executed press conference, which appeared deliberately designed to distract the population with frivolous and cheap political rhetoric on issues relating to the HDC, rather than addressing the serious and pressing national concerns before us.\"\n\nBeckles said when reporters had asked about the PM's whereabouts, Sobers fumbled through his response.\n\n\"When questioned about why the press conference was held at the UNC headquarters, he claimed it was because the location was “centralised.” Later in the same briefing, he stated that the National Security Council was meeting, only to then assert that he himself was a member of that Council.

It’s a failed country. It’s a totally failed country. It’s a country that’s a disaster in every way.”\nOn Sunday morning, Venezuelan Defence Minister General ‍Vladimir Padrino said in a televised ‌statement that the nation’s armed forces had been activated to safeguard sovereignty. He did not detail how many casualties his nation’s security forces at the hands of the Americans.\n\nPadrino also threw his support behind Rodríguez as interim president, a candidacy that may not be popular in Washington given her pointed criticism of the US invasion shortly after her swearing in by Venezuela’s Supreme Court.\nThe Trump administration has said it is willing to work with the remains of Maduro’s decapitated government provided Washington’s goals, including opening access to US investment in crude oil reserves, are met.\nTrump’s blatant show of force on Saturday has sparked positive and negative global reaction - and spread jitters among foreign leaders. A few hours later, Trump boasted that he is “reasserting American power in a very powerful way” and suggested he may target Cuba, Colombia and Mexico next.\nHours after the attack, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it was “deeply shocked” by what it termed Washington’s “brazen use of force against a sovereign state”.\nThe sharply worded statement said the attack was a violation of international law and an infringement on Venezuela’s sovereignty, adding that the operation threatened peace and security across Latin America and the Caribbean.\nThe governments of Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Spain and Uruguay put out a tough joint statement saying the US actions in Venezuela “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security and endanger the civilian population”.\nVenezuela also appealed to a 33-member regional bloc Sunday to “step forward” and support Caracas.\nAnd 26 European Union nations, other than ‍Hungary, called on Sunday for restraint by all parties involved in Venezuela “to avoid escalation and to ‍ensure a peaceful solution to the crisis”.\nThe UN is expected to address the attack and fallout at an emergency session of the Security Council on Monday.\nAsked by The Atlantic how leaders in Greenland should view the Venezuela attack, Trump suggested they pay close attention. “They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don’t know,” he said. “But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defence.”\nTrump has frequently demanded that Greenland - an autonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a Nato ally - become part of the US, going so far as to post an envoy to the Danish territory.

I think they are in a lot of trouble, yes,” Marco Rubio told NBC News on Sunday when asked if it would be the next Latin American regime to be toppled after the US’s raid on the Venezuelan capital.\n\nHis remarks followed a similar warning on Saturday from president Donald Trump, who warned “we’ll be talking about Cuba” at the end of a press conference about his invasion of Venezuela.\n\nThose ominous remarks have sent alarm bells ringing in Cuba, where the Communist leadership is now in fear of a wider US military campaign in Latin America.\n\nPresident Miguel Diaz-Canel, who has ruled Cuba since 2019, said the capture of Mr Maduro was part of a “brutal assault” on the “Zone of Peace,” a bloc of 33 Latin American and Caribbean states.\n\nHe also branded the US mission a “criminal attack” and “state terrorism against the brave Venezuelan people and against Our America”, urging a response from other world leaders.\n\nCreated in Havana in 2014, the Zone of Peace declaration was a broad commitment not to intervene in the affairs of other countries and to uphold “friendly relations” in the Caribbean and Latin American regions.\n\nWhile it is not explicitly anti-US, the pact is widely viewed as an attempt to counterbalance Washington’s regional influence. Mr Diaz-Canel has warned it is now under siege.\n\nCuba’s Communist Party-controlled media outlets have followed Mr Diaz-Canel’s lead with Granma, the country’s most widely read news outlet, running a huge image of the Venezuelan national colours on its home page.\n\nThe lead article stated that Cuba “stands with Venezuela” and quoted at length various messages of condemnation from senior Communist politicians in the country.\n\nOn the ground, reporters in Havana have spoken of an atmosphere of fear in the capital and a sense of grim inevitability on the issue of an attempted US coup.\n\n“Here in Cuba, people are really rather worried,” British journalist Ed Augustin told NBC News. “I was at a rally outside the US embassy that was hastily convened by the ruling Communist Party this morning, and I think both the government and an awful lot of Cubans feel threatened.”\n\nAddressing fears that Cuba’s government could be next, he added: “It’s been widely reported ... that Marco Rubio ... sees this strategy, getting rid of Maduro, as the mechanism by which they can finally overthrow the government in Havana.”\n\nThere does indeed seem to be a bigger plan under way in Washington, and one largely driven by Mr Rubio, who is the first US secretary of state with Latin American heritage.\n\nBorn to Cuban immigrants who travelled to Miami in 1956 seeking a better life, it is no secret that Mr Rubio wishes to see an end to the Communist regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\nOn Sunday Mr Rubio said the Cuban government has a “huge problem” as he refused to rule out any future action against the South American country.\n\nHe told NBC’s Meet the Press that he would not talk about “future policy” but said it was “not a mystery that we’re not big fans of the Cuban regime”.\n\nWhat is much less clear is what could happen. US military action is one possibility but another might be a home-grown coup or the toppling of the government by mass protests.\n\nThe Cuban economy is in a dire state – with the US the main culprit according to Havana – owing to collapsing public services, a 10 per cent plunge in GDP since 2020, food shortages and a soaring cost of living.\n\nIn 2021, there were large-scale protests against the government and the Communist Party over severe food and medicine shortages during the Covid pandemic. Similar protests followed in 2024, this time linked to power cuts as well as food shortages.\n\nThere were also clues as early as November 2025 that the Trump administration would like to become the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn its National Security Strategy paper released that month, the administration vowed to “reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere”, referring to the policy of James Monroe, the fifth US president, who saw Latin America as part of the US sphere of influence.\n\nThe same document says that the Trump administration will “protect our homeland and our access to key geographies throughout the region”, a line that now feels prescient in light of Saturday’s helicopter raid on Caracas.\n\nHowever, experts say the long-term effects of the attack in Venezuela, and any future intervention in Cuba, extend far beyond Latin America.\n\n“The Trump administration’s removal of Maduro from power in Venezuela is not simply a message to antagonistic regimes in the hemisphere, like Cuba and Nicaragua,” said Alexander B Gray, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a US research institute.\n\n“It is a global re-establishment of deterrence that will be seen in Beijing and Moscow as an unambiguous sign of the Trump administration’s commitment to a security order compatible with American interests,” he said.\n\nThe attack on Caracas may also have been designed to humiliate China, which has pumped enormous amounts of investment into both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nIn Venezuela alone, Beijing has provided about $100bn (£75bn) in loans and other forms of financial support, with the state’s large oil reserves used as collateral.\n\nA report by Reuters over the summer found that China might even supplant Russia as Cuba’s main benefactor in the near future. In 2025 alone, 55 solar parks in Cuba were underwritten by China, the news agency noted.\n\nSure enough, it was China leading the condemnation of the attack on Mr Maduro on Sunday, with Beijing’s foreign ministry demanding his immediate release.\n\nBut if Mr Trump is serious about extending his reach across the whole Western Hemisphere – and Saturday’s events strongly suggest that he is – then getting Mr Maduro out of a jail cell could soon be the least of Beijing’s worries..","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/cuban-regime-reels-communist-ally-154150565.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/22XjulVCvL.RSpsEzNIbXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNTA0O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/c843440ad101f7a5b061acb28f82cc3c","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:46:52","author":"James Rothwell","authors":["James Rothwell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":391206018,"title":"After Nicolas Maduro's capture, will US target Cuba next?

This question arose after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened the communist regime of Havana. Addressing the media after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, he said that \"I’d be concerned\". He said, \"In some cases, one of the biggest problems Venezuelans have is they have to declare independence from Cuba.\" He added, \"They tried to basically colonise it from a security standpoint. So, yeah, look, if I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit.\"\n\nMarco Rubio's Cuba regime threat\n\nMarco Rubio also claimed that Cuba is being \"run by incompetent, senile men, and in some cases not seen now, but incompetent nonetheless.\" The US Secretary of State alleged that Maduro’s guards and Venezuela’s “whole spy agency” were “full of Cubans,” and that “this poor island took over Venezuela.” Before him, US President Donald Trump said his administration “wants to surround ourselves with good neighbours”. He added that Cuba is “not doing very well right now” and it is a “failing nation.” Trump said, \"It’s very similar in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba, but we want to also help the people who are forced out of Cuba and living in this country.\" \n\nWhat did Donald Trump say about Cuba?\n\nOn the other hand, Cuba has condemned the US attack on Venezuela and called it an “act of state terrorism.” Taking to X, Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla wrote on the social platform that his country condemned the “military aggression” of the US “against Venezuela and the kidnapping of its legitimate President Nicolás Maduro Moros and his wife.”\n\nCuba condemns US attack on Venezuela\n\nAlthough the Cuban government did not react to Marco's comment directly, it said in a statement that the US move would be destabilising for the region. It said in the statement, \"All nations of the region must remain alert, as the threat hangs over all. In Cuba, our determination to struggle is firm and unwavering. The decision is one and only one: Homeland or Death.\"\n\nThe US attacked Venezuela on Saturday, its Delta Force stormed Maduro’s compound and captured him and his wife Cilia Flores.

The living standard of Venezuela plummeted 74% between 2013 and 2023. This was the fifth steepest fall in the living standard in the modern economic history of the world. What are the reasons for the downfall of the economy? What role did the US economic sanctions play in the collapse? How much did the domestic policies of the successive governments led by Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro contribute to the withering away of the once robust and vibrant economy? \n\nVenezuela's Economy under Hugo Chavez\n\nAt a time when the Venezuelan economy was booming, riding on the crest of a prolonged period of increased prices of oil and gas, President Hugo Chavez adopted the policy of freebies, where almost everything was served almost free. Under the Bolivarian Mission, Chavez provided free medical care under the Barrio Adentro scheme, free education under Mission Robinson, highly subsidised groceries under Mission Mercal and direct cash handouts to the poorest of the poor. About 50% of the annual GDP was used in paying for the nationwide subsidies. Consequently, the government was under the massive debt burden of $100 billion. \n\n(Nicolas Maduro in custody.)\n\nVenezuela's economic collapse\n\nThe government also offered subsidised gasoline, heating oil and software to its people. The gasoline was so cheap that it was smuggled at throwaway prices. The petrol worth an estimated value of $10 billion were sent across the border to Brazil and Colombia every year. This alone caused a massive loss of about $120-150 billion to the exchequer. The entire oil industry was government-owned, with the monopoly of the Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. or the PDVSA. As the government made no investment, the industry became archaic and outdated and unable to compete in the international market, its production also fell. The only profit they could boast was due to the joint venture projects set up with foreign companies, including those from India. \n\nNicolas Maduro's price controls economy\n\nThe second blunder committed by the administrations of Chavez and Maduro was that they splurged whatever they earned in good times and saved nothing for the bad times. Unlike the oil-rich economies of Saudi Arabia and Norway, they did not set up a fund like the Public Investment Fund or Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund. When the international crude oil price plummeted from $100 per barrel to $40 per barrel, Venezuela was not ready to absorb the shock. \n\n(US attacks Venezuela)\n\nPDVSA oil mismanagement\n\nWhen the flow of Petro-dollar came to a trickle, the government did not cut spending, rather it adopted the artificial measure of controlling prices of almost everything. The price caps were artificial, often too low, and unable to meet the input costs. This led to shortages, smuggling and closure of manufacturing units, throwing thousands out of jobs. The South American economy was heavily dependent on imports; there was not enough foreign currency to pay for the imports. The regulatory body continued to buy dollars, most of them going to a select few due to corruption and the government lost an estimated $300 billion. The central bank printed more notes, money supply was regularly expanded by 20-30% per month, the country was pushed into a hyperinflationary spiral. \n\nDonald Trump sanctions Venezuelan oil\n\nNicolas Maduro refused to give access to the US oil firms; Chevron was nationalized by Chavez in 2006 and the US firms suffered. The US stooge and a champion of the free market economy, Congressman Juan Guaido, lost the presidential election in 2019; Maduro was re-elected, much to the chagrin of the US. After Washington failed to dislodge Maduro and anoint its own man in his place, it imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela. After cutting off the Latin American country from the international oil market and freezing its assets in the US, Donald Trump, who was in his first term of presidency, imposed the secondary sanctions. Now, any other country or company doing business with Venezuela would come under the sanctions. \n\n(US eyes Venezuelan oil.)\n\nThe government-controlled PDVSA was forced to sell its products on the black market to partners that charged high mark-ups in exchange for ‘laundering’ the sanctioned oil. The oil production, which was slashed almost 50% due to years of underinvestment, suffered drastically under the US sanctions. The crude production plummeted from 1500 thousand barrels per day (bpd) before the primary sanctions to 337 thousand bpd after the secondary sanctions in 2020. The economy contracted 73% in 2020. \n\nNarco-terrorism in Venezuela?\n\nThe Maduro regime was marked for price controls, profit controls, central bank money printing and extra-budgetary spending. Venezuela did not have checks and balances. The opposition was stifled, the system was corrupt, the judiciary was silent, the media was biased and the economy was groaning under the US economic sanctions. Since the country had virtually no legitimate exports, many turned to forming drug cartels and began supplying narcotics to the US. Under these circumstances, many officials of the Venezuelan Armed Forces were accused of participating in the smuggling of arms and drugs, especially cocaine. Though the CIA has alleged that the narco-terror ring Cartel of the Suns constitutes a formal organisation led by President Nicolas Maduro, independent observers and analysts have rejected it. \n\nThe US has attacked Venezuela, captured the president and his wife. Donald Trump has said publicly that Washington will run the South American country, send the US firms to get control of the crude oil, ship it to America and sell it to the world, for profit, of course.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/explainer/report-venezuela-economic-collapse-nicolas-maduro-freebies-oil-donald-trump-us-sanctions-3195996","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2026/01/04/2737252-nicolas-maduro-deposed-president-venezuela.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:38:00","author":"Gautam Adani","authors":["Gautam Adani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":391210032,"title":"Major hurdles ahead","text":"President Donald Trump’s plan to take control of Venezuela’s oil industry and ask American companies to revitalize it after capturing President Nicolás Maduro in a raid isn’t likely to have a significant immediate impact on oil prices.\n\nVenezuela’s oil industry is in disrepair after years of neglect and international sanctions, so it could take years and major investments before production can increase dramatically. But some analysts are optimistic that Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day to return to historic levels fairly quickly.\n\n“While many are reporting Venezuela’s oil infrastructure was unharmed by U.S. military actions, it has been decaying for many many years and will take time to rebuild,” said Patrick De Haan, who is the lead petroleum analyst at gasoline price tracker GasBuddy.\n\nAmerican oil companies will want a stable regime in the country before they are willing to invest heavily, and the political picture remained uncertain Saturday with Trump saying that the United States is in charge — while the current Venezuelan vice president argued, before Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, that Maduro should be restored to power.\n\n“But if it seems like the U.S. is successful in running the country for the next 24 hours, I would say there would be a lot of optimism that U.S. energy companies could come in and revitalize the Venezuelan oil industry fairly quickly,” said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.\n\nAnd if Venezuela can grow into an oil production powerhouse, Flynn said “that could cement lower prices for the longer term” and put more pressure on Russia.\n\nOil isn’t traded over the weekend, so there wasn’t an immediate impact on prices. But a major shift in prices isn’t expected when the market does reopen. Venezuela is a member of OPEC so its production is already accounted for there. And there is currently a surplus of oil on the global market.\n\nProven reserves\n\nVenezuela is known to have the world’s largest proven crude oil reserves of approximately 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That accounts for roughly 17% of all global oil reserves.\n\nExxon Mobil didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment over the weekend. ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said by email that the company “is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.”\n\nChevron is the only one with significant operations in Venezuela, where it produces about 250,000 barrels a day. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.\n\n“Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said.\n\nBut even with those massive reserves, Venezuela has been producing less than 1% of the world’s crude oil supply. Corruption, mismanagement and U.S. economic sanctions saw production steadily decline from the 3.5 million barrels per day pumped in 1999 to today’s levels.\n\n“The estimate is that in order for Venezuela to increase from one million barrels per day — that is what it produces today — to four million barrels, it will take about a decade and about a hundred billion dollars of investment,” said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American energy program at Rice University.\n\nStrong demand\n\nVenezuela produces the kind of heavy crude oil that’s needed for diesel fuel, asphalt and other fuels for heavy equipment. Diesel is in short supply around the world because of the sanctions on oil from Venezuela and Russia and because America’s lighter crude oil can’t easily replace it.\n\nYears ago, American refineries on the Gulf Coast were optimized to handle that kind of heavy crude at a time when U.S. oil production was falling and Venezuelan and Mexican crude was plentiful. So refineries would love to have more access to Venezuela’s crude because it would help them operate more efficiently, and it tends to be a little cheaper.\n\nBoosting Venezuelan production could also make it easier to put pressure on Russia because Europe and the rest of the world could get more of the diesel and heavy oil they need from Venezuela and stop buying from Russia.\n\n“There’s been a big benefit for Russia to see Venezuela’s oil industry collapse. And the reason is because they were a competitor on the global stage for that oil market,” Flynn said.\n\nComplicated legal picture\n\nBut Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”","summary":"President Donald Trump's plan to take control of Venezuela's oil industry and ask American companies to revitalize it after capturing President Nicolás Maduro in a raid isn't likely to have a significant immediate impact on oil prices.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/04/major-hurdles-ahead/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25355780619234.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:35:06","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":391216930,"title":"Trump says U.S. needs Greenland 'for defense'","text":"Jan. 4 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump said in an interview published Sunday that the United States needs to annex Greenland \"for defense,\" while his deputy chief of staff's wife was reproached by Denmark's ambassador to the U.S. for a social media post about the possible move.\n\nTrump has consistently discussed annexing Greenland since before retaking office in January 2025, but has also long been rebuffed on the idea by officials in both Denmark and Greenland.\n\nBut at a news conference on Saturday morning after the U.S. apprehension of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both alluded to the potential of U.S. military action elsewhere in the Americas.\n\nWhen asked on Sunday if Maduro's apprehension should be interpreted by other nations -- for instance, Greenland, which does not want to be annexed -- as a signal that his administration might consider military action to pursue more goals, Trump demurred.\n\n\"They are going to have to view it themselves,\" Trump told The Atlantic in an interview on Sunday. \"I really don't know ...

They each shared videos from inside Trump's private Palm Beach resort. \n\nBolivar Camino said it was 'an honor' to be 'the first Venezuelan to thank Donald Trump' for capturing the dictator who had been controlling their country for the last 13 years. \n\nHerrera, who attended the event with her husband, declared Trump to be 'my president'. 'What an honor as a Venezuelan to be here on this great day with POTUS,' she wrote in a post. \n\nAs shown in Herrera's videos, the opulent event was also attended by Elon Musk, in the latest sign of him cozying up to the president after their explosive feud in the summer of 2025.\n\nTrump entered the Mar-a-Lago dining room to a rapture of applause, before he spoke with the attendees and posed for photographs with many of them. The White House declined to comment on the event. \n\nMore than eight million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2014 due to rampant violence, inflation, gang warfare and food shortages. As a result, the country has been left facing one of the largest displacement crises in the world, according to the United Nations. \n\nSo while world leaders have reacted with varying levels of unease and condemnation over Maduro's capture, the celebratory tone of Trump's glitzy Florida party has been echoed among Venezuelan expat circles around the world. \n\nOn Saturday, jubilant Venezuelans spilled out onto the streets to welcome the news with singing and dancing, while waving both US and Venezuelan flags. \n\nOne person celebrating in Chile said: 'I've come to celebrate because the dictatorship has fallen, Maduro's drug trafficking has fallen, and Nicolas Maduro and Diosdado Cabello. \n\n'We are free, we are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.'\n\nAnother in Doral, Florida, added: 'Today, justice is being served. Justice is being served for all the Venezuelans who left our country to demonstrate who we are.\n\n'We are fighters, we entrepreneurs, we are good people but we want to return to our country and rebuild, move forward and continue being that force that we have always been. \n\n'Long live Venezuela.'\n\nMaduro and his wife Cilia Flores were seized by the US Army's elite Delta Force unit during airstrikes in Caracas at around 2am local time on Saturday. \n\nExplosions rang out across the city, with flames seen billowing into the air.\n\nSpeaking to The New York Times, nine minutes after he announced the raid, Trump said: 'A lot of good planning and lot of great, great troops and great people.\n\n'It was a brilliant operation, actually.' Asked if he had consulted Congress prior to authorizing the strike, Trump said: 'We'll discuss that.'\n\nThe United Nations has said it was 'deeply alarmed' by the US strikes and detention of Maduro, saying the escalation may have been a violation of international law.\n\n'These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,' Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general, said in a statement. \n\nDujarric said there are worries about the wider implications for Latin America and the Caribbean, and called on 'all actors in Venezuela' to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nThe New York indictment against Maduro accuses him of leading a 'a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.' \n\nIt alleges that the drug trafficking efforts 'enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite.'\n\nUS authorities allege that Maduro partnered with 'some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world' to bring tons of cocaine into North America.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. \n\nThe drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nTrump said the United States would govern Venezuela indefinitely in the meantime, after dismissing the prospect of the country's popular opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, taking the reins, claiming she 'does not have the support'. \n\nHe offered little further detail on the logistics of running Venezuela, which has a population of 30 million, but suggested the country's vast oil reserves would be used to fund its revival. \n\nTrump's unapologetic focus on the South American nation's oil supplies has prompted many US lawmakers to accuse him of being primarily motivated by economic gain, rather than a desire to pursue criminal charges.","summary":"Videos posted on social media by Venezuelan influencers show them hugging the US President and thanking him for ridding their country of the despot.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15433447/venezuelans-maralago-trump-celebrate-maduro-capture.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/04/19/105221661-0-image-m-12_1767553281140.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/03/8220573852977313458/480x270_MP4_8220573852977313458.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:17:03","author":"Editor,Laura Parnaby","authors":["Editor","Laura Parnaby"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.217},{"id":391211294,"title":"Trump leads the world into a geopolitical Wild West","text":"“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again,” President Donald Trump declared Saturday, after U.S. forces hit various Venezuelan targets and elite commandos carried out the capture and rendition of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife with an audacious raid in the dead of night. “Under the Trump administration we are reasserting American power in a very powerful way in our home region.”","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/04/venezuela-trump-global-law-order-rules-wild-west-intervention/","image":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKPL2Q3HGAFBSARS7JXMM73HKI.JPG&w=1600&h=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:16:21","author":"Ishaan Tharoor","authors":["Ishaan Tharoor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.31},{"id":391211286,"title":"What Maduro’s ouster means for Trump’s mass deportation campaign","text":"Samir Luzardo’s life as an asylum seeker in the United States has been in limbo since President Donald Trump took office again last year.

Cheese, and a Trump Administration lawyer.\n\nThat was evident at the press conference yesterday as President Donald Trump blew apart the carefully constructed narrative presented earlier for the seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. \n\nSome of us had written that Trump had a winning legal argument by focusing on the operation as the seizure of two indicted individuals in reliance on past judicial rulings, including the decisions in the case of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and General Dan Caine stayed on script and reinforced this narrative. Both repeatedly noted that this was an operation intended to bring two individuals to justice and that law enforcement personnel were part of the extraction team to place them into legal custody. Rubio was, again, particularly effective in emphasizing that Maduro was not the head of state but a criminal dictator who took control after losing democratic elections.\n\nHowever, while noting the purpose of the capture, President Trump proceeded to declare that the United States would engage in nation-building to achieve lasting regime change. He stated that they would be running Venezuela to ensure a friendly government and the repayment of seized U.S. property dating back to the government of Hugo Chávez.\n\nThis city is full of self-proclaimed Trump whisperers who rarely score above random selection in their predictions. However, there are certain pronounced elements in Trump’s approach to such matters. First, he is the most transparent president in my lifetime with prolonged (at times excruciatingly long) press conferences and a brutal frankness about his motivations. Second, he is unabashedly and undeniably transactional in most of his dealings. He is not ashamed to state what he wants the country to get out of the deal.\n\nIn Venezuela, he wants a stable partner, and he wants oil.\n\nChávez and Maduro had implemented moronic socialist policies that reduced one of the most prosperous nations to an economic basket case. They brought in Cuban security thugs to help keep the population under repressive conditions, as a third fled to the United States and other countries.\n\nAfter an extraordinary operation to capture Maduro, Trump was faced with socialist Maduro allies on every level of the government. He is not willing to allow those same regressive elements to reassert themselves.\n\nThe problem is that, if the purpose was regime change, this attack was an act of war, which is why Rubio struggled to bring the presser back to the law enforcement purpose. I have long criticized the erosion of the war declaration powers of Congress, including my representation of members of Congress in opposition to Obama’s Libyan war effort.\n\nThe fact, however, is that we lost that case. Trump knows that. Courts have routinely dismissed challenges to undeclared military offensives against other nations. In fairness to Trump, most Democrats were as quiet as church mice when Obama and Hillary Clinton attacked Libya’s capital and military sites to achieve regime change without any authorization from Congress. They were also silent when Obama vaporized an American under this “kill list” policy without even a criminal charge. So please spare me the outrage now.\n\nMy strong preferences for congressional authorization and consultation are immaterial. The question I am asked as a legal analyst is whether this operation would be viewed as lawful. The answer remains yes.\n\nThe courts have previously upheld the authority of presidents to seize individuals abroad, including the purported heads of state. This case is actually stronger in many respects than the one involving Noriega. Maduro will now make the same failed arguments that Noriega raised. He should lose those challenges under existing precedent. If courts apply the same standards to Trump (which is often an uncertain proposition), Trump will win on the right to seize Maduro and bring him to justice.\n\nBut then, how about the other rationales rattled off at Mar-A-Lago? In my view, it will not matter. Here is why.\n\nThe immediate purpose and result of the operation was to capture Maduro and to bring him to face his indictment in New York. That is Noriega 2.0.\n\nThe Administration put him into custody at the time of extraction with law enforcement personnel and handed him over to the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\nThe Trump Administration can then argue that it had to deal with the aftermath of that operation and would not simply leave the country without a leader or stable government.\n\nTrump emphasized that “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.”\n\nI still do not like the import of those statements. Venezuelans must be in charge of their own country and our role, if any, must be to help them establish a democratic and stable government. Trump added that “We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.”\n\nThe devil is in the details. Venezuelans must decide who has their best interests in mind, not the United States.\n\nHowever, returning to the legal elements, I do not see how a court could free Maduro simply because it disapproves of nation-building. Presidents have engaged in such policies for years. The aftermath of the operation is distinct from its immediate purpose.\n\nTrump can argue that, absent countervailing action from Congress, he has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to lay the foundation for a constitutional and economic revival in Venezuela.\n\nHe will leave it to his lawyers to make that case. It is not the case that some of us preferred, but it is the case that he wants to be made. He is not someone who can be scripted. It is his script and he is still likely to prevail in holding Maduro and his wife for trial.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/operation-absolute-resolve-why-trump-went-script-and-why-it-will-not-matter","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/Donald_Trump_official_portrait_2.jpg?h=84bab05f&amp;itok=ybbmXPgc","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:10:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":391211384,"title":"US names its three biggest priorities for Venezuela after dramatic raid and Maduro capture... as unanswered questions remain","text":"Marco Rubio has revealed America's top three priorities after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro - as unanswered questions spark confusion across both nations. \n\nThe US Secretary of State discussed what the country hopes to accomplish following the detention of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday. \n\n'The first steps are securing what's in the national interest of the United States and also beneficial to the people of Venezuela, and those are the things we are focused on right now,' he said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \n\n'No more drug trafficking, no more Iran [and] Hezbollah presence there.'\n\nRubio added that the US was also keen to make sure there was 'no more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries.' \n\nThe Trump administration has alleged that Maduro is the leader of the Cartel de los Soles, a narco-terror organization that has taken control of the country.\n\nIt claims that Maduro, who has been Venezuela's president since 2013, and his cartel associates have been flooding the US with illegal narcotics. \n\nIn his second presidential term, Trump has ramped up his war on drugs, designating an increasing number of gangs as terrorist organizations. \n\nHe had been targeting Venezuelan ships allegedly smuggling drugs from the country for months prior to Saturday's raid. \n\nRubio also referenced the presence and influence of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite terrorist group and political party, in the South American nation. \n\nHezbollah is just one of many foreign agents and terror organizations that have infiltrated Venezuela. \n\nVenezuela has the world's largest oil reserves. The industry has deep ties to US rivals, including China, Iran and Russia. \n\nVenezuela has worked with these nations to dodge US sanctions. The countries have also invested billions into the oil sector, giving them increased economic and political influence. \n\nDonald Trump has outlined his intention to set up US oil companies in Venezuela. \n\n'We're going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,' he said on Saturday. \n\nUS forces captured Maduro and Flores from their Caracas compound during a dramatic military operation involving air strikes across the capital city. \n\nAbout 40 military personnel and civilians died as a result. Donald Trump said that no Americans were killed.\n\nMaduro and Flores now sit behind bars at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Brooklyn, New York, on narco-terrorism and drug trafficking charges. Still, critical details surrounding the ordeal remain cryptic. \n\nIs it lawful for the US to ‘run’ Venezuela? \n\nTrump has vowed to 'run' Venezuela, as he claims to have Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, who has been named the nation's interim leader, on America's side, despite her public declaration that 'never again will we be a colony of any empire.'\n\nHowever, this idea has been debunked by experts who say it is simply unlawful for the US to take over Venezuela. \n\n'This sounds like an illegal occupation under international law, and there is no authority for the president to do it under domestic law,' Cardozo School of Law Professor Rebecca Ingber told The New York Times. \n\n'It’s unclear what he has in mind, but presumably he’d need some funding from Congress to do it.' \n\nJeremy Paul, a professor at Northeastern University specializing in constitutional law, echoed this sentiment to Reuters: 'You cannot say this was a law enforcement operation and then turn around and say now we need to run the country.\n\n'It just doesn't make any sense.'\n\nDid Maduro’s capture and extraction violate international law?\n\nMaduro's extradition to New York apparently violated the US-ratified United Nations Charter.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the treaty states that a country cannot use force against the sovereign territory of another nation without that nation's consent, a basis for self-defense or the authorization of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe US did not have Venezuela's consent, and the premise of the Maduro raid is not considered self-defense but a law enforcement operation. \n\n'It is difficult to conceive of possible legal justifications for transporting Maduro to the US, or for the attacks,' University of Cambridge International Law Professor Marc Weller UK-based thinktank Chatham House wrote. \n\n'There is no UN Security Council mandate that might authorize force. Clearly, this was not an instance of a US act of self-defense triggered by a prior or ongoing armed attack by Venezuela.'\n\n'The cornerstone to the UN Charter is settling disputes peaceably and resorting to the use of force as a last resort. This action violates that principle,' Syracuse University College of Law Professor David M Crane told the Daily Mail.\n\nDoes the UN prohibition matter under US law? \n\nThe US Congress has the power to declare war, but the president is considered the nation's commander-in-chief. \n\nPresidents of both political parties have justified launching international military action when it was of national interest and/or of limited scope - often without a formal declaration of war from Congress. \n\nTrump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair magazine late last year that if Trump were to allow 'some activity on land' in Venezuela, he would need Congress to give him the go-ahead first. \n\nHowever, Rubio said that Congress was not notified about the Saturday operation. \n\nExperts have identified other legal qualms with the ordeal. \n\n'Under domestic law, the President went against the National Security Act and the War Powers Act, which require notice to Congress due to Article I of the US Constitution, where only Congress can declare war,' Crane told the Daily Mail. \n\nWill Trump face any repercussions from the international courts?\n\nUnder international law, there is a basis to penalize Trump for these actions, according to experts. \n\nHowever, the chances of it are unlikely, Crane said. \n\n'The International Criminal Court (ICC) does not have jurisdiction over the US as a non-signatory to the Rome Statute and the US has veto power over a Security Council resolution,' he explained. \n\nThe Rome Statute is the fundamental treaty that created the ICC and its legal framework. \n\nIt defines core crimes as genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes. \n\nThe US did not sign off on the Rome Statute over concerns that it would give the court's prosecutor 'too much power unchecked,' John Bellinger III, a former legal adviser for the National Security Council, told NPR. \n\nRegardless of the legal consequences, Crane said that the Venezuela raid, 'politically and diplomatically, it is a disaster for the US.' \n\n'What moral standing we had left is now gone,' he continued. 'The US is moving towards a pariah state.","summary":"The US Secretary of State discussed what the country hopes to accomplish following the detention of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, on Saturday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15433243/US-priorities-Venezuela-Nicolas-Maduro-Marco-Rubio.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/04/17/105220753-0-image-m-34_1767549098274.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/03/818202880177490565/1024x576_MP4_818202880177490565.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-04 20:09:22","author":"Editor,Laura Parnaby,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Laura Parnaby","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.007},{"id":391214652,"title":"Anger and jubilation after US arrests Venezuelan leader","text":"Protesters in major Australian cities have condemned the United States&apos; takeover of Venezuela, while others are celebrating the downfall of the nation&apos;s authoritarian leader. Hundreds turned out on the streets of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth on Sunday following news of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro&apos;s capture. Mr Maduro was transported to New York under US guard following a military offensive in Caracas sparked by months of tension between the two nations. President Donald Trump said the US would \"run the country\" until a safe, proper and judicious transition, while unveiling plans to tap and sell Venezuela&apos;s substantial oil reserves. Demonstrators took to the streets of Australia&apos;s capital cities on Sunday evening to denounce the US administration&apos;s actions. In Sydney, protesters waved posters that read, \"Hands off Venezuela\" and \"Down with imperialism\". But there was also jubilation from supporters of Venezuela&apos;s opposition who celebrated the fall of Mr Maduro. Many were waving the nation&apos;s flag while draped in red, blue and yellow, and brandished photos released of the ousted leader under arrest with the word \"captured\" superimposed across his image. More than 150 people packed the steps of Melbourne&apos;s Flinders Street Station, yelling \"shame\" when speakers said the ousted president had been \"kidnapped\". They brandished banners that read, \"Release Maduro now! No regime change!\" and \"No war for oil! Solidarity with the people of Venezuela\". One speaker said Mr Maduro had been \"demonised\" and rubbished claims he rigged elections and was connected to drug trafficking. \"It is the clearest cut case of outright propaganda, and its main role is to soften ordinary people to the idea of regime change in Venezuela,\" he told the crowd. The anti-US protesters said they supported Venezuelans who stood for their sovereignty, and demanded the Australian government cut ties and sanction the US administration. Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson said the Labor government needs to speak to Australia&apos;s ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd and find out what the US administration&apos;s plans are. \"It&apos;s an extraordinary situation. It felt like watching a movie in real time,\" Mr Wilson told Nine&apos;s Today show on Monday. \"We want to make sure we&apos;re stepping through all of these things as a nation very cautiously.\" Federal Nationals Leader David Littleproud said that while \"we should be happy that an illegitimate, brutal dictator has been removed ... it is important that the sovereignty of Venezuela is respected.\" \"The world is looking, waiting with bated breath, at what the next move is of the Trump administration,\" he told Seven&apos;s Sunrise program. \"And this should be more than about oil or drugs - this should be about making returning the country of Venezuela back to its people.\" Australia is home to more than 6600 Venezuelan-born residents, with about 10,000 people of Venezuelan ancestry, according to the 2021 census. The Venezuelan Association of Australia said there would be complex emotions within the diaspora after many experienced forced separation from loved ones, exile and the long-term impacts of authoritarian rule. \"In moments like this, our shared hope remains for a free, democratic, and united Venezuela where people can live with dignity, safety and opportunity,\" the association said. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has urged all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy to prevent escalation as his government monitors the situation. The US has previously accused Mr Maduro of running a narco-state and rigging the country&apos;s 2024 national election, claims the ousted president has denied. Mr Maduro&apos;s government appears to still be in charge, with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez assuming the role of acting president. Australia&apos;s SmartTraveller website has urged citizens not to travel to the Latin American country due to the unpredictable security situation.

The White House framed the operation as a necessary effort aimed at dismantling narco-terrorist efforts threatening to destabilise the region..It is important to situate America’s aggressive military action into perspective. The large-scale operation on Venezuelan territory and the capture of its leader is based on much more than just the drug-trafficking and weapons charges being levelled against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. President Donald Trump alleged that Maduro maintained close ties with powerful drug cartels responsible for the flow of narcotics into the US, contributing to rising overdose deaths, and that his government possessed dangerous weapons hostile to US interests..Long-standing concerns over irregular migration from the southern hemisphere were also folded into this narrative, with the President claiming that Caracas deliberately emptied its prisons and facilitated the entry of criminals and patients from mental institutions into the US, claims that critics argue may serve as post-hoc justification for the use of force. Reports suggesting the capture of President Maduro, however, point towards objectives extending beyond law enforcement. They indicate a possible attempt to operationalise regime change, consistent with a revamped US national security strategy that treats American primacy in the Western Hemisphere as non-negotiable..In this context, allegations that Venezuela has hosted Russian military facilities revive the logic of the Monroe Doctrine historically invoked by Washington to resist extra-hemispheric interference, now repurposed to legitimise unilateral US action. Venezuela’s close relationship with the Kremlin under its left-leaning government thus appears to be a central trigger for Washington’s response..The White House has since stated that it seeks to oversee a “safe, orderly, and judicious” transition of power in Venezuela, signalling continued US involvement in the country’s political future..Alongside this, Washington indicated plans to revive Venezuela’s oil sector, a move with clear strategic benefits, given that the country holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves. The promise of economic reconstruction, however, remains inseparable from the political and geopolitical costs of the intervention..The American operation reveals a broader geoeconomic strategy embedded in US-Latin America relations, one that extends beyond counter-narcotics justifications. It unfolded against the backdrop of Venezuela’s vast hydrocarbon reserves and Maduro’s sustained refusal to reopen large-scale oil trade or allow meaningful American corporate participation in Venezuela’s energy sector. As a result, US business involvement and extraction activity in Venezuela have remained negligible, while China has emerged as the country’s principal importer of crude oil..Despite its economic decline, Venezuela remains central to global energy markets and the US’s strategic competition with China and Russia. Even as the US administration urged renewed engagement, American oil firms reportedly stayed away amid political volatility, making regime change and the prospect of a US-backed government increasingly appealing..The implications are graver than they look, as, legally, the strike sits on uncertain ground. International law prohibits the use of force against another state’s territory unless authorised by the United Nations Security Council or justified as self-defence against an armed attack. Drug trafficking, however serious, does not meet that threshold under established international jurisprudence. Legal scholars argue that such US action sits uneasily with customary international law, as the undertaking of a large-scale military strike and the pursuit of regime change amount to a direct breach of Venezuela’s sovereignty in the name of national security..Analysts warn that Washington has risked not just erosion of the rule of law, as the UN Secretary-General stated, but also brought itself to the doorstep of potential war crimes under International Humanitarian Law if the hostilities are recognised in light of severe civilian damage. By framing military action as a law-enforcement necessity, Washington risks diluting the legal distinction between policing and warfare, a boundary that has long protected weaker states from unilateral intervention..The broader implication is the gradual erosion of the rules-based international order that major powers themselves claim to uphold. If military strikes become an accepted tool for managing economic risks, criminal networks or political defiance, international law risks being reshaped by power rather than principle..Strategy of territorial assertion.The US actions towards Venezuela reinforce a permissive global climate where unilateral force eclipses legal restraint. China’s territorial ambition towards Taiwan is increasingly advanced through graduated coercion that fuses geoeconomic pressure with rehearsed territorial encirclement, a strategy Beijing has pursued consistently but with growing scale and confidence..China’s approach was most clearly demonstrated during the Justice Mission 2025 military drills in December. Several exercise zones extended into areas within 12 nautical miles of Taiwan’s coast, marking a significant escalation in proximity and intensity..China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the drills as a “punitive and deterrent action” against Taiwan independence forces and their external supporters, embedding territorial escalation within a long-standing sovereignty narrative rather than presenting it as a novel response..Against this backdrop, Venezuela’s national sovereignty has been violated with apparent impunity to safeguard Washington’s perceived strategic vulnerabilities in the Caribbean arising from Russia’s presence in the region. While Venezuela remains a fully functioning sovereign state, the situation appears markedly different in the case of Taiwan. In his New Year’s address, Xi Jinping reiterated that reunification with Taiwan is “unstoppable”, framing territorial consolidation as a historical and sovereign inevitability rather than a discretionary policy choice..Taken together, these military actions and political statements reflect a deliberate strategy of incremental territorial assertion consistent with Beijing’s long-standing Taiwan policy. The strategy is further reinforced by an international environment in which unilateral economic coercion and selective legal enforcement by major powers, particularly its principal competitor, the US, continue to occur with limited multilateral constraint, thereby lowering the perceived legal and reputational costs of sustained territorial pressure..(The writer is a professor of Economics and Dean, O P Jindal Global University, and a visiting professor at the London School of Economics)Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own.

A new international order is now emerging, based on the use of force, revisionism and security on the American continent.\n\nHere are five keys to understanding the outcomes of the military intervention, and the new order it ushers in.\n\nExpanded presidential power\n\nThe attack cements the new doctrine of an imperious President, one who executes orders without waiting for congressional approval, legal validation or media opinion.\n\nWith checks and balances weakened, the second Trump administration is free to present the new order as a question of urgent security: with the US at war against drug trafficking (or migration) and threatened by ‘new powers’ (a euphemism for China), it has no need to respect proper procedures or timelines.\n\nTrump identifies himself with historic, founding American presidents like Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. All three were charismatic leaders, and with the 250th anniversary of the US republic approaching, such comparisons feed into Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric.\n\nErosion of the US political and legal system is undeniable. The President has approved an extensive package of regulations that promote emergency powers, a permanent state of crisis, and suppression of political opposition and the judicial system. The attack on Venezuela is yet another milestone in the reconfiguration of the presidency’s relations to the legislative and judicial branches of power, in line with the Hamiltonian tradition of a strong and unifying executive branch.\n\n(Latin) America for the (US) Americans\n\nOn the international stage, the attack on Venezuela advances a diplomatic agenda that is rooted in the defence of national interests. The concept of ‘America for the Americans’ has made a strong comeback: Panama, Mexico and Canada have all been made to bow to Trump’s will, while the administration continues to push for control of Greenland.\n\nIn Latin America, Brazil and Colombia’s left-wing governments lead regional opposition to the US, while Chile’s newly elected José Antonio Kast and Argentina’s Javier Milei are Trump’s ideological allies. The continent as a whole is witnessing a broad shift towards nationalist, right-wing parties that oppose migration.\n\nIf Venezuela’s post-Maduro transition aligns with these values, any hope for national unity and a peaceful transition to full democracy will disappear.\n\nControl of resources\n\nOnce again, it’s all about oil, but for different reasons than in Iraq. In a world where globalisation has shifted to geoeconomics, the United States wants to project its power in international energy markets and regulation. Venezuela’s infrastructure, ports and minerals are key to making this happen.\n\nThe US therefore doesn’t just want Venezuelan oil to supply its domestic market – it also wants to impose international prices and dominate supply. Its new vision aims to align energy sovereignty and technological development with trade and security.\n\nPax Silica – the international US-led alliance signed at the end of 2025 to secure supply chains for critical technologies such as semiconductors and AI – ushers in an era of transactional diplomacy: computer chips in exchange for minerals. For the ‘new’ Venezuela, its oil reserves will allow it to participate in this new power dynamic.\n\nGeopolitical realignment\n\nThe American view of territory fuels a revisionist foreign policy based on sovereignty – similar to those of China, Israel, or Russia – which is rooted in the concept of ‘nomos’, as defined by mid-20th century German philosopher Carl Schmitt. This is a worldview where the division of nations into ‘friend or foe’ prevails over a liberal worldview governed by cooperation, international law, democracy and the free market.\n\nUnder this logic, spheres of influence emerge, resources are distributed, and power blocs are balanced, as the above examples demonstrate: without opposition, China would dominate Southeast Asia, Russia would scale back its war in exchange for 20 percent of Ukraine and control over its material resources and energy, and Israel would redraw the map of the Middle East and strike trade agreements with neighbouring countries.\n\nEurope, democracy and Hobbes\n\nIdeals like democracy, the rule of law and free trade are fading fast, and without effective capacity, things don’t end well for the European Union. As we have seen with Gaza, the EU often has strong ideological disagreement with other major powers but doesn’t command enough respect to do anything. The US’ military intervention revives Hobbesian political realism, where freedom is ceded to an absolute sovereign in exchange for peace and security.\n\nIn Trump’s new order, it is presidential authority – not truth, laws or democratic values – that has the final say.","summary":"Comment: In Trump’s new order, it is presidential authority – not truth, laws or democratic values – that has the final say\n\n\nThe post Five things to understand as Trump’s new world order takes shape in Venezuela appeared first on Newsroom.","url":"https://newsroom.co.nz/2026/01/05/five-things-to-understand-as-trumps-new-world-order-takes-shape-in-venezuela/","image":"https://newsroom.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/american-dollar-bill-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:56:36","author":"Juan Luis Manfredi","authors":["Juan Luis Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"nz","sentiment":0.542},{"id":391211672,"title":"Trump warns Venezuela’s interim president of “very big price” for not cooperating with US","text":"BAKU, Azerbaijan, January 4.

I haven't looked at the case file,” added the secretary. “I've got a bunch of other things going on.”\n\nDuring another appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Rubio was directly asked: “Mr. Secretary, who is in charge? Are you running Venezuela right now?” \n\nThe secretary did not give a clear answer, instead replying: “Yeah, I mean I keep-- ...people [keep] fixating on that. Here’s the bottom line on it, is: We expect to see changes in Venezuela. Changes of all kinds, long term, short term, we’d love to see all kinds of changes but the most immediate changes are the ones that are in the national interest of the United States. That’s why we are involved here. Because of how it applies, and has a direct impact on the United States.”\n\n“We are not going to be able to allow, in our hemisphere, a country that becomes a crossroads for the activities of all of our adversaries around the world. We just can’t allow-- we can’t have a country where the people in charge of its military and in charge of its police department are openly cooperating with drug trafficking organizations,” he continued. “We’re not going to allow that.”\n\nRubio seemed to indicate that the existing governmental infrastructure in Venezuela, home to roughly 30 million people, could be upheld under its current leadership, presumably including Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez. The question around whether remnants of Maduro’s government will remain in power remains an open one as U.S. President Donald Trump himself has thrown cold water on the idea that Maria Corina Machado, the country’s most prominent opposition leader, was seen as a legitimate replacement among Venezuelans. \n\nHis statements come as the country’s vice president reportedly fled to Russia to escape a potential similar fate and the U.S. has been unclear in its stance on who should fill the power vacuum that threatens to arise.\n\nRubio told Stephanopoulos that the U.S. did not view Rodriguez or the remainder of Maduro's government as legitimate, while giving no indication of who the U.S. expected would be in power in the days ahead.\n\nMaduro arrived in New York late on Saturday, where he is expected to face criminal charges in the Southern District.\n\n“I assure you the people left behind in Venezuela now that are in charge of the police and everything else, I assure you they are gonna probably be a lot more compliant than Maduro was as a result of this,” Rubio said on Sunday.\n\nThe secretary went on to call questions about holding elections in the country “premature” while holding to a line he’d offered a day earlier, flanked by the president and other top aides including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at a press conference discussing the strike: that the U.S. held firm to its convictions under Trump’s leadership, in contrast to other presidential administrations.\n\nAt the same time, however, Rubio couldn’t say for sure whether the U.S. would be taking over Venezuela’s oil industry and “take back the oil” with the help of American companies, as Trump had promised just a day earlier.\n\nInstead, he claimed the U.S. didn’t “need” Venezuela’s oil, and claimed that the priority of the Trump adminsitration was oriented around keeping Venezuela’s oil industry from being traded with countries like Iran, Russia and China.\n\n“No more using the oil industry to enrich all our adversaries around the world and not benefiting the people of Venezuela and frankly, benefiting the United States,” said the secretary.\n\n“We don't need Venezuela's oil. We have plenty of oil in the United States,” claimed Rubio. “Why does China need their oil? Why does Russia need their oil? Why does Iran need their oil? They’re not even in this continent.”\n\n“We’re not going to allow the western hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States,” he added, insisting that the U.S. wants to “see the oil proceeds of that country benefit the people of Venezuela.”\n\n“Ultimately, this is not about securing the oil fields,” Rubio said.\n\nOn Saturday, at a press conference the president brashly claimed that the U.S. would be directly running Venezuela for the time being and force a transition of power, indicating an Afghanistan-style removal of the entire Maduro regime. The authoritarian left-wing leader ruled the country from 2013 to 2025 and held on to the office after elections in 2024 that were widely condemned in Venezuela and around the world as fraudulent.\n\n\"We’re there now, and we’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place,\" Trump said on Saturday, in terms Rubio would not use a day later. \"We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.”\n\n“We can’t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn’t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind,” added the president. “We are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so. So we were prepared to do a second wave if we need to do so.”\n\nTrump went on to say that he wasn’t afraid of ordering a sustained U.S. military presence within Venezuela and told reporters: “We don’t mind saying it, but we’re going to make sure that that country is run properly. We’re not doing this in vain.”\n\nHe turned from that press conference to Truth Social for the remainder of the day, where he unleashed long spree of posts and “re-truths” that included glowing praise of his military strikes as well as a return to the latest fixation of conservatives in the U.S.: Alleged instances of fraud among daycares run in Minnesota’s Somali-American communities, which have become the Trump administration and broader right wing’s latest target of fury. In many cases, the criticism has devolved into naked racism and Trump himself has been accused of stoking that hate by referring to Somali-American communities as “garbage”.\n\nOn Saturday, the president re-truthed another Minnesota-related post that supported a conspiracy theory about a murdered Democratic lawmaker and accused Gov. Tim Walz, also a Democrat, of ordering her assassination. Friends and family of Melissa Hortman, the slain former speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, have called the insinuations shared by the president despicable and false.","summary":"Trump’s top diplomat can’t say who is in charge day-to-day of running Venezuela or when U.S. will hold elections as Trump promised","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rubio-trump-venezuela-maduro-government-b2894241.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/04/16/22/rubio_mtp_126.jpg?crop=421.5,281,x40.2,y0&trim=0,40,0,40&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xVC0t7XQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:50:25","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":391211368,"title":"JD Vance builds a mammoth lead for 2028 Republican nomination as one insurgent begins plotting a takedown","text":"As he addressed a gathering in Las Vegas recently, Ted Cruz raised the elephant in the Republican room.\n\n'When Trump is not in the White House, what then?' he asked. A loud call came back from the crowd: 'Ted Cruz!'\n\nCruz, 55, who was runner-up to Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, paused his speech for several seconds and chuckled. He declined to respond directly to the call for him to run again in 2028 but, increasingly, many Republican insiders believe he is at least maneuvering toward the starting gate.\n\nAccording to a new Daily Mail/JL Partners poll, Cruz, and a myriad of other potential 2028 contenders, will have an uphill struggle - but that's not to say they won't try.\n\nThe poll gives Vice President JD Vance a massive 38-point lead among Republican primary voters.\n\nHe has the backing of 49 percent, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis a distant second on 11 percent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio third with five percent. Cruz and Vivek Ramaswamy are in joint fourth with four percent.\n\nHowever, two years before the presidential primary, no lead is unassailable and the prospect of an open primary, not with as many contenders as 2016 but some serious players, remains realistic.\n\nThere are expected to be two main sources of support - the MAGA base, and the more traditional wing of the party with a less isolationist foreign policy. There's also a strain of the party who will be searching for a fresher face - someone who may not even be on the radar of most Republicans right now. \n\n'Vance actually has converted to a much greater extent [to MAGA] than Rubio has,' one insider told the Daily Mail. 'He's seen as the real thing. He's hardcore.'\n\nWhile this insider complimented Marco Rubio as 'sharp' and 'thoughtful,' the current secretary of state is most likely seen as a Vance ally in the run-up to 2028. \n\n'He wants to be Vance's VP. Remember, that means Hispanics on the ticket,' the insider added.\n\nThat could mean Rubio taking a run at the White House as late as 2036, when he would still only be 65, young by current presidential standards.\n\nHowever, others are watching Vance closely, and putting themselves in position to run in case a path opens up.\n\nWhile the polls are with the vice president, history is not.\n\nThe last incumbent vice president to be elected president was George H W Bush in 1988, and the one before that was Martin Van Buren in 1836. Joe Biden and Richard Nixon were former vice presidents when they won the White House.\n\nOne former senior Trump official told the Daily Mail: 'There's no doubt Vance has a head start as vice president, but I think it's a head start, I don't think it's locked in by any stretch of the imagination. I think there'll be a big open field within the Republican Party, I think a lot of people are interested.'\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail poll, no potential female Republican contender earned more than three percent support.\n\nFormer Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley secured three percent, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem two percent and Congresswoman Elise Stefanik one percent, but each could eye a run if they see an opportunity. \n\nVance had particularly high support among female Republican primary voters, with 54 percent backing him compared to 45 percent of men.\n\nIt comes after Vance recently went nuclear at commentators who insulted his wife Usha.\n\n'Let me be clear, anyone who attacks my wife, whether their name is Jen Psaki or Nick Fuentes, can eat s***,' Vance said, referencing former Biden press secretary Psaki, and far-right influencer Fuentes.\n\n'It says a lot to people, here's a guy who believes in true love, I've heard people say that,' Professor Larry Sabato, Director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told the Daily Mail.\n\n'He's got a soft side, I think brought on by having a young family. Women don't make up the large majority of the Republican [primary] vote that they do on the Democratic side, but they make up about half in most places and they're going to be more sympathetic, they're going to be more pro-Vance because of Usha's presence.'\n\nIn his corner, Vance will also have the formidable backing of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk's political machine Turning Point USA, which would help get out the vote in the wintry, rural first-voting primary state of Iowa.\n\nDuring the group's annual AmericaFest conference just before Christmas, Kirk's widow Erika endorsed Vance.\n\n'There are few endorsements that really matter, but I think hers [Erika Kirk's] does,' said Sabato.\n\nVance also won Turning Point USA's recent straw poll for the Republican nomination in 2028 with 82 percent of the vote. His margin of victory was bigger than Trump's in the same poll in 2024. \n\nAbsent unforeseen crises - and there are two years to go before Iowa - Vance is almost certain to inherit the MAGA mantle.\n\nOthers have tried to reinvigorate the traditional wing of the party and failed, a lesson Haley learned the hard way in 2024.\n\nHowever, there was recent encouragement for such candidates from an NBC News poll, which asked Republicans whether they considered themselves more a 'member of the MAGA movement' or a 'supporter of the Republican Party.' The result split 50-50, having been 57 percent MAGA and 43 percent traditional Republican in April.\n\nThose who read the Washington tea leaves believe Cruz could be the next Republican who tries to ride that wave.\n\nHe has been vocal in his warnings against isolationism, particularly the growing criticism of Israel among some prominent conservative figures including Tucker Carlson.\n\nWhile he has publicly praised Trump, sources claimed to the Washington Post that Cruz has privately told Republican donors that Vance's foreign policy views are too isolationist.\n\n'Cruz would be crazy not to do this. This is his last shot,' one Washington insider told the Daily Mail. 'You always prepare yourself to run for the position if circumstances enable you to do so. And one circumstance would be an unpopular Trump.'\n\nCurrently, Trump remains overwhelmingly popular within the party but if that fades toward the end of his presidency it could open the door for Cruz and a host of other senators and state governors to enter the 2028 race.\n\n'If Trump is still at 80 to 85 percent approval among Republicans, no way,' said Sabato assessing the likelihood of a strong challenge to Vance. 'If Trump becomes unpopular [with Republicans] and the economy is a mess, then yes, everybody, and his brother and sister will be on the train.'\n\nVance's team has repeatedly said he is not yet looking ahead to 2028, and is focused on his current position.\n\nHis team declined the Daily Mail's request for comment on the polling results.\n\n'We're going to do everything that we can to win the midterms, and then after that, I'm going to sit down with the president of the United States and talk to him about it,' Vance said recently.\n\nIf Cruz were to run, it may well spur others to do so, as they may feel they have more allies within the Republican Party than he does.\n\nThe feeling was summed up succinctly by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who recently fell out with President Trump. She told the Washington Post: 'There'll be Ted Cruz, I'm sure, running against JD Vance. All of us hate Ted Cruz.'\n\nAnother potential landmine for Vance is the libertarian wing of the party.\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul has criticized Vance's position on trade and tariffs.\n\n'Now all these pro-tariff protectionists, they love taxes, and so they tax, tax, tax, and then they brag about all the revenue coming in. That has never been a conservative position,' Paul told ABC News.\n\nAsked if Vance met that criteria of the traditional Republicans, he bluntly replied: 'No.'\n\nWhen the Daily Mail poll includes the current president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr in a hypothetical 2028 Republican primary, Vance's support falls from 49 percent to 38 percent – but he still remains in first place.\n\nHowever, the president's son has been clear he has no ambitions to run for president, especially given that he is personally close with Vance and helped convince his father to place him on the 2024 ticket.\n\nA well-connected Iowa strategist suggested that Vance could face a primary challenge from the right in, possibly from an unexpected candidate claiming to be the true MAGA successor through even greater loyalty to Trump's causes.\n\n'There may be two MAGA lanes. Will someone try to outflank the vice president?' the strategist told the Daily Mail. 'Some fresh faces, maybe not the ones being talked about now, might decide they want to take a swing at it.'\n\nBut Cruz will also be standing in the way of an insurgency. The Texan defeated Trump in the 2016 Iowa caucuses and would start with strong relationships formed in the evangelical community. \n\nRon DeSantis, who finished second in both the Daily Mail poll and the 2024 Iowa caucuses, appears less likely to run again, according to the Iowa strategist.\n\nIf the Daily Mail poll came to fruition, it sets up a 2028 general election between Vance and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut front-runners at this early stage usually don't end up as their party's nominee.\n\nHarris, who lost the popular vote and Electoral College to Trump in the 2024 election, has the support of 30 percent of her party's voters.\n\nBut a fellow Californian, Governor Gavin Newsom, is hot on her heels, with 21 percent of support in the Democratic primary and appears ascendant. \n\nIn a recent speech, Vance forecasted that Democrats are likely to nominate a Californian in 2028 - but he stopped short of naming which one.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance is poised to take over the MAGA empire in 2028 with 49 percent of likely Republican voters saying they want him as their next presidential candidate.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15406127/JD-Vance-lead-Republican-nomination-2028.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/22/19/104952679-0-image-m-14_1766433364815.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:49:35","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle Senior U.s,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle Senior U.s","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.134},{"id":391215224,"title":"Report: Iran enters ‘survival mode’ as protests surge and US threats escalate","text":"A week of protests showing no sign of abating, a direct threat from the U.S. president and then the lightning capture of a foreign leader have shaken Iran’s leadership and thrust the Islamic Republic into what senior officials privately describe as “survival mode.” Officials told The New York Times on Sunday that after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to intervene in the ongoing unrest in the country if the regime killed peaceful protesters — comments that drew sharp responses from Tehran — Iran’s Supreme National Security Council held a late-night emergency meeting Friday night to discuss how to contain the protests with less violence to avoid fueling public anger. Three Iranian sources familiar with the discussions said the council, which directs internal and external security policy, also weighed preparations for possible military escalation. Those sources said senior officials have privately acknowledged that Tehran is focusing on regime survival as protests continue. The Iranian government appears constrained, with few tools to address both a faltering economy and the risk of further confrontation with Israel and the United States. President Masoud Pezeshkian has publicly repeated in recent weeks that he has “no ideas” to solve the country’s deepening crises. In a Thursday speech — his first major address since the protests began — he said, “Any policy in the society that is unjust is doomed to fail. Accept that we must listen to the people.” Officials involved in internal discussions said there is concern that continued instability could invite fresh Israeli strikes. Statements by Trump and supportive remarks from Israeli leaders, including Cabinet ministers, have heightened that fear. Last week, Pezeshkian held two emergency economic advisory meetings and sought written talking points in case the crisis deepened. Some aides suggested directing public frustration toward Iran’s power structure centered on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority. Khamenei took a harder line Friday, saying at a public speech that “rioters must be put in their place,” blaming “foreign enemies” for the economic woes while acknowledging Tehran merchants’ right to protest price volatility. The Times also reported that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met secretly Thursday with pro-government media leaders, calling the unrest a “fight for the survival of the Islamic Republic’s rule and for the nation,” and saying negotiations with Washington are not currently possible and beyond his authority. Today, Iran’s Chief of Staff Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi accused the United States and Israel of fomenting chaos through “soft war” and economic pressure, claiming trained agents had been sent to exploit the protests. Meanwhile, state-aligned Iranian social media circulated an image of a new billboard at Tehran’s Palestine Square showing coffins draped with U.S. and Israeli flags and the words, in Hebrew and English, “Watch out for your soldiers,” erected in response to Trump’s threat and a retort from Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council: “They should worry about their soldiers.”","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/h1ldxbdn11x","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/04/r1Riig00Nbg/r1Riig00Nbg_0_0_2043_2999_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:49:29","author":"Lior Ben Ari","authors":["Lior Ben Ari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":391212558,"title":"Venezuela’s oil, not alleged drug trafficking, caught Trump’s eye","text":"For weeks, United States President Donald Trump and his officials said the rhetoric and military posturing against Venezuela were aimed at countering the flow of narcotics.\n\nBut abundant evidence, including Trump’s own words in the aftermath of the abduction of President Nicolas Maduro, suggests that Washington’s true interest lies in Venezuela’s vast proven oil reserves – the largest in the world, estimated at about 303 billion barrels.\n\nThe US president initially framed Saturday’s attacks on Caracas as an anti-drug operation, with officials calling it an arrest of “two indicted fugitives” on narcotrafficking charges. Maduro was indicted in the Southern District of New York courts for alleged “narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy”, among other charges.\n\nBut within hours of the US attacks on Caracas that killed dozens of civilians, officials and military personnel, Trump pivoted to openly discussing oil and US control of Venezuela.\n\nIn a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the US president claimed the US would “run the country” for now, rebuild oil infrastructure, and “take out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground” to sell to global customers, including rivals China and Russia.\n\nMaduro has consistently denied involvement in the drug trade and has accused Washington of using this charge as an excuse to get to oil and other resources, even as the Trump team labelled Venezuelan-trafficked fentanyl a “weapon of mass destruction” and launched air strikes on boats accused of moving narcotic substances.\n\nOil vital to Venezuela’s recovery\n\nThe sudden abduction of the Venezuelan president has not yet translated to any major shift in the power structure of the South American nation.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez has been ordered by the constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s Supreme Court to serve as acting president “to guarantee administrative continuity and the comprehensive defence of the nation” as a legal framework is devised for the future.\n\nShe had also been serving simultaneously as finance minister and oil minister, giving her enormous influence over the nation’s embattled economy and efforts to vitalise the underdeveloped oil sector that produces less than it should as a result of sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump said the US would not occupy Venezuela if Rodriguez “does what we want”. He also declined to endorse the opposition leader, exiled Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, saying she does not have the approval or “respect” of the people.\n\nWhat the US wants from Rodriguez is likely to revolve around Venezuela’s oil, which Trump and other US officials have characterised as US oil – based on the South American country’s nationalisation of its oil industry between the 1970s and the 2000s, forcing most US oil companies out.\n\n“If you remember, they took all of our energy rights, they took all of our oil from not that long ago. And we want it back,” said Trump in December.\n\nIn his typically forthright manner, Trump has also said that Venezuela’s oil reserves would cover any costs the US incurs from its attack on the country, and “the damages” allegedly caused by Venezuela to the US.\n\nOil is vital to Venezuela, and the US had used its importance to pressure the country prior to the abduction of Maduro.\n\nUS sanctions targeting Venezuelan oil have been a core element of US policy toward Venezuela since 2017, especially under combined Trump-era directives. The state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PDVSA) is blacklisted, and Washington has taken measures restricting the shipment of diluents that are needed for heavy crude.\n\nA host of oil traders, companies and ships that transport the goods have been sanctioned, including last month, while Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters, which led to at least two tankers being confiscated.\n\nUS sanctions and pressure are some of the main reasons why Venezuela’s oil exports are not comparable to the country’s oil reserves.\n\nVenezuela’s oil exports averaged about a meager 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and the US “oil embargo” knocked them down to around 500,000 bpd last month, according to preliminary figures based on ship movements.\n\nIn comparison, major oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia export millions of barrels per day on average.\n\nFrancisco Rodriguez, the former head of the economic advisory of the Venezuelan National Assembly, said gold and oil reserves are among the country’s main hopes for economic recovery.\n\n“If the US moves to remove the sanctions and clear the hurdles for investors to come back in, you can get the oil output to 2.5 million barrels per day in the scope of three to five years,” he told Al Jazeera from the US state of Colorado, pointing out that production currently stands at below one million barrels per day.\n\n“I think what the Trump administration is saying is that we need to prioritise the recovery of the oil sector and get the economy on a manageable basis so that we think about more orderly political transition,” the former official said.\n\n“But if you try to directly hand over the power to the opposition right now without having set the basis for economic recovery, that can actually be quite dangerous and lead to chaos.”\n\nWhat does this mean for OPEC and others?\n\nAt least in the short term, the Venezuela developments do not mean a major change for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). But things could drastically change with time.\n\nVenezuela cannot quickly raise production due to its ageing infrastructure, and unilateral US seizures of tankers near Venezuela’s waters only led to an uptick in oil prices before another stabilisation.\n\nVenezuela’s upstream oil infrastructure, particularly under PDVSA, has suffered from more than a decade of underinvestment, so some wells are mechanically compromised, restarting shut-in wells often requires full workovers or redrilling, not simple reactivation, and routine preventive maintenance largely ceased after the US embargoes.\n\nThe crude cannot flow or be exported without diluents, which are being blocked by the US, while storage, blending, and upgrading facilities are bottlenecked, with many operating well below nominal capacity.\n\nBut theoretically, if a US-directed Venezuela manages to rapidly boost output in the future, OPEC will face a supply glut or will have to adjust quotas. This would give Washington indirect but major influence inside the group and over global supply, disrupting the delicate balance members have been trying to keep for years.\n\nWest Asia neighbours like Iran and Saudi Arabia are also directly affected if Caracas leans towards the US in the long term.\n\nThe anti-US and Israel establishment in Iran has lost another major ally in Maduro, after the fall of top leaders of the Tehran-backed “axis of resistance” over the past two years.\n\nIran has also been hampered in efforts to develop its oil sector due to stringent Western sanctions, and like Venezuela under Maduro, Iran sends most of its oil at heavily discounted prices through a shadow fleet of ships to China. A robust return of Venezuelan oil to the market would further undermine Iranian oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia was not a close ally of the Maduro establishment like Iran, but it also risks future oversupply that may push global prices down if Venezuela makes a comeback. That may force Riyadh to cut production and weaken its price leadership in the global market.","summary":"Donald Trump now says he wants American companies to take over Venezuelan fields in order to extract and sell resources.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/4/venezuelas-oil-not-alleged-drug-trafficking-caught-trumps-eye?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty_6955860136-1767212545.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:49:16","author":"Apps Support,Maziar Motamedi","authors":["Apps Support","Maziar Motamedi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":391206038,"title":"After Venezuela, Colombia next? Trump warns president Gustavo Petro: 'Has to watch his...","text":"United States President Donald Trump has issued a warning for his counterpart in Colombia, Gustavo Petro, after ordering a strike in Venezuela and capturing its president Nicolas Maduro. The Venezuelan president and his wife were seized under the cover of powerful strikes in capital Caracas, and the two have since been brought to New York, where the US says they will be prosecuted. Speaking to reporters, Trump didn't mince his words and said that Colombian leader Petro needed to \"watch his a**.\"\n\nTrump vs Petro\n\nTalking of Petro, Trump said: \"He is making cocaine and they're sending it into the United States, so he does have to watch his a**.\" Petro, a 65-year-old leftist leader, has been a vocal critic of Trump's military deployments in the Caribbean to fight alleged drug trafficking vessels. After the attack on Venezuela, the Colombian president described US' actions as an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America and said that they would result in a humanitarian crisis. Trump had also recently said he would not rule out striking alleged drug-production laboratories in Colombia, which Petro called a threat of invasion.\n\nMaduro's dramatic capture\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, US forces struck the capital and other parts of Venezuela, capturing president Maduro his wife Cilia Flores. They are currently being held at a detention centre in Brooklyn, New York City, where the US plans to prosecute them on charges related to drug trafficking and conspiring against America. Meanwhile, Trump has announced that the US would \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe transition\" could take place. Top US officials have also hinted that Cuba and Mexico could be the next overseas targets of the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-after-venezuela-is-colombia-next-united-states-president-donald-trump-warns-president-gustavo-petro-has-to-watch-out-latin-america-threats-drug-trafficking-allegations-news-updates-3195994","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2026/01/04/2737250-trump-petro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-04 19:46:00","author":"Gautam Adani","authors":["Gautam Adani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.459}]}
