Or we cannot see them because one cannot see beyond six feet in Delhi. Or we keep trying to brush them under the Persian carpet, where, of course, they have their own problems. So in Delhi's drawing rooms, the focus shifts far afield to a virginal Greenland cowering under Trump's covetous gaze. At one level, I regard that, too, as my problem. Greenland has been on my bucket list—a list that moves as slowly as an old Soviet queue—ever since my first sight from a transatlantic flight of endless vistas of pristine ice, dotted along the coast with brightly coloured cottage-like houses. Now Greenland is less likely to be ticked off that list even as the time to k. the b. comes ever nearer: getting a Schengen visa, though not easy, is a relatively civilised process; with another kind of ICE in full flow, an American visa will require jumping through hoops, including swearing declarations that one is not going to the US to engage in money-laundering, terrorism, prostitution and so on. But despite three wonderfully voluble dinners since New Year's Day, nobody—not even Donald Trump—can quite predict what will happen with Greenland. The world—particularly Europe—waits like an anxious teenaged girl, plucking petals off a daisy flower and wondering: Will he, won't he. American interest in Greenland has been voiced before: in 1867 when the US acquired Alaska from Russia, in 1946, in 2019 under Trump 1.0 and even last January (which seems an awfully long time ago).Its strategic and commercial importance is undeniable. Arctic warming is opening up the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage, drastically cutting transit times. Russia has a powerful Arctic fleet and claims a long Arctic coastline. China is investing heavily in ports, energy and mining with an eye on Greenland's 1,000 trillion cubic feet of gas, 90 billion barrels of oil and massive deposits of precious metals and critical minerals. All these are rational strategic interests whose pursuit does not require a territorial takeover and a strangling of NATO. The US occupied Greenland during World War II following the German occupation of Denmark. A 1951 agreement gives the US virtually complete military access to the territory; Denmark/Greenland are hardly likely to object to greater US military presence now: it is the US that has reduced its earlier 10,000 strong presence to 200 personnel confined to one base. But in a Trumpian world, rational methods are passe'. Explanations have to be found in irrational impulses and psychological vulnerabilities. First, Trump, the real estate mogul, likes ownership not tenancy. And he likes big: Ask the 6'3' tall, broad, chunky Maduro. (In Manhattan, the XXL Nike tracksuits worn by Maduro after arrest are flying off the shelves.) So Trump salivates over Greenland on a map, which looks misleadingly the size of Africa on the Mercator projection, and says (as reported in The New Yorker): 'Look at the size of this, it is massive, and that should be part of the United States.' By that logic, what about Russia? Next, Trump, the reality TV host, enjoys playing commander-in-chief. Stopping wars, bombing countries—the tally is seven in one year, 'running' places and then watching it, from the safety of the White House situation room, like 'a television show…the speed, the violence'. This military porn can be addictive. And, as he recently claimed, no one can stop him except his 'own morality… own mind'. Well, so this week the needle is tilting towards He will. Unless Cuba, Mexico, Columbia, Iran… come in the way.

Negotiators will return to the United Arab Emirates for the next round on Feb. 1, according to a U.S. official who described the meetings as upbeat and positive.\n\nThe talks are the first known instance that officials from the Trump administration have sat down with both countries as part of Washington's push for progress to end Moscow's nearly 4-year-old invasion.\n\n\"All parties agreed to report to their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe meetings covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, said the official. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.\n\nThe power generated from the plant will be shared \"on an equitable basis,\" according to the official, but control of it was still undecided.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said there was \"an understanding of the need for American monitoring and control of the process of ending the war and ensuring real security.\"\n\nU.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner participated alongside Ukrainian officials, including chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov. Russia sent military intelligence and army representatives, according to Zelenskyy.\n\nWhile Zelenskyy said in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that a potential peace deal was \"nearly ready,\" certain sensitive sticking points — most notably those related to territorial issues — remain unresolved.\n\nThe U.S. official said Russian and Ukrainian officials likely would need to hold further talks in Russia or Ukraine before there was a chance of Zelenskyy meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, or even a joint session with President Donald Trump. There seemed to be momentum to reach the stage of leader meetings, according to the official, who spoke to reporters in Washington on condition of anonymity to describe the private talks in Abu Dhabi.\n\nJust hours before the three-way talks began Friday, Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with Witkoff and Kushner during marathon overnight talks. The Kremlin insists that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nThe second day of talks came as Russian drone attacks killed one person and wounded four in the capital, Kyiv, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko. In Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, drone attacks wounded 27 people, Kharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said Saturday.\n\n\"Cynically, Putin ordered a brutal massive missile strike against Ukraine right while delegations are meeting in Abu Dhabi to advance the America-led peace process,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. \"His missiles hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table.\"","url":"https://mb.com.ph/2026/01/25/zelenskyy-says-trilateral-talks-ended-constructively-and-more-are-possible-next-week","image":"https://mb.com.ph/manilabulletin/uploads/images/2026/01/25/74228.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 07:58:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":393951006,"title":"No war, no peace: Is India's military ready for the new normal?","text":"Looking back, the past five years might go down as quite an important period in India's military history. Not only did the country show the world that it could fight and fight well, but also that its soldiers could hold their own across the negotiating table. The two different forms of engagement—parleying with the Chinese military and a full-blown military conflict with Pakistan—had their own dynamics. They added another dimension to the evolving nature of the Indian military, but also exposed gaps in the security establishment. If the engagement with China underlined lack of intelligence information, tardy procurement process and apparent lack of modern equipment—particularly for high-altitude warfare—the conflict with Pakistan revealed serious weaknesses in India's electronic warfare capability, information warfare and the capacity to make its own weapons. Engagement with China From mid-2020, the world's two biggest land forces—with some 20 lakh soldiers in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and about 13.5 lakh in the Indian Army—embarked on a massive face-off. They mobilised lakhs of men, tanks, artillery guns, ammunition, supply logistics equipment, drones and other equipment, transporting them to the icy heights of the Karakoram and the Himalayas along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC). It was a delicate time for the two Asian giants—both trying desperately to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic—and the crippling economic cost of the engagement was telling. Yet, mobilisation continued. The fact that at least 24 soldiers died in a brutal fistfight in the Galwan Valley (June 15-16, 2020) made both sides itch for violent confrontation. The reverberations were felt strongly, from the banks of the Pangong Tso lake in eastern Ladakh to the high mountains of Tawang in Arunachal. It was important to cool tempers before the situation reached a point of no return. What followed was a series of quiet and resolute interactions—ranging from calm to stormy ones—between the men in uniform from both sides. At times, these interactions continued for days, and the effort slowly began to pay off. Of course, there were meetings at the top political level, but these interactions on the border, from the senior levels to the battalion and company level, were equally if not more important. Chief of the Army Staff General Upendra Dwivedi told THE WEEK that the two armies had, on average, more than 1,100 interactions a year—that is more than three times a day. These meetings were mostly held in Daulat Beg Oldi and Chushul-Moldo (Ladakh), Nathu La (Sikkim), and Bum La and Kibithu (Arunachal Pradesh). '[Both armies] have become more responsive and more sensitive to each other's concerns and the process of disengagement has contributed to improved stability on ground,' said General Dwivedi. Many a time, however, the situation was close to breaking point. In July 2023, then Army chief General Manoj Pande told THE WEEK: 'The events of 2020 led to the emergence of northern borders (read China) as the 'primary front'.' It was perhaps the first indication that the Indian forces now saw China as enemy number one and that the forces were being 'strategically re-orientated' towards the northern borders. At the same time, General Pande had also said that India did not want permanent deployment along the LAC, but that any moving back would depend on disengagement and withdrawal of forces from the other side. As things stand now, India and China seem to have avoided a conflict that had the potential to turn into a war, with catastrophic consequences not just for South Asia, but for the world. As for the future, the behaviour of President Donald Trump could perhaps even push India and China closer together. Engagement with Pakistan On April 22, 2025, Pakistan-aided terrorists shot dead 26 people in the tourist spot of Baisran near Pahalgam in Kashmir's Anantnag district. India decided to hit back and hit hard. On the intervening night of May 7-8, the chief of defence staff and the three service chiefs huddled together as Operation Sindoor was launched from South Block in Delhi. Among other things, it reflected the ongoing jointness and integration effort of the three services. Nine targets, hosting terrorists and their infrastructure, were hit in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan. The farthest one was Bahawalpur in Pakistan's Punjab, 100km from the Line of Control. As a former Army chief told THE WEEK during the crisis: 'The key was to maintain and calibrate the level of escalation. Because we all know what an escalation means between two nuclear adversaries.' From May 7 to May 10, India foiled a series of night swarm attacks by Pakistani drones. 'It demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated counter-UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) and layered air defence systems,' a top Army officer told THE WEEK. On May 10, Pakistan's DGMO requested a ceasefire. 'It demonstrated the effectiveness of India's long-range firepower and precision strike capability. The circle was complete and the intent was made clear,' said the officer. In effect, Operation Sindoor gave birth to a new military doctrine. From the Cold Start Doctrine (quick but limited strikes and focus on defence), it had now become the Dynamic Response Military Doctrine, which enables execution of a range of military operations without a formal declaration of war, all within the nuclear threshold. Perhaps more important, Operation Sindoor put several military initiatives on the fast track. In June, two additional Pinaka rocket regiments were operationalised, strengthening stand-off firepower. Indigenous rocket evolution was accelerated, including work on the 300km-class Pinaka variants for future deep-strike options. On October 24, a demonstration in Rajasthan showcased the integrated employment of new organisations such as the Bhairav battalion and Ashni drone platoon (see graphics), alongside newly inducted technological assets. This signalled the movement from concept to deployed capability. Said Lieutenant General Ajay Kumar, director general (Infantry): 'About 385 infantry battalions of the Army have already been equipped with a platoon each of Bhairav as part of a mega transformative effort. Each platoon will operate 10 drones—six loitering munitions of 'kamikaze' drones and four for surveillance.' There have been crucial developments in other verticals, too. On December 1, a BrahMos unit of the Army's Southern Command and elements of the tri-services Andaman and Nicobar Command executed a missile launch that showed high-speed flight stability and terminal accuracy under simulated battle conditions. Then, the successful test of the Pinaka Long Range Guided Rocket (reported range of 120km) on December 29 marked a notable step towards higher-precision deep fires. Two days later, the Defence Research and Development Organisation successfully tested a salvo launch (multiple firings) of the indigenous, multi-warhead capable Pralay missile. This is a solid propellant, quasi-ballistic (capable of manoeuvres in flight) missile with state-of-the-art guidance and navigation to ensure high precision. The past year also saw a variety of UAS being inducted into the Army. This includes various types of drones, including about 3,000 remotely piloted aircraft, about 150 tethered drones, swarm drones, logistics drones for high-altitude areas, and kamikaze drones. The Army's air power also got a boost in 2025, with the induction of six Apache attack helicopters. But most important, the Indian security establishment has realised the need to adopt and adapt to changes in keeping with the changing needs of modern warfare. All this acquires significance when seen against the backdrop of the government's position that Operation Sindoor still continues. In his special address in Parliament on July 29, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asserted: 'India will demolish terror in the terrorism nursery. Which is why Operation Sindoor hasn't ended. It will continue.' On December 13, CDS Gen Anil Chauhan reiterated: 'The intensity of operations may have ebbed, but Operation Sindoor continues... our strengths will lie in the ability to remain alert, agile and prepared, every hour, every day.' What India faces now is a 'no war, no peace' scenario, which is the new normal.","url":"https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2026/01/17/no-war-no-peace-is-indias-military-ready-for-the-new-normal.html","image":"http://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/magazine/theweek/cover/images/2026/1/17/42-Soldiers-during-a-tactical-drill-along-the-LoC-in-October-2025.jpg.transform/schema-1x1/image.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 06:37:00","author":"Sanjib Kr Baruah","authors":["Sanjib Kr Baruah"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.18},{"id":395764462,"title":"Williams, Blake top the field at New Balance Grand Prix","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this file photo Danielle Williams of Jamaica competes in heat three of the women’s 100 metre hurdles during the World Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, on August 22, 2023.

They are going to be building a base starting next week to place it on and then the process of installation will take us a few weeks and that’s why we say maybe the third week in February, certainly hopefully not beyond the end of February,” said Tufton.\n\nThe minister made the revelation during a visit to the St James-based health institution on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe facility has been in the news, in particular, after staff members staged a protest about overcrowding at the facility, due to the lack of wards and other issues. The space was already cramped but was made worse after Hurricane Melissa damaged sections of the facility which is being housed temporarily at the Mount Salem Health Centre while renovations continue on CRH’s main building.\n\nMinister Tufton said they are working to also rehabilitate the impacted ward spaces in the temporary A and E unit.\n\n“The contractors are active, they’re on the ground, I just went and toured, and we do expect a number of those wards to come on stream. Over the next week, this week, you’ll see some coming on stream,” he said.\n\nHe is however urging individuals to understand the situation as they work to remedy the challenges.\n\n“I just want to appeal to all concerned to understand the context of what we are working with, it’s a very difficult situation, but just to say that there is a remedy that is being pursued and that remedy is to restore the bed space so that the doctors and nurses can then triage and do what they need to do to get patients who need be in hospital, in hospital,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Cornwall Regional Hospital Minister of Health and Wellness Dr Christopher Tufton \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Haitian group seeks Caricom intervention amid efforts to remove prime minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) – The National Conference of Actors for New Governance (NCANG) in Haiti has written to Caribbean Community (Caricom) Secre... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Snow, ice hit western, central US as massive storm sweeps nation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n HOUSTON, United States (AFP) — A massive winter storm dumped snow and freezing rain on New Mexico and Texas Saturday as it spread across the United St... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Kitts PM defends policy on Haitians \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n BASSETERRE, St Kitts (CMC) – Noting that St Kitts and Nevis has one of the largest per capita Haitian populations in the Caribbean, Prime Minister Dr ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NFA CEO confident Jamaica can surpass record tilapia production \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief Executive Officer of the National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Dr Gavin Bellamy, has expressed confidence that Jamaica’s tilap... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AfroSzn hits the scene with Jamaican DJs at the helm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— As part of what organisers are describing as a bold new-year regimen for Jamaica’s nightlife, a fresh cultural experience dubbed Af... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

(Photo: CMC) \n\n Latest News, Regional \n\nJanuary 24, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Haitian group seeks Caricom intervention amid efforts to remove prime minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) – The National Conference of Actors for New Governance (NCANG) in Haiti has written to Caribbean Community (Caricom) Secretary General, Dr Carla Barnett, seeking its in “the immediate creation of the mediation and transfer of power committee”.\n\nThe development comes amid efforts to remove Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime within 30 days.\n\nThe NCANG in its January 23 letter to Barnett, a copy of which has been obtained by the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC), said that together with several Haitian civil society organisations, they wanted to alert Caricom “of the gravity of the national crisis and the rapid deterioration of the political and social situation” in the French-speaking member state.\n\n“With the expiration of the mandate of the Presidential Transitional Council (CPT) approaching on February 7th, 2026, it has become imperative to establish a Mediation Committee. This committee must serve as an impartial and inclusive framework to initiate negotiations among Haiti’s various stakeholders, with the goal of reaching consensus on the new governmental structure that will replace the CPT,” the letter states.\n\nEarlier this month, the Caricom Eminent Persons Group (EPG) warned that it is “vital that stakeholders, civil society and the people of Haiti reach a consensus before 7 February 2026,” adding that “a failure to do so could lead to unwanted repercussions”.\n\nThe EPG, comprising the former prime ministers of St Lucia, Jamaica and the Bahamas, said time is of the essence and that it has continued to render its good offices to Haitian stakeholders as they address “the myriad political, security and institutional challenges facing Haiti at this time”.\n\nHaiti has been without an elected head of state since July 2021 when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated at his private residence overlooking the capital, Port-au-Prince. Since then, criminal gangs have been seeking to overthrow the provisional government and have taken control of a vast section of the capital.\n\nEarlier this week, a resolution for Fils-Aimé’s dismissal had the support of five members of the CPT, before advisor Smith Augustin finally reversed his decision and refused to sign.\n\nIn correspondence addressed to the members of the Council, president pro tempore and coordinator of the CPT, Laurent Saint-Cyr, said he was opposed to any resolution aimed at calling into question governmental stability ahead of February 7.\n\nBut on Friday, two CPT members, Leslie Voltaire and Edgard Leblanc Fils, told a news conference that they intend to proceed with a plan to remove Prime Minister Fils-Aime within 30 days following established procedures, despite warning from the United States that such a move would have consequences.\n\n“We are the ones who appointed Didier Fils-Aime in November 2024. We are the ones who worked with him for a year, and it is up to us to issue a new decree naming a new prime minister, a new government and a new presidency,” Voltaire told reporters.\n\nThe CPT was appointed in 2024 to oversee a move towards Haiti’s first election in a decade, but this has been repeatedly pushed back due to a collapse in security amid a bloody conflict with powerful, heavily armed gangs.\n\nFils-Aime, speaking at a police event in Port-au-Prince on Friday, warned that “neither criminals wearing ties nor criminals wearing flip flops” would dictate the law and warned that anyone who stood against the police or the state would face a firm response “without weakness, without compromise”.\n\nUS Charge d’Affaires, Henry Wooster, who was also at the police event, said it was essential that Fils-Aime stay on to safeguard the fight against gangs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: elections Haiti Prime Minister \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Snow, ice hit western, central US as massive storm sweeps nation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n HOUSTON, United States (AFP) — A massive winter storm dumped snow and freezing rain on New Mexico and Texas Saturday as it spread across the United St... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Kitts PM defends policy on Haitians \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n BASSETERRE, St Kitts (CMC) – Noting that St Kitts and Nevis has one of the largest per capita Haitian populations in the Caribbean, Prime Minister Dr ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NFA CEO confident Jamaica can surpass record tilapia production \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief Executive Officer of the National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Dr Gavin Bellamy, has expressed confidence that Jamaica’s tilap... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AfroSzn hits the scene with Jamaican DJs at the helm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— As part of what organisers are describing as a bold new-year regimen for Jamaica’s nightlife, a fresh cultural experience dubbed Af... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spurs slip at Burnley increases pressure on Frank as City win \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Thomas Frank's job is under renewed threat after Tottenham dropped more points in a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened B... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Multiple US states declared states of emergency as meteorologists said the storm would soon begin marching across much of the continental US, covering a wide swath of the country's middle including the Rockies and Plains.

At least 16 states and the US capital Washington, declared states of emergency.\n\n“Take this storm seriously, folks,” the National Weather Service said on X, predicting an “astonishingly long swath” of snowfall from New Mexico to Maine.\n\nMore than 3,400 flights in and out of the United States were cancelled on Saturday alone, and more than 1,100 others were delayed, according to tracker FlightAware.\n\nIn Dallas, freezing rain pelted the city, and temperatures plummeted to 21F (-6C).\n\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire urged residents of the country’s fourth most populous city to hunker down by late Saturday: “Be where you need to be for the next 72 hours.”\n\nWarming centres were set to open on Saturday for those in need.\n\nState officials vowed that the Texas power grid was in better shape than five years ago, when it failed during a deadly winter storm and left millions without power.\n\nSnow also hit Oklahoma and Arkansas, where some spots already recorded six inches (15 centimetres) on the ground, the NWS said.\n\nAfter battering the country’s southwest and central areas, the storm system was expected to hit the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern states before a frigid air mass settles in.\n\n“The snow/sleet impacts will linger well into next week with rounds of re-freezing that keep surfaces icy and dangerous to both drive and walk on for the foreseeable future,” the weather service said.\n\nThe US federal government preemptively announced offices would be closed on Monday.\n\n“We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!” US President Donald Trump, who was riding out the storm in Washington, said on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe brutal storm system is the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air spilling across North America.\n\nScientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions of the polar vortex may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled, and natural variability plays a role.\n\nBut Trump — who scoffs at climate change science and has rolled back green energy policies — questioned how the cold front fit into broader climate shifts.\n\n“WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???” the Republican leader posted on Truth Social.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that heavy ice could cause “long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions,” including in many states less accustomed to intense winter weather.\n\nIn New York state, Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul warned residents to stay inside amid frigid conditions: “Five or six minutes outside could literally be dangerous for your health.”\n\nShe stressed precautions like protecting pipes, using heaters safely, and checking on vulnerable neighbours.\n\nProfessional and collegiate basketball games have been rescheduled as a result of the weather.\n\nAuthorities warned of life-threatening cold that could last a week post-storm, especially in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, where wind chill lows were forecast to dip to extremes under -50F (-45C).\n\nSuch temperatures can cause frostbite within minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: ice US snow Storm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Kitts PM defends policy on Haitians \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n BASSETERRE, St Kitts (CMC) – Noting that St Kitts and Nevis has one of the largest per capita Haitian populations in the Caribbean, Prime Minister Dr ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NFA CEO confident Jamaica can surpass record tilapia production \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief Executive Officer of the National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Dr Gavin Bellamy, has expressed confidence that Jamaica’s tilap... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AfroSzn hits the scene with Jamaican DJs at the helm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— As part of what organisers are describing as a bold new-year regimen for Jamaica’s nightlife, a fresh cultural experience dubbed Af... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spurs slip at Burnley increases pressure on Frank as City win \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Thomas Frank's job is under renewed threat after Tottenham dropped more points in a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened B... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sav-la-Mar Hospital on the mend: reconstruction progresses amidst overcrowding, staffing woes \n\n\n\n\n BY ANTHONY LEWIS Observer writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n SAVANNA-LA-MAR, Westmoreland – Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton is asking for patience from the public and staff of the Savanna-la-M... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Technical teams are continuing discussions. Once it’s cleared by the US Trade Representative and India’s Commerce Ministry, it would be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump for final approval.\n\nOver the last couple of months, Prime Minister Modi and President Trump have had several rounds of phone calls, during which they are believed to have discussed the contours of the proposed trade agreement. In Davos, Trump expressed confidence in a great trade deal between India and the US.\n\nOne of the first results of the long-awaited trade deal is likely to be the lifting of the 50 per cent tariff on Indian exports to the US, imposed since last summer. While many sectors, like Indian textiles, have been significantly impacted by this tariff, officials noted that overall bilateral trade between the two countries has increased by a high single digit.\n\nOfficials described a mixed picture beneath the headline numbers. Textiles and apparel have been cited as key areas under pressure, though some fabric categories recorded modest gains. Pharmaceutical exports showed a similar pattern. Overall volumes grew.\n\nAnother factor hovering over the talks is legal uncertainty in the United States. A possible Supreme Court ruling on the authority of tariff authorities is not directly shaping negotiations, officials said. But it remains a risk on the horizon.\n\nSupport for the relationship remains strong in the US Congress, officials said. Lawmakers from both parties have voiced support for closer economic ties.\n\nAt the same time, officials have acknowledged that immigration-related developments have affected business sentiment. Higher fees on certain skilled-worker visas have raised concerns among companies and professionals. While not part of the trade talks, these issues shape perceptions of the broader relationship.\n\nSources said the possibility of a US Supreme Court ruling affecting the legal basis of certain tariffs looms in the background. Such a decision could force Washington to rely on alternative statutory authorities that carry tighter limits on tariff levels and duration, potentially disrupting the political narrative around trade enforcement.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Jan 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) Indian and US officials are pushing to resolve the last few hurdles in a proposed bilateral trade agreement, with both sides close on substance but still divided on several sensitive tariff...\n\n\nThe post India, US work to clear final hurdles in bilateral trade deal talks appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2026/01/24/india-us-work-to-clear-final-hurdles-in-bilateral-trade-deal-talks/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25/202601253650155.jpg?fit=295%2C400&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1769305208","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:21:08","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.236},{"id":395791436,"title":"The Duty to Enforce the Law","text":"Stuck in traffic last fall as a “No Kings” rally in Chicago brought our car to a standstill, I listened to a familiar charge: President Donald Trump was acting like an unrestrained monarch. Many signs and chants particularly complained about his immigration policy: his detaining and deporting immigrants who had no legal right to remain in the country. But whatever one thinks of the soundness of our immigration laws, it is clear that they are, indeed, laws. What struck me was how strange it was that enforcing a duly enacted law can plausibly be confused with royal prerogative.\n\nEnforcing immigration law is not an act of political discretion on the part of a king but an obligation of a republican executive simply implementing congressional directives. Such legal restrictions may be debatable, but it is up to Congress to change them. And it is likely that some of Trump’s agents are not complying with constitutional requirements in rounding up illegal immigrants, but that would be a complaint primarily about methods, not their objectives.\n\nFar from reflecting a regal prerogative, the enforcement posture now inspiring such protests was partly a response to an earlier presidential claim of one. President Barack Obama refused to enforce a substantial part of the immigration law. First, he bestowed “lawful presence” on children who were in the country illegally and then extended these rights to their parents. Indeed, lawful presence went beyond a mere failure to enforce and granted permission to work in the country. Congress has consistently failed to pass laws incorporating these judgments despite their being proposed on many occasions. Texas v. United States indeed dismissed a challenge to the Biden administration’s deportation priorities. But the decision did not validate the Obama administration’s DACA or DAPA programs. While DACA and DAPA affirmatively conferred lawful presence and eligibility for benefits on large, predefined classes, the Biden guidance challenged in Texas largely involved prioritizing whom to arrest and remove. The Court emphasized that such prioritization reflects necessary enforcement triage discretion given resource constraints. But the majority underscored limits on discretion, warning against executive “abdication” and distinguishing non-enforcement from programs that alter legal status that were at the core of the Obama program.\n\nAs it happens, the Constitution specifically memorializes the republic’s prohibition of the prerogative of abdication. It requires that the president “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”—a direct repudiation of executive dispensing power. Thus, the Clause was designed at least in part to deny the president the so-called dispensing power by which English monarchs had sometimes claimed the authority to refuse to enforce the laws of Parliament.","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2026/01/24/the-duty-to-enforce-the-law-n3811172","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:20:00","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":395789176,"title":"Videos show altercation that leaves Minneapolis man dead","text":"Videos quickly emerged Saturday showing the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a Border Patrol agent, with Democratic leaders in Minnesota saying the footage showed the deadly encounter was the result of untrained federal officers overreacting and the Trump administration saying the man provoked the violence. \n\nIt was the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis by federal immigration authorities this month. The first, on Jan. 7, involved Renee Good. It also was captured on videos and produced a similar schism among political leaders. \n\nOn Saturday, at around 9 a.m., a Border Patrol agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti after a roughly 30-second scuffle. The Trump administration said shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti, who federal authorities said had a semiautomatic handgun and was “violently” resisting officers. \n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said he watched one of several videos, said he saw “more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents, shooting him to death.” Frey has said Minneapolis and St. Paul are being “invaded” by the administration’s largest immigration crackdown, dubbed Operation Metro Surge.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti attacked officers, and Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said he wanted to do “maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” In posts on X, President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti “a would-be assassin.”\n\nThe shooting Saturday occurred when officers were pursuing a man in the country illegally wanted for domestic assault, Bovino said. Protesters routinely try to disrupt such operations and they sounded their high-pitched whistles, honked horns and yelled out at the officers.\n\nAmong them was Pretti. At one point, in a video obtained by The Associated Press, Pretti is standing in the street and holding up his phone. He’s face-to-face with an officer in a tactical vest, who places his hand on Pretti and pushes him toward the sidewalk.\n\nPretti is talking to the officer, though it’s not clear what he is saying.\n\nThe video shows protesters wandering in and out of the street as officers persist in trying to talk them back. One protester is put in handcuffs. Some officers are carrying pepper spray cannisters.\n\nPretti comes in again when the video shows an officer wearing tactical gear shoving a protester. The protester, who is wearing a skirt over black tights and holding a water bottle, reaches out for Pretti.\n\nThe same officer shoves Pretti in his chest, leading Pretti and the other protester to stumble backwards.\n\nA different video then shows Pretti moving toward another protester, who falls over after being shoved by the same officer. Pretti moves between the protester and the officer, reaching his arms out toward the officer. The officer deploys pepper spray, and Pretti raises his hand and turns his face. The officer grabs Pretti’s hand to bring it behind his back, and deploys the pepper spray cannister again and then pushes Pretti away.\n\nSeconds later, at least a half-dozen federal officers surround Pretti, who is wrestled to the ground and hit several times. Several agents try to bring Pretti’s arms behind his back, and he struggles.\n\nAn officer who is hovering over the scuffle with his right hand on Pretti’s back in one video backs away from the group just before the first shot. In the video provided to The AP, the same officer is moving away with what appears to be a gun in his right hand. \n\nAfter about 20 seconds, the first shot is fired.\n\nVideos do not clearly show who fired the first shot. In one video, seconds before the first shot, one officer reaches for his belt and appears to draw his gun. That same officer is seen with a gun to Pretti’s back as three more shots ring out. Pretti slumps to the ground. Videos show the officers backing away, some with guns drawn. More shots are fired.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun.

What is that all about? Where are the local Police?” he wrote. “Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off?”Referring to ICE agents as “patriots”, Trump urged Americans to allow them to carry out their work and alleged widespread fraud in Minnesota. He claimed that individuals who had “stolen money from the people of Minnesota and the United States of America” would be jailed, adding that 12,000 “illegal alien criminals” had been arrested and removed from the state.“Those Fraudsters who stole the money are going to jail, where they belong,” Trump wrote. “This is no different than a really big Bank Robbery.” He accused critics of federal enforcement actions of using public outrage as “a cover-up for this theft and fraud”, concluding: “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”The comments follow the killing of a Minneapolis resident during a federal immigration enforcement operation involving ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Democratic leaders identified the victim as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse and US citizen.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the shooting occurred at about 9:05 am CT, while officers were “conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault”.According to DHS, “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun”. The department said officers attempted to disarm him, but that “the armed suspect violently resisted”.“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” DHS said. Medics provided immediate medical aid, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.DHS said the individual was carrying two magazines and no identification, adding, “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” The department said the incident remained under investigation and that further details would be released.The department also claimed that about 200 protesters arrived at the scene and attempted to obstruct and assault officers, prompting the deployment of crowd control measures “for the safety of the public and law enforcement”.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz strongly condemned the federal operation and called for it to be halted immediately.“This is sickening. The President must end this operation,” Walz wrote on X. “Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the man killed was an American citizen and a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, and confirmed that multiple federal officers were involved in the shooting.Democratic leaders across the country rejected the administration’s account and demanded accountability.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the killing as “a horrific, preventable tragedy”, accusing “lawless and masked thugs masquerading as law enforcement officers” of killing an American citizen “without justification”.“The American people deserve a thorough, independent investigation without interference or obstruction by DHS,” Jeffries said, adding that “every single federal agent responsible for the unjustified killing of another civilian must be held criminally accountable to the full extent of the law”.Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar said the shooting appeared to involve immigration enforcement agents. “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement,” she said. “I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”Omar said the incident reflected a broader pattern under the Trump administration. “This isn’t isolated or accidental,” she said. “The Trump administration is trying to beat us into submission rather than protect us.” She accused ICE and CBP of “violating constitutional rights under the guise of immigration enforcement”.House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Bennie G. Thompson said the killing “should shock all Americans”, alleging that “yet another US citizen has been killed in cold blood by ICE and CBP in Minneapolis”.He accused DHS of attempting to shape public perception, saying that “within minutes, DHS and its mass propaganda machine slandered and attacked the deceased individual with no evidence”. Thompson called for ICE and CBP to leave Minneapolis immediately and demanded the release of body-camera footage.Reaction also came from outside Minnesota. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she had learned of “yet another tragic shooting in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents” and warned that “this violence has to stop”.Bass said the president “must remove these armed, federal forces from Minneapolis and other American cities”, adding that she had joined mayors nationwide in a federal court challenge against what she described as the administration’s “unconstitutional and unlawful deployment of federal agents in the Twin Cities”.She described Operation Metro Surge as “unacceptable” and warned against allowing the federal government to “turn cities into war zones”.The killing follows the January 7 death of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was fatally shot when an ICE officer fired into her vehicle during a separate federal operation.The latest incident has further intensified national debate over the scope, tactics, and oversight of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, particularly in Democratic-led states and cities. Minnesota has seen repeated protests in recent weeks as the expanded federal presence continues, with sharply conflicting accounts from federal authorities and local officials over public safety and enforcement practices.(With IANS inputs)","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/world/trump-accuses-minnesota-leaders-of-inciting-insurrection-after-fatal-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis-3010258.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2026/01/25/1896382-mixcollage-25-jan-2026-06-40-am-4736.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:14:53","author":"Zee Media Bureau","authors":["Zee Media Bureau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":395789606,"title":"Trump Heaps Praise on UK Troops Following Furor over Afghan Comments","text":"LONDON: U.S. President Donald Trump heaped praise Saturday on British soldiers who fought in Afghanistan , in a post on social media that represented a partial reversal of comments he made this week that drew a cascade of criticism in the U.K., particularly from families of those killed and seriously injured in the conflict.

Years of mismanagement and corruption have driven production down from a peak of over 3 million bpd in the early 2000s to a historic low of 350,000 barrels daily in 2020.If adopted, the bill would roll back decades of state control over Venezuela's oil sector, which were tightened by Maduro's late mentor, socialist firebrand Hugo Chavez, in the mid-2000s.Reconciliation with oppositionUS President Donald Trump has made no secret of his interest in Venezuela's oil. His administration has stated bluntly that it is taking over sales of the country's crude petroleum.Rodriguez this week announced that the country had received an initial transfer of $300 million after the sale of its oil by the United States.She also spoke Saturday about starting a dialogue with the opposition party in Venezuela to reach a \"common good.\" \"There can be no political or partisan differences when it comes to peace in Venezuela,\" Rodriguez said on state television, speaking from the coastal state of La Guaira.\"Despite our differences, we must speak to each other with respect. Despite our differences, we must come together and reach agreements,\" she added.The hydrocarbons bill stipulates that private companies located in Venezuela would be able to exploit oil after signing contracts, a marked difference from the state's previous dominion over the country's oil exploitation.\"The main idea behind the hydrocarbons law and its reform is for us to increase oil production,\" said National Assembly president Jorge Rodriguez. \"What is the primary objective?

Get the pregnant women to the hospital immediately. Get the children checked. We are not deporting them,”he said.\n\nPrime Minister Drew said the twin island Federation has, per capita, accepted one of the largest Haitian populations in the Caribbean, providing free access to education, healthcare, and social support, often at significant cost to a small state with limited resources.\n\n“We are very accepting and progressive towards Haitians,” he said, stressing that Haiti’s exclusion from the specific agreement should not be interpreted as a rejection of the Haitian people, but rather as a reflection of capacity constraints and national security responsibilities.\n\nHe reiterated that the government remains fully committed to working through regional and international mechanisms to support Haiti’s long-term stability.\n\nDrew, who is also the chairman of the 15-member regional integration grouping of which Haiti is a member, said that under his leadership, the twin island Federation has never and will never engage in the dehumanisation or mistreatment of Haitian nationals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Caricom Dr Terrance Drew Haitian St Kitts and Nevis United States \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NFA CEO confident Jamaica can surpass record tilapia production \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Chief Executive Officer of the National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Dr Gavin Bellamy, has expressed confidence that Jamaica’s tilap... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AfroSzn hits the scene with Jamaican DJs at the helm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— As part of what organisers are describing as a bold new-year regimen for Jamaica’s nightlife, a fresh cultural experience dubbed Af... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spurs slip at Burnley increases pressure on Frank as City win \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Thomas Frank's job is under renewed threat after Tottenham dropped more points in a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened B... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sav-la-Mar Hospital on the mend: reconstruction progresses amidst overcrowding, staffing woes \n\n\n\n\n BY ANTHONY LEWIS Observer writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n SAVANNA-LA-MAR, Westmoreland – Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton is asking for patience from the public and staff of the Savanna-la-M... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died: US media \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n MINNEAPOLIS, Jamaica (AFP) — A man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died, the city's police chief told United States (US) media on Saturday -... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

In areas ranging from trade to territorial boundaries Donald Trump has made it very clear to the world that nations must adhere to Washingtons dictates; otherwise they should expect to incur penalties including economic sanctions or diplomatic consequences. Recently Trump slammed Canada over its growing engagement with China warning that Beijings influence north of the border would not going to happen and threatening a sweeping 100 per cent tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa deepens trade ties with China. However Prime Minister Mark Carney has responded to Trumps warning.\nWhat did PM Carney mean by “focus on what we can control” amid Trump’s tariff warning?\nCanadians are encouraged by Prime Minister Mark Carney to buy Canadian products to help secure the Canadian economy against global economic threats. By doing this a major change from large amounts of international trade to a larger emphasis on supporting local businesses is made.\nThis statement follows US President Donald Trumps comments that Canada should avoid making any trade agreements with China. PM Carney asserts that Canadas economy is facing threat from abroad advocating for a strategy where the country becomes its own best customer.With our economy under threat from abroad.

Keith Edwards organized the fundraiser following the fatal shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a Border Patrol agents during a federal immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis. The campaign description states that Pretti, a Minneapolis resident and American citizen, was “executed on the streets of Minneapolis by ICE agents.“ The fundraiser aims to support Pretti's loved ones with “immediate and ongoing needs,“ according to the page. The Context According to statements from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Pretti allegedly approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a handgun during what officials described as a “targeted operation.” Federal agents said he resisted violently, leading an agent to open fire. Medical responders on scene attempted lifesaving measures, but he was pronounced dead shortly afterward. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told reporters that the victim was believed to be an American citizen with no criminal history beyond traffic citations and that he legally owned a firearm. State records show Pretti had a nursing license issued in 2021, which remained active through 2026. What To Know The GoFundMe organizer stated that funds will not be distributed until next-of-kin can be verified and an appropriate family representative identified to manage the donations. If funds cannot be transferred to Pretti's family for any reason, the total amount will be directed to the Immigrant Defense Project, a nonprofit that provides litigation, advocacy, and community-defense resources to help immigrants defend their rights and fight deportation. Pretti was an intensive care unit nurse whose state nursing license remains active. Records show he attended the University of Minnesota and worked as a “junior scientist“ at the University of Minnesota Medical School starting in 2012. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed Pretti had no serious criminal history apart from parking tickets and was a “lawful gun owner“ with a permit. DHS claims Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and “violently resisted“ when officers attempted to disarm him, prompting defensive shots. However, bystander video obtained by the Associated Press shows at least seven officers surrounding Pretti before shots were fired, raising questions about the federal account of events. Federal agents stand near the site of a shooting Saturday, Jan. 24, 2026, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr) What People Are Saying Keith Edwards, GoFundMe Organizer: “On January 24, 2026, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a Minneapolis resident and American citizen was executed on the streets of Minneapolis by ICE agents. This fundraiser is intended to support the loved ones he leaves behind with immediate and ongoing needs. Because details are still unfolding, and to ensure the money goes to the right person, funds will not be distributed until we can verify next-of-kin and identify the appropriate family representative to manage anything raised.“ Adding: “If, for any reason, the funds cannot be transferred to Alex’s family, we will direct the total amount to the Immigrant Defense Project, a nonprofit that provides litigation, advocacy, and community-defense resources to help immigrants defend their rights and fight deportation.“ Minnesota Governor Tim Walz wrote on X: “I told the White House the state must lead the investigation. Let state investigators secure justice. As we process the scene, stay peaceful and give them space. The State has the personnel to keep people safe – federal agents must not obstruct our ability to do so.“ Dr. Dimitri Drekonja, Pretti's colleague, wrote on Bluesky: “Alex Pretti was a colleague at the VA. We hired him to recruit for our trial. He became an ICU nurse- I loved working with him. He was a good kind person who lived to help and these f****** executed him. White. Hot. Rage.“ Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey during a press conference on Saturday, in part: “How many times must local and national leaders must plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation and recognize that this is not creating safety in our city…We have seen these kinds of operations in other places, in other countries, but not here in America. Not in a way where a great American city is being invaded by its own federal government. I'm done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets. I'm done being told our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature.“ What Happens Next The fundraiser continues to receive donations as details about the shooting remain under investigation.","summary":"A fundraiser for Alex Jeffrey Pretti, the 37-year-old nurse fatally shot by federal agents, has raised over $160,000.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alex-pretti-gofundme-surges-past-160k-after-fatal-border-patrol-shooting-11413412","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26024832065477.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:09:12","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":395791718,"title":"Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl dress rumor debunked as new halftime show details shut down viral speculation","text":"Bad Bunny Super Bowl Halftime Show plans are coming into sharper focus as game day inches closer, and one rumor has now been put to rest. With the performance set for February 8 in Santa Clara, online chatter suggested the global star might make a bold fashion statement that would dominate headlines before he even hit the stage. That speculation traveled fast, fueled by social media and the already charged response to his selection as the headliner.Behind the scenes, however, the story looks far less dramatic. Sources tied to the production say the chatter missed the mark, shifting attention back to the music and the spectacle rather than wardrobe shock value. As anticipation builds, the conversation around Bad Bunny keeps revealing how deeply culture, politics, and pop collide on the Super Bowl stage.Bad Bunny won’t wear a dress at Super Bowl, insiders clarify amid explosive halftime show buzzDespite widespread claims, Bad Bunny will not wear a dress or gown during his Super Bowl Halftime Show. Production sources have confirmed that he is skipping any dress fitting because such an outfit was never part of the plan, according to a TMZ report. While details about his final look remain under wraps, insiders were clear that the viral rumor does not reflect reality.The news drew mixed reactions from those who had weighed in publicly. Celebrity stylist and The Real Housewives of Atlanta star Miss Lawrence had previously voiced support for the idea, saying she would welcome the choice if it carried meaning and pride. Her comments added another layer to the discussion, highlighting how fashion at the Super Bowl often becomes a symbol far beyond fabric and fit.The outfit debate unfolded alongside broader backlash aimed at the NFL for selecting Bad Bunny as the halftime performer. Conservative group Turning Point USA even pledged to stage an alternative show with English-speaking artists, framing the booking as a cultural flashpoint rather than a musical one.That criticism reached the highest levels of politics. President Donald Trump addressed the topic in an Oval Office interview with the New York Post, making his feelings clear. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said. He later explained that distance, not the performers, would keep him away from the game, adding, “It’s just too far away. I would. I’ve [gotten] great hands [at] the Super Bowl. They like me,” and, “I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter.”As kickoff approaches, criticism is expected to continue. Still, when Bad Bunny takes the stage, the spotlight will likely return to his sound, not a dress that was never there.Get the latest WPL 2026 updates including WPL teams, full WPL 2026 schedule, and live scores for Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, UP Warriorz, Gujarat Giants, and Delhi Capitals.

And I'm a big fan of marriage. I understand why people do it now. I didn't understand, coming from a broken home.\n'But marriage has actually made me the man that I am.

It was the peak of Britpop and a golden age for British Music.\n'I've worked with some of my heroes on this album; it's raw, there are more guitars and it's an album that's even more upbeat and anthemic than usual.\n'There's some 'Brit' in there and there's certainly some 'pop' too – I'm immensely proud of this as a body of work and I'm excited for fans to hear this album.'\nTake ThatRobbie WilliamsLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRobbie Williams says he has been an 'absent parent' after five months on tour as he pays tribute to wife Ayda for 'making him a man'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Forecasters said snow, sleet and freezing rain, accompanied by dangerously frigid temperatures, would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into next ⁠week. Calling the storms \"historic,\" President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia. \"We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said. \"We ‌do have tens ​of thousands of people in affected states in the South that have lost power. We have utility crews that are ‍working to restore that as quick as possible,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said late on Saturday. The number of power outages continued to rise. More than 130,000 customers had lost electricity, the bulk of them in Texas and Louisiana, according to PowerOutage.com. The US National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that will bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the southeast US and cited \"crippling to locally catastrophic impacts\". Weather ​service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into ‌the Great Plains region of the US by Monday. More than 4000 US flights scheduled for Saturday had been cancelled, according to flight tracking website ​FlightAware. More than 9000 US flights originally set for Sunday also have been cancelled, the website indicated. Major US airlines warned passengers to ‍stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations. In an update on its website on Saturday. The airline said it was relocating ​experts from cold weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at ​several southern airports. JetBlue said as of Saturday morning it had cancelled about 1000 flights through Monday, with additional cancellations possible, as it was \"closely monitoring\" forecasts for the storm. US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts. Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centres in the world, said if its ice forecast holds, it could be among the largest-ever winter events to affect the utility's operations. Noem warned Americans to take precautions. \"It's going to be very, very cold,\" Noem said. \"So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, ‍stock up on food, and we will get through this together.\" Australian Associated Press","url":"https://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/9160170/us-storm-leads-to-power-outages-flight-cancellations/","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/9f1b8e8c-e966-453d-bb7f-38ce26f49b48.jpg/r0_0_800_600_w800_h600_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:05:05","author":"Phil Stewart And Lewis Krauskopf","authors":["Phil Stewart And Lewis Krauskopf"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":395786860,"title":"Who was Alex Pretti? Minneapolis nurse shot dead dead by ICE &#8211; All we know","text":"37-year-old Alex Pretti has been identified as the person who was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis on Saturday (US time). It marks the third overall shooting incident involving federal authorities this month alone, and second fatal shooting after Renee Nicole Good was shot dead in the state of Minnesota weeks ago. As the major ICE crackdown continues in the city of Minneapolis, videos circulating online have once again raised starkly contrasting accounts of federal officials. Even as the United States braces for a brutal winter storm, the streets of the Whittier neighbourhood in Minneapolis were jammed with traffic as over a thousand protesters gathered in Whittier Park to hold a vigil for the man killed by ICE agents, as per details relayed by the New York Times. Who was Alex Pretti? A senior law enforcement official familiar with the investigation revealed that the man fatally shot in Minneapolis on Saturday was Alex Jeffrey Pretti, according to the NYT. He was an American citizen, born in Illinois, and a registered nurse who worked in the intensive-care unit (ICU) at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Minneapolis. ALSO READWas 5-year-old Liam Ramos ‘used as bait’? ICE reveals why Minnesota boy was detained Pretti had no criminal record. He live in a Minneapolis apartment, which was a short drive away from where he was killed. According to the Associated Press, the 37-year-old nurse had even worked for the US Department of Veteran Affairs. His family members have since shared with the US news outlet that Pretti had become an avid participant of Minneapolis protests amid the ongoing ICE crackdown especially after the Jan 7 killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer. Having grown up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Alex Pretti had been a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir, as per the AP. He played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. Following his graduation, he completed his bachelor’s degree in biology, society and the environment at the University of Minnesota in 2011. Before returning to school to become a registered nurse, he worked as a research scientist. Another angle of federal agents killing a Minnesota legal observer, which appears to come from the direction of the woman in pink filming from the sidewalk.Obtained by Drop Site News pic.twitter.com/IT56ftPkYP— Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) January 24, 2026 Minneapolis ICE shooting: What happened? As per the account shared online by the Department of Homeland Security, the now-deceased man was shot after he \"approached\" Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun when they were \"conducting a targeted operation. against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault.\" As far as the DHS' tweet goes, Pretti was armed at the time of the altercation and federal officer attempted to disarm him but he \"violently resisted.\" \"Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,\" the DHS added in the X post. \"The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\" Meanwhile, the video of the incident circulating online appears to show the ICU nurse attempting to help a woman who had been pepper-sprayed. As the chaotic scenes unfolded, agents can be seen wrestling Pretti and pulling him away. At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault, an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here.

Multiple shots of gunfire were ultimately heard on the scene, as per the video. The fatally shot man, now ID'd as Alex Pretti, was eventually spotted lying on the ground lifeless. Did Alex Pretti use a gun against ICE? Although DHS' post on X seemingly insists that Pretti brandished the gun at the time of the altercation, bystander videos emerging online paint a different picture. As per the clips going around, the Minneapolis man was seen with a phone in his hand at the scene. The videos don't appear to show him wielding a visible weapon. His family members revealed that Pretti had owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota, according to the AP. As per their account, they had never known him to carry the weapon.

So, a lot of farmers came out of the business at that time,” Bellamy explained.\n\nHe highlighted that a number of new farmers have since joined the industry, but the agency is encouraging others to also come on board, as there are many opportunities for growth and financial development.\n\nBellamy shared that the NFA and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining have identified avenues to replenish the tilapia stock and surpass the 2007 output.\n\n“First of all, to increase the stock, we need more fry production, we need better husbandry practices, we need more access to water in certain areas and definitely the National Fisheries Authority, is doing the extension work, encouraging the farmers both on the business side, [and] the management side, and getting us all on the same page [to] developing a sustainable industry,” Bellamy outlined.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of a marketing plan that the NFA has undertaken to ensure that farmers are able to reap the profits of their labour.\n\nBellamy emphasised that the farmers’ consultation is a vital forum for identifying the specific resources and support farmers need to match and eventually exceed 2007 production levels.\n\nChief Executive Officer of the National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Dr. Gavin Bellamy delivers remarks at the National Tilapia Farmers’ Consultation held on Thursday (January 22) at the Caymanas Golf and Polo Resort in St. Catherine.\n(Photo: Dave Reid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: farming National Fisheries Authority tilapia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n AfroSzn hits the scene with Jamaican DJs at the helm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica— As part of what organisers are describing as a bold new-year regimen for Jamaica’s nightlife, a fresh cultural experience dubbed Af... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spurs slip at Burnley increases pressure on Frank as City win \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Thomas Frank's job is under renewed threat after Tottenham dropped more points in a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened B... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sav-la-Mar Hospital on the mend: reconstruction progresses amidst overcrowding, staffing woes \n\n\n\n\n BY ANTHONY LEWIS Observer writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n SAVANNA-LA-MAR, Westmoreland – Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton is asking for patience from the public and staff of the Savanna-la-M... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died: US media \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n MINNEAPOLIS, Jamaica (AFP) — A man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died, the city's police chief told United States (US) media on Saturday -... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Funeral of late journalist Donald Oliver ongoing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Members of the media fraternity and loved ones are currently gathered at the Mona Chapel of the University of the West Indies (UWI... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Saturday's showing was the first time the president, her family and close friends saw the film in full, said Marc Beckman, the first lady’s outside adviser and agent.The film offers rare behind-the-scenes access to the first lady, who has kept a low public profile during her husband’s second term. The trailer opens on Inauguration Day in January 2025, showing her donning a navy wide-brimmed hat for the ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. It also depicts her role as an adviser to the president, including a moment in which she encourages him to emphasize “peacemaker and unifier” in his inaugural address.Saturday's East Room screening followed the president's tariff threat to Canada, defense of federal agents after a fatal shooting in Minnesota, and preparation for a winter storm barreling through the southern U.S.About 70 people across the cultural spectrum attended, including former professional boxer Mike Tyson and Jordan's Queen Rania, who is featured in the film's trailer, a person familiar with the event said.Other attendees included Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon MGM Studios head Mike Hopkins, and film director Brett Ratner, as well as Larry Culp, the CEO of General Electric.Beckman, who produced the film, oversaw the $40 million movie deal with Amazon MGM Studios, plus a follow-up documentary series set for release later this year focusing on some of Melania Trump's priorities, including children in foster care.PREMIERE THIS WEEK\"This is not a political film at all,\" Beckman said in an interview this week, adding that the first lady spearheaded the film's creative direction.The movie highlights her fashion choices, diplomatic engagements and the operations surrounding her Secret Service protection. Beckman said viewers also will see moments that capture the president's sense of humor.Ahead of the public theatrical release of the film next week, the president and first lady will attend a premiere on Thursday at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by the Trump-appointed board of directors.The first lady is also scheduled to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday to promote the film.

JPMorgan notified Trump of the closures about a month after his supporters stormed the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump said the bank’s motivation was political and that JPMorgan violated Florida law barring unfair trade practices and acted in bad faith.\n\nTrump also accused Dimon of ordering a malicious “blacklist” to warn other banks about doing business with the Trump Organization, Trump family members and Trump himself. Trump said the publication of this blacklist amounted to trade libel under Florida law and said his businesses suffered considerable financial and reputational harm as a result. The suit comes after Dimon criticized Trump’s immigration policies and proposal to cap interest rates that banks charge on credit cards.\n\nJPMorgan denied wrongdoing, said the lawsuit had no merit and that it closes accounts that create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\n\nThe case will likely boil down to whether Trump’s legal team can prove the bank canceled the accounts because of his political viewpoints. Terms of banking agreements tend to strongly favor the banks, which do not need to provide a reason for closing an account and customers often don’t know why their accounts are terminated.\n\nIn this case, Trump said JPMorgan gave a 60-day notice of the account closure but did not provide a reason.\n\nBanks must monitor their customers for a variety of potential risks, and a customer who had an account closed because of banned activity such as money laundering would have no grounds to challenge it.\n\nHowever, some reasons for terminating an account might be considered an unfair trade practice or bad faith, including closing an account due to a customer’s religion or ethnicity.\n\nLegal experts said canceling an account because of an accountholder’s political viewpoint, which JPMorgan said it does not do, would likely be impermissible. However, it might be legal if an accountholder’s views were so extreme they undermined trust in the bank. Trump could argue that his political views were mainstream as he had just amassed more than 70 million votes in losing the November 2020 election.\n\nTrump’s trade libel claim stems from the allegation of a blacklist. Trump claims the JPMorgan blacklist is reserved for clients that have engaged in malfeasance or other actions worthy of having their accounts closed. Trump said his business accounts were in good standing prior to being added to the list. In February 2024, nearly three years after the accounts were closed, a New York state judge found Trump and his businesses liable for civil fraud, in a case brought by the state’s attorney general. A state appeals court later threw out a half-billion dollar penalty against Trump without completely overturning the fraud finding. Both sides appealed.\n\nLegal experts said trade libel claims usually involve a defendant accused of disparaging a plaintiff’s product to gain a competitive edge — an aspect that is lacking from the Trump allegations. The claim will depend on the existence a blacklist and whether JPMorgan made disparaging statements to other banks about Trump and his businesses that were false.\n\nThe case was filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County. JPMorgan could try to move the case to federal court, which is often the preferred venue for corporate defendants. Unlike Florida trial court judges, who are generally elected, federal judges are appointed for life. Capital One is defending a similar case by Trump businesses, which it had moved to federal court.\n\nJPMorgan will likely try to have the lawsuit quickly dismissed by arguing the allegations are too speculative to sustain a case. If Trump can get past this stage, it clears the way to take discovery and demand documents and access to witnesses inside the bank.\n\nIf JPMorgan, which is heavily regulated by the federal government, cannot get the case dismissed, it will be under pressure to settle before a trial. Trump is seeking USD5 billion, but damages would depend on the disruption caused to Trump’s businesses in moving to another financial institution. The president has said the account closures forced him to go to “small banks all over the place.” Trump has sued several media businesses in his personal capacity since he returned to the White House and two of those cases quickly settled, while others continue to be litigated.","summary":"US President Donald Trump filed a USD5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon on Thursday for closing his accounts allegedly for political reasons.\n\n\nHere is a look at Trump’s claims and how the case could play out:\n\n\nThe largest US bank closed accounts of several Trump businesses in April 2021 after they had been customers for decades, according to Trump’s lawsuit.

The shooting took place amid ongoing federal immigration operations in Minnesota involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the incident occurred at about 9:05 am CT, while officers were conducting what it described as a “targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault”.According to DHS, “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun”. The department said officers attempted to disarm him, but alleged that “the armed suspect violently resisted”.“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” DHS said. It added that medics at the scene provided medical assistance, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.DHS further claimed the individual was carrying two magazines and no identification, adding: “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” The department said the situation remained under investigation and that further details were expected.The department also said that approximately 200 protesters arrived at the scene following the shooting, accusing some of obstructing and assaulting officers. “Crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement,” DHS said.However, Democratic leaders strongly disputed the federal government’s account and condemned the shooting.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries described the incident as “a horrific, preventable tragedy”, accusing “lawless and masked thugs masquerading as law enforcement officers” of killing an American citizen “without justification”.“The American people deserve a thorough, independent investigation without interference or obstruction by DHS,” Jeffries said, adding that “every single federal agent responsible for the unjustified killing of another civilian must be held criminally accountable to the full extent of the law”.Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar said the killing followed reports that immigration enforcement agents were involved. “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement,” she said. “I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”Omar argued the incident reflected a broader pattern, saying: “This isn’t isolated or accidental. The Trump administration is trying to beat us into submission rather than protect us.” She accused ICE and CBP of “violating constitutional rights under the guise of immigration enforcement”.House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson said the killing “should shock all Americans”, claiming that “yet another US citizen has been killed in cold blood by ICE and CBP in Minneapolis”.Thompson accused DHS of attempting to shape public perception, alleging that “within minutes, DHS and its mass propaganda machine slandered and attacked the deceased individual with no evidence”. He called for ICE and CBP to leave Minneapolis immediately and demanded the release of body-camera footage.President Donald Trump defended federal immigration agents in a social media post, questioned the role of local police and accused Minnesota officials of misconduct. He said ICE agents were operating because of “massive monetary fraud, with billions of dollars missing”, adding: “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”Reaction extended beyond Minnesota. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she was informed of “yet another tragic shooting in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents” and warned that “this violence has to stop”.Bass said the president “must remove these armed, federal forces from Minneapolis and other American cities”, adding that she had joined mayors across the country in a federal court challenge against what she described as the administration’s “unconstitutional and unlawful deployment of federal agents in the Twin Cities”.She criticised Operation Metro Surge as “unacceptable” and warned against allowing the federal government to “turn cities into war zones”.The killing has intensified the national debate over the scope, tactics, and oversight of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, particularly in Democratic-led states and cities. Minnesota has witnessed repeated protests in recent weeks as the expanded federal presence continues, with local officials and federal authorities offering sharply conflicting accounts of enforcement actions and public safety.(With agencies inputs)","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/world/us-federal-agents-kill-minneapolis-man-amid-immigration-raids-protests-intensify-3010257.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2026/01/25/1896381-mixcollage-25-jan-2026-06-36-am-182.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 01:00:44","author":"Zee Media Bureau","authors":["Zee Media Bureau"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":395789698,"title":"Venezuela eyes 2026 oil boost, interim leader calls for opposition talks","text":"The country's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, proposed the legislative reforms last week and it passed a first reading Thursday in parliament, which is headed by her brother.\n\nAnalysts say the reforms, expected to pass next week, were drafted under pressure from Washington after the US military raid that toppled president Nicolas Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"We had a law...that was not up to date with what we needed as an industry,\" PDVSA chief Hector Obregon said.\n\nThe proposed Hydrocarbons Law reforms would update the legal framework in the oil industry \"to ensure that private investors can have legal certainty,\" Obregon said from the Puerto La Cruz refinery in eastern Venezuela.\n\nThe South American nation produces around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), according to authorities, and sits on about one-fifth of the world's oil reserves.\n\nYears of mismanagement and corruption have driven production down from a peak of over 3 million bpd in the early 2000s to a historic low of 350,000 barrels daily in 2020.\n\nIf adopted, the bill would roll back decades of state control over Venezuela's oil sector, which were tightened by Maduro's late mentor, socialist firebrand Hugo Chavez, in the mid-2000s.\n\nReconciliation with opposition\n\nUS President Donald Trump has made no secret of his interest in Venezuela's oil.

The incident came after the January 7 killing of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was fatally shot when an ICE officer fired into her vehicle during a separate federal operation amid the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown.\nWalz, a Democrat, condemned the federal actions and called for an immediate halt to the operations.\n“This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now,” Walz wrote on X.\nPolice chief confirms details of latest shooting\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the latest victim was an American citizen and a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. He confirmed that multiple federal officers were involved in the shooting.\nThe incident has intensified tensions between state officials and the Trump administration as federal immigration enforcement expands in Minnesota, drawing sharp criticism from local leaders and renewed political backlash from the White House.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/inciting-insurrection-trump-blasts-minnesota-leaders-after-fatal-ice-shooting-in-minneapolis-13972227.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2026/01/AP26021742859175-2026-01-e9707706906c897c5834abc5ba1dd0d1-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:59:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":395789432,"title":"'Focus on what we can control,' says Canadian PM Carney after Trump threatens 100% tariffs","text":"ANI\"Focus on what we can control,\" says Canadian PM Carney after Trump threatens 100% tariffs\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney is urging Canadians to \"Buy Canadian\" to protect the country's economy from global economic threats.

The incident occurred amid ongoing federal immigration operations in Minnesota involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security said the shooting occurred at about “9:05 AM CT,” when its officers were “conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault.”\n\nDHS said that “an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.” According to the statement, “the officers attempted to disarm the suspect, but the armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” DHS said. It added that “medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene.”\n\nDHS said the individual “also had 2 magazines and no ID,” adding, “this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” The department said the situation was still unfolding and that “more details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.”\n\nThe department also said that “about 200 rioters arrived at the scene and began to obstruct and assault law enforcement,” adding that “crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended federal immigration agents in a social media post, questioned the role of local police, and accused Minnesota officials of misconduct. He said ICE agents were operating because of “massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing,” and added, “LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB!”\n\nDemocratic leaders disputed the administration’s account and sharply criticized the federal response.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said “lawless and masked thugs masquerading as law enforcement officers brutally killed another American citizen on the streets of Minneapolis without justification.” He described the death of VA nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti as “a horrific, preventable tragedy.”\n\nJeffries called for accountability, saying the American people “deserve a thorough, independent investigation without interference or obstruction by DHS.” He added that “every single federal agent responsible for the unjustified killing of another civilian must be held criminally accountable to the full extent of the law.”\n\nMinnesota Representative Ilhan Omar said the incident followed reports that immigration enforcement agents were involved. “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement,” she said. “I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”\n\nOmar said the incident was part of a broader pattern. “This isn’t isolated or accidental,” she said, adding that “the Trump administration is trying to beat us into submission rather than protect us.” She said ICE and CBP were “violating constitutional rights under the guise of immigration enforcement.”\n\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson said, “Yet another US citizen has been killed in cold blood by ICE and CBP in Minneapolis for exercising his First Amendment rights.” He said the killing “should shock all Americans.”\n\nThompson accused DHS of attempting to shape public perception, saying that “within minutes … DHS and its mass propaganda machine slandered and attacked the deceased individual with no evidence.” He demanded that “ICE and CBP must leave Minneapolis at once” and called for the immediate release of body-camera footage.\n\nReaction extended beyond Minnesota. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she learned of “yet another tragic shooting in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents” and said “this violence has to stop.” She said the president “must remove these armed, federal forces from Minneapolis and other American cities.”\n\nBass said she had joined mayors nationwide in a federal court action challenging what she described as the administration’s “unconstitutional and unlawful deployment of federal agents in the Twin Cities.” She called Operation Metro Surge “unacceptable” and warned against allowing the federal government to “turn [cities] into war zones.”\n\nThe killing has intensified national debate over the scope, tactics, and oversight of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, particularly in Democratic-ledalaed the states and cities. Minnesota has seen repeated protests in recent weeks amid the expanded federal presence, with local officials and federal authorities offering sharply conflicting accounts of enforcement actions and public safety.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Jan 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) A Minneapolis resident was shot and killed during a federal immigration enforcement operation, which has escalated the already tense situation between the Trump Administration and the Minnesota State Government, along with...\n\n\nThe post Minneapolis shooting by federal agents draws scrutiny appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2026/01/24/minneapolis-shooting-by-federal-agents-draws-scrutiny/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25/202601253650153.jpg?fit=900%2C600&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1769304039","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:57:15","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":395787582,"title":"A Tale of Two Economies Is Reshaping China’s Stock Market","text":"A tale of two economies is driving China’s stock market, prompting investors to raise bets on the beneficiaries of an industrial export boom at the expense of firms mired in a consumption slump.The world’s No. 2 economy is painting a picture of consumer-sensitive sectors lagging further behind industries linked to manufacturing and technology. That’s making Wall Street firms including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Asset Management more bullish toward Chinese companies from machinery producers to power grid builders. These Chinese firms have thrived on the world’s appetite for advanced manufacturing or surging demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. China’s economy has grown more bifurcated in the past year. New industrial forces have helped deliver surprisingly robust exports that defied President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile, domestic consumption remains anemic amid a prolonged property downturn. For investors, that split is reshaping their strategies, rewarding selective bets on global-facing industrial champions rather than those on a broad consumer-led recovery.“There are clearly two very different Chinas at the moment,” William Bratton, head of cash equity research in Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Exane, wrote in a note. “We have a clear preference for the materials, industrials, and technology sectors and sub-industries over their consumer-facing peers – a preference which is reflected in earnings trends and the recent economic data.”Much of China’s export strength is being driven by equipment makers, electronic component manufacturers and metal miners that are tied to global demand for AI infrastructure. China XD Electric Co., a key contractor of ultra-high-voltage grid construction, has surged 75% this year, while electrical component-maker TBEA Co. is up about 28%.Morgan Stanley was the latest to join the chorus of bullish calls, favoring a group of stocks that included Sany Heavy Industry Co., Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic Co., Han’s Laser Technology Industry Group Co. and Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipment Co.“Construction machinery is entering an improvement cycle, with the domestic recovery continuing along with overseas demand,” the bank’s analysts including Sheng Zhong wrote in a note, citing “decent growth momentum” for exports.In contrast, consumer stocks have lagged. Shares of Fuyao Glass Industry Group Co. are down 5.4% this year, while those of Great Wall Motor Co. have fallen 4.6%.“Recent conversations with investors indicate that institutional investors remain cautious about domestic recovery, focusing instead on the earnings growth potential of the ‘going global’ theme,” Chaoping Zhu, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, wrote in a note. “Policymakers are emphasizing advanced manufacturing and technology as new growth drivers, with the stock market playing a key role in supporting capital formation and household wealth allocation,” Zhu added. To be sure, the outlook of Chinese industrials firms may turn sour if they face stronger pushbacks from countries worried about an influx of cheap goods. Meanwhile, as Beijing lists reviving consumption as its top policy task this year, some observers argue that the sector’s valuations may be attractive enough for bargain hunters.For now, the momentum of the two-speed economy appears intact: Earnings forecasts for the CSI 300 Industrials Index have climbed 10% over the past six months, compared with just a 5% increase for its consumer peer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“I think industrials outperformance will continue because that’s where there’s a lot of structural growth that is happening,” said Min Lan Tan, head of the Asia Pacific chief investment office at UBS Group AG. “Nobody can afford to really step back from this AI race, so we think that will continue to drive the industrial sector.”With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/a-tale-of-two-economies-is-reshaping-china-s-stock-market-11769302576496.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/market_2_1733466021722_1733466033367.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:56:16","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.273},{"id":395791660,"title":"World News | Saud Bin Saqr Attends UAE National Orchestra Concert in Ras Al Khaimah","text":"Ras Al Khaimah [UAE] January 25 (ANI/WAM): Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, attended a concert by the UAE National Orchestra held at the Ras Al Khaimah Cultural Center,, affiliated with the Ministry of Culture, under the title \"The Beginning\".\nThe event was attended by Sheikh Salem bin Khalid Al Qasimi, Minister of Culture, Sheikh Fahim bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Sheikh Khalid bin Saqr Al Qasimi, and Sheikha Alya bint Khalid Al Qasimi, Director General of the UAE National Orchestra, alongside senior officials, music and arts enthusiasts, and members of the community.\nAlso Read | Why Are There No Penguins in Greenland?.\nSheikh Saud said the concert reflects the depth of Emirati culture and its rich creative heritage, noting that music and the arts play a vital role in preserving national identity and strengthening its presence within society.\nHe highlighted the UAE National Orchestra as a valuable addition to the country's cultural landscape, bringing orchestral music closer to audiences, showcasing Emirati identity through contemporary artistic forms, and contributing to the development of talent and professional performance standards.\nAlso Read | A Penguin in Greenland?

In an interview to Politico, Bessent said, “We put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and the Indian purchases by their refineries of Russian oil have collapsed. So, that is a success. The 25 per cent Russian oil tariffs are still on. I would imagine that there is a path to take them off,” he said.

According to him, before the Ukraine invasion, approximately 2-3 per cent of Indian oil that went into its refineries came from Russia. “The oil was sanctioned, it got deeply discounted, and it moved up into the high teens – 17, 18, 19 per cent – being refined. Huge profit for refiners,” he said, adding it was the Europeans who were buying the refined products and financing the war against themselves. Bessent’s comments came in the backdrop of European countries standing up to US President Donald Trump’s demand for Greenland, and EU President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa being invited as chief guests by New Delhi on the occasion of India’s Republic Day on January 26. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has already landed in Delhi. Earlier this week on Tuesday, she had referred to the imminent EU-India Free Trade Agreement as the “mother of all deals”. The two were on the cusp of signing a trade deal, giving the 27-member bloc a “first mover advantage”. In an exclusive interview to The Indian Express on Friday, Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission, said the agreement is a “strategic choice” and provides a chance to reduce reliance on China, Russia and US.

Kennedy Jr. said the withdrawal was carried out through an executive order signed by President Donald Trump and was aimed at freeing the United States from what they described as the organization’s constraints.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Geneva, Jan 25 (SocialNews.XYZ) The World Health Organization (WHO) chief said that the reasons given by the United States for its decision to withdraw from the WHO are \"untrue.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, made...\n\n\nThe post WHO chief says US reasons for withdrawal &#8216;untrue&#8217; appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2026/01/24/who-chief-says-us-reasons-for-withdrawal-untrue/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25/202601253650151.jpg?fit=1600%2C1066&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1769303409","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:48:37","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":395791276,"title":"Trump Claims He Prevented Major India-Pakistan Conflict Amid Disputes","text":"In a recent statement, former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed to have intervened in a potentially catastrophic conflict between India and Pakistan. The assertion came during his remarks at a political event, where Trump suggested his involvement thwarted a severe escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations.\n\nTrump’s Claim on Preventing a Nuclear Escalation\n\nAccording to Trump, the tensions between India and Pakistan had reached a dangerous level during his presidency, with the two countries on the brink of a large-scale conflict. The former president stated that it was his diplomatic efforts that prevented the situation from spiraling out of control. His comments have reignited discussions on his administration’s foreign policy maneuvers and their implications for global peace.\n\nTrump’s narrative places emphasis on his personal role in diffusing the tension, suggesting that his actions were pivotal in steering both nations away from a possible nuclear confrontation. However, specifics on how this intervention was carried out remain vague, leaving political analysts and international affairs specialists questioning the exact nature of his involvement.\n\nHistorical Context of India-Pakistan Relations\n\nThe relationship between India and Pakistan has been fraught with conflict since the two nations gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947. The core issues revolve around territorial disputes, particularly over the Kashmir region, and have led to several wars and ongoing skirmishes at the borders. The presence of nuclear weapons in both countries has further complicated matters, making the stakes considerably high.\n\nOver the years, both nations have engaged in diplomatic negotiations and treaties to mitigate these tensions but with limited success. The historical animosity, combined with domestic political pressures and regional dynamics, frequently propels the two countries into conflict territory. Thus, any potential de-escalation narrative, like the one Trump proposed, sparks interest concerning its legitimacy and the lasting impact of such interventions.\n\nReactions and Speculations\n\nReactions to Trump’s claims have been mixed, with some viewing his remarks as self-aggrandizing while others consider them plausible given the former administration’s focus on international relations. Experts are divided over the potential truth behind his declarations. On one hand, some suggest that there may be elements of truth, citing undisclosed diplomatic channels that were active during his term. On the other, skeptics highlight the lack of concrete evidence supporting his statements.\n\nThe governments of India and Pakistan have yet to officially comment on Trump’s assertions, which adds another layer of complexity to the narrative. Without confirmation or denial from these key stakeholders, the public is left to speculate about the potential involvement of other international actors, such as the United Nations or influential countries within the geopolitical landscape.\n\nIn the landscape of media and punditry, Trump’s statements have triggered debates regarding the nature and effectiveness of secret diplomatic engagements, particularly those that involve high-stakes situations like potential nuclear conflicts. This is a reminder of the delicate balance world leaders must maintain between public transparency and national security interests.\n\nAs discussions continue, attention may turn towards uncovering more detailed accounts of events during that period. Analysts and historians will likely delve into records, seeking to verify the accuracy of Trump’s assertions or unearth further revelations about the diplomatic strategies employed to maintain peace.\n\nWhile the claims themselves remain subject to scrutiny, they underscore the precariousness of international relationships and the continuous efforts required to foster peace between nations with a complex history like India and Pakistan. As the story develops, further insights and confirmations may shape public understanding of these allegedly critical interventions.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump recently claimed he averted a near-catastrophic conflict between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan during his time in office. Speaking at a political event, Trump suggested his diplomatic efforts played a key role in preventing a major escalation, though he offered few details. The bold assertion has sparked fresh debate over his administration’s foreign policy and raised questions among analysts and observers about the accuracy and impact of his claimed intervention. With no official response from India or Pakistan, and limited evidence to support Trump’s remarks, the story has reignited interest in behind-the-scenes diplomacy and the fragile balance of global security.","url":"https://www.czechjournal.cz/trump-claims-he-prevented-major-india-pakistan-conflict-amid-disputes/","image":"https://www.czechjournal.cz/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-Claims-He-Prevented-Major-India-Pakistan-Conflict-Amid-Disputes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:47:10","author":"Kristina Vankova","authors":["Kristina Vankova"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cz","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":395789662,"title":"Brooklyn Beckham's ex Afton McKeith claims he was 'telling the truth' in his bombshell statement as she says he struggled with anxiety and found it 'hard' growing up in the spotlight","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jan 25th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti identified as victim of Minneapolis shooting as furious friends say 'good, kind' man was 'executed'\n\nStarmer is cornered: As Andy Burnham throws his hat into the ring for a plum Labour seat, the beleaguered Prime Minister faces a stark choice - block him or face a leadership challenge\n\nHow 81 seats could torpedo the chances of the 'Loony Left' seizing power: Study reveals pact between Conservatives and Reform could win scores of constituencies the Right would otherwise lose\n\nMy Corrie hell... and the cruel jibe from my co-star that left me sobbing and broken: HELEN FLANAGAN reveals the pill addiction that nearly ruined her life - and the childhood episode that started it all\n\nPETER HITCHENS: Huge remote police forces don't serve the public - they just obey Whitehall Leftists\n\nHow Labour's civil war meltdown unfolded: Andy Burnham finally makes his move after months of unsubtle manoeuvering as supporters say it's 'game on' for the Labour leadership\n\nThe man who duped an entire Greek island (and even his own wife) into believing he was Manchester United icon Remi Moses\n\nDeeply cynical whispers about timing of Katie Price's engagement, the suspected 'horrible' impulse behind it, wild background of fiance... and why she's 'unlikely' to make it down the aisle revealed\n\nWhy Brooklyn denouncing his parents' greed and self-obsession was inevitable, by Beckham biographer TOM BOWER - who now reveals the unsavoury hidden drama that led to meltdown... and what happened with ex Hana Cross\n\nNHS gets midwives to fill in 'farcical' forms with no option to record biological sex and instead ask parents what their newborn baby's 'gender identity' is\n\nThe Masked Singer leaves fans shocked as Arctic Fox and Monkey Business are revealed as a noughties star and Strictly legend in double elimination twist\n\nI travelled to Michael Schumacher's Majorca mansion - this is the heartbreaking news I learned about wheelchair-bound F1 legend's physical state, the fake stories around his daughter's wedding and the inner circle allowed to visit him\n\nFate of the 51 boys reprieved from Auschwitz's gas chamber after being sentenced to death by Josef Mengele: Their extraordinary story is told for first time in MICHAEL CALVIN's new book.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JESSICA JANES, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:40 GMT, 25 January 2026 |Updated:00:46 GMT, 25 January 2026 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex Afton McKeith has claimed he was 'telling the truth' in his recent bombshell statement, in which he launched an astonishing attack on his famous parents.\nThe actress, 25, who previously said she dated the son of Victoria and David Beckham when they were younger, revealed that Brooklyn, 26, struggled with life in the spotlight as his childhood became entwined with the Beckham family empire. \nTaking his side in the ongoing family feud, she told The Sun: 'A lot has gone on over the years. This has not just happened suddenly. \nShe added: 'Brooklyn was telling the truth in his post. It was hard for him growing up.\n'There are two sides to every story, but I know growing up in the spotlight was challenging for him.' \nThe daughter of Scottish TV personality Gillian McKeith went on to claim Brooklyn suffered from anxiety and felt the world was 'constantly waiting for him to muck up'.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's ex Afton McKeith has claimed he was 'telling the truth' in his recent bombshell statement, in which he launched an astonishing attack on his famous parents (pictured with her mother Gillian in 2023)\n\nThe actress, 25, who previously said she dated the son of Victoria and David Beckham when they were younger, revealed that Brooklyn, 26, (seen) struggled with life in the spotlight as his childhood became entwined with the Beckham family empire \nStanding up for him, Afton said she believes his parents 'could have protected him more' and should have considered the 'impact' of the Beckham public brand. \nDespite this, she admitted Brooklyn inevitably found himself in the spotlight, revealing he would often become 'upset' when having his picture taken and frequently required security. \nShe claimed he never got angry, insisting he doesn't have that type of personality, but said he was often 'frantic' and 'anxious'.\nElsewhere in the interview, Afton said Brooklyn struggled with his parents frequently being away from home and, despite having nannies and his siblings around, he felt 'isolated'. \nSince Brooklyn shared his scathing statement, rumours have circulated that his wife Nicola Peltz, 31, wrote the post on his behalf. \nHowever, dismissing the speculation, Afton claimed Brooklyn wrote it himself, describing him as intelligent and claiming he has 'had enough'.\nDaily Mail has contacted Brooklyn and Afton's representatives for comment. \nAfton's interview comes after aspiring chef Brooklyn published a scathing six-page statement about his family, where he said he has no interest in reconciling with them, including dad David.\n\nTaking his side in the ongoing family feud, she told The Sun: 'A lot has gone on over the years. This has not just happened suddenly. Brooklyn was telling the truth in his post. It was hard for him growing up,' (pictured 2023)\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Afton insisted Brooklyn wrote the statement himself, describing him as intelligent and claiming he has 'had enough', after rumours circulated that his wife wrote the post on his behalf (pictured with his wife Nicola 2025)\n\n Brooklyn Beckham capitalises on frenzy surrounding family feud as he promotes his hot sauce inspired by father David after bombshell statement \nDespite once proudly declaring he was a 'mama's boy', Brooklyn focused on Victoria in the statement, with his vitriolic comments reportedly leaving her 'on the floor in pieces'.\nAmong Brooklyn's long list of claims was the accusation that his mum 'hijacked' his first dance at his wedding and 'danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone', before accusing his parents of trying to ruin his relationship. \nNow, five days on from the statement, a clip of another viral moment between Brooklyn's wife Nicola and his mother Victoria from October 2022 during Paris Fashion Week has been doing the rounds on TikTok. \nIt shows Nicola speaking to a blonde woman at an event while Brooklyn's younger sister Harper stands nearby. \nNicola stands with her back to Brooklyn and Victoria to have her conversation, while Victoria appears to awkwardly hang around behind her and struggles to be brought into the conversation.\nSharing the clip, one TikTok user claimed: 'Leaked footage from 2022 of the Beckhams, Victoria is not the problem…'\nUnder the video, fans gave their divided opinions as some claimed: 'Even when talking to someone you turn and at least say hello and excuse yourself and say you're talking to a friend and won't be long.'.\n'Having a conversation that didn't include queen Victoria? How dare she?',\n\nAll episodes\n\nBrooklyn is now estranged from his entire family - and he says he has no wishes to reconcile (pictured L-R: Cruz, Harper, Romeo, Victoria and David Beckham)\n'I never heard anything good about Nicola.'\nOthers leapt to Nicola's defence however, as they penned: 'She's talking to someone she's not being rude.',\n'If she's talking to someone what's the problem.',\n'What are you taking about… she’s having a conversation.',\n'she was chatting to someone . not rude at all.'\nIt came as Brooklyn and Nicola had the biggest smiles on their faces in their first sighting since the statement. \nDespite the eyes of the globe being on the controversial couple amid the family drama, on Thursday they enjoyed a carefree walk with their dog in Malibu, with their arms around one another. \nIt marked the first outing for Brooklyn and the actress since they released a statement denouncing his family and pledging his allegiance to his wife.\nBut in stark contrast to his withering words, Brooklyn appeared happy and relaxed as he strolled along the beach with Nicola and their rescue dog, Lamb.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham's statement in full\n\nI have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private. Unfortunately, my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.\nI do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\nRecently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.\nMy parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped. My mum cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress. \nWeeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.\nThey were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since. \nDuring the wedding planning, my mum went so far as to call me \"evil\" because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra, and Nicola's Naunni at our table, because they both didn't have their husbands. Both of our parents had their own tables equally adjacent to ours.\nThe night before our wedding, members of my family told me that Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\" Since the moment I started standing up for myself with my family, I've received endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders.\nEven my brothers were sent to attack me on social media, before they ultimately blocked me out of nowhere this last Summer. \nMy mum hijacked my first dance with my wife, which had been planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song. In front of our 500 wedding guests, Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead. \nShe danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life. We wanted to renew our vows so we could create new memories of our wedding day that bring us joy and happiness, not anxiety and embarrassment.\nMy wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\nDespite this, we still travelled to London for my dad's birthday and were rejected for a week as we waited in our hotel room trying to plan quality time with him. He refused all of our attempts, unless it was at his big birthday party with a hundred guests and cameras at every corner.\nWhen he finally agreed to see me, it was under the condition that Nicola wasn't invited. It was a slap in the face. Later, when my family travelled to LA, they refused to see me at all.\nMy family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family \"love\" is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp, even if it's at the expense of our professional obligations.\nWe've gone out of our way for years to show up and support at every fashion show, every party, and every press activity to show 'our perfect family.' But the one time my wife asked for my mum's support to save displaced dogs during the LA fires, my mum refused.\nThe narrative that my wife controls me is completely backwards. I have been controlled by my parents for most of my life. I grew up with overwhelming anxiety. For the first time in my life, since stepping away from my family, that anxiety has disappeared.\nI wake up every morning grateful for the life I chose, and have found peace and relief. My wife and I do not want a life shaped by image, press, or manipulation. All we want peace, privacy and happiness for us and our future family. \nDavid BeckhamTikTokBrooklyn Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham's ex Afton McKeith claims he was 'telling the truth' in his bombshell statement as she says he struggled with anxiety and found it 'hard' growing up in the spotlight\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 13\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

A key part of that movement is educating the community about the culture, so people don’t just hear the music, but truly connect with it.”\n\nNoting that Jamaica’s love for music is unmatched, organisers say Afro-centric genres such as Afro House, and Amapiano remain under-served in mainstream nightlife, despite their rapid growth among young urban audiences and their influence on global fashion, dance, and culture.\n\nAfroSzn is an attempt to fill that gap by offering a home for these sounds — and a community built around them.\n\n“People are already listening to this music, dancing to it, travelling for it,” added DJ Powa. He further expressed that he has been enthralled by Afro House for the past two-and-a-half years.\n\n“There’s something embedded in the music that gives [sic] the feeling of being rooted. There’s no better way to describe it other than personally experiencing it,” he said.\n\nOrganisers cited the unmatched credibility DJ Denvo and DJ Powa bring to the brand.\n\nDJ Denvo, an on-air personality on FAME 95FM and a seasoned events DJ, is known for his authentic music selections, effortless genre fusion, and strong background in music direction and radio programme management.\n\nDJ Powa, also a DJ on FAME 95FM, is a highly sought-after name on the corporate and nightlife circuit. Renowned for his skillful blends, remixes, and seamless transitions between genres, Powa’s Afro House sound has cultivated a loyal following and earned him a reputation for delivering consistently high-energy, crowd-moving performances.\n\n“We’re building something sustainable,” DJ Denvo statedd. “AfroSzn is culture, community, and lifestyle. If you love the music, you belong here.”\n\nThe event promoters say with perfect timing, a clearly underserved niche, and two powerful curators at the helm, AfroSzn is poised to redefine Afro-centric nightlife in Jamaica. What begins on January 29 is only the start of a long-term cultural movement — one that aims to grow into international tours and, ultimately, an AfroSzn Weekend Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: African music Afrobeats AfroSzn \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff if it completes China trade deal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Pope warns against risks of AI algorithms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n VATICAN CITY, Holy See (AFP) — Pope Leo XIV on Saturday stressed the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI), how it could usurp human identi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spurs slip at Burnley increases pressure on Frank as City win \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — Thomas Frank's job is under renewed threat after Tottenham dropped more points in a 2-2 draw at relegation-threatened B... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sav-la-Mar Hospital on the mend: reconstruction progresses amidst overcrowding, staffing woes \n\n\n\n\n BY ANTHONY LEWIS Observer writer \n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n SAVANNA-LA-MAR, Westmoreland – Health and Wellness Minister Dr Christopher Tufton is asking for patience from the public and staff of the Savanna-la-M... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died: US media \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n MINNEAPOLIS, Jamaica (AFP) — A man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis has died, the city's police chief told United States (US) media on Saturday -... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Funeral of late journalist Donald Oliver ongoing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Members of the media fraternity and loved ones are currently gathered at the Mona Chapel of the University of the West Indies (UWI... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over 7,000 students sign up for rural school bus card – Moris Dixon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 24, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —Minister of Education, Senator Dr Dana Morris Dixon, is urging parents to ensure that their children are in possession of the Jamai... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Before her rise, she had explored modeling and pursued philosophy studies at a little-known university in the American Midwest.\n\nHowever, the newly titled Countess of Iveagh harbored a troubling secret.\n\nAn extensive investigation by The Mail on Sunday has uncovered that prior to meeting her husband, ‘Ned’ Guinness, the Countess was deeply involved with Jeffrey Epstein’s inner circle. She reportedly flew on Epstein’s private jet, infamously known as the ‘Lolita Express,’ as many as 40 times over four years.\n\nNewly discovered documents from the Epstein Files, a large collection currently being examined by the US Congress, show that in June 2020, the UK’s National Crime Agency alerted the FBI about the Countess being ‘allegedly a close contact of Epstein.’ Additionally, a woman, whose identity remains undisclosed, claimed she was sexually abused by her.\n\nIt is understood by this publication that the accuser of the Countess is Virginia Giuffre, who has alleged she was trafficked to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions, including once when she was a minor—allegations the former prince has consistently denied.\n\nIt must be noted, too, that there is no proof that Ms Giuffre’s allegation against the Countess is true, as it has not been investigated by the police nor tested in court.\n\nNor will it be, as both women have since died. Ms Giuffre took her own life in April last year, while the Countess died two days before Christmas aged 51.\n\nShe was eulogised at a private funeral at the picturesque Church of St Andrew and St Patrick at Elveden, the 23,000-acre Guinness estate on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, where generations of Guinness family members have been laid to rest. The Countess’s two sons aged 23 and 21 – the eldest being heir to his father’s £900 million fortune and title – led mourners in celebrating the life of their mother who lost a ‘cruel’ battle against brain cancer.\n\nLast night, a source told the MoS: ‘While she was alive, and particularly while she was so sick, people didn’t want to talk about the dark cloud hanging over Clare. She was universally loved by those closest to her. She led an exemplary life as a Countess but few knew about her time with Epstein and, if they did, they never talked about it.’\n\nWhile the former Duke of York’s involvement with Epstein has been well chronicled, the story of Clare, Countess of Iveagh’s relationship with the vile paedophile has, until now, remained secret.\n\nIndeed, it is only since her death, that the MoS has been able to piece together fragments of her remarkable rags-to-riches tale.\n\nThe newly-discovered documents from the National Crime Agency (NCA) show the Countess’s links to Epstein were under the spotlight in 2020 after flight records showed her accompanying the paedophile on 40 flights to his Caribbean island and his homes in New York, Ohio and New Mexico.\n\nOn at least one flight she was joined by the then Prince Andrew. On all but three trips, Epstein was also on board as was, on many occasions, the disgraced socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the paedophile’s ‘madam’ who is currently serving 20 years in jail having trafficked children for sex.\n\nMaxwell, we have learned, was one of the Countess’s closest friends. But more of that later.\n\nWho was Clare Hazell? And how did she end up in Epstein’s warped world then go on to marry into one of Britain’s most illustrious families? It’s a question that baffled Ms Giuffre, who first met the future Countess when she was simply ‘Clare with a cute English accent’.\n\nMs Giuffre entered Epstein’s orbit shortly before her 17th birthday in 2000 when she was ‘headhunted’ by Maxwell at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate where she was a receptionist in the spa.\n\nWriting on X in 2020, Ms Giuffre accused Hazell of having ‘sexually abused her’ when she was a minor.\n\nIn an interview with journalist Daniel Bates in 2021 – published here for the first time – Ms Giuffre said the pair were ‘intimate’ but she also appeared much more sympathetic towards the Countess, portraying her as someone who was not tied to Epstein ‘of her own accord’. She said: ‘I know she wasn’t forced into it, she obviously had a choice like we all did. I don’t think she necessarily wanted to be there. I can’t say anything bad about her.’\n\nThe reason for Ms Giuffre’s marked change of tone is not clear. It must, however, be pointed out that if the pair were intimate, Hazell would have been almost a decade older than a teenage Giuffre. Old enough for Giuffre to comment: ‘I didn’t understand Clare’s reasoning for being there. Jeffrey didn’t like older girls but he did with her.’\n\nBy Ms Giuffre’s account, Clare Hazell, as she then was, had arrived in America to pursue a modelling career.\n\nIt would have been some adventure for Clare, the daughter of Andrea and Derek, a sales manager, who lived in a modest two-bedroom terraced home in a Reading suburb.\n\nBut the MoS understands Ms Hazell first met Epstein not in the US but in Britain after which the vile financier invited her to America. It was there she met Maxwell, with the pair becoming friends.\n\n‘It was Epstein who met Clare first,’ a source said. ‘He was living in London in the mid-Eighties and met a lot of British society people and it was through those friends he ended up meeting Clare. She came to New York at his invitation and that was when she met Ghislaine. Ghislaine was very fond of Clare. Everyone loved Clare because she was vibrant and good-hearted.’\n\nBy then Maxwell had fallen ‘madly in love’ with Epstein, then a financial adviser to Ohio-based billionaire Les Wexner, owner of brands like Victoria’s Secret. ‘Epstein only had one client and that was Les,’ the source says. It is at this stage that things become murky.\n\nClare appears to have accepted Epstein as her ‘benefactor’. In 1996, she enrolled in Ohio State University – which received millions in donations from Wexner’s charitable foundation – and left with a BA in philosophy three years later. \n\nOne of her university friends claimed Epstein paid for Clare’s tuition fees, accommodation and a monthly allowance. Now a 50-year-old studio engineer, the friend told the MoS that Clare was living in a £1,000-a-month rental apartment near the university – a fortune in Ohio – but would frequently leave to jet around the world with Epstein and Maxwell. \n\nThe university declined to comment on payment arrangements citing privacy laws.\n\nClare was considered ‘sophisticated’ by other students, not only because of her English accent but also because she appeared more worldly, speaking fluent French. \n\nThe friend says he regularly accompanied Clare to New Albany Country Club, an exclusive club on the grounds of a development created by Wexner. ‘It was definitely intimidating the first time. I was her plus one.\n\n‘She was an extremely intelligent girl… down to earth, she carried herself really well. There was a lot of grace and refinement, just from her British background, that set her apart. Epstein was paying her tuition and that sort of thing. \n\nIt was almost a personal scholarship. She was essentially being paid a living wage, a monthly stipend. I believe she referred to him as her benefactor.’\n\nThe Countess’s university friend recalled hanging out at Epstein’s house (‘lots of pillars, marble, extremely plush’) with Clare who would excuse herself when Maxwell called. ‘I don’t remember a time when she ever let [Maxwell’s call] go to voicemail.’\n\nHe recalled how his friend would ‘jet off’ to the Bahamas, adding: ‘She never seemed in distress. She would seem upbeat about leaving Ohio for the weekend… I would say that she was playing the game in her own way.’\n\nSo was the Countess a victim of Epstein or a compliant participant? The former, claimed a source close to the family last night. While someone who knew her says: ‘Does it matter at this stage? She was a girl who pulled herself up by her bootstraps. She went from Reading to being the Countess of Iveagh. That’s monumental.’\n\nThe MoS has been unable to establish exactly what Clare did after leaving university in 1997.\n\nShe appears to have worked as a model and then promoted herself as an interior designer. She is believed to have met Ned Guinness – at the time one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors – around 2000. The earl, who was educated at Marlborough College in Wiltshire, is said to have proposed on a mountaintop while on a walking holiday in Spain.\n\nThe couple wed ‘quietly’ in October 2001 at the church on the Elveden estate where she was buried last weekend. Vicar Robert Leach says the couple met at a dinner party: ‘Clare was attracted to Edward because he was different. While everyone else in the room was talking about their last holiday or their trip to France, he was talking about his 3,000 tons of potatoes.’\n\nThe marriage, for the most part, appears to have been a happy one. Both sons are accomplished sportsmen, representing Ireland in downhill skiing. A source says: ‘They adored their sons. Then the Epstein s*** happened. It’s surprising it’s taken this long for someone to write about it. It’s enormously sad. The stress of this may have contributed to her illness.’\n\nOn June 30, 2020, Michael Manley, the NCA liaison officer at the British embassy in Washington, wrote to the FBI raising allegations surrounding the Countess.\n\nIn a letter bringing the matter ‘to the attention of the FBI’ Manley wrote that Ms Hazell, then president of the West Suffolk branch of the NSPCC, was facing an internal investigation by the children’s charity to determine whether she remained ‘suitable to hold the position of president’ – most likely as a result of Virginia GIuffre’s allegation on X that she had been ‘sexually abused’ by her.\n\nManley said the NCA did not ‘hold any derogatory information’ on the Countess but said she was ‘allegedly a close contact’ of Epstein, who took his own life in 2019. Mr Manly said the NCA wanted to know if an internal investigation by the NSPCC would ‘adversely affect’ the FBI and US Department of Justice’s probe into Epstein’s vast network and possible co-conspirators.\n\nHis letter sparked a flurry of emails between FBI agents in New York and officials at the agency’s headquarters in Washington DC, according to documents released as part of the Epstein Files. On August 18, 2020, an FBI official informed a colleague that prosecutors in the office of the US attorney for the Southern District of New York did ‘not see an issue with them [the NSPCC] proceeding on an internal investigation into Clare Iveagh’.\n\nThe children’s charity last weekend told the MoS that ‘Clare Iveagh stood down from her role with the NSPCC before the charity’s internal process had concluded’.\n\nA year on from her resignation, she and her husband announced their plans to divorce.\n\nA friend says: ‘Did Epstein contribute to the marriage breakdown? Who knows?’\n\nFor now, the overwhelming sense of those who knew Clare Hazell is one of sadness. ‘She was a lovely lady. So pretty, so bubbly, so kind,’ says one person who spoke to the Countess when she learned her skin cancer had progressed to her brain and would be life-ending.\n\n‘Once she was linked with Epstein it changed her character.\n\n‘Her feeling towards the end was one of defensiveness. She wanted to protect her boys.\n\n‘Did she do a deal with the devil when she was younger? Maybe. Does she deserve to have her legacy ripped away? No. She knew everyone but remained loyal to her friends, including Ghislaine.’\n\nThe extraordinary story of her association with Epstein follows the Netflix drama House Of Guinness, whose London premiere in September Ned attended. The show depicts how the four children of Sir Benjamin Guinness fight for their share of his 19th Century empire.\n\nThe lives of subsequent generations of the family have often been described as ‘cursed’ after a succession of calamities, including the assassination of Anglo-Irish politician Walter, Lord Moyne, in Egypt in 1944; socialite Tara Browne’s death in 1966 in a car crash and the suicide of Henrietta Guinness in 1978.\n\nTo those loyal to the Countess, it seems the ‘curse’ has claimed its latest victim. But for those abused by Jeffrey Epstein, her premature death leaves many questions unanswered.\n\nAdditional reporting: Daniel Bates","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWhen the elegant interior designer Clare Hazell wed Arthur Edward Guinness, the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling the Untold Mysteries of £900m Guinness Heiress Lady Iveagh first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/unveiling-the-untold-mysteries-of-900m-guinness-heiress-lady-iveagh/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Revealed-The-dark-secrets-of-the-900m-Guinness-heir-Lady.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:45:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.134},{"id":395788964,"title":"US federal agents kill another person in Minneapolis amid immigration crackdown","text":"Minneapolis [US], January 25 (ANI): United States federal agents have fatally shot another individual in Minneapolis during an ongoing immigration enforcement drive, triggering widespread protests and renewed demands for President Donald Trump to withdraw heavily armed federal personnel from the city, Al Jazeera reported.On Saturday, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that a 37-year-old man succumbed to multiple gunshot injuries after being taken to hospital.The victim, who was a resident of Minneapolis and a US citizen, according to O’Hara.“Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,” he said, quoted by Al Jazeera.The shooting occurred amid a sustained deployment of US immigration enforcement and other federal agents to Minneapolis, where they have been carrying out raids as part of Trump’s anti-immigration push.Al Jazeera stated that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz strongly criticised the federal operations, describing them as far removed from immigration enforcement. “This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Minnesota Governor said during a news conference in Saint Paul. “It’s a campaign of organised brutality against the people of our state.

The US National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that will bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the southeast US and cited \"crippling to locally catastrophic impacts.\" Weather service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region of the US by Monday.

The fact of the largest general strike in the state in nearly a century may be only remembered, if at all, as a big day of protests and walkouts, and no more than that.\n\nIn that future, the possibility of mass, coordinated, and powerful action is wiped from the public imaginary — because, within 24 hours, federal agents had killed another civilian in cold blood.\n\nDonald Trump’s paramilitary forces shot and killed 37-year-old nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday morning. Like in the killing of Renee Good, video footage taken by witnesses appears to show a brutal, close-range killing. Eyewitnesses told The Intercept that Pretti was on the scene acting as a civilian observer. Videos show a group of more than four masked agents wrestle him to the ground and beat him, before one shoots him multiple times.\n\nThe shooting — the third in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents since Trump’s deportation machine descended on Minnesota with extreme brutality in December — is an unbearable follow-up to the most extraordinary day of mass resistance to Trumpian fascism to date.\n\nIt is also a searing reminder as to why Friday’s mass strike in Minneapolis must not be swept from our minds. Rather, it must be treated as a powerful new phase of resistance against Trump’s regime — a task that can only be achieved by building on and repeating it.\n\nOn Friday, tens of thousands of Minnesotans braved extreme cold to march en masse and shuttered a reported 700-plus businesses in a daylong general strike with the support of all major unions. They protested, transported, fed, and watched over each other, an outgrowth of weeks, months, and years of community care and abolitionist resistance. Their collective actions mark a breakthrough in the fight against the American authoritarianism of our time.\n\nIt is only a future with mass social strikes, or general strikes, involving large-scale disruption on the immediate horizon that has the chance of stopping Trump’s forces. \n\nOn January 23, the Twin Cities offered a small glimpse of the sorts of work stoppages, blockades, and shutdowns that aggregated practices of collective resistance make possible.\n\nThe task ahead of us, in the face of the government’s unending violence and cruelty, is to take up, share, and spread the practices modeled by networks in Minnesota.\n\nSaturday’s slaughter does not disprove the power of Friday’s strike; no one was under the impression that tides had somehow turned in a day. The point is that, thanks to Minnesota’s resistance, we can see how to go on.\n\nPeople in the Streets\n\nOn Friday afternoon, when people filled the downtown Minneapolis streets, it was the coldest day of the year so far: a reported minus 20 degrees, with a wind chill reaching minus 35.\n\n“I’m seeing icicles form on people’s eyelashes out here, on mustaches, on eyebrows, from just the condensation from their own breath freezing against their own face,” a video journalist reported from the ground. \n\nThe day began early with dozens of protesters barricading the road outside the Whipple Detention Center, the home base of Trump’s deportation machine in Minneapolis, for over two hours.\n\nLater that morning, over 1,000 people, including religious leaders in prayer, formed a picket outside the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. Since December, over 2,000 people in Minnesota have been taken by federal immigration authorities; many have been deported through the airport. Around 100 people were arrested at the airport protest.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses refused to open their doors in numbers not seen in decades.\n\nNo, the government was not brought to its knees under the economic weight of a one-day strike called on short notice. Friday, however, was a crucial step, to be built upon and built upon, creating the specific sort of political strike that takes aim at the very nature of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in our cities and towns.\n\nIt is precisely this combined model of strike, targeted blockade, and mass demonstration, all undergirded by networks of mutual aid, that we need to repeat and expand. \n\n“Hope Is a Discipline”\n\nCommunity defense against ICE did not, of course, begin with Minneapolis — although the city has been the site of Trump’s most lawless and thoroughgoing fascist, nakedly racist operation to date. Residents in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and beyond have blockaded ICE facilities, hid their immigrant neighbors, filled immigration courts, filed lawsuits, and confronted federal agents in the street. And these acts of resistance were not only learned to fight Trump’s regime. They have been rehearsed many times over, in centuries of struggle. \n\nThere are times in a broad and disarticulated political movement, however, when things come together. Momentum builds. And there are events that shift the ground, after which it makes sense to speak of a before and an after.\n\nThe day following the strike brought more horror where there had been an opening for hope. Hope, though, is not what is really needed now — not hope as a sentiment, at least. We prove our orientation toward a better world, whether we feel hope or not — and I do not — by continuing to act against this murderous state force, and for each other. This is what the abolitionist organizer Mariame Kaba meant in calling hope a “discipline.” \n\nAfter January 23 in Minneapolis and St. Paul, we have grounds to talk and organize seriously around general strikes in other cities, states, even nationally — general strikes with the specific aim of making our cities and towns as difficult as possible for ICE and other federal forces to move through. Not by dint of social media calls, or columns like this, but by going on in the way of Minnesotans.\n\nMinnesota organizers did not conjure the state’s largest day of labor action in nearly a century by simply announcing “general strike” online. Labor unions, religious and community institutions, and front-line activists were all key; so, too, was the fury of everyday people, in a city where community support is normalized, and militant anti-racist protest boasts a proud history.\n\nMinneapolis’s extraordinary rapid-response networks, activated to keep watch on ICE and provide transport and care for immigrants, developed swiftly. Minneapolis-based organizers Jonathan Stegall and Anne Kosseff-Jones, however, have said, “Many of these systems sprung to life along the paths laid down by the 2020 uprising after the police-perpetrated killing of George Floyd.”\n\nAs Sarah Jaffe noted in the New Republic, “The Twin Cities have had plenty of opportunities to build up these networks of resistance, networks that have only grown larger in the wake of Good’s killing.”\n\nThis constellation of factors meant in a matter of days, a strike action could be called involving hundreds of thousands of workers across sectors. This can and must be repeated elsewhere. This is not the first time Minneapolis has led the way. And it is for this reason, too, that Minneapolis will not be defeated by the deadly escalations of federal agents the following day.\n\n21st-Century General Strike\n\nGeneral strikes in 2026 will not look the same as they did in the early 20th century. In an age of technocapital and decimated labor power, conditions look different. Even with a slowly rebuilding labor movement, effectively marshaling collective refusal is extraordinarily hard.\n\nIt remains the case, however, as Kieran Knutson, president of the Communications Workers of America Local 7250 in Minneapolis, told Democracy Now!, that “nothing runs without the working class in this country.”\n\nA general strike against Trump’s authoritarianism requires a specific navigation of territory and time — addressing the ways ICE moves rapidly through our cities and neighborhoods — and how to fight against it. That means combining neighborhood patrols with confrontational shutdowns, and creating barriers for federal agents wherever they try to go — including the damn bathroom.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/01/24/strike-minnesota-ice-renee-good-alex-pretti/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257846117_53fab9-e1769297685885.jpg?fit=5377%2C2690","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:41:32","author":"Natasha Lennard","authors":["Natasha Lennard"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":395788738,"title":"Three-Way Peace Talks Set To Resume In UAE, As Russia, Ukraine Fight On","text":"Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, after two days of \"constructive\" peace talks in Abu Dhabi, are set to resume peace negotiations in the United Arab Emirates capital next week, even as the war itself showed no signs of letup.\n\nOn January 23-24, \"the United States coordinated a trilateral meeting alongside Ukraine and Russia, graciously hosted by the United Arab Emirates,\" White House envoy Steve Witkoff wrote on X.\n\n\"Talks were very constructive, and plans were made to continue conversations next week in Abu Dhabi.

The Donbas is a wide swath of territory in eastern Ukraine; Russia controls around 90 percent of it.\n\nZelenskyy, who met with Trump in Switzerland on January 22, has long rejected the suggestion of ceding territory to Russia but told reporters the UAE talks would include the issue of territory in the Donbas.\n\nWarring Parties Continue To Strike\n\nAs the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of February 2022 nears, violence on the ground continued even amid the peace talks.\n\nRussia, following its massive air strikes on Kyiv and Kharkiv, on January 24 claimed to have captured another key village, while Ukraine reportedly struck back in Russia’s Belgorod border region.\n\nRussia's military said its troops had completed the capture of the village of Starytsya in the Kharkiv region, where Ukraine has been struggling to fend off a ground offensive amid heavy losses on both sides.\n\nStarytsya, a settlement of some 486 people near the border, is close to the town of Vovchansk, which has been bloodied and battered for months amid desperate defenses since an offensive launched by Russia in May 2024.\n\nUkraine did not immediately comment on Russia's claim, but its General Staff said the Kremlin's forces had launched six attacks on an area including Starytsya. The reports could not be independently verified.\n\nRussia's Westward Push\n\nRussia has been attempting to push westward through eastern Ukraine to gain as much ground as possible amid peace negotiations. Much of its gains have been in the Donetsk region, although it has kept the pressure on in the Kharkiv region as well.\n\nAs Russia continues its nightly air strikes against Ukrainian cities, often hitting residential areas and infrastructure sites, Kyiv has struck back at energy-related facilities inside Russia that it says are used to fuel the Kremlin's war effort.\n\nRussia's Belgorod region has often been the target of Ukrainian strikes and was the target of a Ukrainian ground offensive in May 2023. It was reportedly hit again late on January 24.\n\n\"According to our information, a massive shelling of the city of Belgorod [has been carried out],\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram, adding that there were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\n\"There is damage to energy facilities. We are collecting information, and emergency services are at the scene.\"\n\nTelegram channels from the region reported that the shelling had lasted for a long period of time and that explosions were heard in Belgorod, a town of some 320,000 people.\n\nUkraine did not immediately comment on the reports of air strikes against the Belgorod region.\n\nKyiv, Kharkiv Hit by Russian Strikes\n\nEarlier on January 24, Ukraine condemned a massive Russian attack overnight and into January 24 on the capital, Kyiv, and on Kharkiv, with at least one person being killed.\n\nAccording to local officials, both cities were hit with Russian missile and drone barrages through the early morning hours and later in the day on January 24.\n\n\"Cynically, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin ordered a brutal, massive missile strike against Ukraine right while delegations are meeting in Abu Dhabi to advance the America-led peace process,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha wrote on X.\n\n\"Main targets remained the same: energy objects and residential areas. Russia continues to wage a genocidal war against civilian people, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"\n\nBy late evening, more than 3,200 buildings in Kyiv remained without heating, down from 6,000 in the morning, as night-time temperatures fell to minus-10 degrees Celsius.\n\nEnergy Minister Denys Shmyhal said more than 800,000 Kyiv homes and a further 400,000 in Chernihiv ⁠region, north of the capital, were still without power late on January 24.\n\n\"As for power, constant enemy attacks unfortunately keep the situation from being stabilized,\" he wrote on telegram.\n\nIn Kharkiv, a nighttime drone attack injured 27 people, according regional head Oleh Syniehubov. City mayor Ihor Terekhov said the attack lasted nearly 2-1/2 hours, with one of the drones striking a dormitory for disabled people, and other strikes damaging a hospital and a maternity hospital.\n\n\"Unfortunately, a 68-year-old woman died in the hospital, who was wounded as a result of an enemy [drone] strike near the village of Prudianka,\" Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-ukraine-war-peace-uae-kharkiv-kyiv/33658854.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/63d0f97c-8aea-4521-ec97-08de3c642a37_cx0_cy7_cw0_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-25 00:40:51","author":"Rfe/rl's Russian Service,Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service","authors":["Rfe/rl's Russian Service","Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":0.167}]}
