Sheriff Chris Nanos said his office was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and US Customs and Border Protection to investigate the incident.Border Patrol involvementLocal authorities said the shooting involved a Border Patrol agent and a suspect. The Santa Rita Fire District, which responded to the scene, said the wounded individual was taken into custody and later transferred by medical helicopter to a regional trauma center.“Patient care was transferred to a local medical helicopter for rapid transport to a regional trauma center,” the fire district said in a statement.The individual who was shot has not been identified, and officials have not released details about what led to the use of force. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Arivaca is a busy corridor for migrant crossings and has previously been a flashpoint for tensions between migrant advocates and Border Patrol agents.Recent fatal incidentsThe shooting comes amid heightened scrutiny of federal immigration enforcement following a series of recent fatal incidents. On Saturday (January 24), 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Earlier this month, 37-year-old Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.Those deaths have triggered protests in Minneapolis, and intensified criticism of the Department of Homeland Security over the aggressive tactics used by immigration agents.President Donald Trump, who won the 2024 election after pledging a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, has expanded deportation operations since returning to office last year.Masked immigration officers wearing tactical gear have become a common sight in several US cities, and clashes between agents and protesters have escalated in recent weeks.Public support for Trump’s immigration enforcement policies has shown signs of softening, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, as Republicans face growing political pressure ahead of midterm elections.(With Reuters, AP inputs)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/border-patrol-related-shooting-in-arizona-one-person-in-critical-condition-11769541028513.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/27/1600x900/NSP_Sharad_Pawar_1721267050573_1769541600670.PNG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 19:21:06","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.018},{"id":396719774,"title":"Trump Backs Noem as Homan Revamps Minnesota Immigration Effort","text":"Donald Trump said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem would remain in her post despite the president’s decision to reshuffle the leadership running his deportation effort in Minnesota following widespread outcry over the killing of two US citizens by federal agents.“I think she’s doing a very good job,” Trump told reporters Tuesday as he departed the White House for a trip to Iowa. “The border is totally secure.”The public vote of confidence came a day after the president ordered the shakeup in the aftermath of the Jan. 24 fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent during an enforcement operation. Trump’s decision to dispatch border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis, effectively replacing Greg Bovino, the US Border Patrol commander who became the face of the contentious immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, spurred widespread speculation that the president may be frustrated with how his deportation efforts are being carried out and viewed by the public.Trump’s expression of support for Noem suggested he wasn’t immediately looking to further upend his immigration team. Still, the president indicated he was pleased by the reaction to his decision to appoint Homan, a Noem rival within the administration seen as more focused on targeted enforcement than broad street operations.“He’s meeting with the governor, and he’s meeting with the mayor, I think, later, and I hear that’s all going very well,” Trump said of Homan.Pretti’s death came just weeks after the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good, a US citizen and Minneapolis mother of three, by an ICE agent during a similar operation in a residential neighborhood of the city.Initial statements by administration officials — including Noem, who said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation,” and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who intimated on social media that Pretti was an “assassin” and “domestic terrorist” — drew bipartisan criticism. Available video of the incident didn’t show Pretti brandishing the firearm he was legally carrying and suggested that the officers had disarmed him before shooting him repeatedly. Trump on Tuesday notably declined to say whether the Pretti shooting was justified.“We’re doing a big investigation,” he said. “I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it. I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself.”“You can’t walk in with guns, you can’t do that,” he added, calling the killing “a very unfortunate incident.”Public opinion polls show increasing discomfort with the administration’s tactics, even among voters who broadly support immigration enforcement. Nearly half of Americans in a recent Politico poll said the deportation campaign was too aggressive, and one in three Trump voters said while they support the the goal, they disapproved with how it’s being implemented. Still, Trump and his inner circle have been reluctant to remove officials in his second term, after frequent firings and resignations became a regular feature of his first presidential stint. That appeared to still be the case on Tuesday, as the president drew some of his embattled administration officials close. Noem and her top aide, Corey Lewandowski — the first campaign manager of Trump’s 2016 presidential bid — met with the president Monday night for nearly two hours at the White House, the New York Times reported. Separately, Miller traveled with Trump aboard Air Force One as he flew to Iowa.But even as Trump appeared eager to calm the palace intrigue, he also signaled a desire to find compromise with state and local officials. Homan was set to meet with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. And the president indicated in a radio interview that aired Tuesday morning he hoped to work with them.“All I said: just give us your criminals, and if you give us the criminals, it all goes away,” Trump told WABC.Business leaders in Minnesota, including executives from Target Corp. and Best Buy Co. Inc., have joined calls for de-escalation, warning that the federal operation was damaging worker morale and the state’s economic stability, while executives in Silicon Valley have also criticized ICE.In Washington, Senate Democrats have warned they would block funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless restrictions are placed on enforcement operations — raising the specter of a partial government shutdown — while some Republicans are urging more restraint and a clearer strategy on immigration from the administration.Meanwhile, a judge in Minnesota has ordered the acting chief of ICE to appear in court on Friday to answer questions about the Trump administration’s handling of bond hearings for detained immigrants. The judge said the administration has failed to comply with orders to hold bond hearings for the detainees.“This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,” wrote Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz in an order Monday directing acting ICE Chief Todd Lyons to appear in person Jan. 30 to show why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/trump-backs-noem-as-homan-revamps-minnesota-immigration-effort-11769539917993.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/27/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1769539920740.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 18:51:57","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.003},{"id":396719764,"title":"‘Americans have died’: US Senator John Fetterman urges Trump to sack Kristi Noem amid Minneapolis situation","text":"Senator John Fetterman, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, has called on President Donald Trump to immediately fire Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, amid the unfolding situation in Minneapolis.In a post on X on Tuesday, Fetterman directly appealed to Trump, tagging both the @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump accounts.“I make a direct appeal to immediately fire @Sec_Noem,” Fetterman wrote.“Americans have died. She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy. DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary,” he added.White House backs NoemThe call came despite the White House publicly reaffirming its support for Noem.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that the DHS chief continues to enjoy the president’s full confidence.“Secretary Noem still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States,” Leavitt said.She added that Noem is “continuing to oversee the entire Department of Homeland Security and all of the immigration enforcement that's taking place across the whole entire country,” while also leading FEMA’s response to a brutal winter storm that has impacted hundreds of thousands of Americans.Minneapolis shootings spark backlashFetterman’s remarks followed controversy surrounding federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, after the fatal shootings of US citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good earlier this month.“Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti should still be alive. My family grieves for theirs,” Fetterman said in a statement on Monday. He described the federal operation in Minneapolis as dangerously out of control.“The operation in Minneapolis should stand down and immediately end. It has become an ungovernable and dangerous urban theatre for civilians and law enforcement that is incompatible with the American spirit,” he said.‘Pro-immigration Democrat’ stanceFetterman sought to clarify his broader position on immigration, stressing that his criticism does not amount to opposition to enforcement itself.“As a very pro-immigration Democrat and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Management, I believe our nation deserves a secured border and that we should deport all criminal migrants,” he said. “I also believe there needs to be a path to citizenship for those hardworking families who are here.”However, the senator pushed back against calls from some quarters to dismantle immigration enforcement agencies.“I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE,” Fetterman said. “I strongly disagree with many strategies and practices ICE deployed in Minneapolis, and believe that must change.”","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/americans-have-died-us-senator-john-fetterman-urges-trump-to-sack-kristi-noem-amid-minneapolis-situation-11769537694979.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/27/1600x900/logo/DHS-SECRETARY-KRISTI-NOEM-BRIEFS-ON-VAST-WINTER_1769539414959_1769539415097.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 18:51:07","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":396778590,"title":"GHN’s ‘Beyond the Book Bag’ initiative reaches 135 students","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNerissa Stevens (second right), principal of Little London Primary School, poses with Global Humanity Network Inc members Dr Ryan Keating (left), director;Dr Miranda Wellington, director; and Professor Laxley Stephenson (right), president & CEO, during the handing over of textbooks to the school on Saturday by the nonprofit organisation. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\n\n\n\n GHN’s ‘Beyond the Book Bag’ initiative reaches 135 students \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWESTMORELAND, Jamaica — Global Humanity Network Incorporated (GHN) has expanded its ‘Beyond the Book Bag’ initiative to reach 85 students across 20 schools in the parishes of St Elizabeth and Westmoreland, bringing total beneficiaries to 135 islandwide following the programme’s launch in Trelawny last December.\n\nThe latest distribution saw 60 students in Westmoreland and 25 in St Elizabeth receiving full sets of textbooks and essential learning materials, adding to the 50 students in Trelawny who were assisted when the initiative was first rolled out in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa.\n\nPresident and CEO of GHN, Jamaican-born American Dr Laxley Stephenson, said the intervention was driven by responsibility rather than convenience, and was designed to fill critical gaps left after the hurricane destroyed or displaced school books and other essential items for many students.\n\n“In December in Trelawny alone, we distributed textbooks, food supplies and hygiene kits valued at approximately $1 million to a number of young students, while also announcing the establishment of a three-year mentorship programme to support selected students,” Stephenson said.\n\nAccording to a release from GHN, the organisation provided 100 per cent of the required textbooks to 85 students in Westmoreland and St Elizabeth, covering nine schools in Westmoreland and 12 in St Elizabeth, in addition to the 50 students already supported in Trelawny.\n\nPrincipal of Little London Primary School in Westmoreland, Nerissa Stevens, expressed heartfelt gratitude for the timely intervention.\n\n“We are overly grateful that they saw our needs. We had students who had no textbooks at all, and GHN filled that gap so our students are better able to be catered to in instruction in the classroom,” Stevens said.\n\nShe noted that nine students at her school were initially identified to receive textbooks, but the organisation went even further.\n\n“He gave an additional 10 following the nine. He instructed us that we can go and get for 10 more students because of the population of our school. The recipients are from all over the school — from the infant department straight to Grade Six and from all streams as well,” she added.\n\nGlobal Humanity Network Inc is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation focused on improving underserved communities worldwide by mobilising volunteers and resources for education, poverty reduction, infrastructure and community development.\n\nProfessor Stephenson also announced that GHN is transitioning from a charity-focused organisation to a capacity-building, development-driven nonprofit aimed at producing sustainable, measurable and long-term impact in underserved communities.\n\n“While GHN will continue to meet urgent needs, every act of assistance will now serve as a gateway to mentorship, education, leadership development and self-sufficiency,” he said.\n\nUnder the new strategic framework, spanning 2026 to 2029, GHN will operate a structured pipeline beginning with Helping Hands — providing targeted, dignified support — progressing to Mentoring Matters, which focuses on guidance, accountability and life skills, and culminating in Beyond the Backpack, a multi-year investment in education and leadership development.\n\nImplementation will take place in three phases: 2026 will establish student cohorts, mentoring systems, recurring donors and impact tracking; 2027 will expand participation, partnerships and public accountability; and 2028 to 2029 will scale the model across additional communities with multi-year funding and regional leadership development.\n\n“The result will be improved student success, stronger youth leadership, reduced dependency on aid, and communities equipped to sustain their own growth. GHN is not ending charity — it is elevating it into a strategy for building futures,” Stephenson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Beyond the Book Bag Global Humanity Network Incorporated \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n First Lotto jackpot winner for 2026 hits $71 million \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—A lucky ticket holder from Westmoreland has won the Lotto jackpot, the first in 2026, bagging $71 million.

(JIS photo) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Senior judge urges motorists to educate themselves about traffic laws \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica—Motorists are being urged to educate themselves about the laws governing the use of the nation’s roads, which will lead them to make better choices.\n\nSenior Judge of the Corporate Area Traffic Court, Mitsy Beaumont-Daley, made the call while addressing a recent traffic symposium at the St Mary Parish Court.\n\nShe noted that several individuals who come before the court are unaware of the traffic laws.\n\n“I’ve seen [it] so many times in the traffic court. A number of persons…indicate that they have no knowledge of what the law says,” she pointed out, requiring the judges to go through the legislation so that individuals can be in an informed position to make their plea.\n\n“Now, while we do that, it is important that you have that personal responsibility to empower yourself to know exactly what it is that is in the Road Traffic Act, the Transport Authority Act [and] the Road Traffic Regulations, so that if you are ticketed, summoned [or] charged by the police, you can say in no uncertain terms, ‘I am guilty or I am not guilty of the offence’ and you are in a position to defend yourself accordingly,” the senior judge advised.\n\nAmong the common misunderstood offences that bring drivers before the courts is the incorrect use of fog lamps.\n\n“Persons would have been ticketed for the fog lamps being on and they would come to court from time to time saying, ‘but judge it’s automatic; it comes with the car’. I think a lot of persons have been mixing up the daytime running light with the fog lamps – they are very different,” the senior judge pointed out.\n\nShe noted that the law recognises fog lamps and certain conditions that need to exist when they are being used.\n\n“If the conditions are not in existence, then it means that you can be ticketed for same,” she said.\n\nThe use of electronic communication devices while driving is another area where motorists need to be educated.\n\nThe senior judge clarified that once the driver is using the device in hands-free mode, he/she is not committing an offence.\n\n“So, you have to look at the legislation and see what hands-free mode is because it is defined,” she said.\n\nThe judge noted that knowledge of the law is a crucial component in making better choices where road use is concerned.\n\n“When you understand the penalties, you will avoid consequences. When you appreciate the reasons as to why rules exist, compliance will now become a matter of wisdom and respect for the lives of others, rather than one of fear of punishment,” she pointed out.\n\nShe warned that the court will be firm in applying the traffic law for unlawful use of the road.\n\n“Yes, it will be fair, but it will be firm, and I will not hesitate to impose the penalties. Remember that driving is a privilege, it’s not a right, and if that privilege is abused, it can be taken away,” the senior judge said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Mitsy Beaumont-Daley St Mary Parish Court traffic laws \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump rebukes armed protesters after Minnesota shooting \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that people \"can't walk in with guns\" at protests after a second American was k... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Lifestyle \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Romae Gordon walks Chanel runway in Paris \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n Romae Gordon walked the runway in central Paris on Tuesday for Chanel’s Haute Couture Spring/Summer 2026 collection show.

On January 24, federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in Minneapolis, less than three weeks after an immigration officer fired on Renee Good, also 37, killing her in her car. The fatal shootings has reignited accusations that federal agents enforcing US President Donald Trump's militarized immigration crackdown are inexperienced, under-trained and operating outside law enforcement norms. (Photo by Octavio JONES / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nJanuary 27, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Trump rebukes armed protesters after Minnesota shooting \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP)—US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that people “can’t walk in with guns” at protests after a second American was killed by federal authorities in Minnesota, aligning himself with an administration stance that has already drawn backlash from gun rights advocates.\n\nThe comments came after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who was legally carrying a handgun when he was wrestled to the ground, disarmed and killed by border agents during a protest in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\nPretti’s death has left Trump navigating a treacherous political terrain, caught between defending aggressive federal law enforcement tactics and risking a rupture with a gun lobby that has long been one of his most dependable allies.\n\n“You can’t have guns, you can’t walk in with guns, you can’t do that, but it’s a very unfortunate incident,” Trump told reporters when asked about Pretti’s death, which came days after an immigration agent killed unarmed activist Renee Good as she was attempting to drive away.\n\nThe Republican leader’s stance has put him at odds with influential conservative gun groups, which argue that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry firearms while exercising other constitutional rights, including peaceful assembly.\n\nGun rights advocates reacted angrily after senior officials appeared to suggest that Pretti’s lawful possession of a gun justified the agents’ actions.\n\nThe National Rifle Association said such claims were “dangerous and wrong,” urging public figures to await the outcome of an investigation rather than “demonizing law-abiding citizens.”\n\nGun Owners of America said Americans do not surrender their right to bear arms when they protest.\n\nTrump’s remarks also exposed tensions within his own political coalition.\n\nThe president softened the administration’s tone compared with some aides, rejecting the “assassin” label used baselessly by deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to describe Pretti.\n\nBut he did not retreat from the broader argument that armed protesters create an inherent threat to law enforcement.\n\nThat position has drawn criticism from libertarian-leaning Republicans, including Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie, who said that “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence.”\n\nAnd the debate risks reviving accusations of hypocrisy from Trump’s critics.\n\nThe congressional panel investigating the 2021 riot at the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters heard testimony from a senior White House aide that Trump knew some supporters at his rally were armed but demanded security checks be removed to allow them closer — before urging the crowd to march on Congress.\n\nThe contrast has sharpened Democratic attacks and unsettled parts of Trump’s base, particularly after the administration previously defended armed conservatives such as Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted after killing two people with his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle at a 2020 protest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Minnesota Minnesota shooting US President Donald Trump \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a

Tom Tillis, N.C., and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska, on Tuesday called for Noem to leave her post leading DHS, the department charged with overseeing a surge of as many as 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation push. Federal agents fatally shot ICU nurse Alex Pretti there on Saturday, only a few weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tillis called on Trump to fire Noem because of her mismanagement of immigration enforcement in Minnesota.\n\n“I think that what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Tillis told reporters on Tuesday, saying he hadn't decided whether to back a push to impeach Noem. “She should be out of a job.”\n\n“I think it should be a management decision,” Tillis said. “She needs to go.”\n\n“I think that what she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” Sen. Thom ristiTillis told reporters on Tuesday, saying he hadn't decided whether to back a push to impeach Noem. “She should be out of a job.”\n\nMurkowski stopped short of demanding that Trump force out Noem. But she did say she was \"disappointed\" in the DHS secretary and that it was time for Noem to move on.\n\n\"I've lost confidence in her… We would be better served with new leadership at [the] department… I supported her, I supported the nomination, I had great hopes for her in the department, and I've been disappointed,” Murkowski said.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers' comments came after a statement from three members of the House Democratic leadership who said that Noem should be fired or they would launch impeachment proceedings. Even before Pretti's death, an effort to impeach Noem was building on Capitol Hill with the backing of dozens of Democrats. \n\nWhile silent on impeachment, many Republicans have pointedly criticized the administration's response to Pretti's death in which Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller falsely accused Pretti of being the aggressor and acting as a \"domestic terrorist.\" President Donald Trump has sought to turn down the temperature in the days since the killing after video contradicting their statements was widely publicized, removing a key official from Minnesota and sending in border czar Tom Homan.\n\nNot all Republican lawmakers were ready to jettison Noem, however. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told reporters Tuesday that he didn't want to weigh on whether administration officials rushed to judgment on Pretti because he wasn't privy to the same information. He stated that Noem was \"working her butt off\" when asked if he still had confidence in the DHS secretary.\n\nBut other prominent Democrats — including Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn, who calls himself a border hawk and supported Noem's confirmation — called for Trump to fire Noem.\n\nThis isn't the first time there have been reports that Noem would be ousted from DHS. MS NOW earlier reported that Trump administration officials were frustrated with her leadership. Some were annoyed she wasn't moving fast enough to build immigration detention centers and others were unhappy with how she's disbursed federal emergency funds to states.","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/kristi-noem-fired-impeached-tillis-murkowski-republicans","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769562343/260127-kristi-noem-es_116141603675_116141670bdd/260127-kristi-noem-es_116141603675_116141670bdd.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:28:11","author":"Erum Salam","authors":["Erum Salam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":396778486,"title":"The Latest: Trump wants ‘honest’ investigation into ‘very sad’ killing of Minneapolis protester","text":"President Donald Trump said Tuesday a “big investigation” was underway into the killing of protester and ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” the president said as he left the White House.\n\nThe comment is the latest marker of Trump’s sudden turnabout on the issue as his administration confronts growing pushback — including from some Republicans and Second Amendment advocates — on federal agents’ tactics in the second fatal shooting from the aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota.\n\nA day earlier, the White House made an effort to distance Trump from some early comments by high-ranking administration officials who had branded Pretti as a domestic terrorist despite videos of the encounter contradicting their narrative.\n\nImmigration agents were active Tuesday across the Twin Cities region, but it was unclear if officials had changed tactics after the shift in tone from the White House.\n\nThe Latest:\n\n Man tackled to ground after spraying unknown substance on Rep. Ilhan Omar at Minneapolis town hall \n\nThe audience cheered as the man was pinned down and his arms were tied behind his back. In video of the event, someone in the crowd could be heard saying, “Oh my god, he sprayed something on her.”\n\nOmar continued the town hall after the man was ushered out of the room.\n\n▶ Read more about the situation at the town hall\n\n ICE agent rebuffed after attempting to enter Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis \n\nA video of the attempt on social media shows a consulate staffer running to the door to turn the ICE agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.”\n\nOne ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said.\n\nThe State Department didn’t immediately respond to questions.\n\n Two Republican senators say Noem needs to resign \n\nTwo Republican senators are escalating their criticism of how Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem handled Pretti’s death, saying she should step down after characterizing Pretti as having committed “domestic terrorism.”\n\nSen. Thom Tillis slammed Noem’s response, saying, “What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying.”\n\n“She should be out of a job. And I mean, really, it’s just amateur-ish,” Tillis said.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski said it was a “good sign” that Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino has been removed from his role in Minnesota but argued that “accountability goes all the way to the top.”\n\nMurkowski, who voted for Noem’s confirmation, said, “I would not support her again, and I think it probably is time for her to step down.”\n\n 2 federal officers fired shots in encounter that killed Pretti, DHS tells Congress \n\nA Customs and Border Protection official told Congress that one officer fired his Glock and another officer fired his, according to a notification obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body camera footage and agency documentation, according to the notice.\n\nThe agency is required to report in-custody and certain other deaths involving its agents and officers to Congress.\n\nThe notice said officers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, according to the notice.\n\n Authorities release man whose case led judge to order ICE leader to appear in court, lawyer says \n\nFederal immigration authorities have released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom, the man’s attorney said Tuesday.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man, who is identified in court documents as “Juan T.R.,” was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis shortly after 1 p.m. CT that his client had been freed.\n\n▶ Read more about Ecuadorian man’s release\n\n Trump says Minneapolis victim’s parents’ support for him makes him feel ‘even worse’ \n\nTrump called the fatal shootings of two Americans by federal agents in Minneapolis “terrible” and said that hearing that one was the daughter of Trump supporters makes it even worse for him.\n\nRenee Good, 37, was shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Pretti, also 37, was killed on Jan. 24.\n\n“I’m not sure about his parents but I know her parents were big Trump fans. Makes me feel bad anyway. But I mean, I guess you could say even worse,” he said.\n\nTrump made the comments Tuesday in an interview with Fox News in Iowa, where he had flown earlier that day to speak at a rally in the Des Moines area.\n\n Judge issues temporary order barring removal of 5-year-old boy and father who were detained in Minnesota \n\nA federal judge has issued a temporary order prohibiting removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father whose arrest last week in Minnesota quickly become another lightning rod for America’s divisions on immigration under the Trump administration.\n\nU.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nThe father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.\n\n▶ Read more about 5-year-old boy and father who were detained\n\n Trump suggests his shake-up of federal officials in Minnesota may ‘de-escalate’ things \n\nTrump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show” of his sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit.”\n\nThat’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\n Trump says Pretti ‘shouldn’t have been carrying a gun’ \n\nAs he greeted diners in a Des Moines-area restaurant, Trump again weighed in on the Minnesota shooting.\n\n“We view that as a very unfortunate incident, OK?,” he said, adding that everyone “unless you’re a stupid person” viewed it that way.\n\nIn comments that were likely to further irritate his backers who are also strong Second Amendment supports, he said: “I don’t like that he had a gun. I don’t like that he had two fully loaded magazines. That’s a lot of bad stuff.”\n\n Schumer says Noem is ‘incompetent’ and a ‘liar’ and should be fired \n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is “a liar,” “vicious” and “incompetent” and must be fired after the fatal shootings of two Minneapolis protesters by federal authorities.\n\nIn opening floor remarks as the Senate returned to Washington, Schumer said that Democrats will not vote for Homeland Security funding as part of a wide-ranging spending bill passed by the House last week. The government will partially shut down if the Senate doesn’t pass the legislation by Friday.\n\nSchumer said Republicans should strip the Homeland spending portion out of the bill and should not force a vote on legislation “that everyone knows cannot pass.”\n\n“The ball is in Leader Thune’s court,” Schumer said of Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nDemocrats have criticized Noem and other officials for saying Pretti “approached” immigration officers with a gun and acted violently when video evidence appears to show otherwise.\n\nSchumer stopped short of saying that Noem should be impeached as dozens of Democrats have signed on to an impeachment resolution in the House.\n\n Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin supports impeaching Kristi Noem if she’s not fired \n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin where Pretti grew up and graduated from high school, said she supports impeaching Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n“She has to go,” Baldwin told reporters during an online news conference Tuesday. “She needs to be fired or she should resign. ... If impeachment is the way to do it, I’d support it.”\n\nBaldwin also said she would not vote for the DHS funding bill before the Senate without additional accountability measures for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“ICE is out of control and they are wreaking havoc on American cities, including Minneapolis-St. Paul,” Baldwin said. “The question is are my Republican colleagues just going to look away or are they going to join us in adding accountability measures that rein in ICE?”\n\n Minneapolis mayor asks border czar to quickly end immigration enforcement surge \n\nMayor Jacob Frey told Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, that the city will not enforce federal immigration laws, and he asked that the immigration enforcement surge “come to an end as quickly as possible.”\n\nHoman met with Frey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara on Tuesday morning.\n\n“Public safety works best when it’s built on community trust — not tactics that create fear or division,” Frey said in a statement released after the meeting. “I shared with Mr. Homan the serious negative impacts this operation has had on Minneapolis and surrounding communities, as well as the strain it has placed on our local police officers.”\n\nFrey said the city would “remain focused on keeping our neighbors and streets safe.”\n\n Shooting involving Border Patrol leaves 1 in critical condition near US-Mexico border \n\nOne person was shot and in critical condition Tuesday in a shooting involving the Border Patrol near the U.S.- Mexico border, authorities in Arizona said.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department said it was working with the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in response to the shooting in Arivaca, Arizona, a community about 10 miles from the border.\n\nThe shooting involved a Border Patrol agent and a suspect, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department told the Arizona Daily Star.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the FBI did not immediately respond to emails and telephone calls seeking more information.\n\n▶ Read more about shooting involving Border Patrol\n\n Former federal prosecutor lays out road map for prosecuting officers \n\nThere’s a potential path forward for Minnesota prosecutors to charge the federal officers who killed Good and Pretti, a former federal prosecutor said Tuesday.\n\nState officials have complained about a lack of cooperation from federal authorities.\n\nBut former federal prosecutor Anders Folk laid out a potential road map on social media Tuesday. He said there first needs to be a fair, impartial investigation.\n\nIf state charges are then filed, Folk said, the case would likely get moved to federal court. He said a federal judge would then decide whether the officer was shielded by the Supremacy Clause. He said that immunity is not absolute, and whether the case can go forward will depend on the facts.\n\n“Let’s get caught trying to do the right thing and ensure people are held accountable for these unlawful killings,” said Folk, who is running for the job of Hennepin County’s top prosecutor.\n\n House Democratic leader says Noem must go — or face impeachment proceedings \n\n“The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,” said Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a statement.\n\nThe Democrat is the latest in a growing number of voices — from party leaders to advocacy groups to the most centrist of lawmakers in Congress — insisting on dramatic changes in the aftermath of the shooting deaths in Minnesota.\n\n“Kristi Noem should be fired immediately or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House,” said Jeffries, whose party would need GOP support on any legislation to launch such an effort.\n\n“The violence unleased on the American people by the Department of Homeland Security must end.”\n\n Trump disputes staff and says Pretti was not an ‘assassin’ \n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\n Trump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’ \n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\n Trump says Noem isn’t going to resign \n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nHe did not elaborate further.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\n Minnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’ \n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\n Walz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says \n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\n Immigration agents still active across the Twin Cities \n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\n Every living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing \n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that Pretti's killing should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\n Civil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general \n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\n Trump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate \n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\n Minnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration \n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\n Fetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem \n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\n What to know about Gregory Bovino \n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps.

So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\n Trump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’ \n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\n ICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process \n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\n ICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics \n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\n Bovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown \n\nBovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming Pretti had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis.

His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nLawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\n Minnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates \n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Pretti as responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nImportant voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach.

That misuse reportedly benefited private companies, costing the country hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe audit report revealed considerable deficiencies in UHWI’s governance, procurement, and contract management processes, which, if not addressed, ”could increase the risk of corruption and undermine UHWI’s ability to deliver quality health care services”.\n\nNewly-elected President of the JCC, Bishop Garth Minott, has responded.\n\n“The issues raised in the report extend beyond technical or administrative matters. They speak to deeper questions of governance, stewardship, and public trust,” he said.\n\n“Public institutions do not manage abstract resources; they manage funds drawn from the labour, taxes, and sacrifices of Jamaican households,” Minott added.\n\nContinuing, the JCC president said, “Public money is a sacred trust because it is tied to human life and dignity. When that trust is weakened, the consequences are felt most acutely by those who depend on public services at moments of vulnerability”.\n\nMinott argued that from the perspective of the churches, weaknesses in public health governance are never victimless.\n\n“Failures in procurement systems can translate into delayed care, inadequate facilities, inefficient services, and additional costs borne by families already under strain. These burdens ripple outward from the hospital into households and communities, increasing anxiety, disrupting work and family life, and eroding confidence in institutions meant to protect life”.\n\nThe JCC said it was especially mindful that these impacts are not gender-neutral.\n\n“In Jamaica, caregiving responsibilities fall disproportionately on women: mothers, grandmothers, daughters, and female health workers who often absorb the hidden costs of systemic inefficiency. When health systems falter, women carry a greater share of the emotional labour, financial pressure, and unpaid care. Governance failures, therefore, become a matter of gendered injustice, reinforcing inequalities that the nation has long pledged to confront,” the JCC said.\n\nThe umbrella church group noted that the auditor g eneral’s findings are not determinations of criminal guilt.\n\n“We therefore call for all follow-up actions to proceed fairly, lawfully, and without prejudice. At the same time, accountability must be meaningful. Transparency delayed, corrective action postponed, or responsibility blurred only deepens public mistrust and prolongs harm,” it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the JCC is urging the leadership of UHWI, together with the relevant oversight authorities, including the Ministry of Health and Wellness, to respond with clarity and urgency by publishing and implementing a time-bound corrective action plan.\n\nAccording to the JCC, this moment calls the nation to moral reflection. “Hospitals are places where the ethical character of a society is tested; where policy meets pain, and where systems must serve people at their most fragile,” it stated.\n\nThe JCC said it stands ready to support efforts toward reform, restoration, and renewed public confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: AuGD Jamaica Council of Churches JCC UHWI \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Holness departs for International Economic Forum in Panama \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness is scheduled to travel to Panama from Tuesday, January 27 to Thursday, January 29, 2026 for offic... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WATCH: Armed thieves steal seven goats from Sydney Pagon STEM Academy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — Armed thieves made off with seven goats from the Sydney Pagon STEM Academy, firing two shots to scare off security, Monday nig... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Caricom concerned about internal turmoil in Haiti \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n GEORGETOWN, Guyana (CMC) – The 15-member Caribbean Community (Caricom) grouping on Tuesday said that it has noted “with great concern” the “internal t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Animal traceability system to be expanded to goats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The National Animal Identification and Traceability System (NAITS) will be expanded in the new financial year to include the taggi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n TikTok settles hours before landmark social media addiction trial \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n LOS ANGELES, United States (AFP) — Video sharing app TikTok has made an eleventh-hour deal to avoid a landmark United States (US) trial accusing it, a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trinidadian relatives suing US over deadly missile strikes on alleged drug boats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Relatives of two Trinidadian men killed last year in a United States (US) military strike on a boat allegedly carryi... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘You can’t walk in with guns’, says Trump of Minneapolis victim \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — United States (US) President Donald Trump on Tuesday rejected the \"assassin\" label used by a top aide to describe a ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

He did not elaborate.\n\nTrump's chief trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, told Fox Business Network's Kudlow program that he spoke with South Korean officials early Tuesday and would meet with their trade officials in Washington later this week.\n\n\"I think that they are getting the message,\" US Trade Representative Greer said. \"We have nothing in particular against Korea. They're an ally. But when it comes to the economics of all of this, it has to be balanced.\"\n\nGreer said the US trade deficit with South Korea had ballooned to US$65 billion during the previous Biden administration and that was \"not sustainable and it has to change\".\n\nIn a social media post on Monday, Trump said he was raising US duties on imports of South Korean autos and other goods because the Asian ally's parliament had not lived up to its part of a deal he had reached with its president last year.\n\nThe news rattled officials in Seoul, who said they were caught by surprise and left them scrambling to find a response to what could be a blow for the export-heavy country.\n\nGreer told Fox Business that the US had reduced its tariff rate on South Korean goods to 15 per cent from the 25 per cent rate initially planned in exchange for Seoul's pledge to invest US$350 billion in the United States, allow more US cars into South Korea, and eliminate some non-tariff barriers on agriculture.\n\n\"But, in the meantime, they haven't been able to get a bill through to do the investment,\" Greer said, adding that Seoul had also failed to meet its commitments on agriculture and industry.\n\n\"And so it's hard to continue to hold up our end of the bargain while they have not moved forward swiftly enough on their end,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's parliament is not expected to sit for a plenary session until February, when members normally vote on Bills. Currently five bills that would enact the US investment are pending, and ruling Democratic Party members have expressed hope to approve them in February.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea's Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told Reuters the government planned to implement the investment package as soon as possible, while noting that uncertainty over a US Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs expected soon could affect the process.\n\nBut highlighting how the timeline may be stretched, he said the planned investment of US$350 billion was unlikely to kick off in the first half of 2026, given the weakness in the won.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/south-korea-tariff-threat-trump-says-work-something-out-5889816","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--dHrSvtyn--/c_crop,h_449,w_799,x_1,y_1/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2026-01-28T003431Z_2_LYNXMPEM0R00O_RTROPTP_3_","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:18:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":396775144,"title":"Two federal officers fired their weapons in Alex Pretti shooting, DHS says","text":"The DHS report detailing the fatal shooting incident was part of CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility investigation into the encounter.\n\n“CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody.

One way or the other, we're going to do it. If we have to do it a different way, we'll do it,\" he said.Defending his trade approach, Trump claimed his policies were generating massive revenue for the United States.\"But we're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars. We're doing amazing. Nobody can even believe it. Foreign countries cannot believe what's happened. They're studying us, but it won't work.\"His remarks followed developments at the US Supreme Court, which on January 20 issued three rulings but stopped short of deciding the closely watched case challenging the legality of Trump's global tariff policy.The court did not provide any indication on when it might take up the dispute next, maintaining its practice of not announcing in advance which decisions will be delivered on any given day.Reacting to the developments, Trump said he was uncertain about how the Supreme Court would rule, warning that the government could be forced to return hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff revenue if it loses the case.\"I don't know what the Supreme Court is going to do ...

And some politicians, including some Republicans, are again calling for immigration reform.\n\nIn an op-ed in the New York Times, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) proposes a “common-sense bipartisan solution” to the violence and disorder that have accompanied President Donald Trump’s aggressive effort to enforce federal immigration law in Minneapolis. \n\n“Congress and the president need to embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy,” Lawler writes. He praises Trump’s record of stopping illegal border crossings and deporting 675,000 illegal immigrants. “Any balanced immigration policy would preserve and expand on this progress — but humanely,” Lawler writes, calling on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol to “reassess their current tactics.”\n\nAnd then it will be time for immigration reform. “A realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records,” Lawler writes. “This path would be rigorous and fair … those who benefit would face mandatory work requirements, forgo public assistance, and pay fines and any back taxes they might owe.”\n\nWould that work? One thing we know is that this kind of talk has been going on for decades. Multiple failed attempts to pass comprehensive immigration reform have taught a few lessons. The first is that Congress will not secure the border. Just not gonna happen. On the other hand, a president can do it, or not do it. Trump is doing it, but the next president could undo that progress at the border, just as Joe Biden did from 2021 to 2025.\n\nThe second lesson is that Congress will not legislate Trump-level deportation numbers. And even if it did, it would take measures to ensure that its own law is never enforced. Back in 2006, amid another immigration debate, Congress passed the Secure Fence Act, mandating the construction of fencing on significant parts of the U.S.-Mexico border. The next year, it passed a bill saying that nothing in the Secure Fence Act required any actual fencing to be built.\n\nA third lesson is that when considering a “path to legal status” for “long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records,” Congress will create a set of definitions —”long-term,” and “without criminal records” and “work requirements” can be very, very flexible phrases — that ends up including virtually everybody. \n\nTake the notion of “without criminal records.” So what is a criminal record? In the last, biggest comprehensive immigration reform failure, the Senate’s Gang of Eight, lawmakers stipulated that an illegal immigrant could not receive legal status if he had a criminal record. Just what did that mean? Sorry for the long excerpt, but this is from a piece I wrote about the bill in June 2013:\n\nThe Gang bill says an immigrant cannot be legalized if he has been convicted of a felony, or if he has been convicted of three or more misdemeanors. But as far as those misdemeanors are concerned, there are some big exceptions.\n\nThe first is that the misdemeanor count excludes convictions for “minor traffic offenses or state or local offenses for which an essential element was the alien’s immigration status or violations of this Act.” So the government simply will not count immigration-related misdemeanors.\n\nThen, the bill says the three misdemeanors that would disqualify an immigrant count as three misdemeanors only “if the alien was convicted on different dates for each of the three offenses.” What that means is that if a person is accused of multiple misdemeanors, and convicted of them during a single court session — a fairly common occurrence — the multiple convictions would count as just one conviction for the purposes of the Gang of Eight bill, since they all happened on one day.\n\n“Say that because of court backlogs, an alien is awaiting trial on a misdemeanor committed in June,” says one Republican source. “In August, he is again arrested on a misdemeanor, and then a third time in September. Each time he posts bond. In the interest of judicial economy, all three trials are consolidated and held on the same day in December, and the alien is convicted of all three. Three different offenses, but all three convictions occurring on the same date. Under the language of the bill, such an alien is entitled to apply for legal status.”\n\nThe same principle would hold for any number of convictions, if they happened on the same day. The bottom line is an immigrant could have more than three misdemeanor convictions in his background check and still qualify for legalization.\n\nBut that is not the biggest exception in the bill. A few lines later, the legislation gives the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to ignore an immigrant’s record and grant legal status no matter how many misdemeanor convictions the immigrant might have. “The secretary may waive [the misdemeanor requirement] on behalf of an alien for humanitarian purposes, to ensure family unity, or if such a waiver is otherwise in the public interest,” the bill says.\n\nThat’s a lot of flexibility. And it is the kind of language that will emerge in any so-called “common-sense bipartisan solution” that comes out of the legislative process. \n\nDemocrats will be fully on board, of course. After abandoning old-style labor union opposition to mass immigration many years ago, the Democratic Party has embraced legal and illegal immigration. They can be counted on to push for “comprehensive immigration reform,” both because they believe it will help them now politically and because they think it will ultimately mean more voters in the future.\n\nAny new effort is likely to fail, just like the old ones did. What Trump has shown is that simple executive authority, enforcing the law, fixed the border problem. The president also believes it will make a deportation policy work, even after the problems in Minneapolis. The one thing that is not needed is a big new bill on Capitol Hill.","summary":"USING THE MINNEAPOLIS VIOLENCE TO PUSH IMMIGRATION REFORM.&#160;“Comprehensive immigration reform” has failed several times in Congress.

These worries, along with ​uncertainty about Trump’s policies on biofuels and trade with China, threaten to erode his support across the U.S. farm belt. Iowa is the nation’s largest producer of corn, hogs and ethanol.\n\n“If they won, this country would be cratering,” Trump said of Democrats. “I made a lot of people rich that I don’t even like,” Trump said, touting high stock prices.\n\nA visit to the rural heartland\n\nTrump won Iowa in each of ‍the last three presidential elections. Some of the rural voters who were his most loyal supporters are now struggling to make ends meet.\n\nLike many farmers, 56-year-old Iowa corn and cattle farmer Lance Lillibridge said he has been hit hard by a trade war with China and rising costs of seeds and fertilizer, and he hopes the administration will pursue another multibillion-dollar farm bailout.\n\n“Right now everything’s just terrible; I’ve never been so cash poor in my entire life,” Lillibridge said, describing himself ⁠as a Trump supporter “for the most part.”\n\nEven as Trump made his case on the economy, the U.S. dollar sank to a near ​four-year low against a basket of currencies, with traders on Tuesday citing concerns including ‍the prospect of another U.S. government shutdown, White House intervention in central bank policy and Trump’s ongoing tariff threats.\n\n“On the economy, they don’t have a plan; there’s nothing to announce,” said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies ‌at the ‌conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. “They’re not going to roll back tariffs, they’re not going to say we’re going to reduce the deficit. They’re not going to say that attacking the Fed is counterproductive and puts upward pressure on inflation, and they don’t have a plan to make housing more affordable.”\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Sunday showed that 30% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the rising cost of living, while 59% disapproved, including nine in 10 Democrats and one in five Republicans.\n\nTrump’s Republicans are defending narrow congressional majorities in November’s midterm elections, when incumbent presidents’ parties typically lose seats.\n\nIowa will host two highly competitive races ⁠for U.S. House of Representatives seats held by ⁠Republican Representatives Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn.\n\nDifficulty in the U.S. Farm business\n\nStrain in the U.S. farm economy has been mushrooming, from unsold tractors to agribusiness companies reporting shrinking earnings. Abundant grain supplies have weighed on markets, while production costs remain high, leaving crop prices weak for a third straight year.\n\nAlso stressing farmers, the administration has delayed final biofuel-blending quotas for 2026. The quotas are known as renewable volume obligations, or RVOs.\n\nIt has also not finalized tax guidance for renewable-fuel credits known as 45Z, and efforts have ‍stalled on a long-standing priority for corn growers: securing congressional approval for year-round sales of gasoline blended with 15% ethanol.\n\nThose delays have hit Iowa’s biodiesel industry particularly hard. Iowa’s biodiesel plants produced 244 million gallons in 2025, down 31% from 2024, the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said. At full capacity, the state’s plants can produce more than 400 million gallons a year.\n\nTrump on Tuesday said congressional leaders are working on legislation to allow gasoline blends containing 15% ethanol. “They are very close to ​getting it done,” he said.\n\nScott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, said that while Trump’s trade policies have hurt crop farmers, the administration has eased regulations and kept fuel prices lower to maintain support.\n\n“As long as Trump and a Republican Congress are willing to backfill a significant amount of crop losses with special programs, his support will remain solid,” Irwin said.","summary":"CLIVE, Iowa: U.S. President Donald Trump rallied supporters in Iowa on Tuesday as he worked to shore up support in a Midwestern political battleground just south of neighboring Minnesota, where ​a confrontation was escalating over the aggressive tactics of federal immigration agents.\n\n\nThe Republican president traveled to Iowa to rally his stalwart rural supporters in a state that hosts key ‌congressional races in November.\n\n\nMounting stress in the farm economy and delays in biofuel policy are testing the patience of farmers and renewable-fuel producers.\n\n\nREAD MORE: Trump in trouble on immigration, as signature issue turns deadly\n\n\nWhile Trump tries to convince voters he is bringing costs down, his White House is embroiled in a crisis in neighboring Minnesota.\n\n\nOn Saturday, federal immigration agents shot and killed 37-year-old U.S. citizen Alex Pretti during a protest in Minneapolis, sparking widespread demonstrations and calls for independent investigations.\n\n\nPretti was the second American to be fatally ","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40404457/trump-in-iowa-touts-economy-as-protests-roil-neighboring-minnesota","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2026/01/280603329370f98.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:07:28","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":396777842,"title":"Trump Warns of 'Bad Things' if Republicans Lose Midterms","text":"CLIVE, United States: Donald Trump warned Tuesday of \"very bad things\" if Republicans lose the US midterm elections, as the US president kicked off a travel blitz under the shadow of unrest in Minneapolis and voter worries about the economy. At a rally in Iowa -- one of the first stops for primary campaigns in US presidential elections -- Trump said his party must win both the Senate and the House in November despite his own poor approval ratings. \"I'm here because I love Iowa, but I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms. Got to win the midterms,\" second-term president Trump said in his speech. \"If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about -- and it would lead to very bad things.\" But Trump's economy-focused speech was largely overshadowed by events in the neighboring state of Minnesota, where two people have died this month in a deadly immigration crackdown. Trump told Fox News earlier he would \"de-escalate a little bit\" after federal agents shot 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis at the weekend, but he largely avoided talking about it in his speech. The White House says Trump will be making weekly trips across the country ahead of the midterms, in which voters have historically punished US presidents. Trump's team has increasingly focused on the economy after polls showed mounting voter anger over the issue of affordability one year since the billionaire's return to power. In his Iowa speech, the 79-year-old president repeated his claims about a \"Golden Age\" in the United States and insisted prices were falling for most goods. But he admitted that it may be hard to convince voters in November's midterms, saying that in past elections \"if something happens, the screw turns with the voters\" no matter how good the president. - 'Sickos' - Trump has raged at what he calls unfair opinion polls, but numerous surveys have showed him with low approval ratings. A New York Times/Siena poll last week put the figure at 40 percent. With supporters cheering him along in Iowa, Trump, however, returned to a familiar theme of talking about running for a constitutionally barred third term as president. \"Should we do it a fourth time?\" he said, referring to his false claim to have won the 2020 election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, along with winning in 2016 and 2024. Protesters disrupted Trump's speech on at least two occasions, with the Republican dismissing them as \"sickos\" and \"paid insurrectionists.\" Trump, who was accompanied by US Treasury chief Scott Bessent, earlier visited a local diner and talked to patrons. Also accompanying Trump to Iowa was deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration policy, who described Pretti without evidence as a \"would-be assassin.\" The political row over immigration sees Trump in an unusually tight spot of one of his core campaign issues. While polls show most voters approve of his policy of mass deportations, many recent surveys show they are uncomfortable with the harsh tactics of Trump's immigration agents. During his Iowa speech Trump veered off as he often does into talking about immigration, including renewed attacks on Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who is the first Somali-American elected to Congress. Meanwhile Trump faced a fresh blow on the economy too Tuesday as data showed US consumer confidence plunged in January to its lowest level since 2014.","summary":"The White House says Trump will be making weekly trips across the country ahead of the midterms, in which voters have historically punished US presidents","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-republicans-lose-midterms-1933199","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/01/28/2004115-aa-6385158.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:07:26","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.033},{"id":396777536,"title":"Tucker Carlson Presses Peter Schiff On Bitcoin As A New Global Reserve Currency","text":"In a new interview with US media personality Tucker Carlson, gold advocate Peter Schiff renewed his attack on Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry.\n\nSpeaking on Carlson’s show, he argued that Bitcoin is a speculative instrument with “no actual use” and warned that proposals for a US strategic reserve amount to a taxpayer‑funded bailout for early adopters. \n\nSchiff also spent much of the conversation attacking official inflation data and fiscal policy, telling Carlson that Americans are “being lied to” about inflation, and arguing that the government changed the Consumer Price Index so that it could blame the private sector for the higher cost of living, when it was “simply raising prices in response to inflation.”\n\nHe singled out President Donald Trump’s signature Big Beautiful Bill as “the worst thing that we’ve done under Trump,” and argued that the legislation not only preserved all the deficit spending under President Joe Biden, but “made it worse” by “increasing government spending” and cutting taxes.\n\n“Complete waste of capital”\n\nSchiff turned to the crypto industry and complained about the US government “promoting” it, which is a “complete waste of capital” and has caused many Americans to “throw their money away” on crypto.\n\nPeter Schiff discusses inflation, gold and Bitcoin. Source: Tucker Carlson\n\n​When Carlson cuts in to ask, “Why is it throwing it away?” and why betting on Bitcoin is any different from buying gold or stocks, Schiff answers that BTC has “no actual use” beyond speculation and “the only reason anybody wants to buy it” is that “they think the price is going to go up.” “That is the sole source of demand,” he said. \n\nHe added that people who “made money in crypto” only did so because “the crypto that they bought a long time ago went way up,” not because they produced anything of value, or made people’s lives better. \n\n“How’s that different from buying gold? You’re not making anything. You’re not making anyone’s life better,” Carlson interjects, to which Schiff replies:\n\n“There’s a big difference… [Bitcoin] is never going to earn money in the future. It is a non-income-producing digital asset. It’s got nothing in common with gold.”\n\nBitcoin: The new global reserve currency?\n\n​Summarizing Schiff’s arguments about the state of the global economy and the decline in purchasing power of the US dollar, Carlson asks why Bitcoin could not become the next global reserve asset as confidence in the dollar erodes.\n\nSchiff dismisses that idea outright, claiming that a Bitcoin strategic reserve is really just a “Bitcoin bailout fund,” trying to use taxpayer money, and alleging that some early holders “were able to pay off a bunch of politicians and get them to support Bitcoin.”\n\n​He argues that both BTC and fiat currencies are ultimately faith‑based, but that central banks cannot rely on Bitcoin because it has no non‑monetary demand and would collapse if they ever tried to liquidate it at scale. \n\nBy contrast, he calls gold “real money” and “a valuable commodity” used in jewelry, aerospace, consumer electronics and medicine, and says that tokenized, fully backed gold on blockchains can deliver internet‑native payments without creating inflation or relying on ever‑rising token prices.\n\nThe price of gold has been on a tear lately, reaching a new all-time high over $5,000 an ounce on Monday, amid rising global trade tensions, while the Bitcoin price fell briefly below $86,000, signaling a sharp divergence as the precious metal surged 17% in January.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/tucker-carlson-presses-peter-schiff-bitcoin-new-global-reserve-currency","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/019bff3e-e63e-7d39-b5d0-fe8441c6.jpg?itok=jYTJHsYB","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.485},{"id":396773194,"title":"Not allies, not enemies: Britain’s ties with China","text":"Beijing - Britain's Keir Starmer is in China this week, marking the first visit by a U.K. prime minister in eight years and hailed by Beijing as a potential 'new chapter' in relations.It is the latest in a string of Western leaders seeking a rapprochement with Beijing, as U.S. President Donald Trump turns on traditional allies.Starmer hopes to boost trade after years of strained relations, but must balance this with security concerns raised in the U.K. over a potential threat posed by China.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/01/28/world/politics/uk-ties-china-explainer/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2026/01/28/519695.JPG?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:04:44","author":"The Japan Times","authors":["The Japan Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.425},{"id":396775124,"title":"Venezuela's acting president says US unfreezing sanctioned funds","text":"The United States has started unblocking Venezuelan funds that were frozen under sanctions, the South American country's interim president said Tuesday in the latest sign of rapprochement between long-term foes. Caracas has been under US sanctions, including an oil embargo, since 2019, following Nicolas Maduro's first disputed claim to reelection the previous year. During his first term, US President Donald Trump also froze Venezuelan funds in international accounts, which Maduro estimated in 2022 amounted to some $30 billion. \"We are unfreezing resources from Venezuela that belong to the Venezuelan people,\" Delcy Rodriguez, acting as president since Maduro's toppling in a deadly US military operation on January 3, said on state TV. \"This will allow us to invest significant resources in equipment for hospitals -- equipment we are acquiring in the United States and in other countries.\" She did not specify the amount. On Rodriguez's watch, various agreements have been struck between Washington and the interim Venezuelan regime. \"I reaffirm what President Donald Trump has said: that we have established channels of communication marked by respect and courtesy, both with the President of the United States and with Secretary (Marco) Rubio, with whom we are establishing a work agenda,\" Rodriguez said. Rodriguez has sought to improve ties with Trump, who has vowed repercussions if her interim government -- made up of Maduro loyalists -- does not toe Washington's line. This includes granting access to Venezuela's vast oil resources. Trump has since called Rodriguez's leadership \"very strong\" and said the United States is already taking a cut of Venezuela's oil. She insists her country is not under US tutelage. But Rubio is to warn Wednesday that Rodriguez risks the same fate as the deposed Maduro if she fails to comply with Trump's wishes. Rodriguez \"is well aware of the fate of Maduro,\" Rubio is to tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to prepared testimony. \"It is our belief that her own self-interest aligns with advancing our key objectives,\" the text read, with Rubio also warning: \"We are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation.\" - Elections 'not on the table' - Venezuela sits on about a fifth of the world's oil reserves and was once a major crude supplier to the US, with multiple American firms operating in the country until 2007. Another change unfolded in Caracas last week, with the United States confirming Laura F. Dogu -- a former ambassador to Nicaragua and Honduras -- as the new charge d'affaires to Venezuela. That was seen as a step toward restoration of full diplomatic ties severed in 2019. Venezuela's constitution mandates new elections if a president's seat is declared vacant before half their term has expired. Maduro was sworn in in January 2025. His son, Congressman Nicolas Maduro Guerra, insisted Tuesday there was no legal provision for fresh elections in the case of a \"kidnapping,\" as he refers to his father's fate. \"There is no clock running,\" he told AFP in Caracas. \"Elections are not on the table.\" mbj/jt/mel/dga/mlr/md","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/venezuelas-acting-president-says-us-unfreezing-sanctioned-funds-1877877073","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/d2f33b7/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x576+0+0/resize/768x576!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Ff4%2F87c1ab0a7f2f7052882947bc9e45%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:03:29","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":396773306,"title":"Growing Pressure on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Amid Calls for Her Dismissal","text":"In a significant turn of events, a wide array of voices is calling for the resignation of Kristi Noem, currently serving as Secretary of Homeland Security. This demand is not confined to one political spectrum; it stretches from Democratic leaders to influential advocacy groups and even includes some centrist lawmakers in Congress. The catalyst for this outcry has been the tragic shooting deaths of two individuals in Minneapolis, who were protesting against the current deportation policies.\n\nThe incident has become a pivotal moment in Noem’s career, with a noticeable lack of support from her own party. Few Republicans have come forward to defend her position in this growing storm of criticism. Prominent House Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, and Pete Aguilar of California, have voiced their condemnation in a unified statement. They expressed their disapproval by saying, “The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done.”\n\nThe Democratic leaders went a step further, insisting that Noem should be “fired immediately” and warning that if action is not taken, they are prepared to initiate impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. This statement underscores the severity of the situation and the urgency with which they believe it must be addressed.\n\nInitially, the criticism of Noem’s handling of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration was met with skepticism, particularly in a Republican-dominated House. However, the call for her removal has gained momentum and crossed party lines, becoming a significant point of contention and reflection on her leadership.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats call for Noem to step down\n\nWhat started as sharp criticism of the Homeland Security secretary, and a longshot move by Democratic lawmakers signing onto impeachment legislation in the Republican-controlled House, has morphed into an inflection point for Noem, who has been the high-profile face of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement regime.\n\nNoem’s brash leadership style and remarks in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good — in which she suggested Pretti “attacked” officers and portrayed the events leading up to Good’s shooting an “act of domestic terrorism” — have been seen as doing irreparable damage, as events on the ground disputed her account. Her alliance with Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who was recalled from the Minnesota operation Monday as border czar Tom Homan took the lead, has left her isolated on Capitol Hill. \n\n“What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying. She should be out of a job,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. \n\n“I think the President needs to look at who he has in place as a secretary of Homeland Security,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. “It probably is time for her to step down.”\n\nTrump stands by Noem and praises her work\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended Noem on Wednesday at multiple junctures, strongly indicating her job does not appear to be in immediate jeopardy.\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nPressed later during an interview on Fox News if he had confidence in Noem, the president said, “I do.”\n\n“Who closed up the border? She did,” Trump said, “with Tom Homan, with the whole group. I mean, they’ve closed up the border. The border is a tremendous success.”\n\nAs Democrats in Congress threaten to shut down the government as they demand restrictions on Trump’s mass deportation agenda, Noem’s future at the department faces serious questions and concerns. \n\nThe Republican leadership of the House and Senate committees that oversee Homeland Security have demanded that department officials appear before their panels to answer for the operations that have stunned the nation with their sheer force — including images of children, including a 5-year-old, being plucked from families.\n\n“Obviously this is an inflection point and an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and procedures and how they are being implemented and put into practice,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, where Noem had been the state’s House representative and governor before joining the administration.\n\nAsked about his own confidence in Noem’s leadership, Thune said, “That’s the president’s judgment call to make.”\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Noem a “liar” and said she must be fired.\n\nThe fight over funding\n\nAssistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that DHS enforces the laws from Congress, and if lawmakers don’t like those laws, they should change them.\n\n“Too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws,” McLaughlin said. “It’s time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem’s leadership.”\n\nThe ability of Congress to restrict Homeland Security funding is limited, in large part because the GOP majority already essentially doubled department funding under Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts law. \n\nInstead, Democrats are seeking to impose restraints on Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations as part of a routine annual funding package for Homeland, Defense, Health and other departments. Without action this week, those agencies would head toward a shutdown.\n\nTo be sure, Homeland Security still has strong defenders in the Congress.\n\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus said Tuesday in a letter to Trump that he should invoke the Insurrection Act, if needed, to quell protests. The group said it would be “ready to take all steps necessary” to keep funds flowing for Trump’s immigration enforcement and removal operations.\n\nOn the job for a year, Noem has clashed at times with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as Republicans and Democrats have sought greater oversight and accounting of the department’s spending and operations.\n\nNoem has kept a low profile since the Saturday press conference following Pretti’s death, though she appeared Sunday on Fox News. She doubled down in that interview on criticism of Minnesota officials, but also expressed compassion for Pretti’s family. \n\n“It grieves me to think about what his family is going through but it also grieves me what’s happening to these law enforcement officers every day out in the streets with the violence they face,” she said.\n\nOnce rare, impeachments now more common\n\nImpeachment, once a far-flung tool brandished against administration officials, has become increasingly commonplace. \n\nTwo years ago, the Republican-led House impeached another Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, in protest over the then-Biden administration’s border security and immigration policies that allowed millions of immigrants and asylum seekers to enter the U.S. The Senate dismissed the charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said if the Republican chairman of the panel, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, does not launch an impeachment probe, he would.\n\nRaskin said he would work with the top Democrats on the Homeland Security and Oversight committees to immediately launch an impeachment inquiry related to the Minnesota deaths and other “lawlessness and corruption that may involve treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nMore than 160 House Democrats have signed on to an impeachment resolution from Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill.\n\nAssociated Press writers Rebecca Santana, Kevin Freking and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this story.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a significant turn of events, a wide array of voices is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Growing Pressure on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Amid Calls for Her Dismissal first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/growing-pressure-on-homeland-security-secretary-kristi-noem-amid-calls-for-her-dismissal/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Homeland-Security-Secretary-Kristi-Noem-faces-rising-calls-for-her.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 01:02:28","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":396778658,"title":"Oscar-nominated composer latest performer to pull Trump Kennedy Center performance over 'conflict' with values","text":"American composer and Academy Award nominee Philip Glass announced he is pulling the world premiere of his Symphony No. 15, \"Lincoln,\" at the Trump Kennedy Center, claiming there was a direct \"conflict\" between his work and the institution's current leadership. \"Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,\" Glass said in a statement Tuesday. \"Therefore, I feel an obligation to withdraw this Symphony premiere from the Kennedy Center under its current leadership.\" \"Lincoln\" was originally going to be performed at the Trump Kennedy Center June 12 and June 13.

CHEAP TRICK DEFENDS TRUMP-HOSTED KENNEDY CENTER PERFORMANCE AS A TRIBUTE TO KISS In a comment to Fox News Digital, Roma Daravi, vice president of public relations at the Trump Kennedy Center, criticized the decision, suggesting that Glass was canceling due to political pressure. \"We have no place for politics in the arts, and those calling for boycotts based on politics are making the wrong decision. We have not canceled a single show. Leftist activists are pushing artists to cancel, but the public wants artists to perform and create — not cancel under pressure from political insiders that benefit from creating division,\" Daravi said. Jean Davidson, executive director of the National Symphony Orchestra, also told Fox News Digital the orchestra was not informed about this decision until the statement from Glass was released.

Glass was honored at the Kennedy Center in 2018 during President Donald Trump's first term in office. Glass is one of several performers or entertainers who have announced that they would be canceling shows at the center since Trump took over as chairman in February 2025. GRAMMY WINNER ACCUSED OF CAVING TO 'WOKE MOB' AFTER KENNEDY CENTER CANCELLATION In March, \"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda announced he would be pulling a planned production of his musical in protest of Trump's leadership, saying he was \"not going to be part of it.\" Additional performers began canceling their shows after the Kennedy Center’s board voted unanimously to rename the institution the \"Trump–Kennedy Center\" in December.

The drills coincide with President Donald Trump’s announcement of an additional naval deployment, escalating a tense standoff with Tehran.\n\nUS Air Forces Central (AFCENT) stated on Tuesday that the “readiness exercise” is designed to demonstrate the rapid deployment and sustainment of combat aircraft. The operation allegedly aims to validate procedures for dispersing personnel and jets to various “contingency locations” and integrating command with unnamed “partner nations.”\n\n“This is about upholding our commitment to maintaining combat-ready Airmen and the disciplined execution required to keep airpower available when and where it’s needed,” said AFCENT commander Lieutenant General Derek France.\n\nThe aerial drills complement a major naval buildup. US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, accompanied by guided-missile destroyers, entered the region earlier this week.\n\nFurthermore, the US has moved additional F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jets, Patriot missile batteries, and THAAD air defense systems to the Middle East.\n\n“There’s another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump stated during a speech on Tuesday, adding that he hopes Tehran will “make a deal.” He previously asserted the naval force near Iran is larger than the one used in the Venezuelan operation.\n\nThese military movements follow weeks of extreme tension, during which Trump reportedly came close to ordering strikes to “punish” Tehran for its crackdown on violent anti-government protests. While the US president has yet to make a final decision, an unnamed Gulf official told Middle East Eye that Washington is weighing precision strikes against Iranian officials and military commanders.\n\nIran has responded with defiant warnings against “any miscalculations.” Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani stated that Tehran is “fully prepared” for any potential war, emphasizing that any US attack would provoke a “swift and comprehensive” response. This mirrors prior warnings from Iranian military commanders that their forces have their “finger on the trigger.”\n\nThe crisis stems from widespread anti-government protests in Iran triggered by economic collapse, which officials claim left some 3,000 dead.

(AP) — A man who authorities say was involved in a smuggling operation was shot Tuesday in an exchange of gunfire with the U.S. Border Patrol and after firing at a federal helicopter near the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said.\n\nFederal agents were attempting to apprehend the 34-year-old Arizona man near Arivaca, Arizona, when he shot at a Border Patrol helicopter and at agents, the FBI said. Agents returned fire, striking the man and wounding him, the FBI said.\n\nThe man was transported to a hospital and was recovering from surgery Tuesday evening, authorities said.\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the FBI asked it to lead a use-of-force investigation of the Border Patrol. It noted that such investigations are standard when a federal agency is involved in a shooting in the county.\n\nFBI special agent Heith Janke said suspect Patrick Gary Schlegel has a criminal history that includes a 2025 warrant for escape stemming from a smuggling conviction.\n\nHagle was in federal custody and is expected to be charged with a criminal complaint, Janke said.\n\nArivaca is a community about 10 miles from the border. The area is a common path for drug smugglers and migrants who illegally cross the border, so agents regularly patrol there.\n\nThe Santa Rita Fire District said it responded to the shooting and the person who was wounded was in custody.\n\n“Patient care was transferred to a local medical helicopter for rapid transport to a regional trauma center,” the fire district said.\n\nOne level-one trauma center hospital in Tucson declined to release information, and the AP was waiting on a response from another.\n\nThe shooting comes in a month that has seen three shootings — two fatal — by immigration officers involved in the massive Department of Homeland Security enforcement operation in Minnesota.\n\nWhile there were numerous videos of those shootings taken by residents monitoring the enforcement operations in the Minneapolis area, the latest shooting in Arizona happened in a community of about 500 people apparently without any bystander video of the incident.\n\nThe sheriff department said its involvement in the investigation was the result of “long standing relationships” built over time in the border area to promote transparency.\n\nSheriff Chris Nanos, a Democrat, has previously said his agency will not enforce federal immigration law amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown and that he will use his limited resources to focus on local crime and other public safety issues.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to emails and telephone calls seeking more information.\n\nBorder Patrol agents fired weapons in eight incidents during the 12-month period through September 2025, 14 times during the year before that and 13 times the year before that.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-shooting-border-patrol_n_6979597fe4b05884820b3222?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69795981220000558c6d8b9b.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:56:58","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":396778304,"title":"2 federal officers fired shots during encounter that killed Alex Pretti, DHS tells Congress","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said. \n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nThe notification came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nEcuador’s minister of foreign affairs, meanwhile, filed a protest with the U.S. Embassy after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents tried to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis without permission Tuesday.\n\nA video of the attempt on social media shows a consulate staffer running to the door to turn the ICE agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump says a ‘big investigation’ is underway in Pretti’s killing\n\nBy sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nAs he left the White House Tuesday, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti’s killing on Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nTrump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.\n\nThe seemingly softer tone emerged as immigration agents were still active across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics following the shift by the White House.\n\nWalz’s office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.\n\nFrey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they also met with Homan and had a “productive conversation.” The mayor added that city leaders would stay in discussion with the border czar.\n\nHoman posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.” Homan said that Walz, Frey, top law enforcement officials and he all agree that “we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets.” \n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti's killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘maybe it wasn’t good here.’\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man, who is identified in court documents as “Juan T.R.,” was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of Juan’s and other immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis.

At a defining moment in her tenure, few Republicans are rising to Noem’s defense.\n\n“The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,” top House Democratic Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California said in a joint statement.\n\n“Kristi Noem should be fired immediately,” the Democrats said, “or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats call for Noem to step down\n\nWhat started as sharp criticism of the Homeland Security secretary, and a longshot move by Democratic lawmakers signing onto impeachment legislation in the Republican-controlled House, has morphed into an inflection point for Noem, who has been the high-profile face of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement regime.\n\nNoem’s brash leadership style and remarks in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good — in which she suggested Pretti “attacked” officers and portrayed the events leading up to Good’s shooting an “act of domestic terrorism” — have been seen as doing irreparable damage, as events on the ground disputed her account. Her alliance with Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who was recalled from the Minnesota operation Monday as border czar Tom Homan took the lead, has left her isolated on Capitol Hill.\n\n“What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying. She should be out of a job,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.\n\n“I think the President needs to look at who he has in place as a secretary of Homeland Security,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. “It probably is time for her to step down.”\n\nTrump stands by Noem and praises her work\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended Noem on Wednesday at multiple junctures, strongly indicating her job does not appear to be in immediate jeopardy.\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nPressed later during an interview on Fox News if he had confidence in Noem, the president said, “I do.”\n\n“Who closed up the border? She did,” Trump said, “with Tom Homan, with the whole group. I mean, they’ve closed up the border. The border is a tremendous success.”\n\nAs Democrats in Congress threaten to shut down the government as they demand restrictions on Trump’s mass deportation agenda, Noem’s future at the department faces serious questions and concerns.\n\nThe Republican leadership of the House and Senate committees that oversee Homeland Security have demanded that department officials appear before their panels to answer for the operations that have stunned the nation with their sheer force — including images of children, including a 5-year-old, being plucked from families.\n\n“Obviously this is an inflection point and an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and procedures and how they are being implemented and put into practice,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, where Noem had been the state’s House representative and governor before joining the administration.\n\nAsked about his own confidence in Noem’s leadership, Thune said, “That’s the president’s judgment call to make.”\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Noem a “liar” and said she must be fired.\n\nThe fight over funding\n\nAssistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that DHS enforces the laws from Congress, and if lawmakers don’t like those laws, they should change them.\n\n“Too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws,” McLaughlin said. “It’s time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem’s leadership.”\n\nThe ability of Congress to restrict Homeland Security funding is limited, in large part because the GOP majority already essentially doubled department funding under Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts law.\n\nInstead, Democrats are seeking to impose restraints on Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations as part of a routine annual funding package for Homeland, Defense, Health and other departments. Without action this week, those agencies would head toward a shutdown.\n\nTo be sure, Homeland Security still has strong defenders in the Congress.\n\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus said Tuesday in a letter to Trump that he should invoke the Insurrection Act, if needed, to quell protests. The group said it would be “ready to take all steps necessary” to keep funds flowing for Trump’s immigration enforcement and removal operations.\n\nOn the job for a year, Noem has clashed at times with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as Republicans and Democrats have sought greater oversight and accounting of the department’s spending and operations.\n\nNoem has kept a low profile since the Saturday press conference following Pretti’s death, though she appeared Sunday on Fox News. She doubled down in that interview on criticism of Minnesota officials, but also expressed compassion for Pretti’s family.\n\n“It grieves me to think about what his family is going through but it also grieves me what’s happening to these law enforcement officers every day out in the streets with the violence they face,” she said.\n\nOnce rare, impeachments now more common\n\nImpeachment, once a far-flung tool brandished against administration officials, has become increasingly commonplace.\n\nTwo years ago, the Republican-led House impeached another Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, in protest over the then-Biden administration’s border security and immigration policies that allowed millions of immigrants and asylum seekers to enter the U.S. The Senate dismissed the charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Rep.

During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nThe notification came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following Pretti’s death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nBy sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nTrump says a ‘big investigation’ is underway in Pretti’s killing\n\nAs he left the White House Tuesday, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti’s killing on Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nTrump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.\n\nThe seemingly softer tone emerged as immigration agents were still active across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics following the shift by the White House.\n\nWalz’s office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.\n\nFrey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they also met with Homan and had a “productive conversation.” The mayor added that city leaders would stay in discussion with the border czar.\n\nHoman posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.” Homan said that Walz, Frey, top law enforcement officials and he all agree that “we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets.”\n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘maybe it wasn’t good here.’\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom, the man’s attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man, who is identified in court documents as “Juan T.R.,” was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of Juan’s and other immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.","summary":"Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/27/2-feds-fired-guns-in-deadly-alex-pretti-encounter/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26027657623628.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:54:33","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":396778472,"title":"Zipps raids stoke fears for metro Phoenix chefs.

Employees at some locations, including at 59th and Utopia avenues in Glendale, were walked out in zip-tie handcuffs, according to videos shared on social media and obtained by The Republic.\n\nIt was not fully clear what was being investigated at the local sports bar chain, but people in person and online have protested what appears to be an immigration-related situation. The U.S. Attorney's Office said the search warrants were executed as part of a \"criminal investigation into felony violations of federal law\" but had not provided additional details at the time of writing.\n\nValley chefs in particular are worried about what the raids mean both for the employees affected and for the restaurant industry in metro Phoenix more broadly. \n\n“We just don’t know how bad it’s going to get,” Audrey D’Amore, the pastry chef at Stoop Kid, said. “Right now, it seems like they’re targeting really big restaurants, and that’s just going to trickle down the pipeline.” \n\nThe presence of undocumented immigrants is 'this unspoken thing'\n\nThis is at least the fourth restaurant raided in Arizona during the second Trump administration, following Colt Grill, Taco Loko and Sakura Sushi.\n\nThe presence of undocumented immigrants is \"this unspoken thing\" in Arizona’s restaurant industry, D’Amore said. “Almost every restaurant I’ve worked at, I’ve worked with people that are undocumented,” she said. \n\nRestaurateurs are concerned that such a large action, affecting a business with so many locations, is an indicator of future crackdowns targeting restaurants. \n\n'I shouldn’t have to carry my passport'\n\n“We’re going to be losing essential and good food around the Valley,” said Jorge Picos, who runs the food truck Estero Beach Tacos. \n\nFor Picos, the news about the raids brought up memories of questioning that he faced about his citizenship status because of the color of his skin. He’s worried that he or his team of four employees will face similar scrutiny again. \n\n“You’re sitting there feeling helpless because this may happen to you. I’ve already had to experience the questioning, the ‘Can I see proper documentation?’” Picos said. “I shouldn’t have to carry my passport in my pocket.” \n\nZipps raids are alarming to metro Phoenix chefs\n\nWhether or not future raids happen, the Zipps raids have already contributed to an environment of alarm, which chefs fear will be bad for business. \n\n“It’s not only the workforce that is going to be afraid of going to work; it’s going to be the clientele,” said Angelica Urrego, who does catering and Colombian food pop-ups under the name Arepa Babe. \n\nIn early 2025, when President Donald Trump first launched his immigration crackdown, sales dropped at businesses in Latino communities across metro Phoenix, The Arizona Republic reported. \n\nFor chef Silvana Salcido Esparza, owner of the now-closed Barrio Cafe, watching videos of the raids was emotional.\n\n\"This is heartbreaking,\" she said.\n\nA restaurateur’s duty, she said, is not just to serve food, but also to take care of the people in the kitchen. \n\n“Those little chicken wings at Zipps, I promise you, are not going to be the same without those staff members they just pulled out of those kitchens,” Esparza said.\n\nBreaking news: Homeland Security raids Zipps locations in Phoenix area criminal probe\n\nReach the reporter at reia.li@gannett.com.

But no other major Oregon employer has announced made a similar pledge.\n\n“By matching the federal government’s contribution, Intel is reinforcing our longstanding commitment to investing in our people and expanding the ways we support employees’ families as they prepare for the future,” said Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump negotiated an $8.9 billion government investment in Intel last summer, helping to stabilize the faltering chipmaker’s balance sheet.

It still has approximately 16,000 working in Washington County, Intel’s largest site.\n\nThe company has also cut several employee benefits, reducing retirement contributions, placing limits on its employee stock purchase program and scaling back its sabbatical program.\n\nIntel said its “undesired turnover rate” — the share of employees who left Intel without being fired, laid off or bought out — was 7.9% last year. That’s up from 5.9% in 2024 and 5.6% in 2023.","summary":"President Trump negotiated an $8.9 billion investment in the troubled chipmaker last summer.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2026/01/intel-will-match-1000-government-contribution-to-employees-trump-accounts.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/AL46GIDZ3JB3PL3V4WOBDRFEZU.jpg?auth=f852051cd0f47e17e5c8abfa0f56828ca3bcd209ffccc674f4fb787e1f77890b&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:52:57","author":"Mike Rogoway","authors":["Mike Rogoway"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041},{"id":396773018,"title":"Texas halts new H-1B visa petitions at state agencies and universities","text":"Governor Greg Abbott ordered Texas universities and state agencies on Tuesday (January 27, 2026) to halt new H-1B visa petitions, which are used by employers to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, until next year.\n\nThe pause in the red state, which is home to thousands of H-1B visa holders, comes amid actions by the Mr. Trump administration aimed at reshaping the visa program. Critics argue that it has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay and is taking job opportunities from Americans. But supporters say the program is crucial to attract top global talent, fill specialised roles and drive innovation.\n\n“State government must lead by example and ensure that employment opportunities — particularly those funded with taxpayer dollars — are filled by Texans first,” Mr. Abbott wrote in his letter.\n\nBut proponents of the program argue that it is beneficial to the state, and that any pause could worsen existing staffing shortages and hinder universities’ ability to recruit talent.\n\n“Freezing those pathways makes it harder to staff classrooms, research centers, and hospitals across our state, raising costs, straining public services, and hurting Texans in every corner of our state,” Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., Democrat and chairman of Texas Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said in a written statement.\n\nThe pause in Texas, which only applies to state agencies and public universities, is scheduled to last until May 31, 2027. Mr. Abbott’s order does allow exceptions if permission is granted from the Texas Workforce Commission.\n\nMr. Abbott said the freeze will give lawmakers time to “establish statutory guardrails\" for employment under the visa program, allow Congress to modify federal law and allow program reforms by the Trump administration to be implemented. \n\nCurrently, the public university in the state with the most H-1B visas is the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas with 228 visa holders, based on data reported by the U.S. Citizen & Immigration Services in September. The university employees more than 23,000 people, according to their website. University staff did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment on the pause. \n\nOther institutions with H-1B visa holders include: the Texas A&M University in College Station with 214; the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston with 171; the University of Texas at Austin with 169; and Texas Tech University in Lubbock with 143.\n\nWhile there is a wide range of employers who can apply for HB-1 visas — including hospitals, bands and universities — at least 60% of the H-1B visas approved since 2012 have been for computer-related jobs, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nLast year across the country, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Mumbai-based informational technology company Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. In Texas, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation — a multinational information technology company — has the most H-1B visas in the state with 3,172. \n\nAbbott, who along with Republicans alleges that the visas are being abused, plans to review the program’s use. As such, he ordered agencies and universities to provide information on the number of new or renewed H-1B visa petitions last year, visa holders currently sponsored, job titles, countries of origin and visa expiration dates. The Republican also asked for documentation showing employers made an effort to give \"qualified Texans candidates with reasonable opportunity to apply” for positions filled by H-1B holders.\n\nOpinion: Is the American Dream dead for Indians?\n\nAcross the aisle, Mr. Romero argues that H-1B visa holders are “Texans in every way that matters” — saying that they are professionals who “work hard, follow the rules and contribute to our economy.”\n\nMr. Abbott is not the only GOP governor taking action. Last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for fewer H-1B hires, alleging abuse of the program to fill non-specialised roles. On Thursday (January 29, 2026), the Board of Governors, which oversees the Florida’s public university system, is scheduled to discuss pausing the use of H-1B program to hire new personnel until next year.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation last year imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court.\n\nCreated by the 1990 Immigration Act, H-1B visas allow American companies to bring in people with technical skills that are hard to find in the U.S. The visas are good for three years and can be extended another three years.\n\nThe number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master’s degree or higher. Some employers, such as universities and nonprofits, are exempt from the limits.","summary":"Governor Greg Abbott said the freeze will give lawmakers time to “establish statutory guardrails” for employment under the visa program","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/texas-halts-new-h-1b-visa-petitions-at-state-agencies-and-universities/article70559172.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/77cw1y/article70559176.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Immigration_Visas_Texas_60178.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:51:12","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":396772578,"title":"Oil Steady Near Four-Month High On Weak Dollar And Iran Risks","text":"Oil held near a 16-week high after the dollar slumped, while traders also monitored US President Donald Trump's threats against Iran.West Texas Intermediate was near $63 a barrel after jumping 2.9% in the previous session to the highest level since early October.

Trump would also have the power to approve resolutions and suspend them in urgent cases.The resolution is dated Jan. 22 -- last Thursday -- and has not been signed by Trump, which would bring it into force, according to three officials who were briefed on the resolution and verified the authenticity of the obtained copy. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, adding that the resolution was currently under discussion.Live EventsIt was not clear whether the draft was the final text of the resolution.The document resembles a United Nations Security Council resolution, and appears to be an effort by the Board of Peace to formalize some of its plans for Gaza.The notion of establishing a Board of Peace for Gaza was first set out in Trump's 20-point plan, announced last September, for ending the 2-year war between Israel and Hamas that devastated the Palestinian enclave.In November, the U.N. Security Council granted the Board of Peace a mandate as part of U.S.-led efforts to sustain the ceasefire in Gaza.The assumption was that the board would focus solely on Gaza, but the Trump administration said this month that it would address conflicts elsewhere, although the scope of that remains unclear.Though some countries have enthusiastically joined the new international organization after being invited by Trump, others, including close U.S. allies such as France and Britain, have refused. Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said his country would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was \"outside the framework of the United Nations.\"Leaders of nations that signed onto the project would make up the Board of Peace, with Trump as chair, with the power to name his successor, and below that would be an executive board.On Jan. 16, the White House announced the names of seven people who would make up the executive board, including Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. The board is tasked with helping implement the 20-point plan for Gaza.Yet the draft resolution said that Susie Wiles, the president's chief of staff, and Martin Edelman, a New York-based real estate lawyer, would also be part of the executive board. It is the first time their names have been mentioned publicly in relation to the Board of Peace.The draft resolution \"makes clear the United States is in charge of Gaza, with all other countries and entities playing a support role,\" said Michael Ratney, a former U.S. consul general in Jerusalem.Ratney described the resolution as having \"uncertain legal standing,\" but went on to say that \"Gazans are desperate and anything that stands to improve their lives, including the 20-point plan, is worth pursuing.\"According to the draft resolution, the Board of Peace will coordinate the reconstruction of Gaza, an immense project that is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars and take years, and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid there. It also calls for the establishment of \"humanitarian zones\" in the enclave where people would be able to safely access relief.The draft resolution refers to some of the complicated challenges facing Gaza.For instance, it stipulates that people and organizations with \"a demonstrated history of collaboration, infiltration or influence\" with Hamas would not be involved in administering or rebuilding Gaza.Tens of thousands of civil employees and security officers have served in the Hamas-run government, including medical professionals, rank-and-file police officers and rescue workers.The draft resolution also details the role of Nickolay Mladenov, a former U.N. envoy to the Middle East peace process, who was named by the White House as the first high representative for Gaza.According to the resolution, Mladenov will closely supervise the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a body of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer the territory and oversee the police force, and direct all of its \"day-to-day activities.\"This article originally appeared in The New York Times.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onBoard of Peacegazatrumptrump peace boardisraelgaza war\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onBoard of Peacegazatrumptrump peace boardisraelgaza war\n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"Trump peace board: Much about the Board of Peace has so far been unclear, but a draft resolution would allow the chair, Trump, to nominate senior officials who will help administer Gaza, and assign responsibilities.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/board-of-peace-set-to-hand-trump-sweeping-powers-over-gaza/articleshow/127665241.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-127665423,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-262684,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:50:52","author":"Adam Rasgon","authors":["Adam Rasgon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":396778310,"title":"ICE agent rebuffed after attempting to enter Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis","text":"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs has filed a protest with the U.S. Embassy after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents tried to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis without permission Tuesday.\n\nA video of the attempt on social media shows a consulate staffer running to the door to turn the ICE agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” \n\nOne ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said.\n\nThe State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said. \n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nThe notification came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nBy sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nTrump says a ‘big investigation’ is underway in Pretti's killing\n\nAs he left the White House Tuesday, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti’s killing on Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nTrump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.\n\nThe seemingly softer tone emerged as immigration agents were still active across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics following the shift by the White House.\n\nWalz’s office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.\n\nFrey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they also met with Homan and had a “productive conversation.” The mayor added that city leaders would stay in discussion with the border czar.\n\nHoman posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.” Homan said that Walz, Frey, top law enforcement officials and he all agree that “we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets.” \n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti's killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘maybe it wasn’t good here.’\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man, who is identified in court documents as “Juan T.R.,” was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of Juan’s and other immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis.

entering US","text":"Tongan citizen Lionel Funaki fears a United States policy of \"collective punishment\" has ended his dream of studying in Hawaii.\n\nHe's one of many in the Pacific Island nation grappling with the Trump administration's new travel restrictions affecting Tongan nationals.\n\nUnder new immigration restrictions that came into effect on January 1, the US has suspended issuing visas to Tongans for short-term visits, tourism and business purposes.\n\nOnly two weeks after the new rules came into effect, the US State Department, in a separate measure, also said it would suspend processing immigrant visas for people from 75 countries including Fiji.\n\nMr Funaki, who is based in Tonga and used to study in Hawaii at Brigham Young University, said he was saddened by the new measures imposed on Tongan nationals. \n\n\"I was looking forward to continuing my educational journey, but unfortunately, that now looms in limbo,\" he said.\n\nTonga was named alongside 20 other countries in a round of full and partial travel restrictions imposed in December by the Trump administration, as it continued its sweeping immigration crackdown.\n\nThe White House said it included Tonga on the list due to the high number of its nationals — about 14 per cent — who overstayed their visas.\n\nIt also said Tonga had unreliable civil documents and criminal records, lacked birth registration systems, and that its government had refused to share data and repatriate deportees.\n\n\"I would tell everyone that America is a land of hospitality, we love to have visitors — but they have to come here legally,\" US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a November press conference.\n\n\"When they're done visiting, then they need to go home.\"\n\nIn a December statement, US President Donald Trump said countries listed for the new travel restrictions had failed to address concerns raised by his administration about their screening, vetting, and the information they provided about their citizens.\n\n\"Such countries warrant continued or new travel restrictions,\" he said.\n\nRestrictions stir frustrations in Tonga\n\nThe US travel restrictions have caused frustrations in Tonga, which has a large diaspora of citizens living in states such as Utah, Hawaii and San Francisco.\n\nAbout 78,000 people of Tongan heritage were living in the US during the most recent census in 2020, and many regularly travel between the countries.\n\nThe diaspora in the US is an important part of Tonga's economy, having long been the largest source of remittances to the Pacific nation.\n\nThe US has long been viewed as a \"land of opportunity\" for Tongans seeking education, wealth and a higher standard of living overseas.\n\n\"Since the 60s, most of the immigration was the result of Tongans coming through the Church of Jesus Christ [of] Latter-Day Saints,\" said Tongan-born American citizen Semisi Fa'asolo, who lives in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nExperts have also warned that travel bans could pose problems for families hoping to visit US-based relatives on religious or cultural occasions, or to provide support.\n\nThe ABC approached newly-elected Tongan Prime Minister Lord Fakafanua, but he declined to comment.\n\nHis predecessor, 'Aisake Eke, was critical of travel restrictions while in office and signalled his government's displeasure at a proposed ban last year, telling local media it was \"unacceptable\".\n\nIt was a turn in relations nearly three years after Washington opened a new embassy in Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa — a move meant to symbolise that America was re-engaging with the Pacific.\n\nCritics link ban to ICE arrests\n\nMany in the US have also condemned the move, accusing the Trump administration of racism and of being motivated by anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\n\"We need not enact these draconian restrictions,\" Hawaii state senator Jarrett Keohokalole said.\n\nHe said visa overstay rates among Tongans living in the US could instead be solved through diplomacy.\n\nSenator Keohokalole said the new restrictions went overboard and came off the back of a Supreme Court ruling interpreted as empowering US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to racially profile suspects.\n\n\"They're allowed to take into account a person's skin colour … and speech in their investigations,\" he said.\n\n\"Basically what the law now allows is for [ICE] agents to stop, investigate, detain, and potentially arrest anyone that they think resembles a Tongan national.\"\n\nThe ABC approached the US government for comment.\n\nOther critics have linked the US travel restrictions to the Trump administration's controversial ramp-up in arrests of suspected illegal immigrants.\n\nNational Tongan American Society executive director Fahina Pasi said Mr Trump's policies — enforced by ICE on streets around the US — had caused anxiety among the Tongan diaspora.\n\n\"Not too many people are travelling [overseas] for fear that something might happen … that immigration [officials] might not let them back in for whatever reasons they have,\" Ms Pasi said.\n\n\"[Mr Trump is] very racist and is always trying to put people of colour down.\"\n\nMs Pasi said her organisation had been actively advising the community about their legal rights and protections against arrest by ICE personnel.\n\n\"What we tell our people is, 'If you see some strange people coming to your door that look kind of fishy, don't open your door,'\" she said.\n\n\"Slide this red card under and the red card basically says, 'Contact our attorney.'\"","summary":"The United States bars Tongans from short-term visits or travel for tourism and business purposes, saying too many are overstaying their visas.

operation","text":"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, met the mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota on Tuesday in a show of detente, as the White House — facing mounting political pressure — sought to ease the unrest that has gripped the city after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents. \n\nThe move to put Homan in charge of the immigration operation in Minneapolis in place of Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump’s crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president to soften his administration’s aggressive tactics. \n\nSome advisers are concerned that Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, which sparked national outrage, could derail Trump’s immigration agenda. \n\nHoman’s job in Minneapolis is to “recalibrate tactics” and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said. \n\n White House tries to deflect outrage over second fatal shooting of US citizen by ICE\n\n“The goal is to scale back, eventually pull out,” the source added. \n\nA senior Trump administration official said Homan would move away from the broad, public neighbourhood sweeps that Bovino had conducted in Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis and other cities and adopt a more traditional targeted approach. \n\nIn a statement, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he had reiterated to Homan his request that the enforcement action, known as Operation Metro Surge, “come to an end as quickly as possible,” and that city leaders would remain in touch with Homan. The 30-minute meeting also included the city’s police chief. \n\nIn a separate meeting with Homan, Governor Tim Walz said he had outlined the state’s priorities, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and a reduction in the 3,000-strong force of federal agents deployed to the city. Homan and Walz agreed to “continue working toward those goals,” the governor said. \n\nThe president spent the weekend huddling with advisers to reassess the administration’s response to Pretti’s death, according to the same source and a White House official. \n\nAs in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month, some administration officials initially responded by accusing Pretti of “domestic terrorism,” a claim belied by witness video verified by Reuters that showed he posed no threat. \n\nThe discussions included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, recalibrating the mission to focus more narrowly on deportations and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. Trump also weighed whether immigration officers should be required to have body-worn cameras, as many police officers do, according to the White House official. \n\nThe killing of Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents on Saturday during daytime protests, has turned into a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations. \n\nCoupled with the shooting of Good, a mother of three, earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti’s death sparked renewed anger over the federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2026","summary":"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, met the mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota on Tuesday in a show of detente, as the White House — facing mounting political pressure — sought to ease the unrest that has gripped the city after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents. \n\n\n\nThe move to put Homan in charge of the immigration operation in Minneapolis in place of Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump’s crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president to soften his administration’s aggressive tactics. \n\n\n\nSome advisers are concerned that Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, which sparked national outrage, could derail Trump’s immigration agenda. \n\n\n\nHoman’s job in Minneapolis is to “recalibrate tactics” and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said. \n\n\n\n\n  White House tries to deflect outrage over second fatal shooting of U","url":"https://www.dawn.com/news/1969446/trump-shakes-up-minneapolis-immigration-operation","image":"https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69794d6653627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:45:56","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.176},{"id":396776522,"title":"Ready for any move that avoids war, Tehran tells Riyadh","text":"PARIS: Tehran always welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on Tuesday, as a US naval strike force entered Middle Eastern waters. \n\nIran has vowed to hit back against any US strike, while President Donald Trump says he believed Tehran still wanted talks.\n\nThe statements come after unrest erupted in Iran last month over the rising cost of living, which, according to officials, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into what they described as “foreign-instigated riots” involving killings and vandalism.\n\nIn their phone call, Pezeshkian told the Saudi ruler that US threats against the Islamic republic would only result in instability.\n\n“The threats and psychological operations of the Americans are aimed at disrupting the security of the region and will achieve nothing other than instability for them,” his office quoted the Iranian president as saying, adding that “unity and cohesion” of Islamic countries can guarantee “lasting security, stability and peace in the region”.\n\nThe US also maintains several bases in the Middle East, prompting a Revolutionary Guards commander to issue a warning to Iran’s neighbours.\n\n US president says Iran ‘ready for deal’ as naval strike group moves into position\n\n“Neighbouring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency. \n\nIt also lashed out at the EU, after Italy’s foreign minister urged Brussels to go ahead with designating the force as a terrorist organisation.\n\nMeanwhile, the US has announced a major multi-day Air Force exercise in the region, in a bid to “demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower across” the Middle East.\n\nSince Iran earlier this month launched the crackdown on protests accompanied by a blanket internet blackout, Trump has given mixed signals on intervention, which some opponents of the clerical leadership see as the only way to bring about change.\n\nMonitor Netblocks on Tuesday reported intermittent connectivity but warned internet access remained “heavily filtered on a whitelist basis” and users would still need workarounds.\n\n“We have a big armada next to Iran.

At a defining moment in her tenure, few Republicans are rising to Noem’s defense.\n\n“The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,” top House Democratic Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California said in a joint statement.\n\n“Kristi Noem should be fired immediately,” the Democrats said, “or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats call for Noem to step down\n\nWhat started as sharp criticism of the Homeland Security secretary, and a longshot move by Democratic lawmakers signing onto impeachment legislation in the Republican-controlled House, has morphed into an inflection point for Noem, who has been the high-profile face of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement regime.\n\nNoem’s brash leadership style and remarks in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good — in which she suggested Pretti “attacked” officers and portrayed the events leading up to Good’s shooting an “act of domestic terrorism” — have been seen as doing irreparable damage, as events on the ground disputed her account. Her alliance with Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who was recalled from the Minnesota operation Monday as border czar Tom Homan took the lead, has left her isolated on Capitol Hill. \n\n“What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying. She should be out of a job,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. \n\n“I think the President needs to look at who he has in place as a secretary of Homeland Security,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. “It probably is time for her to step down.”\n\nTrump stands by Noem and praises her work\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended Noem on Wednesday at multiple junctures, strongly indicating her job does not appear to be in immediate jeopardy.\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nPressed later during an interview on Fox News if he had confidence in Noem, the president said, “I do.”\n\n“Who closed up the border? She did,” Trump said, “with Tom Homan, with the whole group. I mean, they’ve closed up the border. The border is a tremendous success.”\n\nAs Democrats in Congress threaten to shut down the government as they demand restrictions on Trump’s mass deportation agenda, Noem’s future at the department faces serious questions and concerns. \n\nThe Republican leadership of the House and Senate committees that oversee Homeland Security have demanded that department officials appear before their panels to answer for the operations that have stunned the nation with their sheer force — including images of children, including a 5-year-old, being plucked from families.\n\n“Obviously this is an inflection point and an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and procedures and how they are being implemented and put into practice,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, where Noem had been the state’s House representative and governor before joining the administration.\n\nAsked about his own confidence in Noem’s leadership, Thune said, “That’s the president’s judgment call to make.”\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Noem a “liar” and said she must be fired.\n\nThe fight over funding\n\nAssistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that DHS enforces the laws from Congress, and if lawmakers don’t like those laws, they should change them.\n\n“Too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws,” McLaughlin said. “It’s time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem’s leadership.”\n\nThe ability of Congress to restrict Homeland Security funding is limited, in large part because the GOP majority already essentially doubled department funding under Trump’s big tax breaks and spending cuts law. \n\nInstead, Democrats are seeking to impose restraints on Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations as part of a routine annual funding package for Homeland, Defense, Health and other departments. Without action this week, those agencies would head toward a shutdown.\n\nTo be sure, Homeland Security still has strong defenders in the Congress.\n\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus said Tuesday in a letter to Trump that he should invoke the Insurrection Act, if needed, to quell protests. The group said it would be “ready to take all steps necessary” to keep funds flowing for Trump’s immigration enforcement and removal operations.\n\nOn the job for a year, Noem has clashed at times with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as Republicans and Democrats have sought greater oversight and accounting of the department’s spending and operations.\n\nNoem has kept a low profile since the Saturday press conference following Pretti’s death, though she appeared Sunday on Fox News. She doubled down in that interview on criticism of Minnesota officials, but also expressed compassion for Pretti’s family. \n\n“It grieves me to think about what his family is going through but it also grieves me what’s happening to these law enforcement officers every day out in the streets with the violence they face,” she said.\n\nOnce rare, impeachments now more common\n\nImpeachment, once a far-flung tool brandished against administration officials, has become increasingly commonplace. \n\nTwo years ago, the Republican-led House impeached another Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, in protest over the then-Biden administration’s border security and immigration policies that allowed millions of immigrants and asylum seekers to enter the U.S. The Senate dismissed the charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said if the Republican chairman of the panel, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, does not launch an impeachment probe, he would.\n\nRaskin said he would work with the top Democrats on the Homeland Security and Oversight committees to immediately launch an impeachment inquiry related to the Minnesota deaths and other “lawlessness and corruption that may involve treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nMore than 160 House Democrats have signed on to an impeachment resolution from Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill.\n\nAssociated Press writers Rebecca Santana, Kevin Freking and Joey Cappelletti contributed to this story.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-shootings-kristi-noem-ice-congress-add9ac7b90f5677621009e8a603c0141","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/2360f2d/2147483647/strip/false/crop/8640x5760+0+0/resize/980x653!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F9a%2F1e%2Fd84fb2c4932fd11b0a7a4199a953%2F97ba26b86ca44a2088c7006d7f5961a9","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-28 00:43:53","author":"Lisa Mascaro","authors":["Lisa Mascaro"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22}]}
