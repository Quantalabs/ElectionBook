Trump is the 47th President. Pam Bondi is the Attorney General. And I am now the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Habba wrote on X Thursday. \n\n“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics,” she added. “This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in.” \n\nHabba’s stint as New Jersey’s interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday. \n\nShe was tapped for the temporary role by Trump in March – pending permanent approval – and had 120 days to serve as US attorney in an interim capacity. \n\nThe Garden State’s 17 federal judges — mainly appointed by Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden — opted against extending Habba’s tenure earlier this week and announced the appointment of First Assistant US Attorney in New Jersey Desiree Leigh Grace to lead the office. \n\nGrace was subsequently fired by Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said the DOJ would “not tolerate rogue judges.” \n\nA DOJ official explained to multiple outlets Thursday that Trump withdrew Habba’s nomination to be the state’s US attorney and that she was appointed first assistant US attorney, replacing Grace, and allowing Habba to become acting US attorney of New Jersey. \n\nThe first assistant attorney becomes acting US attorney if the position is vacant. \n\nThe DOJ and New Jersey US Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. \n\nHabba, Trump’s onetime personal attorney, had been blocked from receiving a Senate confirmation hearing by some Democrats in the upper chamber – leaving an extension of her interim status by the state judges or Thursday’s workaround as the only options for her to remain New Jersey’s top prosecutor. \n\nThe New Jersey native had garnered the enthusiastic support of the National Troopers Coalition, National Association of Police Organizations and National Police Defense Foundation since being nominated to the post.","summary":"“I don’t cower to pressure.

He pointed out the need to distinguish between truthful and untruthful claims.\n\n“What I’m worried about is that when these files come out, they will include only the false accusations, but not the information that would show that these accusations are false. Because these judges are, quote, protecting the victims,” Dershowitz told host Greta Van Susteren.\n\nDershowitz said that Maria Farmer, who was one of the first to report Epstein’s abuse in 1996, and Sarah Ransome, who has accused both Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual assault, are not victims, as they have claimed.\n\n“Farmer and Ransome, they’re not victims. They’re perpetrators. They’re criminals. They’re perjurers. They’re people who belong in prison. So we have to separate out the truthful from the untruthful,” Dershowitz said. “And you don’t get that by lists of accusers or anything like that. You get that from real testimony, from people who are there, like Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n\nDershowitz said he hopes Ghislaine Maxwell strikes a deal and receives time served, as she has already served longer than anyone else for a comparable crime. (RELATED: Jonathan Turley Explains Why Ghislaine Maxwell May Be ‘Most Dangerous Witness’ Regarding Epstein)\n\n“So I hope they do make a deal. I hope she gets time served. She’s, after all, served already longer than anybody ever for any comparable crime. And so if she does turn over all of her information, not only her testimony, but her physical evidence, we may finally be able to close the book up,” Dershowitz said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced Tuesday that he plans to meet with convicted sex trafficker Maxwell in the coming days to discuss potential evidence related to Epstein’s case. The Department of Justice has reached out to Maxwell’s legal team to explore whether she is willing to cooperate with prosecutors, following pressure from figures within President Donald Trump’s circle over the handling of Epstein’s sex trafficking operation.\n\nIn 2022, Maxwell received a 20-year prison sentence for grooming women as young as 14 to be sexually abused by Epstein, who was found dead in 2019 in his jail cell while facing sex trafficking charges. Trump’s DOJ leaked memo said Epstein had no “client list” and also said he died by suicide, contradicting long-standing speculation about the involvement of powerful figures in his crimes.\n\nThe announcement followed the Trump administration’s release of “Epstein files” to conservative influencers, which revealed little new information. Prior to the July 6 memo, Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated she was reviewing an Epstein “client list,” only for the memo to assert that no such list existed.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Al Jazeera noted that de Moraes has been overseeing the investigation into whether Bolsonaro attempted a coup following his defeat in the 2022 presidential election to current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Meets King Charles III at Sandringham House in UK, Gifts Him Tree Sapling Inspired by 'Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam' Initiative (See Pics).\nThe case has triggered widespread political debate both domestically and internationally, with Bolsonaro's allies -- including US President Donald Trump -- calling the prosecution politically motivated. Bolsonaro has long denied any wrongdoing, stating during his testimony in June, \"There was never any talk of a coup.\"\nHowever, prosecutors allege that Bolsonaro and his allies plotted to overturn the election results by undermining trust in the vote, declaring a state of emergency, and preparing to suspend the government's functions in order to hold a new election. Al Jazeera reported that Bolsonaro never officially conceded defeat and left Brazil at the end of his term instead of attending Lula's inauguration.\nAlso Read | Russia Plane Crash: PM Narendra Modi Expresses Grief Over Loss of Lives After Russian An-24 Aircraft Crashes in Amur Region, Offers Condolences to Victims' Families.\nAccording to Al Jazeera, his supporters subsequently stormed police headquarters, blocked highways, and ransacked major government buildings -- including the Supreme Court, Congress, and the presidential palace -- in a failed attempt to incite military intervention.\nTrump, in response to Bolsonaro's legal troubles, threatened to impose 50 percent tariffs on Brazilian imports to the US beginning August 1. In a letter, Trump wrote, \"This trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\" He further labelled the proceedings \"an international disgrace.\"\nJustice de Moraes, citing growing international pressure, imposed several restrictions on Bolsonaro last Friday, including house arrest on nights and weekends, confiscation of his passport, an ankle monitor, and a ban on social media use or communication with foreign governments. Bolsonaro later criticised the measures, saying of the ankle monitor, \"This is a symbol of the utmost humiliation.\"\nDe Moraes accused Bolsonaro of delivering a \"speech to be shown on digital platforms,\" raising concerns about a possible breach of the social media ban. He gave Bolsonaro's legal team 24 hours to respond and warned that any violation could result in arrest.\nBolsonaro's lawyers denied any breach and requested clarification on the ban's scope, particularly whether media interviews were permitted. In a court filing on Friday, de Moraes clarified that Bolsonaro is not barred from giving interviews to news outlets and ultimately declined to order his detention, Al Jazeera reported.\nHe warned, however, that any future violations of the imposed restrictions would lead to Bolsonaro's arrest.

Known in real life as Terry Bollea , Hogan suffered a cardiac arrest at his home in Clearwater, Florida on Thursday. Yet behind his towering persona as an all-American hero and larger-than-life entertainer, Hogan was grappling with the pain of a lengthy estrangement from his daughter, Brooke. The 36 year old hadn't spoken to her dad for eight years. While the precise cause of their relationship breakdown was never fully disclosed , it's reported that Hogan remained hopeful they would one day reconcile. \"The last few months of Hogan's life had more highs than lows,\" an insider told the Daily Mail. \"There was a bit of tension with his daughter and their relationship that had taken quite the emotional toll, but he always believed he would eventually be able to mend that.\" His sudden demise has reportedly left those closest to him in shock, reports the Express . \"He was still incredibly close to his son,\" the source added. \"It is a surprise and doesn't feel real at all to his family and friends.\" Hogan's years in the ring took a severe physical toll. Back in April, an insider described his condition as having \"the body of a 140-year-old man.\" In June, he underwent major neck surgery. But even more than his physical decline, insiders say it was the fractured state of his family life that weighed most heavily on him. Earlier this year, Brooke publicly addressed her estrangement from both her parents, alleging she had been \"verbally and mentally abused since childhood.\" However, she emphasised that the allegations were \"not pointed at either person.\" According to TMZ, Brooke and her father did have a conversation before his passing, and she was able to express her love for him. Her husband, ice hockey player Steven Oleksy, reportedly made several unsuccessful attempts to bridge the family divide. While Hogan largely kept quiet about the family rift, his ex-wife Linda was much more outspoken. The 65 year old branded him a \"complete liar\" and a \"sex addict\" in a candid online video shared in March. \"I'm just home by myself today,\" Linda said, tearfully. \"Again, as usual, I'm okay with most things, but today something hit. I don't know what hit, but I look terrible because I've been crying.\" Reflecting on her daughter's absence, she continued: \"She's had twins, she got married, she didn't tell us. She had a huge row with Terry. I don't know how that reflected onto me. But she cut me out, too. I haven't spoken to her for seven years - almost eight years now.\" Linda added that their son, 34 year old Nick, remains a beacon of light in her life: \"God bless Nick.\" However, she reserved her most scathing remarks for Hogan, despite his 2023 marriage to third wife Sky Daily. \"I've given him more opportunities to come back and make us a family,\" Linda said. \"I've never put a Facebook [post] out like this with my ugly face and my crying face, but I have to be honest about what I went through in my marriage with Terry. It's been 20 years and I'm still this sad. Somebody please explain that. I don't know. It just doesn't get better.\" The pair's stormy romance unfolded before the public gaze, especially following their meteoric rise to reality television stardom in 2005 with Hogan Knows Best. Their son Nick battled with life in the limelight, and in 2007 was caught up in a collision that left his 22 year old mate John Graziano with lifelong injuries. Linda petitioned for divorce soon afterwards and started seeing a 19 year old, although the romance fizzled out. In 2012, she was nicked for allegedly being over the limit whilst driving. Hogan faced his own share of drama. He found himself caught up in controversy when a sex tape emerged featuring him with the spouse of his mate and radio host Bubba the Love Sponge. He took gossip website Gawker to court for $100 million and ultimately reached a settlement for $31 million, backed by billionaire supporter Peter Thiel. Despite everything, Hogan kept up his boisterous public image. He started a beer company and stayed a passionate backer of Donald Trump , backing him at the 2024 GOP convention and even suggesting himself as a possible vice-presidential candidate before JD Vance got the nod. However, his reputation took a hit following a 2015 scandal where he was recorded using racist language, including repeated uses of the n-word when discussing Brooke's love life. \"I guess we're all a little racist,\" he said in the recording, which was made public by The National Enquirer. He was met with boos during a rare WWE appearance in Los Angeles earlier this year, as the backlash continued. Despite everything, friends say that Hogan remained focused on mending his relationship with Brooke. \"It has been a very trying few months for Terry,\" a source told the Daily Mail in April, \"but he isn't allowing it to get to him, and he is living his life the way he wants to live it. He's heartbroken that he doesn't have a relationship with his daughter and would love someday to rectify that.\"","summary":"Wrestling legend Hulk Hogan was estranged from his daughter Brooke for eight years before his sudden death at the age of 71, and reportedly held out hope for a reconciliation","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/hulk-hogans-dream-reconciling-estranged-35615035","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35615038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_JS376103068.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 01:02:53","author":"Michael D.

Move to London or Paris,’ another urged. \n\n‘No, we don’t want them back,’ one comment read. \n\nOne person tweeted directly to the president: ‘Donald Trump, quick revoke their visas.’\n\n‘Nooooooooo…’ a user simply said.\n\nOthers quickly shot down the rumors, arguing that Ellen and Portia were remaining in the UK.\n\n‘I think they have two properties in England. They bought this property first, had it renovated, and lived in it for a month before moving to a larger, more modern estate in the same area,’ a commenter clarified.\n\n‘They are moving to a larger house that will accommodate their horses, not coming back to America,’ another affirmed. \n\nIn a rare public appearance in the UK, Ellen told an audience this week: ‘We decided we needed a different house, and now we are selling that house. So if anyone wants a house, it’s a beautiful stone farmhouse!\n\n‘To clarify, I’m not selling the new one we now live in. I’m selling the old stone farmhouse.’ \n\nThe former talk show host also recently revealed that she had decided to stay in the UK ‘for good’ because of Trump’s re-election.\n\nWhen asked if she was staying in the UK because of Donald Trump, she said: ‘Yes. We were hopeful for Kamala. We were very hopeful, and we thought, at least let’s get a place here.\n\n‘The idea was that we would be here for three or four months of the year – but always when we came here, we loved it and we thought it was beautiful.\n\n‘We thought when I stopped the show [The Ellen DeGeneres Show] one day, that it was so beautiful here that we would get a farm here and then go back there.\n\n‘And we got here the day before the election. We woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis. And we were like, “He [Trump] got in. So we are staying here. We are not going back. We are not leaving.”\n\n‘So we bought a house that we thought was going to be a part-time house.’\n\nThe agent’s marketing material describes the home as ‘discreetly set at the end of a long private driveway… beautifully reimagined over the past year to an exceptional standard.’\n\nIt continues: ‘The estate blends period character with sleek, modern design across 43 acres of rolling Cotswold countryside. \n\n‘The main house unfolds around a central landscaped courtyard, a lovely focal point that brings light and flow to the interiors.\n\n‘Designed for both grand-scale entertaining and relaxing, the layout combines sharp architectural detail with a contemporary eye for volume, proportion and finish.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEllen DeGeneres has caused

'How about the Hulkster, how good was he?' the President demanded to a cheering rally crowd last year.\n\nTerry Bollea, alias Hulk Hogan, stood to acknowledge the praise. 'I know about entertainment,' bragged Trump, 'but when he used to lift a 350lb man over his shoulders and bench-press him two rows into the audience – there aren't a lot of entertainers that can do that, right? He is one strong son-of-a-gun.'\n\nFormer wrestling superstar Hogan, who died yesterday at his home in Florida from cardiac arrest, aged 71, campaigned hard to earn Trump a second term in the White House. Often hinting he had ambitions for a career in politics himself – as the President's fitness tsar, perhaps.\n\nHe could certainly match Trump for outrageous political statements. While promoting his own brand of 'Real American' beer during last year's presidential election campaign, he asked a raucous crowd in Ohio if they wanted to see him 'body slam Kamala Harris', the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut it was for his decades in the US wrestling scene that he was internationally famous, once boasting, 'In Mozambique and Malaysia, they know Hulk Hogan – the parents, the grandparents and the kids. It's amazing how many homes I have been into around the world on a consistent basis for 40-plus years'.\n\nBursting out of his trademark leotards, and with a swathe of bandana knotted across his bulging, bald forehead, he was instantly recognisable.\n\nTo a European audience, his massive chest and peroxide horseshoe moustache made him look like a modern-day Obelix the Gaul, as though he'd fallen into a cauldron of magic potion as a baby.\n\nTo American fans, with his reputed 6ft7 physique and arms like an Olympic cyclist's legs, he seemed to be a rubber action figure brought to life.\n\nHulk Hogan gesturing to the audience during his Hulkamania Tour at the Burswood Dome on November 24, 2009 in Perth, Australia\n\nMore recently, Hogan became a celebrity endorser for Trump's presidential campaign in the United States, which he went on to win\n\nHe won six championships with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), counted Andy Warhol among his celebrity fans, and held the record for drawing the spectacle's largest TV audience, 33million viewers – still the most-watched wrestling match in American television history – tuning in to see him fight 7ft4 Andre the Giant in 1988.\n\nWWE was not so much a sport, more a violence-fuelled soap opera, and Hogan understood the largest ego would dominate its storylines.\n\nAt first he played the all-American hero, taking on a succession of wrestler villains in protracted feuds. When the public began to tire of that, he reinvented himself as the king of the villains, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, leader of the New World Order.\n\nHis movies, including Mr Nanny and Suburban Commando, were commercial failures, though he also appeared in Rocky III with Sylvester Stallone.\n\nDespite announcing he was retiring on several occasions, he remained a beloved figure on the wrestling scene until 2015, when online celebrity gossip site Gawker released a video of Hogan – who was married to his second wife, Jennifer, at the time – having sex with a woman, with her husband's encouragement.\n\nHogan sued Gawker for invading his privacy and won, settling for $31million (£23million). Gawker, run by a former Financial Times journalist named Nick Denton, went bankrupt.\n\nBut during the trial, an audio recording was played of Hogan unleashing a racist diatribe at the idea of his daughter Brooke sleeping with a black man. Repeatedly using the 'N-word', he declared: 'I am a racist, to a point.'\n\nIn the 1980s, Hogan was the driving force behind WWE's rise from a regional promotion around New York to an international brand - pictured 1991 - but saw his legacy tainted by a racism scandal in 2015\n\nHis wife Sky(pictured with Hogan during the Jake Paul vs Mike Perry in July 2024) previously claimed his heart was 'strong' after he underwent a routine neck surgery \n\nThe WWE icon passed away early Thursday morning after medics were dispatched to his Clearwater, Florida home, per TMZ - pictured \n\nThe star is pictured with daughter Brooke, second ex wife Linda and son Nick in 2005\n\nHogan is pictured at Trump's campaign rally in NYC in October 2024\n\nHe was suspended from the WWE, but then reinstated in 2018.\n\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953, his mother Ruth was a dance teacher and his father Peter a construction worker. His parents wanted him to be an accountant, and it wasn't\n\nuntil they saw him fight at Madison Square Garden in 1984 that his father admitted that wrestling could be a worthy career. 'That was the greatest night for me,' Hogan said.\n\nIn recent years, he claimed to have stopped drinking and abusing prescription drugs, and found God – calling himself, 'a meat suit filled with the spirit of Christ'. He leaves two children, his daughter and a son, Nick, as well as his third wife, Sky.\n\nHulk Hogan, he said, was always just a persona, a character he played. 'The moment I walk out the front door, the world doesn't want Terry. They say, 'Hey Hulk!' So I say, 'Hey brother, how are you doing!' They expect it.\n\n'But the moment I come home, the headband comes off the bald head, and it's just Terry, dad, father, husband and friend. It's not just a job, but I have learned to separate myself.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nCHRISTOPHER STEVENS: His real name was Terry and his parents hoped he would be an accountant.

(Haiyun Jiang/The New York Times)\n\nPresident Donald Trump locked horns with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during a rare presidential visit to the U.S. central bank on Thursday, criticizing the cost of renovating two historical buildings at its headquarters and pressing the case for lower interest rates. Trump, who called Powell a \"numbskull\" earlier this week for failing to heed the White House's demand for a large reduction in borrowing costs, wrapped up his visit to the Fed's $2.5 billion building project in Washington by saying he did not intend to fire Powell, as he has frequently suggested he would. \"To do so is a big move and I just don't think it's necessary,\" Trump told reporters after the visit. In a post on his Truth Social media site, Trump later said of the renovation, \"it is what it is and, hopefully, it will be finished ASAP. The cost overruns are substantial but, on the positive side, our Country is doing very well and can afford just about anything.\" The visibly tense interaction at the Fed's massive construction site marked an escalation of White House pressure on the central bank and Trump's efforts to get Powell to \"do the right thing\" on rates. It happened less than a week before the central bank's 19 policymakers are due to gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting, where they are widely expected to leave their benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range. The president has repeatedly demanded Powell slash rates by 3 percentage points or more. \"I'd love him to lower interest rates,\" Trump said as he wrapped up the tour, as Powell stood by, his face expressionless.Live Events Powell typically spends the Thursday afternoon before a rate-setting meeting doing back-to-back calls with Fed bank presidents as part of his preparations for the session. The encounter between the two men became heated as Trump told reporters the project was now estimated to cost $3.1 billion. \"I am not aware of that,\" Powell said, shaking his head. Trump handed him a piece of paper, which Powell examined. \"You just added in a third building,\" the Fed chief said, noting that the Martin Building had been completed five years ago. White House budget director Russell Vought and Trump's deputy chief of staff, James Blair, who have spearheaded criticism of the renovation as overly costly and ostentatious, later told reporters they still have questions about the project. The two men, who joined Trump during the visit, have suggested poor oversight and potential fraud in connection with it. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, a Republican who sent Powell a letter on Wednesday demanding answers to his own questions about the renovation, also took part in the visit. Elevated by Trump to the top Fed job in 2018 and then reappointed by former President Joe Biden four years later, Powell last met with the current president in March when Trump summoned him to the White House to press him to lower rates. The visit on Thursday took place as Trump battles to deflect attention from a political crisis over his administration's refusal to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, reversing a campaign promise. Epstein died in 2019. The Fed, in letters to Vought and lawmakers backed up by documents posted on its website, said the project - the first full rehab of the two buildings since they were built nearly a century ago - ran into unexpected challenges including toxic materials abatement and higher-than-estimated costs for materials and labor. Speaking outside of the construction site, Trump said there was \"no tension\" at his meeting with Powell and that they had a productive conversation about rates. FED INDEPENDENCE Ahead of Trump's visit, Fed staff escorted a small group of reporters around the two construction sites. They wove around cement mixers and construction machines, and spoke over the sound of drills, banging, and saws. Fed staff pointed out security features, including blast-resistant windows, that they said were a significant driver of costs in addition to tariffs and escalations in material and labor costs. The project started in mid-2022 and is on track to be completed by 2027, with the move-in planned for March of 2028. A visit to the roof of the Eccles Building, a point of particular scrutiny by critics like Scott, who has complained about \"rooftop garden terraces,\" revealed an impressive view of the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall, according to the pool report. Staff explained that rooftop seating, although inexpensive, had been removed because of the appearance of it being an amenity and was one of only two deviations from the original plan. The other was the scrapping of a couple of planned fountains. Market reaction to Trump's visit was subdued. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds ticked higher after data showed new jobless claims dropped in the most recent week, signaling a stable labor market not in need of support from a Fed rate cut. The S&P 500 equities index closed largely flat on the day. Trump's criticism of Powell and flirtation with firing him have previously upset financial markets and threatened a key underpinning of the global financial system - that central banks are independent and free from political meddling. His trip contrasts with a handful of other documented presidential visits to the Fed. Then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited the central bank in 1937 to dedicate the newly-built headquarters, one of the two buildings now being renovated. Most recently, former President George W. Bush went there in 2006 to attend the swearing-in of Ben Bernanke as Fed chief.

Further, the US emphasis on securing AI-related supply chains opens doors for India to position itself as a reliable manufacturing and services partner,” she said.The US seeks to drive AI adoption as well as AI exports, across hardware, models, software, applications, and standards, to America’s friends and allies around the world, while strengthening AI compute export control enforcement and plugging loopholes in existing semiconductor manufacturing export controls.Allies may also face action if they don’t fall in line.“Globally, America must impose strong export controls on sensitive technologies. We should encourage partners and allies to follow US controls, and not backfill,” the action plan said. “If they do, America should use tools such as the Foreign Direct Product Rule and secondary tariffs to achieve greater international alignment.”The exports and being part of a global AI alliance could accelerate India's own AI ambitions. Encouragement of open-source and open-weight AI models also aligns well with India's vibrant startup and research ecosystem, which could leverage these resources for innovation, said Rohit Jain, managing partner, Singhania & Co.The provision regarding secondary tariffs could however potentially harm India if its foreign policy and trade decisions, especially concerning technology, do not fully align with America's, forcing difficult diplomatic choices, he added.“The US AI action plan has certain positives for India with respect to easing export of the tech stack to allies, which will help boost domestic innovation in India,” said Anirban Mohapatra, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. “The emphasis on local production of hardware will mean that India will need to develop indigenous capacity to create a resilient infrastructure.”Others pointed out that Trump’s call for America-first hiring by tech companies may not gel well with the parallel push for its global AI dominance, as the US has a shortage of AI talent, where India can plug gaps.The US has strong AI research talent but for enterprise-level AI adoption, US companies continue to rely heavily on Indian talent, especially through GCCs that handle large-scale data work, deployment, and AI operations, said Raghav Gupta, founder at AI skilling firm Futurense.Such capabilities cannot be replaced overnight, he said. “The real risk is that protectionist thinking could hurt the very competitiveness US companies are trying to protect. For India, it’s a reminder to keep building, not just for support roles but for leadership in AI.”While the action plan doesn’t explicitly target Indian tech workers, its reforms risk constricting their opportunities. This could potentially prompt firms to scale down recruitment from India, or even limit work visas for Indian nationals, thereby constricting pathways for Indian tech professionals, said Sahiba of The Dialogue.The action plan has a largely pro-innovation stance, which companies like Google and OpenAI had batted for in their submissions. The administration plans to address “bureaucratic red tape” as well as ideological bias in AI. It seeks to remove federal regulations that “hinder AI development and deployment” and seeks private sector inputs on rules to remove.","summary":"This comes on the heels of the US releasing an AI Action Plan, which includes plans for export controls, to shore up American dominance in the global AI race and prevent “adversaries” from getting their hands on critical AI technology.

However, Mr Trump has applied public pressure where he can to force Mr Powell’s hand, or push him out.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Trump arrived at the new Federal Reserve building site in Washington DC, saying he wanted to come down to check what was going on, taking with him a piece of paper with a new sky-high figure for total costs of the build.\n\n“We’re just taking a look at what’s happening,” Mr Trump said.\n\n“It’s a tough construction job. A lot of expensive work.”\n\nMr Trump was accompanied by Republican Senator Tim Scott, from South Carolina, who is also the chair of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\n“One of the reasons we wanted to see it was the overruns of the expenses,” Senator Scott said.\n\n“We wanted to figure out why.”\n\nMr Trump said he was “taking a look” because of new figures, which Mr Powell appeared unaware of at first.\n\n“It looks like it’s about $US3.1 billion,” Mr Trump said, as Mr Powell began shaking his head.\n\n“It’s went up a little bit, or a lot. So the $2.7 is now $3.1,” Mr Trump added.\n\nMr Powell quickly responded, “I’m not aware of that, Mr President. I haven’t heard that from anyone at the Fed.”\n\nMr Trump then handed Mr Powell a folded-up piece of paper, something he claimed was from the Fed.\n\n“This came from us?” Mr Powell asked.\n\n“Yes,” Mr Trump said, adding “I don’t know who does that”.\n\nIt took Mr Powell around five seconds to quickly scan a document he had not seen before he fact-checked the US President in front of the media, pointing out the error in his calculations.\n\n“You’re including the Martin renovation. You just added in a third building,” Mr Powell said.\n\n“I know, it’s a building that’s being built,” Mr Trump responded.\n\nHowever, Mr Powell refused to accept the President’s narrative that costs had blown out by an additional $US400m.\n\n“No, it (the Martin renovation) was built five years ago.

Walz, the governor of Minnesota and one-time running mate of former Vice President Kamala Harris, is threatening to pull out of the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) over concerns it is not doing enough to push back against Trump, according to The Atlantic. The Atlantic reported that two unnamed people \"familiar with the governors' thinking\" shared that at least two Democratic governors — Walz and fellow Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who is head of the Democratic Governors Association — are opting to stop paying their NGA dues this month. The two governors will not renew their membership in the organization out of frustration with its inaction against perceived violations of states’ rights by the Trump administration. TRUMP FOE BOASBERG ORDERS DOJ TO DETAIL STATUS OF CECOT MIGRANTS SENT TO VENEZUELA The concerns raised included the Office of Management and Budget briefly pausing disbursements of federal funds in January, the clash with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills over transgender athletes and Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to respond to the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles. The outlet reported three other unnamed sources saying that Walz and Kelly are not alone and that the offices of other Democratic governors are similarly frustrated with the NGA. One of the unnamed sources said \"when you are also paying dues with taxpayer dollars, it has got to be worth it, and they are going to have to demonstrate that. Right now, they are not doing that,\" the outlet reported. The source also claimed \"there have been ongoing concerns about the NGA among the Democratic governors and staff, off and on, for years.\" MESSAGING WAR OVER TRUMP'S 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' HEATS UP BETWEEN DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS The NGA has existed as a forum for bipartisan collaboration among governors since 1908. The organization lists all 50 governors as well as leaders of five U.S. territories as members. Eric Wohlschlegel, NGA communications director, told Fox News Digital the group \"exists to bring governors from both parties together around shared priorities.\" Amid the Walz-led controversy, Wohlschlegel said NGA’s \"mission hasn’t changed.\" \"Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus,\" he said. \"So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don’t agree, we simply don’t issue one. That’s how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won’t compromise.\" DNC CHAIR SAYS 'WE WANT EVERYONE' IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY INCLUDING 'LEFTISTS' LIKE MAMDANI A source familiar with the situation blamed the controversy on \"Democratic infighting, unspoken campaign jockeying and a few anonymous voices looking to reshape a nonpartisan institution into a political one.\" That source pointed out that, despite all the noise about controversy, the NGA’s summer meeting in Colorado Springs this weekend is expected to have \"record turnout\" with 13 Republican and seven Democratic leaders attending. They also noted that \"no governors are on the record expressing discontent with the NGA. No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised.\" \"What’s behind the noise?\" the source added. \"There’s an internal power struggle currently and no consensus among Democrats right now on how to lead, how to message or how to govern in a divided environment. \"Several Democratic governors are vying for national attention, testing messages for future campaigns rather than collaborating on consensus governance,\" the source added. \"The NGA’s bipartisan model is working exactly as it’s supposed to. DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S AUTOPSY REPORT OF 2024 ELECTION WILL AVOID ASKING IF HARRIS SHOULD HAVE RUN \"When a party can’t agree with itself, it becomes easy to take shots at bipartisan institutions that don’t serve short-term political goals.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, the outgoing NGA chair, and Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, the incoming chair, for comment on the Walz mutiny. Though not addressing the controversy directly, Conor Cahill, a spokesperson for Polis, told Fox News Digital the governor \"has been honored\" to lead the NGA and to \"work across the aisle with governors on education, permitting reform, standing up to federal efforts to strip away gubernatorial authority around the National Guard and elevating the priorities of states.\" He added that \"during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Sitt, who will become NGA chair this weekend, told Fox News Digital \"people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one.\" \"Coming to bipartisan consensus is difficult, but governors from across the political spectrum are addressing the real challenges facing Americans every day,\" Cave said. She said that Stitt \"looks forward to leading this organization and finding more areas of collaboration in the coming year.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to the offices of Walz and Kelly but did not receive responses by the time of publication.","summary":"Dem Gov.

Those documents alleged that Trump colluded with Russia to sway the election in his favor. While discussing the additional reports being released, Watters asked Tarlov if she had read the report “Tulsi dropped.”\n\n“I did not read all 200 pages,” Tarlov responded.\n\n“Well, it wasn’t 200 pages, it was 44,” Watters said. “That’s why I read them, because it wasn’t 200 pages. Did you know that the assessment said that Putin wanted Trump to win, Putin tried to help Trump win, Putin had blackmail on Trump, and that Putin tried colluding with the Trump campaign? All of those things were erroneous, and they cooked the intelligence.”\n\nTarlov pushed back and said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “wanted Trump to win” the 2016 election against then-Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nWatters again asked Tarlov if she had read the report, saying that if she had she “would have known that Putin had no preference who won.” Tarlov said Watter’s argument “has nothing to do” with her claim. (RELATED: Deep State Buried Evidence Russia Did Not Want Trump To Beat Hillary In 2016)\n\n“Well, that’s one of the main points in the report,” Watters said.\n\n“The report is erroneous,” Tarlov said.\n\nAllegations of collusion between Russia and Trump’s first campaign began to circulate at the start of his first administration, with the infamous Steele dossier later becoming the roadmap for the investigation.\n\nAlong with the initial declassified document, Gabbard released a memo saying the agency found that Obama’s DNI James Clapper and the Department of Homeland Security withheld an FBI and NSA press release issued just weeks before the 2016 election, which said they had “low confidence” in Russia’s role in the data leaks.\n\nThe release of the documents came shortly after reports began to circulate that former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan were under criminal investigation for potential wrongdoing related to the infamous Steele dossier.\n\nThe two intelligence officials, during the height of the Russiagate hoax, were vocal about the allegations. Brennan allegedly ignored an email from the then-CIA deputy director warning about the consequences of including the Steele dossier in their 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment.\n\n“No, Jessica, I’m sick of it. We spent years, six figures worth of legal bills for low-level staffers,” Conway said as Tarlov began to cut in.\n\n“You’re saying that Putin didn’t, that the intel, that our intel community and the rest of the world — ” Tarlov began to ask before Conway cut her off.\n\nConway and Tarlov argued back and forth over Trump’s and Putin’s past comments about one another.\n\n“No, no, no. Excuse me, the media needs to own up to being part of this lie for years. Excuse me, 2,000 minutes, that is two days out of a human being’s life, just in coverage of this thing called Russian collusion, which wasn’t true,” Conway said.\n\nTarlov went on to point to the 2019 Mueller report, defending it after Conway called it “a joke” with Watters yelling that there had been “interference” and “collusion.”\n\n“I think that people who said there was collusion, which is a made-up term anyway, should rewrite —” Tarlov said before Conway jumped in.\n\n“No, no, no. I wasn’t talking to people in Moscow,” Conway said. “I was talking to people in Macomb County, Michigan, in Mecklenburg County, in North Carolina. That’s how he won. He won because Hillary was a flawed candidate, and every time you guys have a shitty candidate, you do all these shenanigans to try to stop Trump.

His penis is teeny-tiny, but his love for us is large.\"The episode aired days after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reportedly penned a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount that gives the company global rights.The deal comes at a sensitive time for Paramount, which is trying to secure government approval for a multi-billion-dollar merger with entertainment company Skydance.The CBS parent caused a furor this month when it agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit Trump had brought over an interview the storied \"60 Minutes\" current affairs program aired with Kamala Harris ahead of last November's election.The payment was criticized by Democrats as little more than a bribe to help smooth the merger, with Paramount initially dismissing Trump's lawsuit as meritless.Last week CBS sparked fury after it cancelled \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" whose host is a pointed critic of the president.The network insisted it was a financial decision, but opponents have painted the move as the latest example of American institutions bowing to Trump.","summary":"The White House on Thursday lashed out at the creators of \"South Park\" after the bawdy satire skewered Donald Trump in an episode featuring an AI-generated version of the US president crawling naked through a desert.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/white-house-lashes-out-south-park-trump-parody-3779383","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4612669/south-park-creators-matt-stone-trey-parker-have-incurred-wrath-whote-house-after-season.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=280f07172ba2058e9c7bbf48dd0e4aed","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 00:15:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":344990504,"title":"Alina Habba becomes acting US attorney in New Jersey","text":"“I don’t cower to pressure,” Habba said Thursday evening, one day after Grace, also a Republican, posted to social media that she would assume her former boss’s position. “I am now the acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey,” she said, adding, “This is a fight for justice.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi swiftly rejected the judges’ ruling and terminated Grace’s employment, accusing the judges of attempting to subvert President Donald Trump’s authority over the Department of Justice. Trump said he has “full confidence” that Habba will be confirmed despite the ongoing uncertainty for her role.\n\nBut in a pointed post to LinkedIn Wednesday night, Grace defied the move, saying she was “prepared to follow” the court’s order and “begin to serve in accordance with the law,” possibly as soon as this Friday, when ranking DOJ officials have said Habba’s term is set to end.\n\nThe political calculus behind withdrawing Habba’s nomination serves as a workaround to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which does not allow the nominee for a Senate-confirmed office to hold the post on an acting basis.\n\nBefore the decision to make her acting U.S. attorney, the dispute between the Trump administration surrounded a little-known Civil War-era statute that allows district courts to appoint an interim U.S. attorney once a 120-day appointment expires, a concept that raised significant questions about whether a judge-appointed prosecutor can be removed without the president’s direct involvement.\n\n“If Grace was appointed by the court to be U.S. Attorney under 28 U.S.C. § 546(d), then only the president can remove her,” said former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. “That is a U.S. attorney — not an assistant — and they are presidentially removable.”\n\nThe Trump administration and conservative attorneys have argued that there is no reason why Bondi should defer to the president’s actions in removing Grace, suggesting that doing so only diminishes the role of the president’s leadership selections in the DOJ.\n\nFormer Trump campaign surrogate David Gelman called the judges’ move not to reappoint Habba “ridiculous,” arguing, “Their job is to manage the DOJ. And who is the head of the DOJ? Pam Bondi. She has been put there by Donald Trump.”\n\n“So the president is going to have to go and fire every person in government who their supervisor thinks isn’t performing their duties? It’s a preposterous theory,” Gelman said, describing the judges who declined to extend Habba’s time in her role as “activist” and politically motivated.\n\nRahmani said that judges are typically willing to give an interim appointee some leeway past the 120-day deadline while waiting for the Senate to confirm a nominee.\n\n“It’s not common for a district court to not extend an interim appointment when they haven’t been confirmed,” he said. “Assuming they’re not completely unqualified, courts usually extend the appointment as a matter of course. In this case, they didn’t—and that’s why we’re in the situation we’re in.”\n\nIt remains unclear whether Grace intends to challenge removal from her post. The DOJ did not respond to requests for comment, while Deputy U.S. Attorney Todd Blanche implied to the New York Times that Grace was already fired by the DOJ “pursuant to the president’s authority.”\n\nRahmani added that if Trump fired Grace and no Senate-confirmed or interim replacement was named, Bondi herself would be forced to exercise direct authority over the office. “There will be no U.S. attorney in that district who can do the tasks of the U.S. attorney,” he said. “So the attorney general will have to step in and act for that district.”\n\nThe showdown echoes earlier executive branch fights, such as the 2017 case when Leandra English sued the Trump administration after claiming she, not Mick Mulvaney, was the rightful acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. English eventually dropped her challenge.\n\nIn 2020, a similar controversy erupted when then-Attorney General William Barr ousted Geoffrey Berman after judges attempted to keep him in place beyond his interim term.

We're in the midst of a long, challenging process.'\n\nWilkins was the Raiders' marquee free-agent signing last year, agreeing to a four-year, $110m contract with $82.75m guaranteed.\n\nThe former Dolphins star was expected to bolster a defensive line led by pass rushers Maxx Crosby and Malcolm Koonce after making a career-high nine sacks in 2023 with Miami to go with his elite run-stopping ability. All three linemen, however, suffered season-ending injuries. \n\nWilkins made $29.2m last year and $20.5m this year already, with Las Vegas voiding the remaining $33m he was guaranteed.\n\nHe had two sacks and 17 tackles in five games before injuring his foot, which required surgery, after suffering a Jones fracture - a break of the bone that connects the pinkie toe to the base of the foot. \n\nLas Vegas RaidersTom Brady\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTom Brady's Las Vegas Raiders embroiled in bitter dispute after cutting $110m star in shock decision\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Raiders, who are co-owned by legendary quarterback Tom Brady, have released the player due to the way he handled his rehab from a foot injury he suffered last season, according to reports.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14938747/tom-brady-las-vegas-raiders-christian-wilkins-nfl.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/00/100616347-0-image-m-18_1753400885185.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 00:13:27","author":"Editor,Oliver Salt","authors":["Editor","Oliver Salt"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":344985806,"title":"Trump Mourns Legendary WWE Pro Star Hulk Hogan ","text":"President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has expressed sadness at the death of WWE Pro Wrestler, Terry Bollea, (a.k.a. Hulk Hogan).\n\nThe legendary WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan died aged 71 years on Thursday morning in Florida, USA.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social: “We lost a great friend today, the ‘Hulkster’.\n\n“Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way — Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart,” wrote the American President in tribute to the late pro wrestling star.\n\nWhile Hogan endorsed Barack Obama in 2008, his allegiance shifted to Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn his post, Trump referred to the Hulk Hogan’s famed speech at the RNC.\n\n“He gave an absolutely electric speech at the Republican National Convention, that was one of the highlights of the entire week,” Trump wrote further. “He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed!” Concludes Trump.\n\nSimilarly, American Vice President, JD Vance, remembered Bollea as a “great American icon.”\n\n“One of the first people I ever truly admired as a kid,” Vance wrote on X. “The last time I saw him we promised we’d get beers together next time we saw each other. The next time will have to be on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace.”\n\nIn the official statement released by Hulk Hogan’s Family on Instagram, it \n\nannounced the death and requested for his privacy to be respected at this moment.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that we confirm we have lost a legend,” a post on Hulk Hogan’s official Instagram account says.\n\nHogan passed away “surrounded by his loved ones,” it reads.\n\n“At this time of grief, we ask that everyone please respect the privacy of his family and friends.” He will be missed “but never forgotten”, it adds.\n\nHulk Hogan will be remembered for his wrestling stardom, but also for many, they will remember the various controversies surrounding him.\n\nIn 1994, he testified in the case of Vince McMahon, WWE co-founder, after getting immunity from prosecution. The infamous case saw prosecutors accuse McMahon and WWE of providing illegal steroids to wrestlers.\n\nHogan’s testimony was key in the government losing the case – success for McMahon. But it was seen by some as a betrayal that Hogan even testified against McMahon.\n\nAs was reported earlier, Hogan was removed from the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015 over a racist slur he was caught saying on tape. He was reinstated three years later.\n\nIn 2024, he took aim at the then vice-President Kamala Harris: “Do you want me to body slam Kamala Harris?” while speaking at an event for his new beer.\n\nA one-off appearance at the start of 2025 saw him receive a deafening amount of boos from the crowd, not the entrance expected for one of the greats of WWE.\n\nHulk Hogan was instrumental in wrestling’s 1980s “golden era.” Hogan’s popularity and his rivalries with “Rowdy” Roddy Piper, André Rene Roussimoff – known as André the Giant, “Macho Man” Randy Savage and scores of others made professional wrestling a multi-billion-dollar industry in the 1980s and early 1990s.","summary":"President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has expressed sadness at the death of WWE Pro Wrestler, Terry Bollea, (a.k.a.

Email amber.hicks@mailonline.co.uk \nBy AMBER HICKS \n Published:01:12 BST, 25 July 2025 |Updated:01:12 BST, 25 July 2025 \n\nFor years, Nicola Tappenden was one of Britain's most recognisable Page 3 models, beaming from tabloids and red carpets with effortless glamour. \nBut behind the smiles and photo shoots, she carried a weight she couldn't explain - until a life-changing diagnosis at 41 finally made everything make sense.\n'I spent my life feeling different,' Nicola tells MailOnline. 'Like I didn't fit in. Always asking myself, 'Why did I say that? Why did I do that?'\nThat nagging feeling would follow her through fame and her relationships, including a disastrous romance with TV presenter Jeff Brazier.\nTwenty years earlier, before entering the world of glamour modelling, Nicola worked in compliance at Citibank and lived in Croydon with parents Tina and Steve.\nA light-hearted pub chat with friends about her 'great boobs' led to her entering The Sun's Page 3 Idol contest in 2002. \nShe kept her progress in the competition a secret from work and when her manager found out, he jokingly confronted her. However, the company's HR wasn't so lighthearted and told her she'd boosted office morale, but her time at the bank was up. \nSoon after, Nicola won the contest with over 25,000 votes. The prize: a one-year contract with The Sun, red carpet invites, photoshoots, celebrity parties, and what was sold as a fast track to fame and fortune.\n\nNicola Tappenden - aka Nicola T - was a Page 3 icon in the noughties. Today, aged 42, she isn't just a former model. She's a mother, a businesswoman and a woman who's finally found peace in who she is\n\nThe brunette beauty was the first ever winner of The Sun's Page 3 Idol competition which launched in 2002 (Nicola is pictured here in 2008)\n\nShe was 20, living at home with her parents in Croydon and working for a bank when her friends encouraged her to apply for the contest, which she won after attracting more than 25,000 votes from The Sun readers\n'It was just a massive whirlwind,' Nicola recalls. \nSuddenly, at aged 20 Nicola was walking the red carpet and meeting A-listers at the premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. \nThe following day's paper would see Nicola posing in a barely-there dress with the headline: 'Good Lord, it's Nicola's 2 towers!'.\n'One night I was at a premiere mixing with A-listers, the next morning I was having a bowl of cornflakes with my mum and dad,' she says.\nHowever, she would soon discover the promise of 'fortune' was underwhelming - £1,000 a month.\n'I was earning more at the bank,' Nicola reveals. \n'I got paid £1,000 a month and then £250 a day to attend events but that might be one day a week or one day a month.'\nNicola also found the reality far less glamorous than it appeared. \n\nHours after being announced as the winner of The Sun's Page 3 Idol competition, Nicola was whisked to the premiere of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nThe Sun had a dress made for Nicola, but 'it was horrific,' she recalls. 'I remember feeling so self-conscious and exposed'\n\nThe very revealing Lipsy cream halter neck dress featured a thigh-high split and a pink clasp in the shape of a figure 3\n'I think I did Page 3 for about five years altogether.\n'It just isn't what you think it would be.'\nDespite the public attention, Nicola began to realise that behind the glossy images, her mental health was unravelling. She never felt good enough - not pretty enough, not smart enough and not worthy. \nShe was also subject to a deeply unsettling experience. During a visit to Gibraltar to welcome home Royal Navy officers, Nicola found herself alone in a private room with a group of drunk, high-ranking men.\nThey pressured her to expose herself. Intimidated and alone, she complied - then fled the room in tears. \n'They just kept chanting. I eventually gave in - and I've never felt so ashamed.'\nBack in England, her agent reported the incident. She was sent flowers and an apology - she heard nothing more.\n'I was young and vulnerable, and instead of being protected, I was exposed,' she says.\nDespite the challenges, Nicola became iconic in the Page 3 world. But inwardly, she struggled with relentless self-doubt.\n'I never felt pretty enough. I would obsess over every photo. I just wanted to be liked.'\nShe dated several high-profile men, including footballers Bobby Zamora and Simon Walton, who she welcomed daughter Poppy with. \n\nNicola dated professional footballer Bobby Zamora for a few years. Bobby, she says, opened her eyes to a world beyond Croydon. (The pair at a film premiere in 2006)\n\nShe also dated TV presenter Jeff Brazier for just over a year after meeting at a nightclub event - but the relationship was 'unhealthy'. (The pair pictured in February 2013)\n\nNicola pictured with footballer Simon Walton in 2011. The pair welcomed daughter Poppy together but later split, before rekindling their love years later. They now live together in Surrey \nBobby, she says, opened her eyes to a world beyond Croydon.\n'He lived in a penthouse in Canary Wharf, and showed me a totally different kind of life. He was normal, funny, kind. I'm grateful to him for that.'\nShe later dated Jeff Brazier, TV presenter and ex-partner of the late Jade Goody. Their relationship, Nicola says, was deeply unhealthy from the start.\n'If I'd known then what I know now - about trauma, about myself - I never would have stayed. But I did, because I was desperate to be liked, to feel enough.\n'There was a defining moment, and at that point, I should have said I'm never going to speak to you ever again.' \nMeanwhile, as the Page 3 culture shifted, Nicola became disillusioned. \n'The early days of Page 3 when photographer Beverley Goodway was there were the best,' she says.\n'He created this amazing culture and when the girls got together, we all loved to see each other.\n'It changed when Beverley retired.'\n\nDespite how glamorous the job looked, it wasn't all it seemed. 'I think I did Page 3 for about five years altogether,' says Nicola. 'It just isn't what you think it would be.'\n\nOne of the things Nicola didn't have to worry about during her glamour modelling days was the pressure on looks and social media. 'I would not have been able to hack the trolling,' she says. 'Botox and filler wasn't part of The Sun culture, because we were girls next door. None of us went to the gym. They didn't want ultra skinny girls. They wanted curves and natural beauty.' \n\nNicola quit Page 3 over a bust-up with a fellow model who was being unkind about ex-The Only Way is Essex star Maria Fowler: 'I'm not normally a confrontational person but I just lost it.'\nDuring a calendar shoot, Nicola clashed with another model over their unkind behaviour. To this day, she's unsure if she quit or was pushed out - but either way, she was done. \nShe remains close to fellow ex-Page 3 girls Nikkala Stott and Keeley Hazell.\n'We laugh all the time because they say I got sacked. If I got sacked, I didn't know about it. But I never went on Page 3 again,' she says.\nBy then, Nicola had built a successful business, launched a fashion label, and went on to appear on reality TV shows, including WAGs Boutique and Celebrity Big Brother where she entered the house to boos.\n'Coming out to cheers felt like people were finally seeing me for who I really was,' she says.\nBut the turning point in Nicola's life came at the school gates. A fellow mum suggested Nicola might have ADHD after recognising the same symptoms her daughter had. \nAt first, Nicola was stunned. She then received a professional diagnosis and cried for weeks.\n'It was like someone had lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. I realised there was never anything 'wrong' with me, it was what was right with me.\n'I grieved for that little girl who was constantly misunderstood. The girl who always felt like she was failing and never good enough.'\n\nDespite having brains and beauty, Nicola never felt good enough - not pretty enough, not smart enough and not worthy\n\nA turning point in Nicola's life came years a few years ago, during a chat at the school gates. A fellow mum gently suggested that Nicola might have ADHD. At first, she was stunned. Then came the tears\n\nNicola now lives a quieter life in Surrey with ex-footballer partner Simon - whom she reunited with 12 years after their split - and her two children\n\nNicola and her family. Pictured left to right: Son Louis, partner Simon, Nicola and daughter Poppy\nThe diagnosis reframed her life. It also gave her the tools to help her daughter, Poppy, who has also been diagnosed with ADHD.\nDetermined to support other women like her, Nicola launched Noops, a supplement brand aimed at managing ADHD symptoms. \nShe spent 18 months working with scientists to develop the gluten-free and vegan supplement designed to support brain health, energy, mood, focus and sleep. \n'I didn't want more chemical medication. But the supplement market was overwhelming. So I created what I wished had existed,' says Nicola, who also runs digital consultancy, Belle Digital.\nNow 42, she lives a quieter life in Surrey with ex-footballer partner Simon - whom she reunited with 12 years after their split - and their daughter, Poppy, 16, as well as son Louis, five, who she had in another relationship.\n'Simon and I found each other again and it's definitely where I'm meant to be.'\nNicola no longer chases the limelight - she chases meaning.\n'Celebrity life wasn't good for my mental health. It made me feel desperate, and I never want to feel like that again,' she says. \n\nDetermined to support other women like her, Nicola has launched Noops, a supplement brand aimed at managing ADHD symptoms. She hopes to take it to America \n\n'I didn't want more chemical medication. But the supplement market was overwhelming. So I created what I wished had existed,' she says. The gluten-free and vegan supplement is designed to support brain health, energy, mood, focus and sleep\n\nMeanwhile, Nicola no longer chases the limelight - she chases meaning. She dreams of launching a ADHD support network for women, to help others avoid the pain she endured silently for so long\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by noops (@noopsnootropics) \nShe dreams of launching a ADHD support network for women, to help others avoid the pain she endured silently for so long. \nAnd she has her sights set on taking Noops to America, as well as raising awareness about ADHD in girls.\nShe explains: 'ADHD goes undiagnosed in girls because the traits are so different. In boys, we recognise the traits as being hyperactive and a naughty little boy,\n'But little girls, it's so different. They are almost in a bubble, in a fairy bubble.'\nToday, Nicola isn't just a former model. She's a mother, a businesswoman, an ADHD advocate - and someone who has finally found peace in who she is. \n'There were times I didn't want to be here anymore. But now I know - I was always worthy. I just needed to understand myself first.'\n\nWHAT IS ADHD?\n\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural condition defined by inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\nIt affects around five per cent of children in the US. Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. \nSymptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows. These can also include:\n\nConstant fidgeting \nPoor concentration\nExcessive movement or talking\nActing without thinking\nInability to deal with stress \nLittle or no sense of danger \nCareless mistakes\nMood swings\nForgetfulness \nDifficulty organising tasks\n Continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones\nInability to listen or carry out instructions \nMost cases are diagnosed between six and 12 years old. Adults can also suffer, but there is less research into this.\nADHD's exact cause is unclear but is thought to involve genetic mutations that affect a person's brain function and structure.\nPremature babies and those with epilepsy or brain damage are more at risk. \nADHD is also linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, Tourette's and epilepsy. \nThere is no cure. \nA combination of medication and therapy is usually recommended to relieve symptoms and make day-to-day life easier. \nSource: NHS Choices \nKeeley HazellJeff BrazierNicola Tappenden\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe naked truth about Page 3: Model Nicola Tappenden reveals 'shocking' wages, life-changing diagnosis at 41 and doomed relationship with Jeff Brazier\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Howard Lutnick Headlines Daily Caller Energy Event, Highlights Trump Admin’s Trade Breakthroughs","text":"Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick headlined Daily Caller Live: American Jobs, American Strength, presented by American Beverage Association Thursday morning in Washington, D.C. and highlighted the Trump administration’s recent work on trade deals and combatting harmful Chinese economic practices.\n\nLutnick was interviewed by Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief Dylan Housman. Other panels featured Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, Grover Norquist and ABA President and CEO Kevin Keane moderated by Daily Caller White House Correspondent Reagan Reese, and President of ALEC Jonathan Williams and President of Unleash Prosperity and American Commitment Phil Kerpen moderated by Daily Caller Senior Editor Amber Duke.\n\nLutnick and Housman began the event by touting the Trump administration’s economic wins and new trade deals, particularly that which was reached with Japan in the preceding days.\n\n“When I say it’s historic, what that means is it’s completely intellectually above anything anybody’s ever done before,” Lutnick said of the deal. “They did not want to move a million jobs out of Japan into America … they offered us, and this was my idea and I worked on it for almost six months … they offered and negotiated with the president $550 billion.”\n\n“This is the Japanese government saying to Trump … the Japanese will finance at their cost, any project for national security or that’s important to Donald Trump in the United States of America.” (RELATED: Howard Lutnick Reveals How Trump Admin Secured Massive Trade Deal With Japan)\n\nLutnick also highlighted the $34 billion in tariff revenue the United States is receiving per month, as well as the administration’s work on dismantling non-tariff trade barriers.\n\nThe panel featuring Sen. Johnson, Norquist and Keane focused on the “Job Boom Behind American Made.” Johnson, a three-decade operator of a manufacturing firm in Wisconsin, brought unique insight on the power of deregulation while Norquist focused on the importance of reducing tactics.\n\nThe event closed with the panel of Duke, Kerpen and Williams, who discussed the “Economic Ripple of American Made.”\n\nDaily Caller Live: American Jobs, American Strength, was the second event in the Daily Caller Live series and was streamed to thousands of viewers online in addition to the packed audience at the Waldorf Astoria in Washington.","summary":"Lutnick touted the administration's trade breakthrough with Japan","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/24/howard-lutnick-daily-caller-live-american-jobs/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC0792-e1753402152879.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 00:10:13","author":"Daily Caller Staff","authors":["Daily Caller Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.287},{"id":344990518,"title":"US President Donald Trump declares beef breakthrough with Australia a ‘golden age’ moment, ban lifted","text":"US President Donald Trump has declared a beef victory and a new “golden age of America” after Australia formally opened its market to a wider range of US imports.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, the US President said it had been a historic trade breakthrough between the “great friends”.\n\nBeef imports had been a long-running trade irritation for the President, who singled Australia out over it during his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April.\n\n“After many years Australia has agreed to accept American Beef,” Mr Trump said.\n\n“For a long time, and even though we are great friends, they actually banned our Beef. Now, we are going to sell so much to Australia.\n\n“Let’s keep the Hot Streak going. It’s the golden age of America.\n\n“The other Countries that refuse our magnificent Beef are on notice.”\n\nAgriculture Minister Julie Collins had announced on Thursday that Australia will accept US beef derived from cattle born in Canada or Mexico, provided they are legally imported and slaughtered in America.\n\nMr Trump said the move was “undeniable and irrefutable proof” that American beef is the “safest and best in the entire world”.\n\nDefending the move, the Albanese Government has denied the timing has anything to do with drawn-out tariff exemption talks with the US.\n\n“There is no second chance when it comes to protecting Australia’s livestock from biosecurity threats,” former Liberal frontbencher Jane Hume said on Sunrise on Friday.\n\n“If it’s 99.9 per cent safe that means that there is a one-in-1000 chance it isn’t safe. It’s not unreasonable to ask what it is that’s changed and to understand what the decision has been based upon, to see those documents.”\n\nSenator Hume kept up the attack on the government over the timing of the concession.\n\nAppearing opposite Senator Hume, Health Minster Mark Butler said Australia’s biosecurity officials who assessed the US system were not making political decisions.\n\n“I’m surprised that the same officials who have been serving governments of both political persuasions, very high-grade biosecurity officials, are being questioned by the National Party in this way,” he said.\n\nThe Nationals have called for a review of the science behind the decision.\n\n“This was a biosecurity decision, made by the same officials who made the same decision in relation to US cattle under the former government. It was not a trade decision,” Mr Butler said.\n\nIn a statement released by US agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Friday, she also touted the relaxation by Australia as a “historic win” for American cattle farmers.\n\n“Gone are the days of putting American farmers on the sidelines. This is yet another example of the kind of market access the President negotiates to bring America into a new golden age of prosperity, with American agriculture leading the way,” Secretary Rollins said.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has declared a beef victory and a new ‘golden age of America’ after Australia formally opened its market to a wider range of US imports.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-politics/donald-trump-declares-beef-breakthrough-with-australia-a-golden-age-moment-c-19468629","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19468629/b9128985ef32ee8f84631839d1d9e9c4bcb6f6e1-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-25 00:05:28","author":"Caitlyn Rintoul","authors":["Caitlyn Rintoul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":344981638,"title":"Navigating challenges in Sino-US trade ties","text":"Head-of-state diplomacy has provided crucial guidance for the development of Sino-US relations. It was the telephone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart on June 5 that enabled the two countries to keep their trade relations on the right track through their talks in London along with other efforts.\n\nChina has been faithfully implementing its part of the outcomes from the framework reached during the London talks. This has laid a foundation for their talks in Stockholm from Sunday to Wednesday.\n\nNonetheless, optimism should be tempered. After making initial progress in their negotiations in Geneva and London, the talks in the Swedish capital are likely to address some tough nuts. Not to mention the US has threatened to impose so-called “secondary sanctions” on economies trading with Russia citing the Ukraine crisis. The US also claims to have reached deals with some economies that reportedly contain China-targeted clauses, in an apparent bid to provide itself with more leverages in future trade talks with China.\n\nTo create the necessary conditions to ensure the forthcoming talks remain solution-oriented, the two negotiating teams should implement the common understanding the two leaders have reached, which is necessary to guarantee their discussions focus on what really matters in their economic and trade relations.\n\nAs President Xi pointed out in his talks with US President Donald Trump last month, for the smooth sailing of China-US relations it is particularly important that the two sides steer clear of disturbances and disruptions.\n\nSince the two countries have made some progress in their previous talks, they should continue to make good use of the economic and trade consultation mechanism already in place, and seek win-win results in the spirit of equality and respect for each other’s concerns, as agreed by the two leaders.\n\nChina has always focused on doing its own things well in its quest for high-quality development, high-standard opening-up and innovation-driven growth.\n\nThat also provides new opportunities for foreign companies and investors, including those from the US. A recent report by the US-China Business Council suggests that 82 percent of US companies in China reported making a profit last year, underscoring the common interests and potential for cooperation that exist between the two countries.\n\nThat the country’s total goods imports and exports in yuan-denominated terms rose to 21.79 trillion yuan ($3.05 trillion) in the first half of 2025, up 2.9 percent year-on-year despite the overall world trade being lackluster clearly shows that China is enhancing its capability to resist the headwinds of protectionism and unilateralism.\n\nSo in the process of recalibrating bilateral trade relations, the US side should rationally view China’s development, and recognize the cooperative nature of bilateral relations. It should meet China halfway in that direction in the negotiations.\n\nTo that end, more efforts should be made to guard against the potential disruptions that may pop up from time to time to prevent them from derailing the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.\n\nChina is sincere and principled about its cooperation with the US, and it always honors and delivers what has been promised.\n\nFor the overall benefit of Sino-US ties, both sides should make good on the agreements reached in Geneva and London, and carry on the practical momentum by enhancing communication in such fields as foreign affairs, economy and trade, and law enforcement to consolidate the consensus, clear up misunderstandings, and strengthen collaboration.\n\nEditorial, China Daily","summary":"Head-of-state diplomacy has provided crucial guidance for the development of Sino-US relations.

The disgraced financier was questioned by an attorney of an alleged victim, Vice News previously reported.\n\nIn the clip, the attorney asks: “Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?”\n\nEpstein replied: “Though l'd like to answer that question, at least today l'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.”\n\nTrump has never been accused of any crime in connection with the Epstein investigation and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Pleading the Fifth refers to invoking the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and not self-incriminate.\n\nEpstein once pleaded the Fifth over 1,000 times in a deposition, which addressed his relationships with Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, along with subjects including his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, and his New York mansion. It is unclear whether that deposition, details of which were published in a trove of documents in January 2024, is the same 2010 deposition in which he was questioned about Trump.\n\nIn the 2010 clip, the attorney also asked: “Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?”\n\nEpstein asked what the attorney meant by a “personal relationship.” The attorney rephrased, asking: “Have you socialized with him?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” Epstein responded.\n\nThe attorney questioning Epstein is not identified in the clip.\n\nA deposition involves an individual giving sworn testimony outside of court, and can involve the names of dozens of people, but it does not mean they are implicated in any crimes. \n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung told The Independent that the clip is \"nothing more than out-of-context frame grabs of innocuous videos and pictures of widely attended events to disgustingly infer something nefarious.\"\n\n\"The fact is that The President kicked him out of his club for being a creep,\" Cheung said. \"This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were known to socialize in New York and Palm Beach. The President had called Epstein a “terrific guy” in a 2002 interview with New York Magazine but the pair had a falling out around 2004, The New York Times reports. Trump then barred Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago club “for being a creep,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges and was sentenced to 18 months in a minimum-security facility in Palm Beach County.\n\nIn 2019, Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. He died by suicide in a New York City jail cell about a month after his arrest. \n\nHis associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the only person who has been charged in connection with the Epstein case. The disgraced British socialite is serving a 20-year sentence in a Florida federal prison for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom, and abuse young girls. \n\nThe Trump administration has come under increasing pressure, from both Democrats and MAGA allies, to release more information since the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo on July 6 indicating there would be no further disclosures in the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe memo said there was no “client list” containing names of Epstein’s alleged high-profile associates. However, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had insinuated that the same “client list” was on her desk in February amid a tranche of Epstein files.\n\nThe memo also confirmed Epstein died by suicide, pouring cold water on years of conspiracy theories around his death. The agencies released security footage taken from outside Epstein’s cell in the hours leading up to his death to bolster their findings. But some have argued the footage was altered and has a “missing minute.”\n\nThe president has tried to quell the outrage, directing Bondi to make attempts to unseal grand jury testimony related to the Epstein investigation. Two judges in Florida and New York denied those requests this week on legal grounds.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell. Her attorney, David Markus, told reporters she “never declined to answer” questions and did not invoke any privileges during the meeting. A federal judge rejected a separate request from Maxwell’s attorneys to release grand jury transcripts Wednesday.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer also subpoenaed Maxwell Wednesday as a growing number of lawmakers seek more information on the Epstein files.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had told Trump in May that his name appears in the Epstein Files. The president denied to reporters earlier this month that his name was in the files. Appearing in the files does not indicate that an individual has committed any wrongdoing.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung called the WSJ report “fake news.”\n\nLast week, the WSJ also reported on an alleged 50th birthday card that Trump sent to Epstein. The WSJ described the 2003 note as including a drawing of a naked woman and Trump’s signature made to look like her pubic hair.

States and cities that seek to move homeless people off the streets and into rehab centers are more likely to receive government grants under the directive, which further ties funding to reforming the government’s approach to homelessness by shifting federal funding away from controversial “harm reduction” programs, viewed by critics as enabling homeless drug users. \n\nIn addition, instead of funneling federal funding into programs focused on offering homeless people housing and then treatment, Trump’s directive prioritizes support for programs that require sobriety during treatment and for cities that enforce homeless camping bans. \n\nThe president’s executive order comes after homelessness reached an all-time high in 2024, the same year the Supreme Court issued a ruling relaxing restrictions on states’ ability to regulate homelessness. The court’s decision last June ruled that banning people from sleeping and camping in public areas did not constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. \n\n“Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe,” the president’s “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” order stated, adding that the overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs or have mental health problems.\n\n“The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats,” it added. “Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order. Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens. My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.”\n\nCritics were swift to accuse Trump of taking a “punitive” approach to the homeless crisis on Thursday, with the National Coalition for the Homeless suggesting his executive order makes cities “more dangerous for residents who are poor.”\n\n“Everyone deserves a safe place to live,” said NCH executive director Donald Whitehead, Jr., adding that the order ignores “decades of evidence-based housing” and will only “exacerbate the challenges faced by vulnerable individuals.”\n\nTrump has long railed against the homelessness crisis, particularly targeting the issue in the nation’s capital. \n\n“We have notified the Mayor of Washington, D.C., that she must clean up all of the unsightly homeless encampments in the City, specifically including the ones outside of the State Department, and near the White House. If she is not capable of doing so, we will be forced to do it for her!” Trump said in March. “Washington, D.C. must become CLEAN and SAFE!

Most of the deaths, which include many children, have been in recent weeks.\n\nIsrael imposed a total blockade on Gaza in March and has only allowed a trickle of aid into the territory since late May, triggering a dire humanitarian crisis and warnings of mass starvation.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) warned that “families are breaking down” amid the hunger crisis.\n\n“Parents are too hungry to care for their children,” agency head Philippe Lazzarini said in a post on X. “Those who reach UNRWA clinics don’t have the energy, food or means to follow medical advice”.\n\nThe UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, added that Israel has been preventing it from verifying aid waiting at distribution centres.\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said the situation was deteriorating, with Palestinians clamouring for any aid they can find.\n\n“Enforced starvation, enforced dehydration, and hunger are gripping the Gaza Strip, with more people reported with malnutrition and a severe, acute shortage of food supplies and other basic necessities,” he said.\n\n“According to what we hear from health sources, people’s immune systems are falling apart. They’re unable to fight the many diseases that are spreading because their bodies are unable to fight,” he said.\n\nWith dire conditions on the ground largely unchanged, international condemnation has continued to grow.\n\nOn Thursday, more than 60 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) demanded an emergency meeting to push actions against Israel in a letter sent to European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, Lynn Boylan, an Irish member of the European Parliament, accused EU leaders of a double standard when it comes to Palestinian lives.\n\n“Clearly, Palestinian lives are not seen by the elite in the EU as equivalent to, for example, Ukrainian lives,” Boylan told Al Jazeera.\n\n“There’s a chilling effect, that if you dare to speak up against Israel, if you dare to call out the war crimes that you’re witnessing, there is immediately a backlash and an attack,” she said.\n\nOutrage among European leaders has also soared in recent days, with 28 countries earlier this week condemning the aid blockade, while calling for an immediate end to the fighting.\n\nOn Thursday, the United Kingdom’s government announced Prime Minister Keir Starmer would hold a call with his German and French counterparts, to “discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need”.\n\nBreakdown in talks\n\nAs the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to spiral, negotiations to end the war again broke down, with US envoy Steve Witkoff announcing that his team was leaving negotiations in Qatar early.\n\nThat came shortly after Israel announced it was withdrawing its delegation from the talks.\n\nIn a statement, Witkoff accused Hamas of showing “a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire”.\n\n“We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” Witkoff said, without elaborating.\n\nHamas, which has repeatedly accused Israel of blocking a ceasefire agreement, said it was surprised by Witkoff’s remarks.\n\n“The movement affirms its keenness to continue negotiations and engage in them in a manner that helps overcome obstacles and leads to a permanent ceasefire agreement,” said Hamas in a statement released late on Thursday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has continued to push for a deal, while simultaneously supporting the displacement of Palestinians from the enclave to nearby countries, in what would potentially constitute ethnic cleansing.\n\nFrance to recognise Palestine\n\nLate on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced he would officially recognise the State of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\nMacron said the decision was “in keeping with [France’s] historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”.\n\nThe move will make France the largest and arguably most influential country in Europe to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nThe move was hailed by the deputy of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who said it showed France’s “commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s rights to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state”.\n\nIsraeli officials swiftly condemned the move, with Defence Minister Israel Katz calling it a “disgrace and a surrender to terrorism”.\n\n“We will not allow the establishment of a Palestinian entity that would harm our security, endanger our existence, and undermine our historical right to the Land of Israel,” he said.","summary":"At least 62 Palestinians killed across enclave in Israeli attacks, as two more malnutrition deaths are

Democrats condemn GOP redistricting plans at first public hearing","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nSpeaking to two dozen state lawmakers, a packed hearing room, two overflow rooms and a robust virtual waiting room, Texans condemned the Legislature’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional map at the House redistricting committee’s first public meeting on Thursday.\n\n“When I saw what you folks were doing up here in the Legislature, I got screaming mad,” said Christy Stockman, from Corpus Christi. “It’s a good old fashioned bait-and-switch, with a power grab added in.”\n\nAt the first of seven public hearings, Democratic lawmakers echoed these calls, pressing their Republican colleagues on why redistricting was being pushed through during an overtime special legislative session.\n\n“The effort to change these districts at this time has nothing to do with representing people better,” said Rep. Jon Rosenthal, a Houston Democrat and vice chair of the House committee in charge of redistricting. “It's the opposite of that. It's a power grab at the expense of Black and brown communities.”\n\nThe unusual attempt to redraw the congressional map in the middle of the decade comes after pressure from President Donald Trump, who wants to pad Republicans’ narrow majority in the U.S. House ahead of a potentially tough midterm election.\n\nThe Legislature has not yet revealed any proposed revisions of the existing map, which was drawn in 2021 and has since reliably yielded 25 seats for Republicans, and 13 for Democrats. Rep. Cody Vasut, the Angleton Republican chairing the House redistricting committee, said the information gathered at the hearings will shape whether and how the maps are redrawn.\n\n“I’ve never gone to a hearing where I didn’t leave thinking about something a little differently,” Vasut told The Texas Tribune on Thursday. “We really want to hear from people on this, and we are listening.”\n\nBut many at the hearing, including Democratic lawmakers, condemned the hearings as a sham, saying the map has likely already been drawn by Trump’s political team.\n\n“That's what's at stake here, whether you all are going to work for the people of Texas, as we used to do, to try to do, or whether you take your commandments from Donald Trump and the White House,” said U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a San Antonio Democrat. “I hope that you all will choose to do the business of the people of Texas, as this body has a history of being independent from the federal government.”\n\nTexas, like all states, redraws its electoral lines every ten years, after the census shows who has moved where over the intervening decade. While there’s no law against redrawing the lines more often, it’s uncommon — the last time Texas did a midcycle redistricting was 2003, after Republicans gained control of both chambers of the Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nThis time, it appears the impetus is coming from the federal government. A few weeks after Trump reportedly began pushing this idea, the Department of Justice issued a letter telling Texas leaders that four of the state’s congressional districts were unconstitutionally drawn based on race. Gov. Greg Abbott added redistricting to the special session agenda, citing “constitutional concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice,” even as Attorney General Ken Paxton claimed in a letter to the DOJ that the districts were drawn race blind.\n\nRepresentatives for the state have repeatedly used the same argument to defend the current maps in court.\n\nAt a rally outside the Capitol before Thursday’s hearing, former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke accused Trump and Abbott of being “thick as thieves.”\n\n“In order to continue this consolidation of authoritarian power and to destroy this democracy once and for all, [Trump] has to retain control in the United States House of Representatives, where he currently has a very narrow majority,” said O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso. “And it turns out that the policies and the programs that he pursues are deeply unpopular with the American people.”\n\nTrump has reportedly asked Texas lawmakers to try to add five additional GOP seats, which will necessarily involve slicing up existing Democratic districts, many of which are made up of mostly Black and Hispanic voters.\n\nGabriel Rosales, with the League of United Latin American Citizens, told lawmakers that this is part of Texas’ long history of disenfranchising Hispanic voters.\n\n“It's very demoralizing that we can do as much as we can to contribute … but we don't have representation on water boards, on school boards and city councils across the state,” Rosales said. “And then people ask why Latinos don’t vote.”\n\nGary Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP, said the state’s current maps already under-represent Latino voters, and this proposed switch will likely worsen it. He said it felt like lawmakers were just “checking the box” with the hearings before pushing forward with the maps Trump wanted to see.\n\n“There's no real consequence to what we say and, no disrespect, but we have been disregarded in the past,” Bledsoe said.\n\nDemocrats have vowed to do what they can to thwart the process, so far dragging out debate over the rules and meticulously questioning each witness at Thursday’s hearing. It took almost 45 minutes to get through the first three of over 170 registered witnesses.\n\nThey also grilled Vasut on why Republicans were moving to redraw district lines now. Rep. Gene Wu of Houston, the House Democratic Caucus chair, asked Vasut whether he knew of any member of the Texas Legislature who had asked Abbott to take up mid-decade redistricting. Vasut said he was not personally aware, but said it was “prudent and proper” for lawmakers to follow the governor’s special session agenda.\n\n“There is no obligation for us to do this at all — at all,” said Rep. Joe Moody, an El Paso Democrat.\n\nThursday was the first of three House redistricting hearings, each slated to last no more than five hours. The next will take place Saturday in Houston, followed by a Monday hearing in Arlington. Vasut encouraged people to submit comments through an online portal.\n\nThe Senate has scheduled four hearings, all virtual, starting Friday at 10 a.m.\n\nThe lineup for The Texas Tribune Festival continues to grow!

Robert Garcia, of Long Beach, demands full transparency of Epstein files","text":"One month into his role as the top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia on Thursday, July 24, signaled his intention to keep up the pressure to ensure that all federal files related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation are fully released.\n\nGarcia, D-Long Beach, claimed a win for Democrats after one of the Oversight Committee’s subcommittees voted Wednesday to subpoena the U.S. Department of Justice for files on the Epstein case. The vote was 8-2, with three Republicans joining the four Democrats on the subcommittee on federal law enforcement, including Garcia, in supporting the subpoena.\n\nGarcia called the vote “a huge win” for Democrats, and “a win for the American public” as well.\n\n“Just yesterday, Oversight Democrats, the Democrats on my committee, forced a motion on Republicans, to force the full release of the Epstein files – unredacted, full list – to the full committee,” Garcia told reporters during a news conference in downtown Long Beach.\n\nGarcia said he sent a letter Thursday to Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Kentucky, to ensure that the files are comprehensive – although victims’ names will be redacted – and to demand that the DOJ release them within 30 calendar days.\n\nComer had confirmed after the subcommittee’s vote that he would issue a subpoena.\n\n“We on the Oversight Committee are ready to enforce the subpoena,” Garcia said during Thursday’s press conference.\n\nDemocrats, who are in the minority in Congress, are claiming victory over the Oversight subcommittee’s subpoena vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration are facing heavy blowback after the Justice Department announced earlier this month that it would not release the Epstein files.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that in May, the Justice Department briefed Trump – who previously ran in the same social circle as Epstein – that his name appeared in the Epstein files, along with a number of other high-profile individuals.\n\nTrump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and simply having one’s name mentioned in files from an investigation doesn’t imply any wrongdoing. Trump previously said he once considered Epstein a “terriffic guy” but that the pair had a falling out.\n\nThe Justice Department stunned conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and elements of Trump’s base this month when it released a two-page letter saying that a so-called Epstein “client list” that Bondi once intimated was on her desk did not exist and that officials did not plan to release any additional documents from its investigation – despite an earlier commitment to provide transparency.\n\nWhether Bondi’s briefing to Trump in May influenced that decision is unclear.\n\nThe Justice Department did not comment directly on her meeting with Trump.\n\nBondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a joint statement that a review of the Epstein files showed there was nothing warranting further investigation or prosecution.\n\nThe department did not immediately respond to a request Thursday for comment about this week’s Oversight subcommittee subpoena vote.\n\nDespite the explanation from Justice officials, Democrats and other members of the public, including some who voted for Trump, are demanding more transparency.\n\nBesides Epstein, a convicted sex trafficker who died by suicide in 2019, there has been public interest in Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Epstein’s who was found guilty of child sex trafficking in late 2021 and later sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nThis week, Comer, following another vote by the Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Government Operations calling for Maxwell to be deposed, subpoenaed the Epstein associate.\n\nIn his subpoena letter, Comer cited a news article indicating that Maxwell was “willing to speak with Congress regarding Mr. Epstein’s criminal activities.”\n\nHe also referenced a request last week by Trump – who has been under pressure from the public, including some among his base of supporters seeking greater transparency – to the U.S. attorney general to release Grand Jury testimony if the court allows.\n\n“While the (Justice) Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to your and Mr. Epstein’s cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government’s enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of you and Mr. Epstein,” Comer wrote.\n\n“In particular, the Committee seeks your testimony to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations,” Comer wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Garcia told reporters he will attend Maxwell’s deposition next month on behalf of House Democrats and members of the Oversight Committee. He hinted that Maxwell, whom he believes is hoping for a pardon from the president, may testify favorably in Trump’s favor.\n\n“We cannot just trust that Republicans are going to ask the right questions,” Garcia said, adding that anything Maxwell says should be “corroborated with documents and records.”\n\nThat, he added, is why it’s critical for Congress to be provided the full Epstein files.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"The House Oversight Committee's top Democrat calls the committee's subpoena of the DOJ for the files a \"huge win.\"","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/07/24/rep-robert-garcia-of-long-beach-demands-full-transparency-of-epstein-files/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LDN-L-GARCIA-EPSTEIN-0725-HF-04.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:54:48","author":"Gqlshare,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.47},{"id":344990670,"title":"Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell speaks with US Justice Department","text":"A top US Justice Department official has spent hours interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell, the imprisoned accomplice of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as President Donald Trump struggles to tamp down a furore over his handling of the explosive case.\n\nWarning: This story contains references to sexual abuse and suicide.\n\nDavid Markus, Maxwell's attorney, said the former British socialite answered every question she was asked during a day-long meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche at a courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\n\"She never invoked a privilege.

My gut tells me we [the US and China] will fight in 2025,” wrote General Mike Minihan, head of US Air Mobility Command, in a private memo two years ago. There’s still five months to go, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say that he’s wrong.\n\nDon’t take my word for it, because my recent record in these matters is bad. I didn’t think Russia’s Vladimir Putin was crazy enough to invade Ukraine although I knew he was largely detached from reality, and I was wrong. For a long time I would not use the word “genocide” to describe what Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu was doing in Gaza, and I was wrong again.\n\nIn my defence, I had not spent quality time with either man and I was reluctant to predict their actions based entirely on other people’s estimates of their characters (especially since most of those people didn’t know them personally either). I still felt compelled to weigh the pros and cons of the case, on the mistaken assumption that facts had some influence on their decisions.\n\nThe possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is a far greater threat to the peace of the world (such as it is) than the relative sideshows in Ukraine and Israel/Palestine. Aircraft carriers and nuclear weapons on both sides. A few poorly planned displays of “determination”, and the US is in a war with China--—with the two Koreas and Japan not far behind.\n\nChina’s President Xi Jinping will never rule out using force to “recover” Taiwan, but the story that he has set a 2027 deadline for that terrifying gamble is just a Washington think-tank special. He does harp on about it a lot, though.\n\nSuccessive American administrations have practiced “strategic ambiguity” (ie, maybe the US would fight to defend Taiwan and maybe it wouldn’t), and the fickle enthusiasms of Donald Trump muddy the waters even further. He is widely seen as a strategic coward (TACO), but he is sufficiently erratic that his response is really incalculable.\n\nAs for Taiwan, President Lai Ching-te of the cautiously pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) serves up the usual word salad: “The message of history is clear. Today we share the same values and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war [1939-45].” Evasiveness as policy, so as not to rile China.\n\nHou Yu-ih of Taiwan’s largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is even fuzzier: “The current status quo is that the Taiwan Strait is on the brink of war. So, to maintain close ties with the United States while also making peace with China is the solution to the problem.”\n\nAnd although very few ordinary citizens want to be part of China, most people are not bothered by all this. Yes, Taiwan’s military are a poorly trained, under-equipped shambles, but the public doesn’t seem worried about a Chinese invasion. The United States is willing to sell Taiwan more and better weapons, but some parties don’t want to spend the money.\n\nSo I will risk my reputation as a soothsayer once again and assume that both Xi Jinping and Lai Ching-te are rational men. In that case, it is unlikely that either man will risk everything on one roll of the dice. Xi will not set the machinery in motion for a sea- and airborne invasion of Taiwan, and Lai will certainly not declare independence for Taiwan.\n\nNo government of Taiwan, even back in the decades when the KMT (now reformed) was the tyrannical and maniacally anti-Communist single ruling party, has ever seriously considered abandoning the sacred fiction that there is only one China including Taiwan. There is just a persistent non-violent dispute over which government is legitimate, Beijing or Taipei.\n\nAs for Xi, who is effectively president-for-life, he faces no special deadline to claim his prize. “Reunification” is his legacy project, but he has just turned 72 and there’s lots of time yet. And always before him is the nightmare example of Putin’s three-day “special military operation” to bring Ukraine back under the rule of the Russian “motherland”.\n\nAbove all, there is Taiwan’s “silicon shield”. The island state manufactures 47% of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips, including all of the most advanced ones. Even the United States is one generation behind, and so is China despite its “Deep Seek” triumph in producing much cheaper high-performance AIs (on Nvidia chips made in Taiwan).\n\nInvade Taiwan and all that is gone. It might be irrational, but even the Trump administration might feel that Taiwan is a treasure that it must defend come what may. The game is not worth the candle, and Xi will not invade for at least three years. He probably never will.\n\nThere! I said it! Now we wait and see.\n\n—Author Gwynne Dyer is an international journalist based in London.","summary":"“I hope I am wrong.

He was awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges when he committed suicide in his cell.\n\nThe revelation that Clinton also contributed to the book comes more than a week after Trump was implicated with an alleged risqué hand-drawn picture of a naked woman with a cryptic message inside, according to the Journal.\n\nTrump furiously denied the allegations and launched a mammoth lawsuit the next day, suing the journalists by name, as well as the publication and Rupert Murdoch himself.\n\nIf the case proceeds, Trump would need to clear a demanding 'actual malice' standard that must be met by public figures to win in U.S. defamation cases. \n\nThe standard means Trump must prove the paper knew the article was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth. \n\nHe is seeking at least $10 billion on each of two defamation counts. \n\nBoth Clinton and Trump were reportedly listed in the 'friends' section of the birthday book, the publication stated, along with about 20 others. \n\nThe birthday letter included what appears to be Trump's famous signature and was obtained by the WSJ. \n\nThe outline of a naked woman allegedly frames typewritten text which reads: 'Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret.'\n\nAccording to the Journal, the naked woman appeared to have been hand-drawn with a marker, with a pair of arcs indicating the woman's breasts and a squiggly signature reading 'Donald' appearing in her pubic region, mimicking hair.\n\nTrump categorically denied any involvement in the drawing or writing of the text.\n\n'This is not me,' he said. 'This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story.\n\n'I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women. It's not my language. It's not my words.'\n\nTrump vowed to sue the Wall Street Journal if it published the story, warning: 'I'm gonna sue The Wall Street Journal just like I sued everyone else.'\n\nThe alleged letter reportedly contained an imaginary conversation between Epstein and Trump, written in third person.\n\nIn the imaginary conversation, 'Donald' writes: 'We have certain things in common, Jeffrey', to which 'Jeffrey' replies: 'Yes we do, come to think of it.'\n\n'Donald' then responds: 'Enigmas never age, have you noticed that', and imaginary 'Jeffrey' says 'as a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.'\n\nTrump responded to the publication of the letter with a rant on his social media platform Truth Social, writing: 'The Wall Street Journal printed a FAKE letter, supposedly to Epstein. \n\n'These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures.'\n\nRepeating his threat of legal action he added: 'I told Rupert Murdoch it was a Scam, that he shouldn't print this Fake Story. But he did, and now I'm going to sue his ass off, and that of his third rate newspaper.'\n\nAlthough Trump claimed he 'never wrote a picture in my life', several sketches he made of New York City landmarks as early as 2004 are readily available online.\n\nIn a separate post, he called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the court's approval to release 'any and all' evidence about Epstein's crimes.\n\n'Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval. \n\n'This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!'\n\nVice President JD Vance also rubbished the allegations last Thursday night, writing on X: 'Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bulls**t. The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. \n\n'Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it? Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?'\n\n'Will the people who have bought into every hoax against President Trump show an ounce of skepticism before buying into this bizarre story?' \n\nThe publication states that a compilation of letters were put together in a leather-bound album, organized by Maxwell for Epstein prior to his first arrest in 2006.\n\nThe album contained poems and photos from businesspeople and high-flying executives.\n\nIt is understood the letter forms part of the initial investigation into Epstein and Maxwell that the Justice Department conducted years ago, however it is unclear whether it was examined during the Attorney General's recent search.\n\nBondi and Trump are both under immense pressure from MAGA loyalists after failing to deliver on a campaign promise to expose Epstein's client list and reveal the truth about his alleged suicide inside his cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for child sex trafficking charges. \n\nBondi in February shared binders with MAGA influencers called 'Phase 1' of the Epstein release, but the folders contained previously published information.\n\nShe assured the public at the time that the client list was 'on her desk to be reviewed' and that more bombshell information would soon follow.\n\nEarlier this month, she backtracked and insisted the highly sought after client list 'doesn't exist.' She also said that Epstein killed himself in jail, and that there was no evidence to suggest he was murdered.\n\nThe lack of new information has sparked mutiny among MAGA and deeply divided Trump's base.","summary":"Bill Clinton's well wishes and birthday message to Jeffrey Epstein has now emerged a week after The Wall Street Journal went to war with President Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14938711/Bill-Clinton-birthday-letter-Jeffrey-Epstein-trump-lawsuit.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/00/100616089-0-image-a-11_1753400458182.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/16/8346726684659923945/1024x576_MP4_8346726684659923945.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:52:13","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":344981804,"title":"Starmer faces pressure to recognise Palestinian state immediately","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure to immediately recognise Palestine as a state amid growing calls from MPs and a commitment from France.\n\nThe Prime Minister condemned the “unspeakable and indefensible” humanitarian conditions in Gaza ahead of an emergency call with German and French leaders on Friday.\n\nHe also said statehood was the “inalienable right” of the Palestinian people but maintained that a ceasefire should come first.\n\nSir Keir said: “I will hold an emergency call with E3 partners tomorrow, where we will discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need, while pulling together all the steps necessary to build a lasting peace.”\n\nHe will speak to Emmanuel Macron, who has confirmed France will recognise Palestinian statehood, making his country the first G7 nation to do so in a move he said he would formalise at the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for the UK to follow suit, saying the UK “should be leading on this, not falling behind”.\n\n“Recognise the independent state of Palestine now and take the lead on securing a two-state solution and a lasting peace,” he said.\n\nMayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan has also called for immediate recognition, while the Trades Union Congress have pushed for formal recognition of Palestine “not in a year’s time or two years’ time – but now”.\n\nEmily Thornberry, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said most of its members back recognition right away.\n\n“It is the view of the majority of the committee that the UK Government should immediately recognise the state of Palestine, signalling the UK’s desire to work urgently towards a two-state solution alongside our allies,” she said.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the Government wants to recognise a Palestinian state “in contribution to a peace process”.\n\nShe also told The Times: “I think there could be multiple benefits.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr noted in a press release that this development would introduce changes to the network’s news coverage. Paramount, which owns CBS, encompasses CBS News.\n\n“Americans have lost trust in the traditional national news media to report comprehensively, accurately, and impartially. A change is necessary,” said Carr. “This is why I support Skydance’s vow to implement major revisions at the once-renowned CBS broadcast network. Notably, Skydance has provided written assurances that the revived company’s programming will reflect a variety of perspectives, covering the entire political and ideological landscape.”\n\n“Today’s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination,” Carr added. \n\nIn recent days, Paramount’s new owner made a number of concessions to the FCC, including agreeing to not implement any diversity, equity or inclusion programs. Skydance also said it would “undertake a comprehensive review” of CBS and “will commit, for a period of at least two years, to have in place an ombudsman.” That role would report to the president of the new company. \n\nA number of companies that have billion-dollar transactions pending before Carr’s FCC have also backed off of DEI programs, including Verizon and T-Mobile. \n\nThe concessions also came after Paramount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. Trump brought that suit, saying the way CBS edited a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was “election and voter interference.” \n\nThe lone Democrat in FCC leadership, Commissioner Anna Gomez, did not mince words about the push to secure promises from the companies.\n\n“After months of cowardly capitulation to this ministration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,” she said in an emailed statement. \n\n“In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” she added. “Once again, this agency is undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity by overstepping its authority and intervening in employment matters reserved for other government entities with proper jurisdiction on these issues.”\n\n“Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.”\n\nSkydance is run by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. While the younger Ellison made a donation to President Joe Biden’s re-election fund in February 2024 shortly before the former president bowed out of the race, Trump recently signaled his comfort with his takeover of Paramount and its assets, which in addition to CBS News include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and film franchises like “Smurfs” and “Sonic the Hedgehog.”\n\n“Ellison is great. He’ll do a great job with it,” Trump said in June.\n\nThere is likely to be a sea change in the editorial direction of CBS News under its new ownership. In a recent filing, Ellison and Skydance said they’d told Carr that they were committed to pursuing a focus on “American storytelling” while touting a new, “unbiased” editorial direction for CBS News. Their meeting came shortly after Paramount agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit. \n\nIt also came just days after CBS announced it was canceling “The Late Show,” currently hosted by Stephen Colbert — an announcement Trump praised on social media. Colbert had recently criticized the parent company’s multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump, while CBS said the cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.”\n\nThere had been signs of an editorial shift ahead of the merger. Most notably, longtime “60 Minutes” editor Bill Owens announced he was stepping down this spring, citing CBS News’ fading editorial independence. Shortly after, CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon was pushed out. Last week, The New York Times reported Skydance was in early talks to acquire the conservative-leaning The Free Press media outlet. Meanwhile, “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart has said he did not know whether his program would survive the merger. \n\nSkydance has spent years pursuing Paramount and eventually realized it could successfully execute the transaction by purchasing Paramount’s parent, National Amusements, the company once helmed by Sumner Redstone, the father of the company’s current chairwoman, president and CEO, Shari Redstone. Yet the proposed deal continued to face hurdles, first under the Biden administration then at the outset of Trump’s term. Its approval came in what was its third deadline extension period.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump administration&#8217;s regulators have given the green light to Skydance Media&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FCC Approves Paramount&#8217;s $8 Billion Merger with Skydance Entertainment Group first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/fcc-approves-paramounts-8-billion-merger-with-skydance-entertainment-group/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FCC-greenlights-Paramount039s-8-billion-merger-with-entertainment-group-Skydance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:50:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.103},{"id":344982506,"title":"Core inflation in Japan's capital stays above BOJ target in July","text":"TOKYO :Core consumer inflation in Japan's capital stayed well above the central bank's 2 per cent target in July, data showed on Friday, adding to renewed market expectations for another interest rate hike this year.\n\nThe data will be among factors the Bank of Japan will scrutinise at its next rate review on July 30-31, when the board is expected to revise up this fiscal year's inflation forecast in a quarterly review of its projections.\n\nThe Tokyo consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food costs, rose 2.9 per cent in July from a year earlier, government data showed, slightly below a median market forecast for a 3.0 per cent increase.

Australia?","text":"It might not be on our plates or menus just yet, but US beef has been a hot topic of conversation across the nation after this week's decision to lift import restrictions that had been in place for more than two decades. \n\nAustralia banned beef imports from the US in 2003 after the fatal neurological disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, was discovered in American cattle.\n\nThe blanket ban was lifted in 2019, however restrictions remained on beef that was sourced from Canada or Mexico and slaughtered in the US, amid concerns it could carry the disease.\n\n\"The Americans were unwilling to … do the traceability work to make sure that beef that was coming to Australia wasn't actually rebranded from somewhere else,\" veterinarian and former NSW Farmers Association president, James Jackson, said.\n\n\"We don't want foot and mouth disease in this country, we don't want our consumers to eat beef and get Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is the disease you get from eating cattle with mad cow disease.\"\n\nWhile some in the industry were optimistic that lifting the restrictions would open up trade opportunities for Australian producers, others raised concerns that Australia's biosecurity could be compromised.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nThe federal government said the move was the result of a decade-long biosecurity review that found more robust movement controls had been introduced in the US.\n\n\"The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is satisfied the strengthened control measures put in place by the US effectively manage biosecurity risks,\" Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said.\n\n\"The Albanese Labor government will never compromise on biosecurity.\"\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud questioned the timing of the decision, saying it looked as though it was a trade to appease US President Donald Trump. \n\nThe biosecurity restrictions on beef imports from the United States were one of the key grievances that led the Trump administration to impose tariffs on Australia.\n\nRed Meat Advisory Council chair John McKillop said while the decision may have been pushed through \"slightly quicker\" than expected, he was confident it was the result of a long-running assessment.\n\nAre there still biosecurity risks?\n\nGlobal AgriTrends analyst Simon Quilty said the risk of US beef imports introducing diseases to Australia was now much lower. \n\n\"They have improved their traceability methods within America and I think, in all honesty, that the degree of risk is significantly low,\" he said.\n\nMr McKillop said any risk would also be mitigated by the limited amount of beef Australia was likely to import from the US.\n\n\"They have the lowest beef herd in 70 years in the US at the moment [due to drought],\" he said.\n\n\"The most [beef] that was ever brought in, and this was pre-BSE … was 210 tonnes … in contrast to the 395,000 tonnes we exported to the US last year.\"\n\nMr McKillop said the US was also experiencing near-record beef and cattle prices, and it was unlikely Australians would want to pay high prices for their product.\n\nWill Australians buy US beef?\n\nWhile the amount of beef coming into Australia from the US may be limited, Mr Jackson said there could be a market for it.\n\n\"There may be some lines [of product] come into Australia, people who want to sell American beef on a restaurant menu or something like that,\" he said.\n\nMr Jackson said Australia must be open to accepting American beef if it wanted to maintain a trade relationship with the US.\n\n\"Part of a trade deal is that you're willing to take product from other countries,\" he said.\n\n\"Are we happy with Australian consumers eating American beef? Well, probably we're not that happy, but the reality is that if you trade, you've got to be happy to take other people's product as well.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for US-imposed tariffs?\n\nThe trade restriction on US beef has been a key grievance for the Trump administration, which placed a 10 per cent tariff on all Australian imports earlier this year.\n\nProfessor Ben Lyons, from the University of Southern Queensland's Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, said it was difficult to know how the move would impact that tariff. \n\n\"Nothing would surprise us at the moment because that's the new paradigm under the Trump administration — full of surprises,\" he said. \n\nDr Lyons said he was confident the Australian beef industry would maintain a strong export market, regardless of US-imposed tariffs.\n\n\"If past performance is the best indicator of the future, we always seem to find a way with our export markets,\" he said.\n\n\"Even the announcement of this tariff on Australian beef at the beginning of the year hasn't really had any economic impact as yet on our exports.\n\n\"I think we should just carry on calmly and do what we do best.\n\nI don't really see this as being a long-term issue for Australian agriculture.\"","summary":"The federal government has lifted longstanding restrictions on beef imports from the US.

Lutnick explained to Daily Caller Editor-in-Chief Dylan Housman how he thought up the deal and negotiated with Japan for six months to secure the historic investment. (RELATED: Daily Caller To Host Manufacturing Event With Sec. Howard Lutnick)\n\n“Japan was facing a 25% tariff, and their auto industry could not, of course, stay in Japan and sell cars to America at a 25% tariff. It just doesn’t work,” Lutnick began.\n\n“The answer was, they offered us and, and this was my idea, and I worked on it for almost six months. In January, I pitched it to the President… this is the Japanese government saying to Donald Trump, ‘the Japanese will finance at their cost any project for national security or that’s important to Donald Trump in the United States of America,'” Lutnick continued.\n\nAs a part of the deal, Japan will pay 15% reciprocal tariffs to the U.S.. Lutnick told the Caller that the United States won’t pay any reciprocal tariffs as a result of the deal he negotiated.\n\nLutnick continued to explain what type of investments Japan might be funding, in the interest of the United States, as a result of the trade deal.\n\n“For example, we don’t make generic pharmaceuticals. They’re all made primarily in China. Think about that for a second. Our antibiotics are made in China,” Lutnick said.\n\n“[It’s] not safe,” Housman remarked.\n\n“We tell the Japanese government, we want to build generic pharmaceuticals. Here’s the project. It’s $15 billion, they give us the $15 billion and we build generic pharmaceuticals here as provided by them. And then when that company operates and makes some money, we split the profits 90% for the American taxpayer and 10% for the Japanese,” Lutnick laid out to the Caller.\n\n“We could build out the Alaska pipeline. We could do whatever we think is the right move for the United States of America,” he said, emphasizing that the United States will not pay any reciprocal tariffs but will lower its tariff on Japan.\n\n“When I say it’s historic, what that means is it’s completely intellectually above anything anybody’s ever done before,” Lutnick added.","summary":"Howard Lutnick Reveals How Trump Admin Secured Massive Trade Deal With Japan","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/07/24/howard-lutnick-donald-trump-japan-trade-deal-commerce-secretary/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsc0793_720-e1753400193578.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:48:05","author":"Reagan Reese","authors":["Reagan Reese"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":344991310,"title":"The 2028 Presidential Race Has Begun","text":"Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor and adviser to two Democratic presidents, is suddenly all over the news. This week alone, he’s appeared on a number of podcasts in what seem to be early forays into an exploratory campaign for president. Emanuel went on the former Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s podcast and answered “no” when asked if a man can “become a woman.” On another podcast, with The Free Press’s Bari Weiss, Emanuel said that Democrats lost in 2024 because Kamala Harris didn’t set herself apart from Joe Biden, and noted that his party “got sidetracked” by issues that were not front of mind for voters.\n\nEmanuel was the most visible in the media this week, but he’s not the only would-be candidate we’re hearing from. This morning, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg went on the podcast The Breakfast Club; he also made a surprise cameo on a Barstool Sports podcast last week to present a jokey “Lib of the Year” award to the internet personality Jersey Jerry, who was wearing a MAGA hat. In an elegant Vogue spread, an old-school and somewhat stiff way to communicate one’s political ambitions, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear bragged about having once been on MrBeast’s show. “We’ve got to do the YouTube shows,” he said, telling the reporter that, unlike Harris, he would have gone on The Joe Rogan Experience. Buttigieg and Representative Ro Khanna of California have both appeared on the comedy podcast Flagrant, co-hosted by Andew Schulz. California Governor Gavin Newsom invited the conservative activist Charlie Kirk to be a guest on the first episode of his podcast.\n\nThese appearances indicate that Democrats “are finally waking up to the fact that you can’t run a presidential campaign” simply “by going on CNN and MSNBC,” Lis Smith, a Democratic strategist who worked on Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, told me. And these public appearances aren’t just a way for presidential hopefuls to introduce themselves to voters; they’re also opportunities for donors and party elites to start eyeballing their favorites and winnowing the primary field.\n\nMost party strategists I’ve spoken with this year believe that Democrats need to appear on more nontraditional and ideologically diverse outlets to reach new voters and make more people—even those who don’t agree with the Democrats on everything—feel welcome inside the party tent. Donald Trump’s successful turns on Rogan’s podcast and on shows hosted by the comedians Theo Von and Schulz contributed to his victory last November.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls everywhere are swearing more and attempting to adopt a little more swagger. In his interview with Weiss, Emanuel, who once sent a dead fish to a political enemy, leaned back in his chair, looking unbothered; Buttigieg chopped it up with the bros on Flagrant for more than two hours. Notably, some female potential candidates aren’t yet in the mix—where’s Gretchen Whitmer these days? Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, told me that she didn’t know, but that it’s clear the party’s decline in support from men “has really lit a fire under Democratic dudes.”\n\nAlong with a broader shift in media strategy, we’re also seeing a shift in rhetoric from at least some Democrats. “These folks are right that the Democratic Party was seen as too extreme, and that contributed to our loss,” Erickson told me. She’s pleased, she said, that the current zeitgeist seems to be a move “toward the middle.” The Democratic course correction has begun.\n\nPart of that involves punching left. After Emanuel told Kelly that a man cannot become a woman, Kelly sighed, lamenting, “Why don’t more people in your party just say that?” “Because,” Emanuel joked, “I’m now going to go into a witness-protection plan.” Newsom told Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports is “deeply unfair,” and had broader critiques of the Democratic Party’s communication skills.\n\nDemocrats on the campaign trail have had a difficult time addressing topics around gender. One analysis conducted by a Democratic super PAC found that a Republican ad about Harris’s views on transgender identity was effective for Trump during the 2024 campaign. (Many Democrats criticized Harris’s campaign for refusing to respond to the ad, whose tagline read: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”) Emanuel’s answer on Kelly’s show, whether or not it’s a winning message with the Democratic base, speaks to a tone change on the topic. Every 2028 hopeful can expect to be asked directly about their views on the subject—and “should be ready to answer,” Smith told me.\n\nEven by the standards of the previous cycle’s incredibly early campaigning, all of this might seem rather premature to discuss. But as Emanuel himself is famous for saying, a good crisis should never go to waste. Democratic presidential hopefuls are well aware that the party’s leadership vacuum is an opportunity—and they’re determined to not misuse it.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Problem With Rewards Credit Cards\n\nBy Ellen Cushing\n\nCulture Break\n\nWatch.

That means we’re going to have to have more trucks to haul the same amount of goods, which will increase congestion,” said Lewie Pugh, vice president of the Independent Drivers Association and longtime truck driver, told “On Balance” host Leland Vittert in 2023.\n\nBut not all drivers were opposed to the idea.

Trump has been on a public crusade against Powell in recent weeks. Trump has been angry with Powell for failing to lower interest rates, and the president has blasted Powell for his inaction repeatedly, citing his quick movement to raise rates under former President Joe Biden. Trump has also blasted Powell, in conjunction with his complaints about interest rates, over the multibillion-dollar renovations at the Federal Reserve&apos;s D.C. headquarters, which Trump described as \"luxurious\" while he inspected it Thursday during his visit alongside Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. \"I thought we had a good meeting. I really, no, there was no tension. It was no tension. I think he had more tension with my great senator to the right,\" Trump told reporters when asked how he would describe his talks Thursday with the Fed chair.

And it turns out we were right. Thank God President Trump and his team took enough time to dig into some of the details.\" Trump&apos;s comments that there was \"no tension\" between him and Powell followed an awkward moment between the pair that occurred on camera as they were touring the new renovations. Trump declared the \"luxurious\" renovations he has been critical of will ultimately cost around $3.1 billion, an increase from previous estimates of around $2.7 billion. \"We&apos;re taking a look, and it looks like it&apos;s about $3.1 billion – went up a little bit, or a lot,\" Trump told reporters during a press gaggle inside the Fed headquarters alongside Powell as they toured the building. \"So, the $2.7 [billion] is now $3.1 [billion].\" Powell shook his head as Trump spoke, and, at one point, the Fed chairman glanced sharply over at the president with a look of bewilderment. GOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP’S INTEREST RATE PUSH \"I&apos;m not aware of that, Mr. President,\" Powell interjected. \"I haven&apos;t heard that from anybody at the Fed.\" \"It just came out,\" Trump turned to Powell and shot back as he pulled out a piece of paper from the breast pocket of his sport coat and handed it to Powell. Sen. Scott agreed that he had heard the total was $3.1 billion. \"This came from [the Federal Reserve]?\" Powell asked, and Trump confirmed it. Then, for a few awkward seconds, Powell read the letter before telling Trump that the larger number includes renovations that have already been completed. \"Are you including the Martin renovation?\" Powell asked. \"You just added in a third building is what that is. That&apos;s a third building. … It&apos;s not new.\" TRUMP COMPARES TALKING TO POWELL TO ‘TALKING TO A CHAIR’ WHILE TOUTING HIS OWN ECONOMIC PREDICTIONS \"It&apos;s part of the overall work,\" Trump added before the topic of questioning changed.

Parents derided the school’s response — a meditation room and calls home — as entirely inadequate. \n\nA Center for Court Innovation in Brooklyn found no statistically significant benefits in schools that implemented restorative-justice practices compared to those that used a traditional disciplinary approach. \n\nThe Department of Education claims suspensions have plummeted 48% over the past 10 years, resulting in “keeping more children in class and engaged.” \n\nDuh: If your policy is to suspend fewer kids, as restorative-justice calls for, it’s no shock that fewer kids get suspended.\n\nEven Schools Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos admits the approach isn’t cutting it: “The work is far from done,” she conceded Wednesday. Yet she vowed, “It’s not leaving New York City public schools.”\n\nThat’s unforgivable: The study’s bottom line clearly found restorative justice fuels disorder, a lack of accountability and possibly an increase in chronic absenteeism.\n\nThe disruptions that prevent well-behaved kids from learning alone should be enough to ditch this policy, not to mention the violence and absenteeism that comes from it.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, as a former cop, should know that kids who don’t pay meaningful consequences for misbehavior will simply continue misbehaving.\n\nSome good news: An April 2025 executive order from Donald Trump puts the kibosh on using race as a factor in discipline, which may help push schools to return to traditional responses to misconduct and a restoration of order in classrooms.\n\nBut until New York City’s policy changes, the chaos will continue — and learning will suffer.","summary":"School “meditation rooms” and “harm-reduction circles,” a new study shows, don't cure juvenile delinquents but instead undermine teachers' authority and lead to more chaotic classrooms.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/24/opinion/of-course-restorative-justice-in-schools-doesnt-work-and-now-the-proof-is-in/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/students-leave-edward-r-murrow-90019959-e1753368532241.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:41:20","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":344983538,"title":"Justice Department official meets with Ghislaine Maxwell about Epstein","text":"WASHINGTON >> Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche said he met accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, today and will meet with her again on Friday.\n\nMaxwell’s lawyer, David Oscar Markus, speaking separately after today’s meeting, said, “We had a very productive day today with the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Ghislaine Maxwell.”\n\nImages captured by ABC News today showed Blanche and his entourage, including acting Associate Deputy Attorney General Diego Pestana, entering the U.S. attorney’s office, which is located in a federal courthouse.\n\nMarkus told reporters that Maxwell answered each of Blanche’s questions. “We don’t want to comment about the substance of the meeting for obvious reasons,” he added.\n\nBlanche had announced earlier in the week that he had reached out to Maxwell’s lawyers to see if she might have “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims.”\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year sentence at a federal prison in Tallahassee, after a jury convicted her of sex trafficking in 2021. She is appealing her sentence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have been facing mounting pressure from Trump’s supporters to release additional information about the Justice Department’s investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nBlanche wrote on X that he met Maxwell today and will continue his interview of her on Friday. The Justice Department, he said, “will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.”\n\nAlthough Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this year had promised to release additional materials related to possible Epstein clients, the Justice Department reversed course this month and issued a memo concluding there was no basis to continue investigating and there was no evidence of a client list or blackmail.\n\nSince then, the department has sought permission to unseal grand jury transcripts from its prior investigations into Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg denied one of those requests, finding that it did not fall into any of the exceptions to rules requiring grand jury material be kept secret.\n\nTrump’s name, along with many other high-profile individuals, appeared multiple times on flight logs for Epstein’s private plane in the 1990s.\n\nThe Justice Department released some records that contained Trump’s name earlier this year.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche said he met accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein&#8217;s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, today and will meet with her again on Friday.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/07/24/breaking-news/justice-department-official-meets-with-ghislaine-maxwell-about-epstein/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/web1_20250724_brk_tbl01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:40:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":344984472,"title":"EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: 'No10 lied to hide distaste for Donald Trump's speech in UK'","text":"When Tony Blair was prime minister, he was accused of trying to 'muscle in' on the Queen Mother's funeral.\n\nNow, Labour Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has become embroiled in a row involving Buckingham Palace himself.\n\nDowning Street – and by extension the Royal Household – has been caught in a lie about the coming state visit of Donald Trump.\n\nNo10 claimed the US President was unable to address both houses of Parliament because his visit would not start until Wednesday, September 17 – the day after the House of Commons breaks for the party-conference recess.\n\nHowever, I understand that parliamentary clerks made it clear that this excuse was groundless. They pointed to a precedent in 2010 when Pope Benedict addressed both houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall.\n\nThat occurred, neatly enough, on September 17 – when the Commons had also broken for its conference recess the day before.\n\n'There was no huffing and puffing about Benedict addressing us out of term-time,' says a senior parliamentary figure. \n\n'It is clear that Sir Keir Starmer's advisers simply did not want President Trump making a speech at the Palace of Westminster. They are entitled to their view, but they should not bend the truth by claiming that the dates made any such speech impossible.'\n\nBenedict's address was not without controversy. Before his state visit he urged Roman Catholic bishops to fight a gay-rights Bill with 'missionary zeal'. His arrival in the country drew protests from human-rights campaigners.\n\nDowning Street and Buckingham Palace did not want the White House to think President Trump was being snubbed, even though that clearly seems to be the case.\n\nA No10 spokesman tells me: 'We're delighted that President Trump accepted His Majesty's offer of an unprecedented, historic second state visit, and the Prime Minister looks forward to welcoming President Trump to the UK.'\n\nBack touring Britain in September, Eric Idle, 82, rules out a stage reunion with his Monty Python colleagues.

I don't think it's possible. I want to be funny with new people, or jam with other wonderful musicians.'\n\n'It's your day!' Top tips for brides by newlywed Toff \n\nHaving married BrewDog pub chain founder James Watt in March, Georgia Toffolo has compiled some advice for brides-to-be.\n\nHere are the seven pearls of wisdom from the I'm A Celebrity winner, 30, who wore a Divine Atelier gown, left, when she exchanged vows with Watt, 43, both pictured right, in Aberdeenshire:\n\nYou shouldn't have to invite people for the sake of it. Your guest list isn't a diplomatic summit. Invite people you love. It's your day, not networking. You shouldn't feel guilty for that.\n\nWedding cakes are a waste of money. We had the children bake ours that morning. No fancy tiers, no overpriced price tag. Just made with pure love. Best decision ever.\n\nFlowers are overpriced and overrated. I grabbed daffodils straight out of the vase on our kitchen table, and you know what? They were perfect. £2 from the supermarket and not a single florist in sight.\n\nYou don't need to spend the morning apart. Who made that rule up? Waking up together on your wedding day is actually really romantic (and calming). The chance to share your nerves and excitement together is something to be cherished.\n\nChildren SHOULD be at weddings. Children bring the best chaos, particularly on the dance floor. They add magic, not mess.\n\nNo need for a three-course meal. We had burgers at BrewDog. Grazing tables, pizza ovens, food trucks... all way more fun.\n\nYou don't have to change your surname. He can take yours. Or double-barrel. Tradition is optional, your identity isn't.\n\nHave King's garden woes hit Highgrove's kitchen?\n\nIt's not just in the gardens of his Gloucestershire retreat that King Charles is apparently struggling to keep staff.\n\nHighgrove is advertising not just for a head chef, but a sous chef, a chef de partie, a commis chef and an assistant hospitality manager.\n\nThe roles are advertised as permanent and full-time, with 'up to £30,000' offered for the hospitality role, and 'up to £38,000' for the head chef position.\n\nA Sunday Times investigation last weekend claimed 11 of the King's 12 gardeners had quit following complaints about his 'demoralising' and 'impolite' feedback. His charity, The King's Foundation, found evidence of staff shortages and suggested a pay review.\n\nBonkbuster author Dame Jilly Cooper says she's a failed matchmaker in real life thanks to Bluebell, her 'larky and bossily assertive' greyhound. \n\n'If I wanted to introduce a single man to a woman and put them on my sofa, Bluebell would saunter in, leaping between them, waggling her silken hips to separate them,' she says of her pet, who died four years ago. \n\nDame Jilly, 88, reflects: 'Having a dog stops one reaching for the gin.' \n\nParty girl Pike's tickled pink about stage role \n\nTreading the boards in this country for the first time in 15 years, Saltburn star Rosamund Pike is determined to prove that she fits the stage like a glove.\n\nThe Oxford graduate, 46, wore an eye-catching pair of fuchsia opera gloves to the first-night party following the debut performance of Suzie Miller's new play, Inter Alia.\n\nThe former Bond girl, who has two children with her businessman boyfriend Robie Uniacke, 64, paired them with a floral dress by Erdem.\n\nBanksy has a big secret: More than a dozen of his works are hidden away at Switzerland's embassy in London. \n\nAsked which of the street artist's pieces no one has ever seen, his first agent and photographer, Steve Lazarides, replies: 'The Swiss Embassy car park.' \n\nHe explains: 'It was bats*** crazy. The old Swiss ambassador put on a full-on rave down in the car park at the Swiss Embassy and invited Banksy.' \n\nSpeaking at his talk in east London, Crime Pays – The Untold Story Behind Banksy, in association with Grove Gallery, Lazarides adds: 'I'd say between ten and 15 complete works are on the walls of that embassy.","summary":"EDEN CONFIDENTIAL: Downing Street - and by extension the Royal Household - has been caught in a lie about the coming state visit of Donald Trump .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14938631/EDEN-CONFIDENTIAL-Donald-Trumps-UK.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/25/00/100615275-0-image-m-40_1753399541551.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:37:34","author":"Editor,Richard Eden","authors":["Editor","Richard Eden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.092}]}
