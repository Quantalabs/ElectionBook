Several tourism advocates told BIV that as many as five U.S. corporate gatherings planned for Vancouver were recently cancelled due to a mix of geopolitical or economic reasons.\n\n“We’ve all lost bits and pieces,” said Fairmont Hotel Vancouver general manager Adam Laker, referring to major downtown Vancouver hotels losing event business from U.S. companies.\n\n“They don’t want to be seen as having a large conference and spending money in the Canadian economy. They think it’s better and safer if they have events in the U.S.”\n\nSome Canadian convention organizers have also pivoted and shifted events planned in U.S. destinations to Canada, but Laker told BIV that this is happening “not to the same scale” as U.S. convention organizers cancelling events.\n\nSean Antonson, general manager of the Sheraton Wall Centre, said no large U.S. corporate events have been cancelled at his hotel, but that he has heard that some event cancellations elsewhere stem from organizers hearing that U.S. residents who are not citizens did not want to attend for fear of not being allowed back into the United States.\n\nTrump’s tariff threats have also bolstered a sense of Canadian nationalism.\n\nWhile frugality on the part of consumers might result in fewer trips, tourism operators have told BIV they anticipate more Canadians will travel domestically and perhaps take more staycations — avoiding travel costs as tourists in their own cities.\n\n“U.S. corporate group business has slowed but there’s been a pick-up in transient and leisure business,” said BC Hotel Association CEO Paul Hawes.\n\n“That is a combination of U.S. individual travellers and Canadian travellers.”\n\nHawes said he has heard from hotel executives that many Europeans and Australians who had planned to visit the U.S. have instead booked vacations in B.C.\n\n“More people are visiting our website from outside B.C., but within Canada,” said Melissa Karmen Lee, CEO of Vancouver’s Chinese Canadian Museum (CCM).\n\n“We’re hoping that more people visiting our website domestically will translate into more visits this summer.”\n\nLee’s museum opened in mid-2023, and attracted about 8,000 people that first summer. She estimated that the visitor count fell to around 6,000 last summer because her museum continued to have the same exhibits that it had in 2023.\n\nShe forecasts visits this summer will again reach around 8,000 because two new exhibits are launching this month: A military exhibition about Chinese Canadians in the Second World War, and an exhibit on Cantonese and Mandarin pop music in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n“The exhibits are for completely different but complementary audiences, so we’re hoping to get a mix of different visitors to come to the museum,” she said.\n\nThose who visit the museum often also visit Chinatown attractions such as the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden and the Chinatown Storytelling Centre, she said.\n\nCruise ships bring many of CCM’s visitors, Lee said.\n\nIn April, she had a busload of about 40 German tourists eager for a guided tour, she told BIV.\n\nThis is why she is excited that the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (VFPA) is forecasting a banner 2025 cruise season, with about 1.2 million visitors.\n\nThat is below a record season last year, when about 1.32 million cruise passengers visited Vancouver. But if the VFPA’s forecast becomes reality, this year’s cruise visitor count will be the third largest in the city’s history, after 2024 and the 1.25 million passengers in 2023.\n\nBefore then, the record for cruise visitors in a calendar year was 1.1 million, set in 2019, according to the VFPA.\n\nIndustry expects strong summer tourism season\n\nLarge conventions are part of the rationale behind expectations that Vancouver’s summer tourism season will be strong this year.\n\nThe global technology sector’s Web Summit is slated for late May. Vancouver is then set to host what could be the largest convention in its history when up to 60,000 people are expected to travel to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous’ convention July 3 through 6.\n\n“We’re busier and ahead of our pace from previous years,” Graeme Benn, general manager of the JW Marriott Parq Vancouver and Douglas hotels, told BIV.\n\n“I expect that to continue all the way through Labour Day weekend.”\n\nOptimism also comes from Prime Minister Mark Carney promising several initiatives to make tourism more affordable this summer.\n\nOne campaign commitment was to make national park and historic site access free for everyone from June through August.\n\nAnother was to reduce prices for Canadians at camp sites in national parks during those peak months.\n\nCarney said his government would introduce heavily discounted access and fares for those aged 18 to 24 years to visit national museums and galleries.\n\nA grander promise was to create what he called the Strong Canada Pass, which would take effect from June to August.\n\nThe passes would provide free access to national museums and galleries for those younger than 18 years. They would also enable youth who travel with parents to ride VIA Rail trains for free.\n\nRocky Mountaineer CEO Tristan Armstrong told BIV that he likes that the government is encouraging train travel, because young train riders today may be his customers tomorrow.\n\nRocky Mountaineer’s trips in B.C. are vastly different from those on VIA Rail. Trains and meals on the former are first-class offerings, with passengers staying at hotels each night to ensure their entire train journeys take place in daylight. The customer demographic is older, in part because itinerary price tags can top $8,000.\n\nPrices have risen with inflation, but Armstrong said his railway offers some discounts, including one that provides reduced fares for Canadian residents.\n\n“We’ll be serving close to 100,000 guests in Canada, and that’s about an eight-per-cent gain from last year,” he said.\n\nRocky Mountaineer’s Canadian season runs April 14 through October 13. The company also has U.S. trips, but about 90 per cent of its business is in Canada, Armstrong said.\n\nPassengers often stay additional nights in Vancouver, which is lucrative for premium hotels.\n\n“Their guests stay with us,” said Antonson of his Sheraton Wall Centre. “They also stay at the Fairmont hotels and the Sutton Place or the Hyatt. The Rocky Mountaineer is a powerhouse in Vancouver. They bring a lot of business into the city.”\n\nScience World is hoping to exceed last summer’s roughly 200,000 visitors, thanks in part to a new exhibit launching June 26, CEO Tracy Redies told BIV. \n\n“Our upcoming feature exhibition is designed to be a major summer attraction, offering a unique combination of space exploration and the universally loved Lego bricks brand,” she said. “We expect it to resonate strongly with families and space enthusiasts.”\n\nScience World recently reopened a 35,000-square-foot outdoor gallery dubbed Ken Spencer Science Park, which provides visitors with interactive exhibits featuring B.C. ecosystems, she said.\n\nScience World raised prices on its various fares by about 2.5 per cent compared with last year, Redies added.\n\nOver at the Vancouver Art Gallery, co-CEO Sirish Rao told BIV that he expects a slight increase in visitors this summer due to new exhibitions.\n\nThe gallery last year welcomed about 172,000 visitors, with around 40 per cent of them during the June-through-August period, he estimated.\n\nA rise in Canadian nationalism may generate interest in the gallery’s exhibit on Québec painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, Rao said. Another exhibit is on B.C. ceramics, among other attractions, he added.\n\nSirish Rao was promoted to be co-CEO at the Vancouver Art Gallery, alongside Eva Respini, after the departure in March of former CEO Anthony Kiendl | Chung Chow, BIV\n\n“People are really wanting to lean into this cultural moment,” he said. “We imagine more people staying in Canada this summer than last year, and many locals.”\n\nRao said staycationing locals think of the Vancouver Art Gallery as a place to go with their families, particularly during heat waves as the gallery is air conditioned.\n\nA discounted admission fare for those who live in B.C. — $29 instead of $35 for the regular adult admission — is another effort to attract local guests.\n\nFuelling business for all tourist attractions are efforts from Vancouver-based Destination Canada, which markets the country to the world.\n\nBritish Columbia Tourism Industry Association CEO Walt Judas told BIV that sufficiently funding that organization is key to industry success.\n\n“Perhaps [the new government] could increase Destination Canada’s budget to ensure we’re not only keeping up with the rate of inflation but can compete globally against other countries that are looking for the same business in the same markets that we are,” he said.","summary":"Vancouver tourism-destination executives are cautiously predicting a banner season this summer, although some signs point to a drop in visitors compared with last year.

This is not leadership; it is cowardice. And it’s not academic freedom; it’s institutional disenfranchisement,” the task force said in a statement.\n\n“By prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support.”\n\nThe elimination of another $450m in grants came in addition to the more than $2.2bn in federal funds that were already suspended last week, the task force added.\n\nThe feud between the president and Harvard – a prestigious Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts – began in March, when Trump sought to impose new rules and regulations on top schools that had played host to pro-Palestinian protests over the last year.\n\nTrump has called such protests “illegal” and accused participants of anti-Semitism. But student protest leaders have described their actions as a peaceful response to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has elicited concerns about human rights abuses, including genocide.\n\nColumbia University was initially a centrepiece of the Trump administration’s efforts. The New York City school had seen the first major Palestine solidarity encampment rise on its lawn, which served as a blueprint for similar protests around the world. It also saw a series of mass arrests in the aftermath.\n\nIn March, one of Columbia’s protest leaders, Mahmoud Khalil, was the first foreign student to be arrested and have his legal immigration status revoked under Trump’s campaign to punish demonstrators. And when Trump threatened to yank $400m in grants and research contracts, the school agreed to submit to a list of demands to restore the funding.\n\nThe demands included adopting a formal definition of anti-Semitism, beefing up campus security and putting one of its academic departments – focused on Middle East, African and South Asian studies – under the supervision of an outside authority.\n\nFree speech advocates called Columbia’s concessions a capitulation to Trump, who they say has sought to erode academic freedom and silence viewpoints he disagrees with.\n\nOn April 11, his administration issued another list of demands for Harvard that went even further. Under its terms, Harvard would have had to revamp its disciplinary system, eliminate its diversity initiatives and agree to an external audit of programmes deemed anti-Semitic.\n\nThe demands also required Harvard to agree to “structural and personnel changes” that would foster “viewpoint diversity” – a term left ambiguous. But critics argued it was a means for Trump to impose his values and priorities on the school by shaping its hiring and admissions practices.\n\nHarvard has been at the centre of controversies surrounding its admissions in the past. In 2023, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled that Harvard’s consideration of race in student admissions – through a process called affirmative action – violated the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution.\n\nTuesday’s letter referenced that court decision in arguing that “Harvard University has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus”.\n\nA pair of reports in April, created by Harvard University’s own task forces, also found that there were cases of anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish violence on campus in the wake of Israel’s war in Gaza, a divisive issue in US politics.\n\nUltimately, on April 14, Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, rejected the Trump administration’s demands, arguing they were evidence of government overreach.\n\n“No government – regardless of which party is in power – should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote in his response.\n\nBut Trump has continued to pressure the campus, including by threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. Democrats and other critics have warned that it would be illegal for the president to influence the decisions of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with regard to individual taxpayers, like the university.\n\nUnder Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has also threatened to bar foreign students from enrolling at the university if Harvard did not hand over documents pertaining to the pro-Palestine protests.\n\nOn Monday, Garber, Harvard’s president, wrote a response to Trump’s secretary of education, Linda McMahon, defending his campus’s commitment to free speech while also addressing the spectre of anti-Semitism.\n\n“We share common ground on a number of critical issues, including the importance of ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus. Like you, I believe that Harvard must foster an academic environment that encourages freedom of thought and expression, and that we should embrace a multiplicity of viewpoints,” his letter read.\n\nBut, he added, Harvard’s efforts to create a more equitable learning environment were “undermined and threatened” by the Trump administration’s “overreach”.\n\n“Harvard will not surrender its core, legally-protected principles out of fear of unfounded retaliation by the federal government,” Garber said.\n\n“I must refute your claim that Harvard is a partisan institution. It is neither Republican nor Democratic. It is not an arm of any other political party or movement. Nor will it ever be.”","summary":"Cuts come in addition to $2.2bn in suspended contracts and grants, as US president seeks to pressure Ivy League school.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/14/trump-administration-cuts-another-450m-in-harvard-grants-in-escalating-row?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25132674739731-1747178184.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 00:33:04","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":321031226,"title":"World News | Dubai Media Council Deepens Engagement with Private Sector Partners","text":"Dubai [UAE], May 14 (ANI/WAM): As part of its ongoing efforts to empower emerging Emirati talent and strengthen their presence in the media sector, the Dubai Media Council (DMC) organised a visit for media students from the Higher Colleges of Technology to the regional headquarters of Edelman, one of the world's leading communications firms.\nOrganised as part of the 'Emirati Media Talent Pledge' initiative, launched by DMC, the visit aimed to offer students real-world exposure, highlight career paths in media, and foster direct engagement with industry professionals.\nAlso Read | 'Let's Not Trade Nuclear Missiles': In Saudi Arabia, Donald Trump Reiterates His Administration 'Brokered Historic Ceasefire' Between India and Pakistan.\nDMC affirmed that collaboration with the private sector and leading media institutions represents a key pillar in advancing the media sector in Dubai and the UAE.

Nutritionist reveals slimming secrets of the past\n\nREAD MORE: Why butter, cheese and ice cream could help you live longer\n\nBy SADIE WHITELOCKS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:56 BST, 14 May 2025 | Updated: 01:25 BST, 14 May 2025\n\nIt's no secret that everything is bigger nowadays. \n\nWhether it's houses, TVs or cars - compared to decades ago, things have gone supersized.\n\nAnd that includes serving sizes and waistlines. \n\nIn 2024, 43 percent of Americans were considered obese, compared to just 13 percent in the 1960s. \n\nExperts have blamed an increased intake of ultra processed foods and meals with more calories and warned obesity can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.\n\nAnd now, California-based nutritionist Autumn Bates has revealed what she believes is driving the obesity epidemic, detailing four reasons as to why people were slimmer in decades gone by, despite exercising less or not having access to fitness monitors like Apple Watches and FitBits. \n\nShe says she decided to investigate this phenomenon after watching a YouTube short recently that asked the question why were we so skinny in the 1960s?\n\nThe nutritionist said: '[This is a] fair question because in the 60s we had an obesity rate in America of about 13 percent. \n\n'To put that into perspective now currently as of 2025 we have an obesity rate that is closing in on 43 percent and this is all kind of wild because it's not like people were known in the 60s for their healthy food choices.\n\n'So why in the world did we have such lower body fat percentages back in the 60s?'\n\nWhile it's easy to look at the past with rose tinted glasses, scientists say it's a cold hard fact that we were much skinnier in the past than today. Above, sunbathers sit in deckchairs at Virginia Beach in the 1960s\n\nThe first driving factor behind the rise in obesity is the decline in home-cooked, fresh meals. These used to be the rule; not the exception.\n\nThey traditionally featured 'some type of really high quality protein, some fruit, some bread, some veggies and then probably milk.'\n\nShe explains this same nutritious formula applied to children's packed lunches for school, so kids were getting more of a balanced diet compared to today.\n\nFrom her research looking at what people ate in the 1960s, Ms Bates says some of the popular items included roast chicken, meatloaf, beef stew, steak and potatoes.\n\nThere was little mention of fast food, which has seen a surge in serving sizes - with calorie counts reaching nearly 2,000 for a serving of popular burgers and fries.\n\nFrom personal interactions with her family, she said in a YouTube video: 'My dad said that they would pretty much always have like pot roast and my mom has a very specific, not fond, memory of lima [or butter] beans.'\n\nMs Bates says the benefits of meals prepared at home include a lower sugar intake, extra protein and an increased amount of vegetables. \n\nA previous study from Johns Hopkins University found people who frequently cook their meals at home tend to consume fewer carbohydrates, less sugar, and less fat compared to those who don't cook as often. \n\nNext, Ms Bates says another reason why today's society is fatter than ever is because of the explosion of ultra processed foods. \n\nUltra processed foods, or UPFs, is an umbrella term used to cover anything with a long ingredients list or made with artificial additives like colorings, sweeteners and preservatives that extend shelf life.\n\nReady meals, ice cream and ketchup are some of the most-loved examples of products that fall under the UPF term, now synonymous with foods offering little nutritional value.\n\nThey are different to processed foods, which are tinkered to make them last longer or enhance their taste, such as cured meat, cheese and fresh bread.\n\nExplaining why UPFs are bad, she says: 'Ultra processed is the next level of processing that really strips down the satiety and make you so much less satisfied from your food and therefore [you] need to eat even more.\n\n'These are foods that are primarily going to have ingredients that you don't recognize and typically a long list of ingredients that you would not be able to just get your grocery store and recreate at home.'\n\nMs Bates says it is estimated that 70 percent of Americans' diet today is made up of UPFs and 'some studies have found that these ultra processed foods can make us eat about 800 calories more a day because they are so much less satisfying.'\n\nCalifornia-based nutritionist Autumn Bates (pictured above) reveals that in the 1960s America had an obesity rate of around 13 percent but today that number has more than tripled, with it now ballooning at 43 percent\n\nThe third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'\n\nMs Bates advises avoiding the fattening impact of these foods and swap them out for healthier alternatives - packaged snacks with added ingredients can be swapped for fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\n\nThe third thing that contributed to a slimmer society in the 1960s, Ms Bates says is that people were 'a lot more accidentally active'.\n\nShe continues: 'A large portion of the workforce back then had more physically demanding jobs. They also had a lot less structured activity, meaning that they didn't really work out.\n\n'My dad will always say that he was super embarrassed when he was younger because his dad was a health nut at the time and would go for runs and his friends would make fun of him and ask what he was running from because people had more active jobs.\n\n'They had a full day where they were more active versus a full day of sitting in front of a computer screen and then also probably commuting.'\n\nMs Bates notes with the rise of technology, people have become more housebound and glued to their screens, so they are getting less physical activity. \n\nMan unrecognisable after shedding a whopping eight stone thanks to an incredibly simple switch\n\nShe adds: 'My mom said that if you had to stay inside, that was a punishment when she was a kid. Kids back in the 60s really didn't have anything inside that would entertain them as much, so they had to go outside and be active and play.'\n\nFor people who have computer based jobs, Ms Bates suggests getting a walking desk, so you can walk on a treadmill while you type and keep trim. \n\nOn top of this, she recommends three to four days of structured exercise per week, such as strength training. \n\nLastly, Ms Bates points to a lack of sleep as another problem driving America's obesity epidemic. \n\nToday the average American adult gets around 7 hours and 10 minutes of sleep per night and successful modern day individuals like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and President Donald Trump have claimed that 4 hours is the optimal amount of sleep.\n\nThis compares to the 1960s, when studies show the average was closer to 8.5 hours. \n\nCommenting on this shift in sleeping patterns, Ms Bates says: 'Less sleep is significantly tied with obesity and weight gain.\n\n'Low sleep causes increased hunger hormones so you're going to feel a lot more hungry the next day. \n\n'It also increases our preferences for sweet foods and it increases our preferences for larger portion sizes.'\n\nThe nutritionist blames technology for hampering peoples' ability to sleep, with more distractions at nighttime in the form of things such as laptops, TVs and phones. \n\nShe adds: 'Plus people were more active throughout the day which meant that they were more tired and actually did want to go to sleep.\n\n'We need to set bed times again for ourselves because there are so many different temptations to stay up late whether it be like binge watching a Netflix show or just scrolling on your phone.\n\n'We need to actually set time limits for when we're going to be going to sleep.'\n\nYouTubeAppleCalifornia\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWhy were we so skinny in the 1960s?

But overriding that important constitutional debate is a more immediate and potentially far-reaching test of judicial power: the ability of individual federal judges to issue universal or nationwide injunctions, preventing temporary enforcement of President Donald Trump's sweeping executive actions. That will be the focus when the nine justices hear oral arguments Thursday morning about how President Trump's restrictions on who can be called an American citizen can proceed in the lower federal courts. Trump signed the executive order on his first day back in office that would end automatic citizenship for children of people in the U.S. illegally. SUPREME COURT POISED TO MAKE MAJOR DECISION THAT COULD SET LIMITS ON THE POWER OF DISTRICT JUDGES Separate coalitions of about two dozen states, along with immigrant rights groups, and private individuals — including several pregnant women in Maryland — have sued. Three separate federal judges subsequently issued orders temporarily blocking enforcement across the country while the issues are fully litigated in court. Appeals courts have declined to disturb those rulings. Now the three consolidated cases come to the high court in an unusual scenario, a rare May oral argument that has been fast-tracked for an expected ruling in coming days or weeks. The executive order remains on hold nationwide until the justices decide. But the cases will likely not be decided on the merits at this stage, only on whether to narrow the scope of those injunctions. That would allow the policy to take effect in limited parts of the country or only to those plaintiffs actually suing over the president's authority. SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE A high court decision could be sweeping, setting a precedent that would affect the more than 310 — and counting — federal lawsuits against White House actions filed since Jan. 20, according to a Fox News data analysis. Of those, more than 200 judicial orders have halted large parts of the president's agenda from being enacted, almost 40 of them nationwide injunctions. Dozens of other cases have seen no legal action so far on gateway issues like temporary enforcement. While the Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the use of universal injunctions, several conservative justices have expressed concerns over power. Justice Clarence Thomas in 2018 labeled them \"legally and historically dubious,\" adding, \"These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court system – preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch.\" Emergency docket and politics of the moment And it comes to the Supreme Court as part of the so-called emergency or \"shadow\" docket, time-sensitive appeals known officially as \"applications\" that usually arrive in the early stages. They seek to temporarily block or delay a lower court or government action that, despite its procedurally narrow posture, can have immediate and far-reaching implications. Things like requests for stays of execution, voting restrictions, COVID vaccine mandates or access to a federally approved abortion medication and, since January, Trump's sweeping executive reform plans. Some members of the court have expressed concern that these kinds of appeals are arriving with greater frequency in recent years, high-profile issues leading to rushed decisions without the benefit of full briefing or deliberation. 'ACTIVIST' JUDGES KEEP TRYING TO CURB TRUMP’S AGENDA – HERE’S HOW HE COULD PUSH BACK Justice Elena Kagan last year said the shadow docket's caseload has been \"relentless,\" adding, \"We’ve gotten into a pattern where we're doing too many of them.\" The pace this term has only increased with the new administration frustrated at dozens of lower court setbacks. \"We've seen a lot of justices critical of the fact that the court is taking an increasing number of cases and deciding them using the shadow docket,\" said Thomas Dupree, a former top Justice Department lawyer and a top appellate advocate. \"These justices say, 'Look, we don't have to decide this on an emergency basis. We can wait.'\" Many progressive lawyers complain the Trump administration has been too eager to bypass the normal district and intermediate appellate court process, seeking quick, end-around Supreme Court review on consequential questions of law only when it loses. The debate over birthright citizenship and injunctions is expected to expose further ideological divides on the court's 6-3 conservative majority. That is especially true when it comes to the 13 challenges over Trump policies that have reached the justices so far, with six of them awaiting a ruling. The court's three more liberal justices have pushed back at several preliminary victories for the administration, including its ban on transgender individuals serving in the military and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport scores of illegal immigrants suspected of criminal gang activity in the U.S. TRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE Dissenting in one such emergency appeal over the deportations to El Salvador, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"The Government’s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law.\" \"Our job is to stand up for people who can't do it themselves. And our job is to be the champion of lost causes,\" Sotomayor separately told an American Bar Association audience last week. \"But, right now, we can't lose the battles we are facing. And we need trained and passionate and committed lawyers to fight this fight.\" Trump has made no secret of his disdain for judges who have ruled against his policies or at least blocked them from being immediately implemented. He called for the formal removal of one federal judge after an adverse decision over deporting illegal immigrants. That prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare public statement, saying, \"Impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\" And in separate remarks last week, the chief justice underscored the judiciary's duty to \"check the excesses of Congress or the executive.\" The arguments The first section of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Trump said last month he was \"so happy\" the Supreme Court will hear arguments, adding, \"I think the case has been so misunderstood.\" The president said the 14th Amendment, granting automatic citizenship to people born in the U.S., was ratified right after the Civil War, which he interpreted as \"all about slavery.\" \"If you look at it that way, we would win that case,\" the president said in Oval Office remarks. Executive Order 14160, \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" would deny it to those born after Feb. 19 whose parents are illegal immigrants. And it bans federal agencies from issuing or accepting documents recognizing citizenship for those children. An estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 are living with an unauthorized immigrant parent, according to the Pew Research Center. There are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country, 3.3% of the population. Although some census experts suggest those numbers may be higher. But in its legal brief filed with the high court, the Justice Department argues the issue now is really about judges blocking enforcement of the president's policies while the cases weave their way through the courts, a process that could last months or even years. The government initially framed its high court appeal as a \"modest request.\" CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ADDRESSES DIVISIONS BETWEEN JUSTICES AFTER SEVERAL RECENT SCOTUS SKIRMISHES \"These injunctions exceed the district courts’ authority under Article III [of the Constitution] and gravely encroach on the President’s executive power under Article II,\" said Solicitor General John Sauer, who will argue the administration's case Thursday. \"Until this Court decides whether nationwide injunctions are permissible, a carefully selected subset of district courts will persist in granting them as a matter of course, relying on malleable eye-of-the-beholder criteria.\" The plaintiffs counter the government is misguided in what it calls \"citizenship stripping\" and the use of nationwide injunctions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Being directed to follow the law as it has been universally understood for over 125 years is not an emergency warranting the extraordinary remedy of a stay,\" said Nicholas Brown, the attorney general of Washington state. \"If this Court steps in when the applicant [government] is so plainly wrong on the law, there will be no end to stay applications and claims of emergency, undermining the proper role and stature of this Court. This Court should deny the applications.\" The consolidated cases are Trump v. CASA (24a884); Trump v. State of Washington (24a885); Trump v. New Jersey (24a886).","summary":"Overriding the Supreme Court&apos;s pending review of a birthright citizenship case involving the Trump administration is a much broader question of federal judges&apos; power.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-debate-trump-restrictions-birthright-citizenship-enforcement-nationwide-injunctions","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/trump-scotus.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 00:24:54","author":"Bill Mears,Shannon Bream","authors":["Bill Mears","Shannon Bream"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.046},{"id":321031232,"title":"World News | Trump's New Pardon Attorney Says He Will Scrutinise Pardons That Biden Issued at the End of His Term","text":"Washington, May 14 (AP) Ed Martin Jr., who will be the Justice Department's new pardon attorney after President Donald Trump pulled his nomination to be the top federal prosecutor for Washington, said Tuesday that he plans to scrutinise pardons that former President Joe Biden issued on his way out of the White House. “These are big moments, and so they have to be able to withstand scrutiny,\" Martin told reporters on Tuesday, his last full day as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.

The pardons were designed to guard against possible retribution by President Donald Trump.

Trump pulled Martin's nomination last week amid bipartisan opposition and replaced him with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who is expected to be sworn into office on Wednesday. Instead, Martin will serve as an associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney. In his new role, Martin also will be director of the “weaponisation working group” at the Justice Department. Attorney General Pam Bondi called for creating that group in February to investigate the work of former special counsel Jack Smith, who led two federal prosecutions of Trump that were ultimately abandoned, and other examples of what Republicans claim to be unfair targeting of conservatives during Biden's administration. In announcing his last-minute pardons, Biden said his family had been “subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics.” “Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end,” he said on the day of Trump's second inauguration. Martin told reporters that he believes Biden's pardons “need some scrutiny.” “They need scrutiny because we want pardons to matter and to be accepted and to be something that's used correctly. So I do think we're going to take a hard look at how they went and what they did,” he said. The Constitution grants broad pardon powers to presidents and their clemency actions cannot be undone by courts or other officials. It's not clear what action, if any, Martin believes he would be able to take regarding Biden's pardons. Martin said the U.S. Attorney's office under his leadership already had been “taking a look at some of the conduct surrounding the pardons and the Biden White House.” Trump also has used the president's sweeping pardon powers to benefit those close to him. In his final weeks of his first term, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. On the first day of his second term, Trump pardoned nearly all of the 1,500 people charged with crimes in the Capitol riot, freeing from prison dozens of people convicted of assaulting police. Trump appointed Martin as acting U.S. Attorney during his first week back in the White House. Martin oversaw the dismissal of hundreds of Capitol riot cases after Trump's Jan. 6 pardons. But his hopes of keeping the job faded amid questions about his lack of prosecutorial experience and his divisive politics. Trump yanked Martin's nomination two days after a key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his defense of Capitol rioters. “Ultimately, the president decided we didn't want to keep going forward,” Martin said. “The president of the United States said we have other battles to do, and so I'm excited about that.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

He won the Iowa Democratic caucus during his brief presidential run in 2020.\n\nDuring a live Substack interview with journalist Anand Giridharadas, Buttigieg said that before making a final decision, he’ll “assess the office and what it calls for” as well as “assess what I bring to the table.” \n\n“There are times I follow that process and decided to run. And there are times I followed that process and decided not to run. And the process can lead you to surprising places,” Buttigieg said, adding that he is a “long way off” from a decision.\n\nThe possible 2028 contender’s remarks came just a few hours before he hosted a town hall for veterans in Cedar Rapids. Sponsored by the left-wing organization VoteVets, the town hall focused on how Democrats fear President Donald Trump‘s cuts to federal agencies and programs will negatively affect veterans and military families.\n\nAmid speculation he will run for the country’s highest office, Buttigieg has been ramping up outreach on new media platforms, which are increasingly viewed as critical to reaching large swaths of voters.\n\n“I’m using my voice best I can in traditional media and new media, and I’m going to continue having conversations with neighbors, with voters, talking about how we could have a better way,” he previously told the Washington Examiner. “I don’t know what that means for me, politically or professionally, a long way from making any decisions about that, but I know that’s what I need to be doing right now.”\n\nButtigieg further addressed his media strategy on Tuesday, explaining that he is trying to reach “people who represent a real breadth of ideological difference.” \n\nBroadening his appeal is critical to reaching a majority of the electorate and clinching a win should he run in 2028. \n\n“Right now, I live in a 50-50 county in Michigan,” Buttigieg told Giridharadas. “I’m literally, physically, co-located with people who represent a real breadth of ideological difference.

His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nHaines initially approved the case as a class action, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using the AEA to deport any migrants in her district. \n\nBut she lifted that designation Tuesday, clearing the way for deportations to resume as long as the people being removed are given at least 21 days notice in English and Spanish as well as an 'opportunity to be heard' on any objections they might have. \n\nMany Tren de Aragua members were deported as part of the president's immigration crackdown and sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.\n\nIn November before Trump took office, it was revealed the Venezuelan super gang's territory covered half of America's population, posing challenges for law enforcement agencies across the US who are trying to combat the mob's wave of crime.\n\nThe gang had spread its tentacles across Virginia, Washington DC, Montana and Wyoming, according to an internal Homeland Security department intelligence memo obtained by The New York Post.\n\nOfficials warned that TdA's arrival in the US capital and nearby Virginia coincides with 'increases in migrant populations' in the area, the memo states.\n\nTdA was reportedly targeting DC because the city provides easy travel access to wealthy northern Virginian suburbs where gangsters are carrying out thefts, robberies and assaults.\n\nThe mob's bloodthirsty members have also increased their 'violent tendencies' and has become more engaged with 'lower-level fraud and theft schemes' that allow them to send stolen funds 'back to South America as a means of financing additional criminal enterprises', according to the intelligence document.\n\nHomeland security officials warned that as the 'population of Venezuelan nationals continues to increase, the potential for violent TdA migrants is highly probable'.\n\nIn addition to its expanded territory, TdA also had footholds in New York, New Jersey, California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Colorado.","summary":"A judge appointed by Donald Trump ruled the president can use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens who are shown to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14709433/Trump-judge-makes-bombshell-ruling-tren-aragua.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/14/00/98354759-0-image-a-25_1747180694389.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/29/8352342017037845877/1024x576_MP4_8352342017037845877.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-14 00:16:58","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

India on Monday firmly reiterated that all matters relating to Jammu and Kashmir must be addressed bilaterally with Pakistan and noted that the outstanding issue is the vacation of Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nAddressing a media briefing, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that India's policy that issues pertaining to Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed bilaterally with Pakistan has not changed.\n\"We have a long-standing national position that any issues pertaining to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have to be addressed by India and Pakistan bilaterally. That stated policy has not changed. The outstanding matter is the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan,\" Jaiswal said.\nAnswering a query, he said there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation from the time Operation Sindoor commenced on May 7 but trade did not come up in any of these discussions.\n\"From the time Operation Sindoor commenced on 7th May till the understanding on cessation of firing and military action on 10th May, there were conversations between Indian and US leaders on the evolving military situation. The issue of trade did not come up in any of these discussions,\" he said. Jaiswal was responding to question about US President Donald Trump's remarks in which he had mentioned trade in the context of tensions between India and Pakistan. Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration played a crucial role in brokering an immediate cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan, following escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\"We stopped a nuclear conflict. I think it could have been a bad nuclear war. Millions of people could have been killed. I also want to thank VP JD Vance and Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, for their work. On Saturday, my administration helped broker an immediate cessation of hostilities, I think a permanent one between India and Pakistan the countries having a lot of nuclear weapons,\" Trump told the media.\n\"I'm very proud to let you know that the leadership of India and Pakistan was unwavering and powerful... And we helped a lot, and we also helped with trade. I said, 'Come on, we're going to do a lot of trade with you guys. Let's stop it, let's stop it. If you stop it, we're doing trade. If you don't stop it, we're not going to do any trade,\" he added. In his post on X on May 10, Trump had said India and Pakistan have agreed to \"full and immediate ceasefire\". \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Trump had said in a post on Truth Social. India's precision strikes on terrorist infrastructure came in response to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 26 people were killed. The government had said that the perpetrators will face severe punishment and over 100 terrorists were killed in Operation Sindoor. Indian Armed Forces effectively repelled Pakistan's subsequent military aggression and pounded several airbases in Pakistan. The two countries have now reached an understanding to stop firing and military action after Pakistan DGMO reached out to his Indian counterpart.

Tina Kotek released a video assuring Oregonians that Donald Trump would not derail the progressive state’s efforts to combat climate change.\n\nAs promised during his presidential campaign, Trump had issued executive orders during his first week in office aimed at halting new sources of wind power and freezing Biden-era funding for renewable energy.\n\nOregon, Kotek said, had been “leading the way for years on courageous state policies to fight climate change.” Along with neighboring Washington state, Oregon has set an ambitious mandate for electric utilities to be carbon neutral within the next two decades.\n\n“It’s going to take all of us working together finding innovative solutions, no matter the obstacles, to confront the climate crisis,” the governor said, “and we are not turning back.”\n\nBut the reality is not nearly as inspiring as Kotek made it sound. For all their progressive claims, Oregon and Washington trail nearly all other states in adding new sources of renewable energy. Iowa, a Republican-led state with roughly the same population and usable volume of wind as Oregon, has built enough wind farms to generate three times as much wind power.\n\nWhat’s held the Northwest back is a bottleneck Oregon and Washington leaders paid little attention to when they set out to go 100% green, an investigation by ProPublica and Oregon Public Broadcasting found: The region lacks the wiring to deliver new sources of renewable energy to people’s homes, and little has been done to change that.\n\nNorthwest leaders left it to a federal agency known as the Bonneville Power Administration to arrange badly needed upgrades to an electrical grid that’s nearly a century old in places.\n\nBonneville, under a setup that is unique to the Northwest, owns most of the power lines needed to carry green power from the region’s sunny and windy high desert to its major population centers. Bonneville has no state or local representation within its federally appointed bureaucracy and, by statute, operates as a self-funded business.\n\nThe agency decides which energy projects can hook up based on whether its infrastructure can handle the extra load, and it decides how quickly that infrastructure gets expanded. Its glacial pace has delayed wind and solar projects under Democratic and Republican presidents alike.\n\nOf the 469 large renewable projects that applied to connect to Bonneville‘s grid since 2015, only one has reached approval. Those are longer odds than in any other region of the country, the news organizations found. No major grid operator is as stingy as Bonneville in its approach to financing new transmission lines and substations needed to grow the power supply, according to industry groups that represent power producers.\n\nEfforts to bypass Bonneville didn’t start until this year, when Oregon and Washington legislators considered bills to create their own state bonding authorities for upgrading the region’s high-voltage network.\n\nBoth bills died.\n\nThe grid’s severe constraints are hindering the Northwest at a time when it desperately needs more electricity. Oregon and Washington lawmakers lured power-guzzling data centers with tax breaks in recent years, and the industry has helped drive electricity demand sky high.\n\nHaving failed to add enough green-energy sources or any new gas-fired power, the Northwest buys electricity from elsewhere, at high prices, during extreme weather. Rates paid by customers of major Oregon utilities are now 50% higher than five years ago. The worsening energy shortage threatens millions of residents with continual rate hikes and sporadic power outages — not to mention dashing the Northwest’s hopes of drastically reducing its contribution to climate change.\n\n“The people who, technically speaking, are in charge of our transmission system are dropping the ball,” said Oregon state Rep. Mark Gamba, a Democrat who sponsored this year’s failed legislation aimed at creating a state grid improvement authority. “We are absolutely looking at rolling blackouts, and we are absolutely looking at not hitting any of our climate targets when it comes to energy production.”\n\nKotek declined an interview request. Kotek spokesperson Anca Matica said in a statement that the governor is “open to innovative ideas to increase transmission capacity” and labeled it key to achieving the state’s energy goals. She offered no direct response to questions about Oregon’s lack of progress in boosting renewables.\n\nReuven Carlyle, the former state senator who crafted Washington’s 2019 decarbonization bill, said he was “deeply cognizant” of the region’s transmission challenges at the time but that plans to address the problem “simply slipped.”\n\n“It’s certainly nothing to be proud of that it didn’t get resolved,” said Carlyle, who founded a consulting firm for climate-focused investments after leaving the Legislature. “And it’s embarrassing that Oregon and Washington, which are such good-looking states, simply can’t practically build anything in terms of energy.”\n\nIn the final months of the Biden administration, Bonneville announced a plan to do some grid upgrades, and agency Administrator John Hairston has said the self-funded federal agency is investing in transmission as much as it can without taking on too much debt.\n\nBonneville responded to written questions from OPB and ProPublica by citing recent improvements to its process for connecting energy projects and noting that it’s not the only player responsible for growing the grid. The agency added that it “remains committed to its critical mission of supporting the region with affordable, reliable and secure power.”\n\nBut Bonneville‘s latest plans for the grid are in jeopardy. In addition to suspending all new federal wind permits, the Trump White House has added Bonneville to the long list of agencies cutting federal jobs. Three Bonneville employees, requesting anonymity for fear of retribution, said the cuts will make building out the transmission system even harder.\n\nWith four years of Joe Biden’s climate activism in the rearview mirror, the Pacific Northwest appears to have blown its best chance to realize its ambitions for renewable power.\n\nProjects in limbo\n\nDavid Brown is a case study in the long and agonizing path to breaking ground on a Northwest solar farm.\n\nThe Portland energy developer has been in the renewables business since 2003, and his firm, Obsidian Renewables, has a plan to put a vast array of solar panels on a piece of southern Oregon high desert that’s the size of 3,000 football fields. Brown said it’s expected to produce enough energy for about 110,000 homes.\n\nObsidian will handle everything from acquiring the land to getting permits approved, then look to sell the solar farm to an investor or utility once it’s ready for construction.\n\nBut any power plant, whether fueled by coal, wind or sunshine, has to be wired into the electrical grid: a system of transmission lines and transformers that pools electricity and channels it to customers. While power lines crisscross the nation, power mainly gets used within the region that generates it.\n\nAs in most parts of the Northwest, the nearest transmission lines Brown could plug into belong to Bonneville. He asked the agency for permission to connect his solar farm to its system in 2020. He doesn’t expect approval until at least 2028.\n\n“I don’t know a single place in Oregon or Washington where I can connect a new solar project and get transmission. Not one,” he said.\n\nOne part of the holdup is that Bonneville needs to finish studying what kind of substation it will need to safely let a big new power source into the grid.\n\nBrown’s 400-megawatt solar farm has been through three such “interconnection” studies so far. The first time, Bonneville estimated Brown’s business would need to pay $23 million to build a substation, which Bonneville would own. The second study bumped the price to $70 million. By the third, Brown said, it was $212 million. He said the agency blamed supply chain and labor issues, in part, for the near-tripling in cost over four years.\n\n There are hundreds of projects like Brown’s: more than 200,000 megawatts worth of renewable energy awaiting Bonneville‘s signoff, or enough to power the Northwest nearly 10 times over. One proposed wind farm has been in Bonneville‘s queue for more than 16 years.\n\nAmong projects 20 megawatts or bigger that were proposed in the past decade, the only one that made it through Bonneville‘s waitlist was an add-on to an existing Portland General Electric wind farm that didn’t require any major transmission upgrades. It won approval in 2022.\n\nThe Northwest is not the only region with a backlog of projects waiting to plug in. Grid operators across the country have navigated a deluge of new wind, solar and mass-storage battery requests in recent years. Many applicants proved to be merely testing the waters, with nearly 3 in 4 ultimately pulling their plans, according to Joseph Rand, an energy researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nBut other regions managed to sort out problems better than the Northwest, OPB and ProPublica found.\n\nThe news organizations used data from Bonneville and from a national database compiled by researchers at the Berkeley Lab to analyze how many large renewable energy projects waiting for grid connections made it to the finish line.\n\nThe data showed that for large projects proposed since 2015, Bonneville‘s one approval translates to a success rate of 0.2%, the lowest rate of any region. By contrast, about 10% of new applications for major projects in the Midwest and 28% in Texas made it through.\n\nBonneville has said one reason for the slow progress is that its waitlist is jammed up with too many “speculative” projects — more dream than financial reality. (There’s no evidence that Bonneville has it worse, though; data shows that the share of developers who back out after seeking Bonneville‘s approval, 76%, is close to the national average.)\n\nRenewable advocates and energy developers say Bonneville struggles to hire and retain people to process connection requests because the agency pays less than the private sector. In January, Washington U.S. Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat, and Dan Newhouse, a Republican, introduced a bill to make Bonneville‘s compensation more competitive, but it hasn’t moved since.\n\nTo speed things up, Bonneville has halted new requests for grid connections and changed its approach to reviewing applications. Where specialists used to review proposals one at a time, in the order received, they now plan to prioritize projects that are closest to ready. The agency said the new approach will increase the number of projects that get connected while cutting processing time in half, from an expected 15 years.\n\nBonneville said in a statement that it is “confident the interconnection reforms we adopted” will prove “sufficient to meet our customers’ needs.”\n\nThe changes have not yet helped Brown, who has been awaiting Bonneville‘s approval to start work in southern Oregon since 2020. For now, the planned solar project remains in limbo.\n\n“It’s gonna take me years and a couple million dollars to get land use approval,” Brown said, “and why do I want to get land use approval if I don’t know whether or not I have transmission?”\n\n‘No room for your project’\n\nThe predicament Brown and dozens of other wind and solar developers face is a product of the Northwest’s unusual history with electric power.\n\nOregon and Washington were blessed with powerful rivers fed by abundant snow and rainfall. Beginning in the New Deal era, the federal government built dozens of hydroelectric dams and a sprawling transmission system to electrify the rural West. The region’s energy supply was cheaper and emitted less carbon than the rest of the nation’s. Bonneville was at the helm.\n\nEven today, hydropower supplies almost 35% of Oregon’s electricity and more than 50% of Washington’s, according to the most recent data available.\n\nBut hydroelectric dams are a finite and increasingly shaky power source. Output from existing dams dips whenever droughts sap water from the Columbia River basin. New dams are a nonstarter because dams have decimated the region’s salmon populations.\n\nThat leaves wind, solar and battery storage as the most promising places for the Northwest to turn as it approaches self-imposed deadlines to fully wean utilities off electricity that comes from oil, coal or gas.\n\nBonneville has now become a barrier to accommodating the new power sources, six green energy developers told OPB and ProPublica.\n\nAn agency that erected more than 4,800 miles of high-voltage transmission lines from 1960 to 1990 built fewer than 500 miles from 1990 to 2020. In the past five years, it built 1.\n\nBonneville has the ability to borrow money, at low interest rates, for projects that would enable the grid to carry more power. Congress pushed the agency to do so in 2021, more than doubling Bonneville‘s debt limit specifically to finance transmission upgrades.\n\nThe chairs of the Oregon and Washington public utility commissions, in a joint 2022 letter, urged Bonneville to spend the money: “The region needs BPA to be a leader in delivering a transmission system that serves the entire region.”\n\nBonneville, however, has been reluctant to take on debt. It is still paying off billions of dollars in bonds from failed nuclear plants in the 1970s. As recently as 2019, the agency’s finances were so poor that some economists expected it to become insolvent.\n\nBonneville‘s transmission planners, for their part, have told OPB and ProPublica in previous interviews that they want to avoid building expensive transmission lines that no one ends up using.\n\n“We can’t speculate and build a transmission line to nowhere,” Jeff Cook, the agency’s vice president for transmission planning, said in May 2024.\n\nWhen Bonneville announced in the fall it would tap some of its expanded debt limit to help pay for $5 billion in transmission upgrades over a decade, renewable energy advocates characterized the work as long overdue maintenance that wouldn’t provide the expansion the grid needs.\n\nMost of the work Bonneville announced was “the equivalent of fixing potholes, installing some new round-abouts, doing some repaving,” Spencer Gray, executive director of the Northwest & Intermountain Power Producers Coalition, said in an email.\n\nA further frustration for wind and solar developers that is unique to Bonneville: The grid operator makes them absorb an outsize share of the cost for projects that help the transmission network accommodate their electricity — and it requires a big deposit up front. That’s true even if the new power lines benefit a wide network and will be around for many generations of customers.\n\n“Lately, the answer to these individual developers has been, ‘There’s no room for your project. If you want to put this project on our system, it’s going to cost you this many millions of dollars to help us upgrade the system,’” said Sarah Edmonds, president of a coalition of utilities known as the Western Power Pool.\n\nThe approach, Edmonds said, has had “a chilling effect on the ability of developers to get their projects online.”\n\nMichelle Manary, Bonneville‘s vice president of transmission marketing and sales, said requiring up-front deposits keeps existing ratepayers from getting stuck with the tab if a developer backs out and that Bonneville has begun work on a transmission upgrade. She said other regions have more control over who pays these costs because their entire distribution networks are under one operator. Bonneville‘s transmission lines are more like highways, from which electric utilities serve as exit ramps that deliver power the last mile to Northwest neighborhoods.\n\nManary denied that Bonneville‘s current way of allocating costs has stifled green energy projects. But she acknowledged the agency needs to reevaluate its policy amid the flood of applications for new projects, and she said that process is underway.\n\n‘Texas is kicking our ass’\n\nThe rest of the nation has taken a different approach to bringing green power online — with better outcomes.\n\nIn most parts of the country, each grid has a central, independent operator, known as a regional transmission organization, typically run by a board that represents customers, electric utilities and other groups. Bonneville recently rejected joining a California-based energy market that advocates described as the Northwest’s best bet at accelerating the adoption of renewables.\n\nIn Texas, which runs its own grid, large renewable projects applying to connect in the past decade took a median of 19 months to get the green light, or nearly two years less than the one project Bonneville approved in that time frame. California and the Midwest were also faster than Bonneville.\n\nTexas doesn’t require project-by-project grid upgrades the way other grid operators do. It essentially tells developers it will connect their project, and then it figures out how to balance the added electricity after the fact.\n\nTexas and other regional grid operators spend billions more than Bonneville on transmission upgrades annually, and they spread the costs across a wider swath of customers than Bonneville does. (Bonneville says the federal agency differs so much from regional operators that they’re not a fair comparison group.)\n\nTexas brought more energy online in the past two years than any other power region. That’s helped the oil and gas powerhouse become the country’s biggest producer of wind and solar energy. Last year alone it added more than enough renewable energy to power the entire Northwest.\n\n“Texas is kicking our ass,” said Gamba, the Oregon state representative.\n\nNorthwest lawmakers were told that they’d need to find effective ways of confronting their region’s aging transmission system if they wished to phase out coal and natural gas.\n\nAs Washington lawmakers debated a mandate for renewable power in 2019, Nicholas Garcia of the Washington Public Utility Districts Association testified that replacing coal plants with wind and solar would require “more transmission, significantly more transmission.”\n\nIn 2021, when Oregon lawmakers debated their own mandate for carbon-free energy, Republicans also raised concerns that the state’s transmission lines were maxed out. It became one more GOP argument against the bill, in addition to saying more should be done to ensure green energy projects were built in Oregon.\n\nNumerous reports — from the Oregon and U.S. departments of energy, for example — supported the assertion that heftier transmission lines were needed. \n\nBonneville would be key to meeting that need, with one utilities lobbyist calling Bonneville‘s grid “the backbone for decarbonization” in testimony to Oregon lawmakers.\n\nBut Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, who led the 2021 effort, said in a recent interview she was focused on getting utilities to cut their carbon emissions and that green energy advocates weren’t demanding transmission improvements at the time.\n\n“I was not thinking personally about the role that Bonneville might play in this,” said Marsh, a Democrat representing southern Oregon.\n\nWashington’s Legislature took some action on the need for better transmission: It required the state to study the issue. The resulting 2022 report concluded that the grid was indeed inadequate but led to little in the way of solutions. Instead, lawmakers decided to require utilities to plan out transmission needs 20 years ahead rather than 10, and they created a statewide environmental review in hopes of streamlining the state’s approval process for transmission. It did nothing about impediments posed by Bonneville.\n\nThe Legislature was “a little complacent” about relying on Bonneville to upgrade the grid, said Sen. Sharon Shewmake, a freshman lawmaker in 2019 when Washington enacted its energy mandate.\n\nShewmake and Gamba both introduced legislation this year following states like Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming in creating independent authorities to finance transmission infrastructure. Gamba said he led an 80-person group of interested parties through 18 months of drafting. Democratic Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson labeled Shewmake’s bill a priority.\n\nThe legislation didn’t make it through either state’s Democrat-controlled legislatures, however.\n\nBrown, the energy developer who’s been awaiting Bonneville‘s solar approval since 2020, said the future of the Northwest’s energy dreams looks dim.\n\n“We don’t have a prayer of meeting our heralded, flag-waving renewable energy goals,” he said. “The dialogue will be to blame Trump; it won’t be to blame ourselves for poor planning and extremely low expectations.”","summary":"BPA's glacial pace in upgrading its grid has delayed wind and solar projects and threatens the region with power outages and missed climate targets, lawmakers and others say.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/environment/2025/05/oregon-washington-trail-almost-every-state-in-adding-green-energy.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/ETNO7LJVE5H5FCYDU3C4E3GA34.jpg?auth=ce607555b0e3539724f7ee0f0468af0087f0fc7e45a5fa924a363e9322e568d3&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 00:11:39","author":"Monica Samoyoa,Tony Schick","authors":["Monica Samoyoa","Tony Schick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":321029340,"title":"Charges Proceed Against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan in Immigration Case After Grand Jury Indictment","text":"MADISON, Wis. — A federal grand jury has brought charges against a Wisconsin judge on Tuesday, alleging she assisted someone in evading immigration authorities, thereby moving the case forward.\n\nThe detention of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has intensified a confrontation between President Donald Trump’s administration and local officials over the Republican’s extensive immigration enforcement. Democrats claim the Trump administration aims to make an example of Dugan on a national scale to deter judicial resistance to the immigration policies.\n\nIn April, prosecutors accused Dugan of hiding an individual to thwart arrest and committing obstruction. Within the federal criminal justice system, charges against a suspect can be initiated by filing a complaint or presenting evidence to a grand jury, who then decides whether to indict.\n\nA grand jury still reviews charges brought by complaint to determine whether enough probable cause exists to continue the case as a check on prosecutors’ power. If the grand jury determines there’s probable cause, it issues a written statement of the charges known as an indictment. That’s what happened in Dugan’s case.\n\nDugan faces up to six years in prison if she’s convicted on both counts. Her team of defense attorneys responded to the indictment with a one-sentence statement saying that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. She was scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.\n\nKenneth Gales, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Milwaukee, declined to comment on the indictment Tuesday evening.\n\nDugan’s case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.\n\nProsecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest.\n\nAccording to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan’s courtroom that morning of April 18 for a hearing.\n\nCourt documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents’ presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry over the agents’ arrival and called the situation “absurd” before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and anotherjudge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a “confrontational, angry demeanor.”\n\nAfter a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.\n\nShe then returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of “wait, come with me” and ushered Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a back jury door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case at the time, according to online state court records.\n\nFederal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.\n\nThe state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. A reserve judge is filling in for her.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMADISON, Wis. &#8212; A federal grand jury has brought charges against a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Charges Proceed Against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan in Immigration Case After Grand Jury Indictment first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/charges-proceed-against-wisconsin-judge-hannah-dugan-in-immigration-case-after-grand-jury-indictment/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wisconsin-judge-Hannah-Dugan-indicted-by-grand-jury-in-immigration.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-14 00:09:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":321037898,"title":"Trump wants to create fair trade across the globe, says GOP senator","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nThe Evening Edit May 13, 2025 02:31 \n\n Trump wants to create fair trade across the globe, says GOP senator \n Sen.

No other clear candidates emerge from research.' \n\nMusk has not commented on the post, however he has been known to take various drugs of that ilk.\n\nIn December, he admitted to upgrading from Ozempic to a medication that has been hailed the 'King Kong' of weight loss drugs.\n\nMusk, 53, admitted to taking Mounjaro, a drug that typically treats type-2 diabetes by lowering a person's blood sugar levels, in a festive holiday post on his social media platform X.\n\nThe billionaire Tesla CEO posted a pictured of himself in a Santa Claus costume posing in front of a Christmas tree and wrote, 'Ozempic Santa'. \n\nHe added: 'Like Cocaine Bear, but Santa and Ozempic!

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hosted the lunch. The lunch was part of Trump&apos;s high-stakes tour of the Persian Gulf region, targeting business deals and strategic partnerships with three oil-rich nations — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. AMERICAN CEOS ELON MUSK, SAM ALTMAN, LARRY FINK JOIN TRUMP AT SAUDI ROYAL COURT A list obtained by FOX Business and media reports Tuesday indicated the lunch in Riyadh had quite a few business executives present, including the following people, some of whom have been critical of Trump in the past. Altman, once a critic of Trump and a contributor to Joe Biden&apos;s presidential campaign, was photographed at the Saudi royal court. In January, the OpenAI CEO wrote on X that \"watching @potus more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him,\" adding Trump \"will be incredible for the country in many ways,\" though Altman&apos;s \"not going to agree with him on everything.\" \"Good discussion on AI leadership with President Trump and my colleagues from across the AI industry. Thanks for our Saudi hosts as well,\" Wang wrote Tuesday in an X post, sharing a screenshot of a news broadcast showing him shaking hands with the president. Musk was a major supporter of Trump during the 2024 campaign cycle. When the president took office in January, Musk became the head of the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Jassy, an attendee at the lunch, was also a speaker at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in the capital of Saudi Arabia Tuesday.

In a letter to Harvard on Tuesday, a federal antisemitism task force said Harvard will lose grants from eight federal agencies in addition to $2.2 billion that was previously frozen by the Trump administration. Also Read | 'Let's Not Trade Nuclear Missiles': In Saudi Arabia, Donald Trump Reiterates His Administration 'Brokered Historic Ceasefire' Between India and Pakistan. The letter said Harvard has become a “breeding ground for virtue signalling and discrimination” and faces a “steep, uphill battle” to reclaim its legacy as a place of academic excellence. “There is a dark problem on Harvard's campus, and by prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school's claim to taxpayer support,” the letter said. Also Read | Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia Speech Will Urge Iran Toward 'New and Better Path' as He Pushes for Nuclear Deal. It was signed by officials at the Education Department, Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration. Hours after the latest cuts Tuesday, Harvard filed a legal challenge to several sanctions imposed by the Trump administration in recent weeks. It was filed as an update to the university's April lawsuit seeking to block the initial $2.2 billion freeze. Harvard has faced escalating sanctions from the White House after becoming the first U.S. university to openly defy the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian activism and end diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Trump, a Republican, has said he wants Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, and the Department of Homeland Security has threatened to revoke the school's eligibility to host foreign students. Last week, the Education Department said Harvard will receive no new federal grants until it meets the government's demands. The Trump administration has demanded Harvard make broad leadership changes, revise its admissions policies and audit its faculty and student body to ensure the campus is home to many viewpoints. The demands are part of a pressure campaign targeting several other high-profile universities. The administration has cut off money to colleges including Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University, seeking compliance with Trump's agenda. In its amended lawsuit, Harvard said much of the funding that was initially frozen has now been terminated, apparently with no hope to restore it. A May 6 letter from the National Institute of Health notified Harvard that grants were being cut over allegations of campus antisemitism. It said grants are typically suspended pending an opportunity to take corrective action, but “no corrective action is possible here,” according to the lawsuit. Harvard later received similar letters from the Defense Department, Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture and other agencies, according to the suit. It's seeking to have those cuts overturned. Harvard President Alan Garber disputed the government's allegations in a Monday letter, saying Harvard is nonpartisan and has taken steps to root out antisemitism on campus. He insisted that Harvard is in compliance with the law, calling the federal sanctions an “unlawful attempt to control fundamental aspects of our university's operations.” The government's letter on Tuesday said Harvard has repeatedly failed to address racial discrimination and antisemitism on campus. It cited the Supreme Court's 2023 decision striking down Harvard's use of race in the admissions process, along with a recent internal report at Harvard detailing cases of antisemitic harassment.

Haines did not rule whether A.S.R. was a member of the gang, but she said people like him must be given more opportunity to challenge their deportations.\n\nHaines required the government to provide notice in Spanish and English, and to provide interpreters when necessary.\n\nLee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing A.S.R., said he would appeal.\n\n“We strongly disagree with the Court’s decision to allow the government to continue using this wartime authority during peacetime, and will appeal that aspect of the decision,” Gelernt said. Haines’ ruling is contrary to other federal courts’ decisions on the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, which the president invoked in March as legal justification for deporting hundreds of men whom his administration accused of being Tren de Aragua members.\n\nFederal judges in New York, Colorado and Texas have ruled against Trump’s use of the law to deport Venezuelans.\n\nHaines, in her ruling, noted that her district has jurisdiction over the petition filed by A.S.R., even though he was transferred from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, on April 15 to an ICE detention center in Texas, despite a temporary restraining order issued that day barring his transfer from the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Trump administration has deported alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an arrangement in which the United States is paying the Central American nation $6 million.

The PKK has \"completed its historical mission\", said a statement published by a news agency close to the group, and the struggle against Turkey's oppression of Kurdish people could now continue via \"democratic politics\".\nThe move \"signals the potential end of a conflict that has plagued the region\", said Al Jazeera, \"spilling over\" into Iraq and Syria and killing an estimated 40,000 people.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Originally, it aimed to create an independent state for Kurds, an ethnic group of about 40 million people spread over Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. Such independence was promised by the allied powers after the First World War, but never granted.\n\nBut in recent years the group has \"called for more autonomy within Turkey instead\", said CNN, and greater rights for Kurds, who are Turkey's biggest minority, accounting for \"between 15% and 20%\" of the population.\nThe PKK has been designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the UK, EU and US. After the collapse of multiple ceasefires, the conflict \"has been on a low boil for years\", said The New York Times. Öcalan, the group's founder and leader, has been imprisoned on an island near Istanbul since 1999, although occasional attacks have \"revived fears of a wider conflict\".\nBut last October Devlet Bahceli, one of Turkey's most powerful politicians and a key ally of President Erdogan, made Öcalan an offer: if he would disband the PKK, it would open a pathway to ending his life sentence.\nIn February, Öcalan argued that the PKK had outlived its original mission and called for it to dissolve itself. \"I am making a call for the laying down of arms,\" he said in a message to his followers. In March, the PKK declared an immediate ceasefire with Turkey, and this week \"echoed\" Öcalan's message.\nThe decision was also influenced by \"current developments in the Middle East\", the group said. It has been \"increasingly weakened\" in northern Iraq where it is based, having been \"pushed out of Turkey\", said Reuters. Affiliated Kurdish forces in Syria have also been weakened by the fall of President Bashar al-Assad to \"Turkey-backed rebels\".\nLasting peace?\nPresident Erdogan hailed the \"peace and fraternity\" the decision might herald. It is an \"important threshold\" towards Ankara's goal of a country free of terrorism, he said. \"The doors of a new era in every area, namely strengthening politics and democratic capacity, will be opened. The winners will be our people and country, and actually all our siblings in our region.\"\nNechirvan Barzani, president of Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, said the decision showed \"political maturity\", laying the foundation for a \"lasting peace\" and the end of \"decades of violence, pain and suffering\". The Iraqi government also welcomed the move as a \"significant opportunity\" to \"end longstanding conflicts\".\nBut the decision to dissolve the PKK \"does not guarantee peace\", said Reuters. It \"paves the way for agreeing a tricky legal framework\". A PKK official said weapon handovers were \"contingent on Ankara's response and approach to Kurdish rights, and the fate of PKK fighters and leaders\". The PKK and pro-Kurdish politicians have called for Öcalan's release, and for him to oversee disarmament.\nIt's not known whether the PKK will win concessions, and it \"remains unclear\" how the process will work, said Al Jazeera. Questions remain over \"how weapons would be disposed of\" and \"the future of PKK fighters\", including affiliate forces like the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria.\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nChas Newkey-Burden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nChas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

Frustrated at delivery delays, he has been on the lookout for alternatives – and apparently had his eye on the Qatari plane even before it was offered to him as a gift this month.\nThe jumbo in question, built in 2012, was previously on call for Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. The 66-year-old is one of the Qatari royal family’s wealthiest figures, having served as prime minister and head of the sovereign wealth fund.\nIt has creamy white and tan furnishings, rugs and artwork by Cabinet Alberto Pinto, a Paris interior design firm. There are custom-made Tai Ping rugs, sycamore and wacapou wood fixtures, and artwork by Alexander Calder. The upper deck has a master bedroom and bath, guest bedroom and private lounge, and downstairs there are lounges, an office and crew areas.\nThe plane would need to be retrofitted to standards that Air Force One currently maintains, according to Troy. That would include a hardening of its surface to withstand explosions and attacks, and technical extras like air-to-air refuelling capabilities and classified communications and weapons systems.\nIt would also take months if not years for US defence department officials and intelligence officers to take the plane apart and thoroughly sweep it for any tracking devices or detect monitoring of systems that could, among other things, reveal the plane’s location.\n“This is why it takes so long to build Air Force One,” said Troy. “It has so many things attached to it to make the president safe.”\nTrump, who has blamed Boeing for falling “way behind”, has defended the gift.\n“Some people say, oh, you shouldn’t accept gifts for the country,” the president told Fox News while en route to Saudi Arabia where he began a Middle East visit on Tuesday.\n“My attitude is, why wouldn’t I accept a gift? We’re giving to everybody else.” He also said that Gulf monarchies have bigger and newer planes than the American government, and “I believe that we should have the most impressive plane.”\n\nBut some of the fiercest criticism has come from devoted supporters, who have called it a bribe or a brazen push for influence by the Gulf state.\nCommentator Ben Shapiro asked how Trump voters would react if a Democrat had done this. “I think if we switched the names to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, we’d all be freaking out on the right,” Shapiro said Monday on his podcast. “President Trump promised to drain the swamp. This is not, in fact, draining the swamp.”\n“This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true,” far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on social media. “And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump.”\nQatar is a long-standing US ally, and has been a key mediator along with Egypt in efforts to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nThe country also hosts Hamas’s political office. Relationships like that pose a risk “in terms of potential information falling into the hands of people who would use it for their own purposes”, according to James Der Derian, who heads the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n“To be sure, Qatar is not the Soviet Union, but it does have a pretty robust intelligence footprint,” he said. “It punches above its weight.”\nStill, while there are dangers in accepting gifts from foreign governments, turning them down is not risk-free either. Since gift-giving is significant in Arab culture, it could amount to a diplomatic blunder – especially when Qatar is playing such an important role in the search for an end to the Gaza war.\nThat’s why “this plane has taken on so much symbolic value right now”, Der Derian said. Refuse the gift, and “there could be a lot of upset leaders – not just the US but also Qatar and other Arab countries that think hospitality is a very important part of their culture”.","summary":"Legal and ethical qualms aside, the luxury Boeing 747 would present a prime opportunity to bug, track and surveil the US president.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3310233/trumps-freebie-qatar-jet-stuff-nightmares-spyworld","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/14/0db51753-9287-476c-9248-32c6c10c8208_f85fafcf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:55:04","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":321029244,"title":"India’s Inflation Falls To 3.16% In April—Lowest Since 2019, Raising Rate Cut Hopes","text":"India’s retail inflation dropped to 3.16% in April 2025 the lowest level since July 2019 marking the seventh consecutive month of decline, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures suggest easing price pressures across essential categories, strengthening the case for a possible rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in June.\nFood Prices Drive Inflation Down\nThe fall in inflation is largely attributed to a steep decline in food prices, particularly vegetables. Food inflation plummeted to 1.8% in April from a high of 10.9% in October 2024. Vegetables recorded an 11% year-on-year price contraction in April, making them the biggest contributors to the cooling trend.\nPrices of pulses and spices also fell, while fruits and edible oils showed double-digit inflation. Despite some moderation in the rate of decline over recent months, April’s inflation figure aligned with economists’ expectations, as forecasted by a Bloomberg poll.\nRising Procurement, Early Monsoon Add Optimism\nAayushi Chaudhary, Pranjul Bhandari, and Priya Mehrishi from HSBC India noted that wheat procurement has hit 29 million tonnes its highest since the 2021-22 season thanks to a strong winter crop. The India Meteorological Department’s forecast of an early monsoon, expected to arrive in Kerala by May 27, could further stabilize food prices and aid agricultural output.\nFuel Prices Rise Despite Cheaper Crude\nWhile most CPI sub-categories remained flat, the fuel and light category showed a notable increase from 1.4% in March to 2.9% in April. This rise comes despite a drop in India’s crude oil basket from $72.5 per barrel in March to $67.7 in April. The increase is linked to the central government’s imposition of an additional ₹2 excise duty on petrol and diesel starting April 7, following former US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.\nAs of May 9, the crude oil basket stood at $63.8 per barrel, continuing the downward trend.\nCore Inflation Remains Stable\nCore inflation which excludes food and fuel remained flat at 4.1% in April, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Though core inflation has edged up over the last three months, analysts attribute this to rising gold and silver prices amid financial market volatility.\nRBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra emphasized in the April MPC meeting minutes that inflationary impulses remain \"benign and well-anchored.\" CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, gold, and silver was just 3.2% in February, with the fuel group still in deflation at that time.\nRBI May Cut Rates in June\nThe RBI has forecast 4% CPI inflation for FY2025-26, with quarterly projections of 3.6%, 3.9%, 3.8%, and 4.4%. Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at Crisil Limited, stated that with Brent crude likely to average $65 per barrel, non-food inflation should remain contained. He added, “Given the current inflation trajectory, a further 25-basis point rate cut is expected in the June monetary policy.”\nIf the RBI follows through, the cut could support household spending and private investment, providing fresh momentum to India’s economic growth story.\nALSO READ: Watch: Pizza Delivery Boy Harassed By Couple In Mumbai For Not Speaking Marathi","summary":"India&#8217;s retail inflation fell to 3.16% in April 2025—its lowest since July 2019—driven by falling food prices, especially vegetables.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to make a national example of Dugan to chill judicial opposition to the crackdown.\n\nProsecutors charged Dugan in April via complaint with concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. In the federal criminal justice system, prosecutors can initiate charges against a defendant directly by filing a complaint or present evidence to a grand jury and let that body decide whether to issue charges.\n\nA grand jury still reviews charges brought by complaint to determine whether enough probable cause exists to continue the case as a check on prosecutors' power. If the grand jury determines there's probable cause, it issues a written statement of the charges known as an indictment. That's what happened in Dugan's case.\n\nDugan faces up to six years in prison if she's convicted on both counts. Her team of defense attorneys responded to the indictment with a one-sentence statement saying that she maintains her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court. She was scheduled to enter a plea on Thursday.\n\nKenneth Gales, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in Milwaukee, declined to comment on the indictment Tuesday evening.\n\nDugan's case is similar to one brought during the first Trump administration against a Massachusetts judge, who was accused of helping a man sneak out a courthouse back door to evade a waiting immigration enforcement agent. That case was eventually dismissed.\n\nProsecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back jury door on April 18 after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the courthouse seeking his arrest.\n\nAccording to court documents, Flores-Ruiz illegally reentered the U.S. after being deported in 2013. Online state court records show he was charged with three counts of misdemeanor domestic abuse in Milwaukee County in March. He was in Dugan's courtroom that morning of April 18 for a hearing.\n\nCourt documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that the agents appeared to be in the hallway. An affidavit says Dugan was visibly angry over the agents' arrival and called the situation \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. She and anotherjudge later approached members of the arrest team in the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \"confrontational, angry demeanor.\"\n\nAfter a back-and-forth with the agents over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, Dugan demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, according to the affidavit.\n\nShe then returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of \"wait, come with me\" and ushered Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through a back jury door typically used only by deputies, jurors, court staff and in-custody defendants, according to the affidavit. Flores-Ruiz was free on a signature bond in the abuse case at the time, according to online state court records.\n\nFederal agents ultimately captured him outside the courthouse after a foot chase.\n\nThe state Supreme Court suspended Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary. A reserve judge is filling in for her.","summary":"A federal grand jury indicted a Wisconsin judge accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities, allowing the case against her to continue.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/wisconsin-judge-hannah-dugan-indicted-grand-jury-immigration-case-allowing-charges-continue/16407080/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16407116_judge-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:53:35","author":"Todd Richmond","authors":["Todd Richmond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.47},{"id":321035900,"title":"Trump nemesis George Conway has found a clever way to stick it to MAGA","text":"George Conway, a lawyer who once was steeped in Republican politics and formerly married to one of the most rabid and reliable liars for Donald Trump, has spent the past nine years trying to make the president’s life miserable.\n\nPodcasts. Social media taunts. Advising E. Jean Carroll in her victorious and lucrative civil lawsuits over Trump. Appearances on MSNBC and other outlets. A political action committee that focused on Trump’s mental deterioration. \n\nWhen it comes to Trump-hating, Conway is a five-tool superstar.\n\nAnd now, he has found another way to stick it to Trump (indirectly), a member of his cabinet (specifically) and MAGA (generally).\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi’s younger brother, Brad, is running to become the president of the Washington, D.C., bar, and Conway has stepped into the middle of the campaign to sound the alarm and persuade lawyers to vote against Bondi.\n\nConway’s recent Instagram post about the race went viral and likely is a main reason turnout in the rolling election is triple the previous high turnout, set in 1990.\n\nConway is not a member of the D.C. Bar and he’s not eligible to vote there, but lawyers undoubtedly heard his call.\n\n“I’m asking you to vote — and most importantly, to vote against somebody — to vote against Brad Bondi,” Conway said.\n\nAt a time when Trump is threatening law firms, forcing the cowardly ones to their knees while squeezing them for pro bono work, Conway and others are afraid of what might happen if Bondi gets his hands on the gavel: Will he and his sister conspire to threaten, intimidate, investigate and even arrest D.C. lawyers who oppose Trump or those who represent clients under attack by the administration?\n\nDiane Seltzer, the other candidate, is an employment attorney with her own small firm. She recently told a debate audience about the fear other lawyers are expressing to her all across the city, according to NPR.\n\n“We’re no longer afraid of, ‘What if I’m not prepared’ or if I missed a case I should have known,” Seltzer said. “We’re literally afraid of terrible consequences just for doing our jobs.”\n\nShe added: “My priority is making sure that the rule of law is upheld, that we feel that we are safe to do our jobs and that we can go forward every day representing the clients we choose,” she said.\n\nBondi, whose sister has led a Department of Justice bent on retaliation, actually said he’s running “to keep our bar apolitical.”\n\nVoting for the D.C. Bar presidential election ends June 4. Results will be announced a few days later.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

If Republicans fail to cut $2 trillion worth of spending, the amount of money left for tax cuts will be reduced by the difference between $2 trillion and the final number of savings.\n\nRepublicans claimed throughout the hearing that the legislation would not hurt people with disabilities. Under the bill, able-bodied adults without dependents must engage in at least 80 hours of either work, community service or education to be eligible for Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Rep. Gary Palmer of Alabama pushed back against accusations that people with disabilities would lose their Medicaid coverage.\n\n“The people who are legally eligible for Medicaid are not going to lose their Medicaid,” he insisted. “We’ve all got family members, friends, we’ve got people in our districts, we all know these stories, people that are depending on Medicaid, and you will not lose your Medicaid.”\n\nBut the protester interrupted Palmer, identifying herself as from Youngstown, Ohio and said that her drugs cost $10,000 a month.\n\nRepublican Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas tried to tamp down criticism as people with disabilities expressed fear that they might lose their coverage.\n\n“Here’s my apology to you: I am sorry that people lie to you, I am sorry that so many people in the media and the left have lied to you,” he said.\n\nMany Republicans have said that the legislation would only cut coverage for able-bodied men, and specifically focused on undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut disability advocates say that the legislation’s requirements to have states determine if patients are eligible for Medicaid every six months could cause some to lose benefits.\n\n“There are lots of people with disabilities ... who may not meet the specific social security definition, but who absolutely do have disabilities,” Katy Neas, the CEO of the Arc, told The Independent.\n\nNeas also said that the cuts to Medicaid could wind up causing states to cut optional programs such as Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services, which allows for people to stay in their homes rather than in nursing homes. Because it’s an optional program, it has long waiting lists to apply, varying by state\n\n“The choice is to go in an institution, or, more likely, people will just be put out, and their families will do the best they can for them, but isn't going to be sufficient for what they need,” she said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined the committee this Congress, praised the activists for their protests.\n\n“First and foremost, I think that they have demonstrated a tremendous amount of courage and bravery putting themselves on the line in order to defend Medicaid for people across the country, and the Affordable Care Act,” she told The Independent. She feared that the “able-bodied” requirement might exclude some people who desperately need Medicaid.\n\n“Does it include people with varying degrees of mental health diagnoses?” she asked.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also pointed out that the legislation would also roll back a rule from the Biden administration requiring that a minimum number of staff work at nursing homes.\n\n“This is definitely going to affect people who rely on nursing homes, the staffing that happens in nursing homes, this is all in the text of the bill, and on top of that, including people who are eligible and covered by Medicaid,” she said.\n\nDuring the hearing, Ocasio-Cortez pointed out how many people in areas – including those represented by Republicans – depend on Medicaid.\n\nRep. Greg Landsman, a moderate Democrat from Ohio, questioned why people needed to be dragged out from the hearing.\n\n“It seems strange that folks in wheelchairs would be arrested,” he said. “Quite frankly, it's a life or death situation for them. I understand that they can't disrupt a proceeding, so they need to be removed. But why arrested?”\n\nNumerous House committees are engaged in marathon markups of their parts of the bill. Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, hope to pass the bill that ramps up spending for immigration enforcement at the Mexican border and boosts oil exploration while also extending the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed in 2017.\n\nBut the bill will face stiff opposition in the Senate, where many Republicans, including allies of the president, worry about steep cuts to Medicaid.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uproar-disability-rights-protesters-wheelchairs-222930456.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9b52e551c7845e043e1fab8d8715dcb0","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:49:29","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":321037368,"title":"US slashes ‘de minimis’ tariff on small China parcels to as low as 30%","text":"The order published late on Monday offers some relief to big Chinese e-commerce players Shein and Temu and follows a weekend deal between Beijing and Washington to unwind for 90 days most of the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed on each other’s goods since early April.\n\nWhile their joint statement following talks in Geneva did not mention the de minimis duties, the order signed by President Donald Trump said levies for those direct-to-consumer postal shipments will be reduced to 54% from 120% for items valued at up to US$800, starting on Wednesday.\n\nAn alternative flat fee of US$100 per postal package remains in effect, but a planned June 1 increase to US$200 was cancelled.\n\nThere are different rules for packages handled by commercial delivery firms such as United Parcel Service, FedEx and DHL, which shipped millions of Shein and Temu packages before Trump ended duty-free status for Chinese shipments valued under US$800.\n\nThe rate for those packages now defaults to the reduced US tariff rate of 30% from 145% for Chinese imports, two delivery experts told Reuters on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe 30% rate reflects the Trump administration’s decision to cut China’s “reciprocal” duty rate to 10% from 145%, plus a separate 20% duty related to the US fentanyl crisis.\n\nThe White House and the US trade representative’s office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.\n\nTrade representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC on Tuesday that the 10% global duty rate would likely remain in place to help rebuild the US manufacturing base.\n\nCollection difficulties\n\nCommercial shippers generally collect duties from sellers in China prior to shipment, but the US Postal Service is not set up to handle tariff collections. Four sources told Reuters most Temu and Shein shipments are handled by commercial carriers.\n\nMany consumer goods from China in the commercial channel will still be subject to much higher duties imposed under previous trade actions or sectoral national security investigations. For example, syringes and surgical gloves are subject to 100% duties under a US Section 301 trade action.\n\nOne of the delivery experts said, however, that if shipped by a postal carrier in quantities valued at less than US$800, they may be able to arrive in the US for only a US$100 fee, or an effective 12.5% rate.\n\nIn February, Trump ended the de minimis exemption and imposed different rules for packages handled by postal services or commercial delivery firms – blaming the exemption for enabling a flood of shipments from Chinese e-commerce firms and traffickers of fentanyl and other illicit goods.\n\nThe number of shipments entering the US through the tax-free channel exploded in recent years with more than 90% of all packages coming via de minimis. Of those, about 60% came from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.\n\nAccording to 2024 congressional testimony from a US Customs and Border Protection official, the average value of a de minimis shipment during fiscal year 2023 was just US$54.\n\nChinese online retailers Shein – which is considering a London stock market listing – and PDD Holdings-owned Temu, as well as US rival Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nChina exported US$240 billion in direct-to-consumer goods benefiting from de minimis worldwide last year, accounting for 7% of its overseas sales and contributing 1.3% of gross domestic product, according to Nomura estimates.\n\nJianlong Hu, CEO of Brands Factory, a Chinese cross-border e-commerce consultancy, said a 54% tariff was still very high.\n\n“Sellers are probably taking a wait-and-see approach but in general I think it’s fair to say the boom times of small package delivery from China to the US, the Golden Age is already gone.”\n\nShein is more exposed to de minimis changes due to its reliance on speed of getting thousands of new styles each week to consumers in the West by air than others such as Temu.\n\nShein might still be one player that would want to send by air freight some packages from China and pay the 54% tariff rather than import all by boat, said Hu.\n\n“If people are buying clothes on Shein and are told the product will arrive one month later, who will buy that?”\n\nChina’s yuan jumped to a six-month high against the dollar on Tuesday, joining a global rally in riskier assets following the broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington.\n\nTrump’s global trade war, which shredded the playbooks that have governed international trade for decades, has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession.\n\nThe US de minimis rule, which dates back to 1938, has been the target of growing criticism from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers as a loophole that allows Chinese products to skirt US tariffs and illegal drugs and fentanyl precursors to enter the US unscreened, as Reuters reporting has confirmed.","summary":"The White House order helps further de-escalate the trade war, providing relief to Chinese e-commerce players.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/05/14/us-slashes-de-minimis-tariff-on-small-china-parcels-to-as-low-as-30/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1199d792-china-economy-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:49:18","author":"President Donald Trump,Reuters","authors":["President Donald Trump","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":321031398,"title":"Hegseth’s plan to cut senior military jobs could hit more than 120 high-ranking officers","text":"By LOLITA C. BALDOR\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s plans to slash the number of senior military leaders across the services would cut more than 120 high-ranking officer jobs in the active duty and National Guard, including as many as nine top general slots.\n\nBased on the percentages outlined by Hegseth and his senior staff, 20% of the 44 authorized top active duty general and admiral jobs would be eliminated, along with 10% of the more than 800 one-, two- and three-star positions, according to numbers compiled by The Associated Press.\n\nThe cuts — about nine positions among four-star generals and 80 jobs across the other leadership levels — would affect dozens of active duty officers scattered across the five services as well as those who are in joint command jobs, such as those overseeing Africa, the Middle East and Europe. The changes would eliminate 33 senior National Guard positions.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader government-wide campaign to slash spending and personnel across federal agencies that is being pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and ally Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAccording to Hegseth and others, the intent of the military job reductions isn’t to reduce the overall size of the force but to thin out the higher ranks and offset those cuts with additional troops at lower levels. While the overall number of service members may not drop, the salary costs will be lower.\n\nSome Democratic members of Congress have criticized Hegseth’s plans as an attempt to politicize the military and oust leaders that don’t agree with the Trump administration. The changes also come as the world is roiled by conflicts, including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and as the U.S. has troops deployed in Syria and elsewhere.\n\nShifting leadership responsibilities\n\nMilitary officials expect that as various jobs are downgraded — for example from a lieutenant general in charge to a major general or brigadier general — more leadership responsibilities will fall on colonels or Navy captains and other subordinates.\n\nAnd while many of the job cuts will come through attrition, as senior officers retire or move on, the services say they will have the flexibility to move people into higher priority positions and get rid of less critical posts.\n\n“More generals and admirals does not equal more success,” Hegseth said in a video describing his plan. “This is not a slash and burn exercise meant to punish high-ranking officers. Nothing could be further from the truth. This has been a deliberative process.”\n\nCalling it the “Less Generals, More GIs” plan, he said the department will make “prudent reductions.”\n\nHow the cuts will hit the military services\n\nThe Army, which is the largest service, is allowed to have a maximum of 219 high-ranking general officers and is expected to absorb a higher number of the cuts, while the Marine Corps will probably see little impact at the very top. There are only two Marine four-star generals, and the tiny Space Force also only has two.\n\n“The Marine Corps, with our general officers, like our civilians and senior executives, is by far the leanest service,” said Lt. Col. Josh Benson, a Marine spokesman. “Due to the already lean nature of the general officers in the Marine Corps, any cuts to Marine general officers will have an outsized impact to the Corps relative to other services.”\n\nHe said nearly one-third — or 21 — of Marine generals hold two or three jobs each, and as many as 10 positions are already empty.\n\nArmy leaders, meanwhile, have already developed plans to merge or close headquarters units and staff. As many as 40 general officer slots could be cut as a result, officials have said.\n\nThe joint jobs would include leaders at regional commands, such as those in Europe, the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, as well as administrative or functional commands, such as Cyber Command and Special Operations Command.\n\nUnder the law, there currently can be no more than 232 of those joint officers, and they’re spread across all the services.\n\nIt’s unclear how many of the cuts those jobs would absorb, versus the slots in each of the services. But officials have talked about merging some commands as the Pentagon reviews its overall leadership structure.\n\nIn addition to the joint command jobs, Congress stipulates the maximum number of high-ranking general officers in the services: 219 in the Army, 171 in the Air Force, 21 in the Space Force, 64 in the Marine Corps and 150 flag officers in the Navy.\n\nAll combined, the services can’t have more than 27 four-star officers, 153 three stars, 239 two stars and 210 one stars.\n\nNational Guard review and cuts\n\nThe decrease in the National Guard stems from a review done by Guard leaders last year that identified more than 30 positions that could be cut among the 133 general officer jobs spread out across the government. There are about 30 general officers in the National Guard Bureau headquarters staff, and the rest are assigned to jobs in other federal agencies, including the FBI, CIA and the military commands.\n\nGuard officials described their plan to Hegseth and Pentagon leaders, and it was approved. According to officials, it would result in six jobs cut from Guard Bureau staff and the rest from other military and government posts.\n\nThe adjutants general who run the Guard in each state are chosen by and work for the governors and so are not part of any cuts. They are largely one- and two- star officers.","summary":"The cuts would affect dozens of active duty officers across the five services.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/13/pentagon-officer-cuts/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump_Mideast_17950_700c04.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:47:46","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":321031930,"title":"Kellyanne Conway Delivers Message To ‘Free Market Friends’ Who Said ‘Sky Was Falling’ Over Trump Tariffs","text":"Kellyanne Conway delivered a message on Fox Business Tuesday to Trump-aligned business elites and free-market conservatives who warned his tariff policies would tank the economy.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the United States has made significant headway in its talks with China, marking the first round of discussions since President Donald Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on several nations in April. During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Conway blasted people who panicked over Trump’s trade wars and short-term market volatility.\n\n“Part of his delegation just left Saudi to go to Turkey to try to get peace with Ukraine and Russia. He’s doing all things at once. And Larry, it wasn’t just the Democrats who pushed back on President Trump and predicted gloom and doom,” Conway told Larry Kudlow. “May I just say, a lot of those were free market friends. A lot of those were people who voted for Trump. A lot of those were people who gave a million dollars to, you know, cozy up to him at the inauguration.”\n\nTrump is spending the week in the Middle East, aiming to secure a series of economic and business agreements as he works to strengthen ties with key Gulf allies early in his second term. The trip includes stops in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, where Trump is expected to pursue major investments and strategic partnerships.\n\nConway contrasted the skepticism of the elite with the faith shown by working-class Americans who, she said, stood by Trump when it counted.\n\n“And all he said was ‘Be patient. There’s going to be a little bit of pain for long-term gain.’ You know who gave President Trump space and grace? The people. The welders, the carpenters, the mechanics, the hairdressers, the folks who manicure your nails and your lawns,” Conway said. “They said ‘You know what? He’s going to rebuild this economy so it works for all of us. And that’s going to take time because, let’s face it, it took decades of globalization and our wealth and our jobs being shipped legally overseas to get us into this mess.'”\n\nConway’s remarks come as Trump doubles down on his second-term economic agenda, using tariffs as leverage to bring manufacturing back home and recalibrate global trade.\n\n“Here’s my message to all the chicken littles. The sky was falling and all the little chickens who couldn’t take a risk along with President Trump. And here’s the other thing that a lot of people will tell you, Larry, that we had inflation all four years of Biden-Harris, and we didn’t have these tariffs,” Conway said. “We had gas and groceries up, up, up all four years. That became a leading early indicator of the failure that was the Biden economy. And then you look at what they did with fossil fuels. Then you look at what they did with the border.”\n\nConway also blasted Democrats for continuing to attack Trump on immigration despite major drops in illegal border crossings under his policies. (RELATED: Trump Admin Wants To Accept Largest Gift From Foreign Government In US History: New Air Force One From Qatar)\n\n“And why the Democrats, Larry, are now still attacking Donald Trump on the border. His signature top issue in everybody’s polling where the border is closed, the crossings are way down. And they insist on going to Newark and protesting instead of going to Newark Airport and doing what our Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is doing and saying ‘Look in our backyard here in Newark. We want to make sure that it’s safe and efficient travel for all [and] that we have confidence in the competence of the system,'” Conway added.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport experienced another radar and communications outage early Friday, prompting renewed concerns about aviation safety and reliability.

The reconciliation is meant to implement President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. The centerpiece is an extension of the tax cuts Republicans enacted in 2017.\n\nIn an effort to modify the bill or delay its passage, Democrats submitted several amendments to avert Republican provisions that would slash climate funding. With Republicans holding the majority in the House, most amendments were not expected to pass. \n\nRep. Scott Peters (D-CA) said that, while Republicans say they favor an “all above approach” to energy, the reconciliation bill in fact “picks winners and losers and elevates expensive, outdated and inefficient sources like coal, over cheap America-made energy, like solar, wind, and storage.” \n\nRep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ), the top Democrat on the panel, criticized the energy-related title of the legislative text, accusing Republicans of “creating a mockery” of U.S. environmental laws. \n\nHe specifically took issue with a provision intended to speed up the permitting process for energy development projects, particularly those in the oil and gas industries. The provision, which mirrors one included in the House Natural Resources Committee’s portion of the proposed reconciliation bill, would allow developers to pay a fee for expedited reviews. \n\nSpecifically, it would allow the Department of Energy to deem a liquefied natural gas facility as a project in “the public interest” if applicants pay a million-dollar fee. Developers trying to secure permits for other natural gas projects would also be able to receive expedited permits from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission if they pay 1% of their expected cost of construction or $10 million.\n\n“By allowing Big Oil and Gas to simply bribe government agencies to acquire permits free of scrutiny, it sets up what I call a pay to play scheme for fossil energy permitting that allows polluters to pay $10 million to the Trump administration to obtain pipeline permits and ignore environmental laws while clean energy gets left behind,” Pallone said.\n\nDemocrats criticized the proposal as “pay to play” policy. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) proposed an amendment to order the Energy Department’s Inspector General to ensure that the bill does not increase the risk of corruption. \n\n“We cannot allow polluters to bribe their way around these processes,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We cannot fast-track corruption that allows massive corporations to put people’s lives at risk.” \n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) argued that the bill’s policy is a “user fee,” adding that “all the laws that govern permitting must be followed.” \n\n“There are already laws preventing corruption, however you mean that word,” Crenshaw said. In an attempt to turn the tables on Democrats, he said that the Inflation Reduction Act provided hundreds of billions of dollars to non-governmental organizations for clean energy projects, but it is unclear where the money went. \n\nThe committee did not pass Ocasio-Cortez’s amendment. \n\nWhile dozens of amendments had been proposed regarding the energy subtitle of the legislative text, committee Republicans voted to skip deliberation of those changes and instead advance discussions to the environment section of the proposal after roughly two hours.\n\nAmong the provisions Democrats have criticized are plans to cut funding from climate programs like the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which provides grants for clean energy projects across the country, specifically in low-income areas. The Trump EPA has taken aim at the program, claiming the Biden administration mismanaged the program’s funds, in part by routing the money through Citibank to be disbursed. \n\nThe bill also would terminate the “unobligated balance” of Inflation Reduction Act funding from DOE’s Loan Programs Office, essentially slashing the office’s loan authority to pre-Biden administration levels. \n\nAs of Monday, committee staff were unable to say how much of the office’s funds were not obligated. Industry experts have said that the move would effectively eliminate the office and dramatically limit federal support for new energy projects. \n\nCAPITOL POLICE ARREST PROTESTERS AS HOUSE GOP BEGINS MEDICAID BUDGET HEARING\n\nTuesday’s markup hearing was anticipated to continue for several hours, likely stretching into Wednesday morning. The first, and only anticipated, break in the hearing came just after 6:30 p.m., as lawmakers headed to the floor for scheduled votes. \n\nSome lawmakers predicted it could last anywhere between 24-36 hours, depending on procedural delays or amendments proposed by Democrats on the committee. With Republicans in the majority, the proposed text is anticipated to pass through committee.","summary":"In a marathon hearing that began Tuesday afternoon, the House Energy and Commerce Committee started marking up legislation to slash green subsidies authorized by the landmark climate bill signed by former President Joe Biden.  Republican members on the committee are seeking to cut billions of dollars in funding from climate initiatives established through the 2022 [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy-and-environment/3410064/gop-debate-energy-commerce-portion-trump-tax-bill/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP24345588388905.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:45:42","author":"Maydeen Merino And Callie Patteson","authors":["Maydeen Merino And Callie Patteson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.161},{"id":321035190,"title":"Stock and crypto trading site eToro prices IPO at $52 per share ahead of Nasdaq debut","text":"EToro, a stock brokerage platform that's been ramping up in crypto, has priced its IPO at $52 a share, as the company prepares to test the market's appetite for new offerings.\n\nThe Israel-based company raised nearly $310 million, selling nearly 6 million shares in a deal that values the business at about $4.2 billion.

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report confirms a 12.7% monthly decline in egg prices for April, marking the steepest drop since 1984.\nThe average retail price for a dozen Grade A eggs decreased to $5.12, down from $6.23 in March, which was a record high. This is the first time in six months that egg prices have shown a month-to-month decrease, reflecting an easing of the avian flu crisis that has plagued the country’s poultry industry since 2022.\nTrump: “We Have Too Many Eggs”\nEarlier in May, Trump addressed rising consumer concerns, saying, “You can have all the eggs you want. We have too many eggs. In fact, if anything, the prices are getting too low. So I just want to let you know that the prices are down.”\nWhile his phrasing stirred political debate, April’s CPI data confirms a notable price drop, aligning with his broader narrative of improving affordability.\nPrices Still Far From Pre-Flu Levels\nDespite April's relief, egg prices remain 79% higher than the same time in 2024, when a dozen eggs cost about $2.86. The ongoing high prices are largely due to the avian influenza outbreaks that decimated egg-laying flocks. Over 169 million birds have been lost since 2022, pushing prices to historic highs.\nHowever, the number of bird flu outbreaks has fallen drastically—from 59 in February to just 3 in April—helping stabilize egg supplies.\nExperts Expect Prices to Keep Falling\nAccording to David L. Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, “We expect continued price declines through May and June due to post-Easter seasonal drops in demand and reduced outbreaks.”\nStill, Ortega cautions that a single outbreak at a major facility could quickly reverse the gains. Recent cases in Ohio and South Dakota, which affected over 927,000 hens, highlight the fragility of the recovery.\nGovernment and Market Response\nTo address the crisis and prevent future supply shocks:\nThe USDA announced a $1 billion investment in February aimed at improving biosecurity on farms.\n Egg imports surged 77.5% in the first quarter of 2025, with supplies coming from South Korea, Brazil, and Turkey.\nALSO READ: Pakistan Declares Indian Diplomat Persona Non Grata After India’s Tit-For-Tat Move","summary":"Egg prices in the US dropped 12.7% in April 2025, the sharpest decline since 1984, following Donald Trump&#8217;s claims about falling grocery prices.

The delays were attributed to a wide variety of factors, including security clearances for contractors working on the plane, to a strike by Boeing machinists that lasted for seven weeks until the company agreed to a new union contract that guaranteed wage increases and the complicated nature of the upgrades themselves.\n\nThe new Air Force One jets Boeing is working on include numerous boardrooms and meeting rooms, along with enhanced self-defense systems and military avionics. And as NBC reported, the Qatari jet would also need similar upgrades given that Air Force One is meant to have sophisticated command center capabilities like secure government communications and the ability to disrupt electro-magnetic pulses and repel missile attacks. It would also need to be expanded to include quarters for Secret Service detail and White House medical staff.\n\nClick here to read NBC's full report.\n\nREAD MORE: (Opinion) There aren't enough words to describe Trump treasury secretary's immorality","summary":"President Donald Trump was hoping to use a jet from Qatar's royal family as a replacement for Air Force One until its upgrades are finished.

According to the complaints, both Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have threatened to cut off funding to states that refuse to comply with President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. Also Read | 'Let's Not Trade Nuclear Missiles': In Saudi Arabia, Donald Trump Reiterates His Administration 'Brokered Historic Ceasefire' Between India and Pakistan. While no federal funding is currently being withheld, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during a news conference on Tuesday that the threat was “imminent.” “President Donald Trump can't use these funds as a bargaining chip as his way of ensuring states abide by his preferred policies,” Bonta added. Also Read | Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia Speech Will Urge Iran Toward 'New and Better Path' as He Pushes for Nuclear Deal. Department of Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the lawsuit will not stop the Trump Administration from “restoring the rule of law.” “Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding. The President has been clear on that,” she said. Duffy said in a statement that the 20 states have filed the lawsuit because “their officials want to continue breaking federal law and putting the needs of illegal aliens above their own citizens.” Both lawsuits say that the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by trying to dictate federal spending when Congress has that power — not the executive branch. On April 24, states received letters from the Department of Transportation stating that they must cooperate on immigration efforts and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs or risk losing funds. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin criticized the timing of Duffy's letter when Newark's airport struggles with radar outages and other issues. “I wish the administration would stop playing politics with people's lives,” Platkin said. “I wish Secretary Duffy would do his damn job, which is to make sure planes land on time, not to direct immigration enforcement.” Meanwhile, on Feb. 24, states received letters from the Department of Homeland Security declaring that states that “refuse to cooperate with, refuse to share information with, or even actively obstruct federal immigration enforcement reject these ideals and the history we share in common as Americans.” “If any government entity chooses to thumb its nose at the Department of Homeland Security's national security and public safety mission, it should not receive a single dollar of the Department's money unless Congress has specifically required it,” Noem wrote in her letter. Attorneys general behind the lawsuits include the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont. The cases are being spearheaded by California but were filed in federal court in Rhode Island, a detail that the attorneys general defended by saying they filed in “any court that is going to be fair and objective and consider our factual presentation and legal analysis.” The lawsuits are the latest legal actions that Democratic-led states have taken against Trump since he took office earlier this year. Bonta noted that California has filed more than 20 lawsuits against the administration, while Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said his state has launched more than a dozen. While the lawsuits have challenged policies on tariffs, federal employee firings and health care research, Trump's focus on immigration enforcement and the mass deportation of immigrants in the United States illegally have received the most attention. This has included the president's promise to mass deport people and the start of a registry required for all those who are in the country illegally. “What we're seeing is a creeping authoritarianism,” Neronha said.

China shipped almost 100 billion yuan (US$13.9 billion) worth of auto parts to the US – from electric vehicle (EV) batteries to lidar sensors and drive control systems – in 2024, according to customs data.\n“We are confident that US customers will be willing to buy our products, even if they still have to pay the extra [lower] tariffs,” said Qian Kang, who owns a factory making printed circuit boards in Zhejiang province in eastern China. “But neither Chinese vendors nor American customers are able to strike deals, because the outlook is uncertain. You have to be aware that tariffs may jump again 90 days later.”\n\nChinese-made EV batteries are now subject to 58.4 per cent US tariffs – which comprises the 30 per cent extra levy and the existing duties, down from 173.4 per cent before the Geneva deal.\nNot all Chinese car-parts producers were subject to the 145 per cent additional duty the US imposed last month. On average, they faced an import duty of around 70 per cent, according to the International Intelligent Vehicle Engineering Association.\n“All those companies are closely monitoring the tariff war and the adjustments,” said David Zhang, general secretary of the Shanghai-based association. “But there is no way that any of them can figure out the best way to sustain their business given the uncertainties.”\nSeveral automotive supply-chain vendors are still bemused by the volatile tariffs that are complicating their go-global strategies. Studies on production and logistics costs, as well as pricing strategies, were not keeping up with the dynamic trade conditions, they said, making risk management a top priority to navigate the tariff spat.\n\nAt Auto Shanghai, the world’s largest marquee event that ended on May 2, several car-parts producers said they had plans or were already in talks to set up factories in the US as a way of sidestepping Trump’s punitive tariffs.\nAutolink, a smart cockpit supplier backed by Chinese EV maker Nio, has been planning to set up a production base in Detroit since the beginning of this year, a manager told the Post. Fuyao Glass, which makes auto glass, announced in March that it would invest US$400 million to expand its Illinois factory to add to its Ohio operations.\nAnother state-backed manufacturer of electrical connectors and optical devices for EVs, based in central China’s Henan province, was also considering building US production facilities, in addition to its existing factories in Vietnam and Germany, according to a manager who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.\n\n“We see greater sensitivity to tariffs among China’s car-parts makers,” S&P Global analysts including Claire Yuan wrote in a report last week. “The fluid tariff situation also makes planning difficult, particularly with regard to offshore investment.”\nThe industry officials with the supply-chain vendors said most of their US customers would opt for their Chinese-made batteries, tyres, optical devices and wheels should the “reciprocal” tariff stay unchanged beyond the 90-day cooling period.\n“My suggestion [to Chinese car-parts makers] is not to make any definitive plans due to the ongoing uncertainty,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. “If you already have branches in Mexico and Thailand, or a European operation supplying the local markets, your global strategy is largely already in place.”","summary":"The fluid tariff situation makes planning difficult, particularly with regard to offshore investment, S&P analysts say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3310061/tariff-flux-clouds-chinese-car-parts-makers-overseas-expansion-plans","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/12/b4197eb7-5804-47f1-981e-c05d8def7b77_a1054d4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 23:30:07","author":"Daniel Ren,Yujie Xue","authors":["Daniel Ren","Yujie Xue"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.201}]}
