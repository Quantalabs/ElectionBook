In the 1980s his suits became de rigeur in Wall Street corner offices, Madison Avenue boardrooms and even in Washington, DC’s corridors of power. \n\nAt the same time the tanned Italian designer, with almost cinematic good looks, transformed the Hollywood red carpet through a skillful blend of his expert tailoring and understated elegance. \n\nHe was one of the first designers to give his clothes free of charge to public figures – pioneering the practice of celebrity dressing which has now become a fundamental part of the fashion world.\n\nHis decision to offer his services to director Paul Schrader for the 1980 film, American Gigolo, not only inspired a touchstone for well-dressed men everywhere, but offered a foretaste for what Hollywood and European high fashion could do when working in tandem.\n\nIndeed, his history of red-carpet dressing offers not just a window into the evolution of the Armani brand, but one into half a century of celebrity dressing. \n\nIn 1978 Diane Keaton stunned the audience of the 50th Academy Awards by donning a tailored double breasted Armani jacket to accept her Best Actress Oscar for her androgynously styled lead role in Annie Hall. Armani was a fledgling designer, all but unknown in Hollywood, and the bold look offered a foretaste of his revolutionary approach to both female workwear and red-carpet dressing. \n\nJulia Roberts was a relative ingenue when she accepted her Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe for her breakout role in Steel Magnolias in 1990. She chose to do so in a silver grey, loosely fitted Armani suit, thus securing herself a place in fashion history. Roberts chose the look, both subtle and sexy, after a visit to the fabled designer’s Rodeo Drive boutique. In an instant Armani became the defacto designer for the modern female power suit.\n\nArmani continued to build his brand by merging his design business with the glitz of old Hollywood glamour. Just two years later he transformed Jodi Foster’s somewhat frumpy image by selecting a shimmering cream pantsuit from his Spring/Summer 1992 collection for that year’s Oscars ceremony. The streamlined silhouette offered the crowning touch to the actress as she picked up her second, Best Actress Oscar for her lead role in Silence of the Lambs. \n\nHollywood golden child Gwyneth Paltrow opted for a sheer Cher-like Armani gown of sparkly embroidery for the premiere of Shakespeare in Love – a movie that would garner the actress an Oscar. The look showcased not only Armani’s love of a sleek silhouette but the evolution of his designs from chic androgyny to full-scale red-carpet glamour. \n\nWhen Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise married in Rome in 2006, they turned to Armani, by then widely acknowledged as the master of Italian couture. Holmes’s off-the-shoulder gown, with an ivory silk train adorned in Valenciennes lace and Swarovski beaded crystal embroidery, grabbed as many headlines as her husband-to-be’s couch-jumping antics. Also outfitting the groom and their 7-month-old-daughter Suri, Armani proved he possessed a skill set that encompassed not only the core strengths of his international brand, but the bespoke glamor that has since become a hallmark of the modern celebrity wedding. \n\nArmani’s reputation as the go-to designer for power dressing made him a natural choice for female politicians. Hilary Clinton frequently turned to the Italian’s structured but understated pantsuits. Though far from the first female politician to favor designer duds, Clinton came under scrutiny when she appeared in June 2016 in an Armani jacket costing upwards of $12,000 for a speech on American income inequality. The moment underscored the fraught relationship between women politicians and their clothes – where dressing is yet another field in which criticism (and praise) can translate into electoral success. \n\nIt may not have been her night - she lost out to newcomer Mikey Madison in the category of Best Actress - but, dressed in a custom Giorgio Armani gown featuring crystal embroidery, a plunging neckline and a pleated bustle that transitioned into a dramatic train, Demi Moore looked every inch the Hollywood diva at this year’s Oscar ceremony. Light years away from Diane Keaton’s appearance forty-seven years earlier, Moore’s look was testament to Armani’s ability to evolve his aesthetic to fit the needs of the moment whilst remaining true to his roots in Italian couture.","summary":"When asked whether he would dress the incoming First Lady, Melania Trump, back in 2017, Giorgio Armani's response was succinct.

Maura Healey is joining with four neighboring governors to demand that planned developments move forward.\n\n“We reaffirm our unwavering support for working people and the unions that represent them. We stand with America’s workers and strongly urge the Trump Administration to keep these projects on track,” Healey, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement celebrating Labor Day.\n\nSince his second term began, President Donald Trump has frequently taken aim at offshore wind. Some reporting has traced his dislike of the industry back to when a new development affected Scotland golf course. He has also erroneously claimed “the windmills are driving the whales crazy” while there are no known links between whale deaths and offshore wind activities.\n\nEarly in his term, Trump signed an executive order to suspend new federal offshore wind leasing. States including Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, and New Jersey filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in May to challenge that order, and a judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss the case in June.\n\nThe governors argued that the projects support American workers and unions, ensure the American economy leads in clean energy innovation, and keeps the electric grid affordable.\n\n“We are looking for the Trump Administration to uphold all offshore wind permits already granted and allow these projects to be constructed,” the governors’ joint statement continued. “Efforts to walk back these commitments jeopardize hardworking families, wasting years of progress and ceding leadership to foreign competitors.” \n\nThe White House is continuing to take more steps to thwart the industry, the New York Times reported Wednesday, bringing in government agencies not associated with wind energy into the effort.\n\nThe Trump administration halted the construction of the Revolution Wind project, a nearly completed wind development off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, Trump is reportedly planning to reconsider a permit issued for the SouthCoast Wind development.\n\n“Workers, businesses, and communities need certainty, not reversals that would cost tens of thousands of American jobs and critical investment,” the governors wrote. “Canceling projects that have already been fully permitted – including some near completion – sends the message to investors that the work can be stopped on a whim.”\n\nNew Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte, the sole Republican governor in New England, signed a new state law to remove the mandate to support offshore wind development in her state, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.","summary":"\"We are looking for the Trump Administration to uphold all offshore wind permits already granted and allow these projects to be constructed.\"\n\n\nThe post New England governors back wind energy as Trump escalates his attacks on industry appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/09/04/new-england-governors-back-wind-energy-as-trump-escalates-his-attacks-on-industry/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Offshore_Wind_11887-68ba2902e43ae-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 00:35:01","author":"Molly Farrar","authors":["Molly Farrar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.044},{"id":357504798,"title":"New Mexico-US security program is ‘good for the country,’ Sheinbaum says: Thursday’s mañanera recapped","text":"A new security cooperation program announced by the Mexican and U.S. governments on Wednesday was a key focus of President Claudia Sheinbaum’s Thursday morning press conference.\n\nSheinbaum responded to several questions about the initiative, which was announced after the president met with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the National Palace in Mexico City on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe new Mexico-US security program is ‘good for the country,’ says Sheinbaum\n\nSheinbaum said that the “cooperation program on border security and law enforcement” that was announced on Wednesday entails collaboration and cooperation between Mexico and the United States “in various areas,” including intelligence and training.\n\nShe said that Mexico and the United States will share information with each other to help authorities combat criminal threats in their respective countries.\n\nMexican and U.S. authorities already share intelligence, but there now appears to be a joint commitment to ramp up that cooperation.\n\nIt also appears that more joint training exercises will take place.\n\nSheinbaum indicated that Mexican military personnel will travel to the United States to undergo training offered by the U.S. armed offices and suggested that U.S. personnel could come to Mexico to receive natural disaster response training from the Mexican Army and Navy.\n\nRubio said on Wednesday that “joint training” is an important part of bilateral security cooperation and that Mexico and the U.S. plan to “amplify” that aspect of their security relationship.\n\nSheinbaum said that the meeting with Rubio was “very cordial” and contended that the result of it — a new security program that includes the establishment of a “high-level implementation group to meet regularly and follow up on mutual commitments” — is “good for the country.”\n\nSheinbaum spoke about a security agreement, but a ‘program’ was announced. What happened?\n\nA reporter told the president that there was an expectation that there was going to be a “signed agreement” between Mexico and the United States, possibly with “more commitments” and a broader scope than what was announced on Wednesday.\n\n“Did something change?” the reporter asked.\n\n“There is a program,” reiterated Sheinbaum, who in recent weeks spoke about a new bilateral security agreement that she expected to be signed soon, before modifying her language last week to talk about a security “understanding.”\n\nShe acknowledged that she had spoken about an agreement, but told reporters that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained to her that “bilateral agreements that are signed have another characteristic,” one that includes “other diplomatic and foreign policy procedures.”\n\n“… Perhaps I expressed myself poorly, … but the work program that was agreed yesterday was always on the table,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nSheinbaum: Rubio didn’t ask for more US agents to be allowed into Mexico\n\nA reporter asked the president whether Rubio had requested that more U.S. agents be allowed to come into Mexico to join the fight against Mexican drug cartels.\n\n“No, no, it wasn’t an issue,” Sheinbaum responded.\n\n“They know that we have a protocol to approve agents from the different [U.S.] agencies. … We have a constitution that addresses that and the National Security Law. So, it wasn’t an issue in the talks,” she said.\n\nIn 2020, Mexico’s Congress approved legislation that regulates the activities of foreign agents in Mexico, removes their diplomatic immunity and allows for their expulsion from the country.\n\nThe legislation was seen as being aimed primarily at United States Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, who have long operated in Mexico.\n\nMexico not planning to send additional troops to the border region\n\nSheinbaum said that an additional deployment of Mexican troops to the northern border region is not part of the new Mexico-U.S. security program.\n\nShe said an additional deployment is not currently “necessary,” and stressed that the United States hasn’t asked for more troops to be sent to the northern border region.\n\nThe federal government deployed 10,000 National Guard troops to the border region in February as part of an agreement Sheinbaum reached with United States President Donald Trump that resulted in a one-month “pause” on a 25% tariff the U.S. government planned to impose on imports from Mexico.\n\nThe tariff took effect in March, despite the National Guard deployment, but USMCA-compliant goods were promptly exempted from the duty.\n\nWhich Mexican officials officials will participate in the Mexico-U.S ‘high-level implementation group’?\n\nIn a joint statement issued on Wednesday, the Mexican and U.S. government said they had “established a high-level implementation group to meet regularly and follow up on mutual commitments and actions taken within their own countries, including measures to”:\n\n“Counter the cartels\nStrengthen border security and eliminate clandestine border tunnels\nAddress illicit financial flows\nEnhance collaboration to prevent fuel theft\nIncrease inspections, investigations, and prosecutions to stop the flow of drugs and arms.”\n\nOn Thursday, Sheinbaum said that five Mexican officials (or their proxies) will represent Mexico in the group:\n\nSecurity Minister Omar García Harfuch.\nDefense Minister Ricardo Trevilla Trejo.\nNavy Minister Raymundo Pedro Morales.\nForeign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente.\nAttorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero.\n\nSheinbaum: US commitment to combat arms trafficking to Mexico is ‘very important’\n\nMarco Rubio on Wednesday declared that the U.S. government will “stop the flow of armaments” to Mexico and other Western Hemisphere countries.\n\nOn Thursday, Sheinbaum said she wasn’t aware if any other U.S. official, while in Mexico, had publicly acknowledged “the importance” of the U.S. authorities taking action to stem the flow of firearms to Mexico, where cartel members and other criminals commonly use illegally imported weapons to commit crimes including murder.\n\n“So it’s very important,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum takes aim at PRI leader \n\nAfter telling reporters that no plans are currently in the works for her to meet Trump face to face, Sheinbaum noted that Senator Alejandro Moreno, national president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the instigator of a congressional brawl last week, was in Washington.\n\nOn social media on Wednesday, Moreno said that he had participated in “very productive meetings” in the capital, and declared that he and the PRI would “never allow” a “terrorist and communist narco-dictatorship” to be installed in Mexico.\n\nHe and some other opposition politicians claims that Sheinbaum and the ruling Morena party are in cahoots with organized crime in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum said that Moreno was making a fool of himself by traveling to Washington and claiming that her government is in bed with “los narcos.”\n\n“And here Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, [was] congratulating us for the work we are doing on organized crime and [speaking about] the good cooperation there is,” she said.\n\nRubio said Wednesday that “the current security cooperation between the United States and Mexico is the “closest … we have ever had, maybe with any country.”\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"Border troop deployment, a US commitment to end arms trafficking and an opposition leader's trip to D.C. were topics at Thursday's presser.\n\n\nThe post New Mexico-US security program is &#8216;good for the country,&#8217;

dozen countries have pledged to join a force to deploy in Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, aiming to deter Moscow from again attacking its neighbour, leaders announced Thursday.A \"reassurance force\" for Ukraine is a key pillar of the security guarantees a coalition of mainly European countries want to offer to Ukraine if the war ends via a peace deal or a ceasefire.However there is also growing concern that Russian President Vladimir Putin is now showing no interest in a peace accord, with alarm intensifying after his high-profile visit to Beijing this week.And the extent of any US involvement in any eventual security backstop remains uncertain, even after European leaders spoke to President Donald Trump via video conference following the summit in Paris of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\".It was hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, while others, like UK premier Keir Starmer, participated remotely.The meeting represented a new push led by Macron to show that Europe can act independently of Washington after Trump upended US foreign policy and launched direct talks with Putin after returning to the White House.The United States was represented by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who also met with Zelensky separately.Europe has been under pressure to step up its response over three and a half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\"We have today 26 countries who have formally committed -- some others have not yet taken a position -- to deploy as a 'reassurance force' troops in Ukraine, or be present on the ground, in the sea, or in the air,\" Macron told reporters, standing alongside Zelensky.Zelensky hailed the move. \"I think that today, for the first time in a long time, this is the first such serious concrete step,\" he said.The troops would not be deployed \"on the front line\" but aim to \"prevent any new major aggression\", the French president said.Macron added that another major pillar was a \"regeneration\" of the Ukrainian army so that it can \"not just resist a new attack but dissuade Russia from a new aggression\".Macron said the United States was being \"very clear\" about its willingness to participate in security guarantees for Ukraine.However, the American contribution remains unclear.There are also divisions within the coalition, with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urging more pressure but remaining cautious about the scope of involvement.\"Germany will decide on military involvement at the appropriate time once the framework conditions have been clarified,\" a German government spokesman said after the summit.Taking a similar line, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni reiterated that Italy will not send troops to Ukraine, but it could help monitor any potential peace deal, her office said.Before the Paris talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would not agree to the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine \"in any format\".Frustration has been building in the West over what leaders say is Putin's unwillingness to strike a deal to end the conflict.Zelensky said the call with Trump discussed sanctions on Russia and protecting Ukraine's airspace. \"We discussed different options, and the most important is using strong measures, particularly economic ones, to force an end to the war,\" Zelensky said on social media.The White House said it urged European countries to stop purchasing Russian oil \"that is funding the war\".A Russian rocket attack Thursday on northern Ukraine killed two people from the Danish Refugee Council who were clearing mines in an area previously occupied by Moscow's forces, the local Ukrainian governor said.Macron warned that if Russia continued refusing a peace deal, then \"additional sanctions\" would be agreed in coordination with the United States.He accused Russia of \"doing nothing other than try to play for time\" and intensifying attacks against civilians.The gathering followed Putin's high-profile trips to China and the United States, where he met with Trump in Alaska last month.Speaking Wednesday in Beijing, where he attended a massive military parade alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin hailed his forces' progress in Ukraine, adding that Russian troops were advancing on \"all fronts\".","summary":"More than two dozen countries have pledged to join a force to deploy in Ukraine after any eventual peace deal with Russia, aiming to deter

makes desperate drugs plea to Donald Trump\n\nBy BEN NAGLE, US SPORTS EDITOR\n\nPublished: 00:37 BST, 5 September 2025 | Updated: 01:14 BST, 5 September 2025\n\nMike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather, two of boxing's most legendary names, are set to face off against each other in 2026 in a blockbuster exhibition fight.\n\nBoth iconic fighters are long retired from the sport but will pull on the gloves once again for a spring showdown, and contracts are already signed, per TMZ.\n\nTyson, 59, sparked serious health concerns when he returned to the ring last year for an exhibition against Jake Paul, and a match-up against an opponent like Mayweather is set to further increase that.\n\nThough Mayweather himself is 48 - and will be 49 by the time he steps back in the ring - he holds a 50-0 professional record and is still in incredible shape.\n\nThe match between two of the sport's most legendary figures will be put on by CSI Sports and Fight Sports, and an exact date and location are yet to be decided.\n\nWhen Tyson last fought - a loss against YouTube sensation Paul - it took place live on Netflix at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium.\n\nMike Tyson is set to return to the ring

could happen. \n\n'However, boxing has entered a new era of the unpredictable - and this fight is as unpredictable as it gets.\n\n'I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this. It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!'\n\nMayweather also responded to the news, claiming: 'I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy. \n\nTyson drew a huge crowd - and plenty of health fears - when he came up against Jake Paul\n\nMayweather is regularly seen courtside at NBA games and flaunting his considerable wealth\n\n'You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it’s going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.'\n\nMayweather last fought professionally in 2017 against Conor McGregor in one of the most-watched fights in history, though he has stepped back into the ring multiple times since.\n\nHis last fight was a second exhibition against John Gotti III in August 2024 in Mexico City.\n\nA remarkable 108 million people tuned in on Netflix to Tyson's fight with Paul last year, and early indications are that this showdown between two of boxing's biggest legends could draw even more excitement.\n\nMike TysonFloyd Mayweather\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nFloyd Mayweather and Mike Tyson to fight each other in blockbuster 2026 showdown... and both have ALREADY signed contracts\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Both iconic names are retired from the sport but will pull on the gloves once again for a spring showdown, and contracts are already signed, per TMZ.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/boxing/article-15067915/Floyd-Mayweather-Mike-Tyson-boxing-fight.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/05/00/99859051-0-Boxing_icon_Mike_Tyson_went_on_Fox_Friends_to_plead_for_the_lega-a-9_1757029040687.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 00:14:33","author":"Ben Nagle,Editor","authors":["Ben Nagle","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":357500448,"title":"Chicago's Latino leaders urge 'don’t take the bait' as city braces for uptick in federal agents","text":"Latino leaders are urging Chicago area residents to peacefully gather “en masse” for upcoming Mexican Independence Day celebrations as President Donald Trump plans to ramp up immigration enforcement and potentially deploy National Guard troops to the city.\n\nLatino Leadership Council members, former U.S. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez, D-Chicago, and other officials at Daley Plaza Thursday repeatedly emphasized that residents “don’t take the bait” from Trump, suggesting his plan to send troops to Chicago is a ploy to agitate the community.\n\nThey also called on residents to remain peaceful during protests that might arise from a National Guard deployment to the city.\n\nTrump reiterated this week that he plans to send guardsmen to Chicago, but he hasn’t said when. Trump has said he wants to combat crime, though a WBEZ analysis found that a three-month summer span saw the fewest murders in Chicago in 60 years. \n\nHis administration also has recently indicated an increase in ICE agents targeting immigrants in Chicago. The Associated Press reported that increased immigration enforcement in the area could last 45 days. \n\n“I’m not saying don’t protest. I’m saying, lift your voice, but not your hand … Lift your banner, but not a rock,” Gutiérrez said. “As a matter of fact, bring cold water. Bring sandwiches. Bring peace and harmony to the National Guardsmen that decide to follow this illegal order.”\n\nSome federal agents have already been practicing crowd control with shields and flash-bang grenades at a north suburban naval base.\n\n“They are already training for riots. What riots? The riots that they want to instigate, the riots that they want to perpetuate in the city of Chicago. Do not take the bait,” Gutiérrez said. “Let us show that this is a city where we take care of one another, where we love one another, where we are in peace and in harmony with one another. We don’t need the National Guard.”\n\nThe majority of Mexican Independence Day parades and celebrations are still happening, though some will have extra precautions and organizers are closely monitoring potential federal activity. The two-day El Grito festival in Grant Park was postponed because of possible ICE presence, organizers said Thursday.\n\nState Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, called the timing of Trump’s idea to send troops around the start of those celebrations “an insult” and a “fear tactic.”\n\nVilla and City Clerk Anna Valencia invited those outside the Latino community to attend celebrations across Chicago and the suburbs “to come cheer us on on the sidelines.”\n\n“We need our allies to show up more than ever,” Valencia said. “If you have the privilege of being a U.S. citizen, you need to join us as not only protesting and speaking out to these injustices, and to understand that this is a distraction from whatever else Trump doesn’t want to talk about.”\n\nWearing a pin with both the Mexican and American flags, Berto Aguayo, the Latino Leadership Council Policy co-chairman, encouraged residents to highlight their Mexican-American pride.\n\n“We will bring both our Mexican and American flags and carry them with pride and peace as a reminder of our heritage and our rightful place in this nation, that this is our home and that this is our country, too,” Aguayo said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/04/chicagos-latino-leaders-urge-dont-take-the-bait-as-city-braces-for-uptick-in-federal-agents","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3eadd53/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F7f%2F98b7e2634b548fd047df49075cfb%2Flatino","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 00:12:51","author":"Kade Heather","authors":["Kade Heather"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":357509082,"title":"Trump set to re-establish Defense Department's 'warrior ethos' by restoring original name","text":"President Donald Trump intends to restore the original name of the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday that will designate the Department of War as the DOD's secondary title, according to a White House fact sheet obtained by Fox News Digital.

The move, confirmed by a White House official to Fox News Digital, is part of the administration’s broader “warrior ethos” campaign aimed at reshaping the Pentagon’s culture. The order will allow the use of “Department of War” as a secondary name for the Pentagon, alongside official terms such as “Secretary of War” for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It also directs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps that would eventually make “Department of War” the permanent title. As part of the rollout, Pentagon websites, office signs, and even the public affairs briefing room will be updated. The press room will be renamed the “Pentagon War Annex.” Officials also said that other long-term projects tied to the name change are being planned. Trump And Hegseth Support Change Trump has hinted at the change in recent weeks, saying the US military had a history of major victories under the War Department’s banner. “Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was the Department of War,” Trump said on August 25. “Then we changed it to Department of Defence,” he added. Hegseth, who has already been called “Secretary of War” by Trump on occasion, said the change matches the administration’s push for a cultural shift inside the Pentagon. “We won WWI and WWII not with the Department of Defense, but with a War Department,” Hegseth said on Fox & Friends. “We’re not just defense, we’re offense. We want warriors, people who know how to win on the battlefield. Words and names matter,” he added. How Department Of War Got Its Title The US first used the Department of War title for its military leadership until 1949. That year, following reforms in the National Security Act of 1947, the agency was renamed the Department of Defense, reflecting a broader structure that unified the Army, Navy, and newly created Air Force under one umbrella. If fully implemented, Trump’s executive order would mark the first major symbolic change to the Pentagon’s identity in over 70 years.

Imports from Japan with preexisting tariffs of 15 percent or higher will not face any additional levy, and duties on other items will be capped at 15 percent.\n\nThe order was issued hours after Japan's top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa arrived in Washington for his 10th round of talks with Trump's trade team, aiming to secure the auto tariff reduction and special treatment won in the agreement.\n\nIn return for Japan's promise to invest heavily in the United States during Trump's second term, most of its exports to the world's largest economy are now subject to a 15 percent tariff instead of 24 percent or 25 percent as previously threatened.\n\nHowever, the United States had yet to implement either the reduced auto tariff rate or the \"no stacking\" treatment.\n\nJapanese officials had said implementing the 15 percent auto tariff rate, which is based on a different legal framework than Trump's country-specific duties, would require an executive order such as that issued on Thursday.\n\nFor the preferential treatment, they had suggested the executive order Trump signed in late July would need to be amended. The document specifically granted such treatment to the European Union, but failed to do so in the case of Japan due to an administrative error by the U.S. government.\n\nAkazawa, who serves as minister for economic revitalization, had initially planned to travel to Washington last week to meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, but canceled the trip at the last minute.\n\nAccording to the officials, the schedule was changed as the two countries still needed to hammer out details at the working level.\n\nUnder the July trade deal, Japan pledged to invest up to $550 billion in the United States, with the officials saying the figure represents a combination of investments, loans and loan guarantees from government-backed financial institutions.\n\nJapan and the United States have shared the view that such investments will focus on areas considered strategically important for both countries, such as critical minerals, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\nBut the administration has repeatedly claimed that Trump has absolute control over the Japanese money, which Tokyo has denied.\n\nIn Thursday's order, Trump said these Japanese investments will be \"selected\" by the U.S. government. He said they will \"generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.\"\n\nThe order highlighted that as part of the deal, Japan is working toward an \"expedited implementation\" of a 75 percent increase of U.S. rice imports under the World Trade Organization's \"minimum access\" quota system.\n\nIt said Japan's planned imports of U.S. rice and other agricultural goods, such as corn, soybeans and fertilizer, will total $8 billion per year.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday formally implementing a trade deal his administration struck with Japan in July, finally lowering tariffs on Japanese car…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/politics/urgent-trump-signs-order-formally-implementing-u.s.-japan-trade-deal","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/8b/b1/f7b210c8635de4b5e11d88a9291906b9198d/ap25098218420558/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:44:19","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":357494812,"title":"Trump admin ditches Biden-era plan to make airlines pay compensation for flight disruptions","text":"By RIO YAMAT\n\nThe Trump administration said Thursday it is abandoning a Biden-era plan that sought to require airlines to compensate stranded passengers with cash, lodging and meals for flight cancellations or changes caused by a carrier.\n\nThe proposed rule would have aligned U.S. policy more closely with European airline consumer protections. It was proposed last December in the final weeks of then-President Joe Biden’s administration, leaving its fate in the hands of his Republican successor.\n\nIn a document posted Thursday, President Donald Trump’s Transportation Department said its plan to scrap the proposed rule was “consistent with Department and administration priorities.”\n\nIndustry trade group Airlines for America, a vocal critic of the proposal, said it would have driven up ticket prices for consumers.\n\n“We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don’t solve issues important to our customers,” the group said Thursday in a statement.\n\nThe proposed rule sought compensation starting at $200 when a flight is canceled or significantly delayed because of a mechanical problem with the plane or an airline computer outage. Compensation as high as $775 was proposed for delays of nine hours or more.\n\nAirlines already promise some level of customer service when they cause flight cancellations or severe delays, but passengers usually have to ask for help at the airport, and airline promises don’t carry the weight of federal rules.\n\nBiden’s Transportation Department was also considering free rebooking on the next available flight, including flights on rival airlines, as well as meals and lodging when passengers are stranded overnight.

The challenge came as the former governor slammed Mamdani at his press conference in Manhattan's Upper West Side for failing \"to give a straight answer\" to reporters' questions, and changing his mind \"on everything\" he has said on the campaign trail. \"When you try to ask [Mamdani] a question, he will simply not answer, and he obfuscates. And, frankly, you guys let him get away with it,\" Cuomo told reporters Thursday. \"I won't let him get away with it. And New Yorkers won't let him get away with it.\" ADAMS, CUOMO TRADE JABS IN INTERVIEWS AS DEMS-TURNED-INDEPENDENTS COURT ANTI-MAMDANI VOTE Hours after Cuomo leveled his challenge to Mamdani, the self-described Democratic socialist shot back a proposal of his own: debate President Donald Trump. \"Let’s cut out the middle man. Why should I debate Donald Trump’s puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?\" Mamdani's campaign told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he’s cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors.\" The back-and-forth between Cuomo and Mamadani comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is weighing whether to offer jobs in his administration to incumbent NYC Mayor Eric Adams and the GOP candidate for NYC mayor, Curtis Sliwa. The move to offer the two candidates a job is reportedly a bid to clear the field for Cuomo, multiple sources with intimate knowledge about the matter have said. WHITE HOUSE SILENT ON REPORT THAT TRUMP ALLIES HAVE WEIGHED LURING ADAMS TO ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERCUT MAMDANI The former governor indicated during his Thursday press conference that he was aware of media reports about Trump possibly offering his NYC mayoral opponents jobs, subsequently clearing the field for him, but added that he has \"no idea\" if the reports are accurate. Cuomo said he has not spoken to either Mayor Eric Adams or President Trump about the matter. \"I know nothing about that speculation,\" Cuomo told reporters Thursday about the matter. His campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Adams nor his team responded to Fox News Digital's inquiries on Thursday either, but media reports Thursday indicated Adams met in Florida with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, one of the president's closest advisors, to discuss a potential job with the Trump administration. News of the Adams meeting came after media reports last week indicating Trump had personally phoned influential businessman John Catsimatidis, an Adams ally, to set a deadline for the mayor and Sliwa to drop out. JUDGE TELLS CUOMO TO STOP USING TAXPAYER MONEY TO ‘RESURRECT HIS PUBLIC IMAGE’ IN LEGAL CASE The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment on the matter. Cuomo, who has positioned himself as the moderate left-wing alternative to Mamdani in the race, described Mamdani's policy proposals Thursday as \"absurd,\" \"out of the mainstream,\" and \"discordant with what New Yorkers believe.\" Shortly after launching his independent bid for mayor last month, Cuomo proposed that all the other candidates in the race, with the exclusion of Mamdani, make a pledge to agree that whoever is not leading in the polls by mid-September, would step aside.

Podcasters and social media influencers will also be excluded from forking over a portion of their tips, according to the list released Tuesday by the Treasury Department.\n\nThe provision in the law signed by President Donald Trump in July eliminates federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them. It’s temporary and runs from 2025 until 2028. It applies to people who make less than $160,000 in 2025.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimates that there were roughly 4 million workers in tipped occupations in 2023, which amounts to roughly 2.5% of all jobs.\n\nThe administration was required to publish a list of qualifying occupations within 90 days of the bill’s signing. The full list of occupations is located on the Treasury Department website.\n\nThey are broken down into eight categories, including beverage and food service; entertainment and events; hospitality and guest services; home services; personal services; personal appearance and wellness; recreation and instruction; and transportation and delivery.\n\nAmong other jobs exempted from tax on tips are sommeliers, cocktail waiters, pastry chefs, cake bakers, bingo workers, club dancers, DJs, clowns, streamers, online video creators, ushers, maids, gardeners, electricians, house cleaners, tow truck drivers, wedding planners, personal care aides, tutors, au pairs, massage therapists, yoga instructors, cobblers, skydiving pilots, ski instructors, parking garage attendants, delivery drivers and movers.\n\nA report from the Budget Lab shows that the effects of the law would be small, given that tipped workers tend to be lower income. More than 37% of tipped workers, or over one third, earned income low enough that they faced no federal income tax in 2022.\n\n“The larger and far more uncertain effect would stem from behavioral changes incentivized by the bill, such as substitution into tipped employment and tipped income, which would increase the bill’s overall cost,” states the report, which was written by Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Budget Lab.\n\nCongressional budget analysts project the “No Tax on Tips” provision would increase the deficit by $40 billion through 2028. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in June that the tips deduction will cost $32 billion over 10 years.\n\nOnly tips reported to the employer and noted on a worker’s W-2, their end-of-year tax summary, will qualify. Payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare, would still be collected along with state and local taxes.\n\nPolling shows Americans have panned the big bill. Half U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most — about 6 in 10 — think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people.","summary":"Golf caddies, blackjack dealers and house painters are covered, too, according to the Treasury Department.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/09/04/podcasters-influencers-no-tax-tips-bartenders-golf-caddies-blackjack-dealers/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25244659217106-e1757028170475.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:24:24","author":"Fatima Hussein,The Associated Press","authors":["Fatima Hussein","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.156},{"id":357495508,"title":"Defense Department Being Renamed Department Of War Under Trump Executive Order","text":"The Department of Defense will soon be renamed to the Department of War, according to multiple outlets, as President Donald Trump follows through on his recent suggestion to revert the agency’s name back to what it was before 1949.\n\nThe executive order will reportedly be signed Friday.

Healthcare and social assistance companies cut openings by 181,000 and retailers by 110,000.\n\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that layoffs rose slightly. The number of Americans quitting their jobs — a sign of confidence in their ability to find better pay, opportunities or working conditions elsewhere — was unchanged from June at 3.2 million.\n\nJobs openings remain at healthy levels but have fallen steadily since peaking at a record 12.1 million in March 2022 as the U.S. economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nThe U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because of the lingering effects of 11 interest rate hikes by the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 and partly because President Donald Trump’s trade wars have created uncertainty that is paralyzing managers making hiring decisions.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department will put out unemployment and hiring numbers for August. They are expected to show that businesses, government agencies and nonprofits added nearly 80,000 jobs last month, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would mark a modest improvement on the disappointing 73,000 they created in July.\n\nWorse than the lackluster July hiring figures were Labor Department revisions that slashed a stunning 258,000 jobs off May and June payrolls. A furious Trump responded to the bad numbers by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the technocratic agency that compiles the statistics, and nominating a partisan idealogue to replace her.\n\nSo far this year, the economy has been generating 85,000 jobs a month, down from 168,000 last year and an average 400,000 a month during the hiring boom of 2021-2023.\n\nIn a time of uncertainty, employers are less likely to hire, but they’re not letting workers go either.\n\nIn a social media post Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, noted that jobs openings in July had come in below the number of U.S. unemployed (7.24 million) for the first time since April 2021. “This is yet another crack in the labor market that illustrates how much harder it is to get a new job right now than what we’ve seen in a long time,” she wrote.","summary":"Job openings fell, layoffs ticked up, and quits hovered in place, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/09/04/jolts-job-openings-quits-layoffs-july-hiring-managers-paralyzed/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25246459148184.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:21:31","author":"Paul Wiseman,The Associated Press","authors":["Paul Wiseman","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":357499444,"title":"Trump will seek ‘Department of War’ rebrand for Pentagon","text":"By KONSTANTIN TOROPIN and CHRIS MEGERIAN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Friday to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, his latest effort to project an image of toughness for America’s military.\n\nThe Republican president can’t formally change the name without legislation, which his administration would request from Congress.

This Justice Department — perhaps the most politicized in American history — will do whatever President Trump demands,” Cook’s lawyer, Abbe David Lowell, said in a statement.\n\nNews of the investigation comes amid a high-stakes legal fight over President Donald Trump’s announcement last month that he was ousting Cook, an action she has said is being undertaken so that he can seize control over a central bank that is typically shielded from political pressure and tasked with making decisions about whether to raise or lower interest rates.\n\nTrump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 25 after one of his appointees alleged that she committed mortgage fraud related to two properties she purchased in 2021, before she joined the Fed.\n\nBill Pulte, who made the criminal referral in his capacity as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has asserted that Cook had claimed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\n\nThe Justice Department inquiry is centered on those two properties, according to the person familiar with the matter. It is being coordinated with U.S. Attorney offices by Ed Martin, the director of the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group, who is also pursuing mortgage fraud investigations into perceived Trump adversaries, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats. Both have vigorously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPulte dodged questions in a CNBC interview Thursday about whether he was similarly scrutinizing Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who is friendly with Trump and is running for Senate in his state’s Republican primary. Paxton took out mortgages on three properties that were all identified as his primary residence. He said he wouldn’t comment on any specific situation that has not been made public.\n\nCook’s lawyers have also insisted that she did not engage in fraud.\n\n“The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again,” Lowell said.\n\nSeparately, on Thursday, the Justice Department urged a federal judge in Washington to allow for Cook’s immediate removal while she fights to keep her job, dismissing as “baseless” Cook’s claim that the president is attempting to fire her so that he can seize control of the Federal Reserve.\n\nCook’s lawyers have argued that the firing was unlawful because presidents can only fire Fed governors “for cause,” which has typically meant inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance while in office. They also said she was entitled to a hearing and a chance to respond to the charges before being fired, but was not provided either. Attorneys said in the court filing that Cook never committed mortgage fraud.\n\nThe Justice Department says the president has the discretion to fire Cook for cause and that his decisions cannot be reviewed by the courts.\n\nThe case could become a turning point for the nearly 112-year-old Federal Reserve, which was designed by Congress to be insulated from day-to-day political influence. Economists prefer independent central banks because they can do unpopular things, such as lifting interest rates to combat inflation more easily than elected officials.\n\nTrump has repeatedly attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the other members of the Fed’s interest-rate setting committee for not cutting the short-term interest rate they control more quickly.\n\nMany economists worry that if the Fed falls under the control of the White House, it will keep its key interest rate lower than justified by economic fundamentals to satisfy Trump’s demands for cheaper borrowing.","summary":"The AP source said the probe is being coordinated by the same office pursuing investigations of Sen.

Ron DeSantis's administration raced to build the facility on an isolated airstrip surrounded by wetlands to aid President Donald Trump's efforts to deport people in the U.S. illegally. \n\nIn her ruling, Williams held that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit against the federal government, based on the fact that the Trump administration has said it would reimburse Florida for its construction on the facility - making the detention center effectively a federal facility.\n\nBut Judges Elizabeth Branch and Barbara Lagoa - both of whom were appointed by President Donald Trump - determined on Thursday that Florida ran the immigration detention center, and not the federal government, ABC News reports. \n\nThey then sided with Florida officials, who claim that the law requiring environmental impact statements does not apply to states.\n\n'To the extent the district court took these statements to mean that Florida may one day be reimbursed for its expenditures on the facility, such an expectancy is insufficient as a matter of law to \"federalize\" the action,' they ruled.\n\nThe judges also determined that keeping Alligator Alcatraz open is in the public interest.\n\n'Given that the federal government has an undisputed and wide-reaching interest combatting illegal immigration, and that illegal immigration is a matter of national security public safety, we think the injunction... goes against public interest,' Branch and Lagoa wrote. \n\nLagoa added that the state of Florida 'will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot \"apply its own laws\" to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest.'\n\nJudge Adalberto Jordan, who was also appointed by Obama, stood as the lone dissent in the Atlanta appeals court's ruling.\n\nHe argued that his colleagues had overstepped their authority in dismissing the lower court's findings that the Everglads ecosystem could de damaged by the massive detention center.\n\n'The district court properly balanced the equities and the public interests,' Jordan wrote in his dissent.\n\n'The court considered the significant ongoing and likely future environmental harms to the plaintiffs from the detention facility, as well as the importance of immigration enforcement to the state and federal defendants.' \n\nT he Miccosukee Tribe has now expressed their disappointment with the ruling, though it said it was 'prepared for this result and will continue to litigate the matter.\n\n'We find some solace in the dissent's accurate analysis of the law and will continue to fight for the Everglades,' the tribe added. \n\nElise Bennet, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, also told the New York Times that Thursday's ruling is a 'heartbreaking blow to America's Everglades and every living creature there.'\n\nStill, she said 'the fight isn't even close to over.' \n\nThe detention center is located in a vast subtropical wetland that is home to alligators, crocodiles, and pythons - imagery that the White House leveraged to show its determination to remove migrants it says were wrongly allowed to stay in the US under former President Joe Biden. \n\nDeSantis has said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after.\n\nTrump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.\n\nDeSantis said on social media Thursday, after the appellate panel issued its ruling, that claims that the facility's shutdown were imminent were false.\n\n'We said we would fight that. We said the mission would continue,' DeSantis said. 'So Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.'\n\nFlorida Attorney General James Uthmeier also celebrated the decision as a 'win for Florida and President Trump's agenda.\n\n'Great win for Florida and our mission to help President Trump detain, deport and deliver for the American people,' he wrote. \n\nThe Department of Homeland Security called Thursday's ruling 'a win for the American people, the rule of law and common sense.'\n\n'This lawsuit was never about the environmental impacts of turning a developed airport into a detention facility,' DHS said in a statement. \n\n'It has and will always be about open-borders activists and judges trying to keep law enforcement from removing dangerous criminal aliens from our communities, full stop.","summary":"Alligator Alcatraz, the notorious immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, will be allowed to resume operations.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15067613/Alligator-Alcatraz-halt-ending-operations.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/22/101851553-0-image-a-9_1757021578997.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/01/8531706299977807934/1024x576_MP4_8531706299977807934.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:16:48","author":"Associated,Editor,Melissa Koenig,Reuters","authors":["Associated","Editor","Melissa Koenig","Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.497},{"id":357494794,"title":"US immigration officers raid Georgia site where Hyundai makes electric vehicles","text":"By RUSS BYNUM\n\nSAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — U.S. immigration authorities on Thursday raided the sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in southeast Georgia, conducting a search that shut down construction on an adjacent factory being built to produce EV batteries.\n\nThe operation targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state’s history. Hyundai Motor Group began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities were conducting an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.\n\nGeorgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.\n\nVideo posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: “We’re Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.”\n\n“We need construction to cease immediately,” the man says. “We need all work to end on the site right now.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.\n\nThe Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.\n\nIn addition to making electric vehicles at the site facing Interstate 16 in Bryan County, Hyundai has also partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the battery plant. It’s slated to open sometime next year.\n\nThe joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, “is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,” the company said in a statement. “To assist their work, we have paused construction.”\n\nOperations at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing plant weren’t interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.\n\n“This did not impact people getting to work,” Johnson said in an email. “Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day” when authorities shut down access.","summary":"The operation focused on an adjacent construction site.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/04/immigration-raid-hyundai-plant/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigration_Raid_Hyundai_Plant_52767.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:09:22","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":357487946,"title":"Redistricting: Just because it’s legal doesn’t make it ethical","text":"The recent redistricting fights in Texas and California are the latest symptom of what’s broken in American politics: too often, we treat legality as if it were the same thing as ethics. Both states are legally redrawing congressional maps mid-decade. Both are open about the partisan advantage they hope to secure. And yet, if this all feels wrong to voters, that’s because it is. Just because politicians can do something doesn’t mean they should.\n\nAt the request of the Trump administration, Texas lawmakers pushed through a new congressional map this past month that could expand the GOP advantage in the state by up to five additional House seats. In response, Democrats in California are pursuing a special election to reset district lines in their own favor. Unsurprisingly, the arms race has escalated, and other states are now looking to join in.\n\nTo be clear, redistricting has always been political. The Constitution entrusts state legislatures with this power, and courts have generally allowed partisanship to shape the lines, so long as it doesn’t run afoul of the Voting Rights Act. But that legal reality shouldn’t excuse the behavior. The law sets a floor for acceptable conduct, not a ceiling. Voters deserve leaders who are guided by more than what they can get away with.\n\nThis confusion of law and ethics extends far beyond district maps. We’ve seen it play out in presidential impeachments, when partisans argued not about whether behavior was right, but whether it rose to the level of a legal “high crime or misdemeanor.” Bill Clinton’s relationship with an intern and Donald Trump’s pressure campaign on Ukraine were very different in nature, but in both cases, the defense boiled down to the same claim: it wasn’t criminal. Similarly, Sen. Bob Menendez remained in office for years despite repeated indictments because he never faced a definitive conviction until 2024. In each instance, political survival was secured not by appeals to ethics, but by appeals to legality.\n\nThe reliance on legality is no accident. Americans rightly prize the principle of “innocent until proven guilty,” and it has become a hallmark of our legal system. But when voters import that standard into politics, it creates a cheap rationale: unless an act is outright illegal, politicians and their supporters claim blamelessness or even victimhood. The result is a steady erosion of standards. Political leaders learn that so long as they clear the low bar of legality, voters will shrug off the ethical failures.\n\nBut we all know in our personal lives that the law is not the only guide for right and wrong. It is legal to cheat on a spouse, to spread gossip about a coworker, or to be an absentee parent. Yet no one would argue these actions are ethically sound. We hold one another to standards higher than bare legality in our families, our workplaces, and our communities. We should do the same for our elected officials.\n\nNor is this a partisan problem. Both Republicans and Democrats have drawn gerrymanders when given the chance. Both parties have defended their leaders against ethical charges with the same tired refrain: “It wasn’t illegal.” If we want better, the pressure must come from voters of all political stripes.\n\nThat brings us back to Texas and California. Both states may succeed in enacting their mid-decade maps. They will likely survive legal challenges, because what they are doing is within their powers. But voters should resist the easy excuse that “if it’s legal, it’s fine.” They should remember that the legitimacy of our government rests not only on the letter of the law, but on the spirit of justice.\n\nMatt Germer is the policy director of the R Street Institute’s governance program.","summary":"They should remember that the legitimacy of our government rests not only on the letter of the law, but on the spirit of justice.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/04/redistricting-just-because-its-legal-doesnt-make-it-ethical/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SUT-Z-CALIF-REDISTRICTING-04.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:09:15","author":"Gqlshare,Matt Germer","authors":["Gqlshare","Matt Germer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":357494136,"title":"Trump to rename Department of Defense the 'Department of War,' official says","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order on Friday to rename the Department of Defense the \"Department of War,\" a White House official said on Thursday.\n\nThe order would authorize Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Defense Department, and subordinate officials to use secondary titles such as \"Secretary of War,\" \"Department of War,\" and \"Deputy Secretary of War\" in official correspondence, public communications, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nThe move, which would put Trump's stamp on the government's biggest organization and likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars, would instruct Hegseth to recommend legislative and executive actions required to make the renaming permanent.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has set out to rename a range of places and institutions, including the Gulf of Mexico, and to restore the original names of military bases that were changed after racial justice protests.\n\nDepartment name changes are rare, and require congressional approval, but Trump's fellow Republicans hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, and the party's congressional leaders have shown little appetite for opposing any of Trump's initiatives.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense was called the War Department until 1949, when Congress consolidated the Army, Navy and Air Force in the wake of World War II. The name was chosen in part to signal that in the nuclear age, the U.S. was focused on preventing wars, according to historians.\n\nChanging the name again will be costly and require updating signs and letterheads used not only by officials at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., but also military installations around the world.\n\nAn effort by former President Joe Biden to rename nine bases that honored the Confederacy and Confederate leaders was set to cost the Army $39 million. That effort was reversed by Hegseth earlier this year.\n\nThe Trump administration's government downsizing team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, has sought to carry out cuts at the Pentagon in a bid to save money.\n\nLONG TIME IN THE MAKING\n\nCritics have said the planned name change is not only costly, but an unnecessary distraction for the Pentagon.\n\nHegseth has said that changing the name is \"not just about words — it's about the warrior ethos.\"\n\nThis year, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, Republican U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, introduced a bill that would make it easier for a president to reorganize and rename agencies.\n\n\"We're just going to do it. I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that ... Defense is too defensive. We want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive, too if we have to be,\" Trump said last month.\n\nTrump also mentioned the possibility of a name change in June, when he suggested that the name was originally changed to be \"politically correct.\"\n\nBut for some in the Trump administration, the effort goes back much further.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, current FBI Director Kash Patel, who was briefly at the Pentagon, had a sign off in his emails which read: \"Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense & the War Department.\"\n\n\"I view it as a tribute to the history and heritage of the Department of Defense,\" Patel told Reuters in 2021.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order on Friday to rename the Department of Defense the &quot;Department of War,&quot; a White House official said on…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-to-rename-department-of-defense-the-%27department-of-war-%27-official-says","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/23/f7/61a564e898d6bc1f73802a47549852b1481f/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 23:08:56","author":"Japan Today Editor,Nandita Bose","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Nandita Bose"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":357493102,"title":"Trump will seek 'Department of War' rebrand for Pentagon","text":"President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order Friday to rebrand the Department of Defense as the Department of War, his latest effort to project an image of toughness for America's military.\n\nThe Republican president can't formally change the name without legislation, which his administration would request from Congress.

Kim put it: \"You can determine your own career. You know that, right?\"\n\nIn part, Miran seems motivated by the fact that his initial Federal Reserve job would only last for four months, as he would be finishing out the remainder of Adriana Kugler’s 14-year term. He would need to be confirmed again for a full term if he got the nod for that down the line. But neither the CEA nor the Federal Reserve is supposed to be treated like some corporate management job trainee program for Miran to rotate through. \n\nMiran may be playing dumb for the cameras, but he thoroughly understands the assignment, which is to push Trump’s interests. He’s not going to be an independent, sober-minded custodian of the country’s financial systems. He’s going to be a partisan spewing pro-Trump dreck, including pretending that tariffs aren’t hurting consumers or businesses. Perhaps he will also share his really racist thoughts about Trump’s abysmal job numbers, which basically boil down to “foreigners took all your jobs”\n\nTrump has attempted to shove out the actually competent, confirmed, and qualified Lisa Cook, who wasn’t treating her job as a governor of the country’s central bank as a side hustle. But Cook was never going to be someone who would let Trump dictate the country’s economic policy based on his whims and ability to line his pockets and the pockets of his friends. it’s clear that Miran will display no such spine.","summary":"One would think that being on the Federal Reserve board might require one’s full attention, what with being responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy and such.

The DNC clipped and posted Mamdani telling \"I've Had It\" podcast hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, \"We welcome anyone to join this movement.\" Mamdani was describing how he fostered a broad coalition of supporters to win the Democratic primary in June by welcoming anyone to join his movement, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. Social media quickly seized on the post, criticizing the party for showing support for Mamdani. Manhattan Institute fellow Daniel Di Martino said the DNC's post confirmed that the Democratic Party is \"quickly finishing its transformation into a socialist party.\" MAMDANI'S FAILURE TO WALK BACK THESE POSITIONS COULD CAUSE RECKONING IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'FIVE-ALARM WARNING' The post comes as several party leaders, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., have yet to endorse his campaign with just two months until Election Day. THE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO BLOCK FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NEW YORK When asked in July about Republicans trying to anchor Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats, DNC Chair Ken Martin told Fox News Digital, \"The Democratic Party is a big tent party. We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have progressives and we have these leftists.\" While the DNC affirmed their support for New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, party officials and establishment leaders have been careful to outright embrace Mamdani and his radical policy agenda. Throughout the summer, Fox News Digital has reported extensively about Mamdani's past comments, political connections and questionable stances. A Fox News Digital review discovered that Mamdani’s growing circle of influence is littered with activists who have espoused anti-Israel views and socialist principles. Mamdani also delivered remarks at a church led by a pastor with a history of controversial statements on race, anti-Israel ties and support for reparations. Fox News Digital has also reported on a resurfaced interview in which Mamdani highlights his commitment to BDS, an acronym for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, and sanctions against Israel, as he runs for mayor in a city with the highest Jewish population in the United States outside of Israel. Mamdani spoke at SAAG Interactive in June 2021 about BDS in the interview, saying that \"the ways in which we can marry our struggle to our day-to-day life and show our solidarity in that life, I think that's critical to winning this fight because it can't all be, as you've very well stated, just kind of exclusively considered a legislative battle. It has to be a society-wide battle.\" Another resurfaced interview included Mamdani explaining that the family he grew up in made him \"open\" to being a \"radical\" and suggesting that socialism needs to be rebranded. \"I think, honestly, growing up in the family that I grew up in, I was quite open to what would be considered being a radical from a very young age,\" Mamdani said on \"The Far Left Show\" in 2020. \"I mean, from the beginning, my identities are already considered radical by a lot of mainstream American political thought. So, being a Muslim and being an immigrant, these are things that already kind of put you in the box of ‘other.’ And so it's not that far of a jump because whenever you ... stand up to speak up for the rights of others who share the same identity as you, then you're a radical, right? So, often people in this country are considered radicals if they stand up for Palestinian human rights.\" Mamdani has faced criticism over some of his positions taken as a young man, including supporting an academic boycott of Israel, starting a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his college days and the past writings of his father, Mahmood Mamdani. A resurfaced video this summer also revealed that the socialist candidate floated the \"abolition of private property.\" \"My platform is that every single person should have housing, and I think, faced with these two options, the system has hundreds of thousands of people unhoused, right? For what?\" Mamdani asked in a resurfaced video that has been clipped and reposted across conservative social media. Mahmood Mamdani, the Columbia University professor and mayoral hopeful's father, has a social media presence littered with anti-Israel comments and praise for radical activists, a Fox News Digital review found. Mamdani, 79, who Fox News Digital previously reported sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, has posted on his X account about Israel on multiple occasions, using terms like \"settlers\" and \"colonialism.\" \"When all ranks of the Occupation, from the armed settler to the settler state, claim 'the right of self-defense', what language is left for those who defend themselves against the Occupation but the right to resist?\" Mamdani posted online May 21, 2021, as Israel was involved in a violent conflict with Hamas. Mamdani's father also sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing \"genocide\" and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers. Mamdani's college newspaper articles also shed light on the candidate’s early views on a variety of topics, including his promotion of an anti-Israel boycott and concerns about \"White privilege,\" a Fox News Digital review found. Mamdani wrote 32 articles for the Bowdoin Orient during his four years studying at Maine’s prestigious Bowdoin College, from 2010 to 2014, including an article his senior year promoting an academic boycott of Israel. He also faced ridicule for his comments at the Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, where he urged attendees not to compromise on goals like \"seizing the means of production.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Right now, if we're talking about the cancellation of student debt, if we're talking about Medicare for all, you know, these are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country,\" Mamdani says in a video to conference goers. \"But then there are also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it's BDS or whether it is the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the DNC and Mamdani but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani faced renewed scrutiny for his comments, stances and socialist views as the Democratic National Committee signals its support in a social media post.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dnc-embraces-socialist-mamdani-resurfaced-anti-israel-remarks-raise-alarm-big-tent-party","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/68269939-mamdani.png","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376091505112","publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:58:43","author":"Andrew Miller,Deirdre Heavey","authors":["Andrew Miller","Deirdre Heavey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":357490234,"title":"Trump to sign executive order renaming the Pentagon in historic move","text":"President Donald Trump will sign an executive order renaming the Department of Defense on Friday to its former namesake.\n\nThe president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have indicated in recent days that they want to change the name of the agency back to the Department of War, as part of the president's 'warrior ethos' campaign within the Pentagon.\n\nA White House official has since confirmed that Trump will roll out the name change on Friday in an executive order that calls for the term 'Department of War' to be used as a secondary title to the Department of Defense and terms like 'Secretary of War' to refer to Hegseth's position.\n\nThe order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive actions to make the name change permanent. \n\nImplementing the executive order will now require the federal government to change its websites, as well as signage at the Pentagon - including changing the name for the press briefing room to the 'Pentagon War Annex,' a White House official said.\n\nThe United States had called its military agency the Department of War up until 1949, when it was changed in accordance with the National Security Act of 1947 to the Department of Defense. \n\nBut Trump has suggested he would like to change the name back.\n\n'Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War,' he told reporters on August 25.

Massie, Greene and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna pushed for a bill that would compel Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the Epstein files.\n\nIf Congress passes the bill, which was originally sponsored by Khanna, Greene said she would read the names on the list thanks to a constitutional immunity rule for members of Congress.\n\nThe rule gives Massie, Greene or any other member the power to read names or make allegations during a speech on the House floor without legal consequences.\n\n'Can you imagine how terrifying it would be to name names like that. These are some of the richest, most powerful people in the world that could sue these women into poverty and homelessness,' Greene said at the presser, with alleged Epstein victims standing behind her.\n\n'Yeah, it's a scary thing to name names, but I will tell you, I'm not afraid to name names. And so if they want to give me a list, I will walk in that Capitol on the House floor and I'll say every damn name that abused these women. I can do that for them,' she added.\n\nMassie later echoed Greene's sentiments on X, saying that she 'and I are willing to name names in the House of Representatives under Constitutional 'speech or debate' immunity'.\n\nNonetheless, Epstein survivors are saying that if the government won't act, they will release the names on their own, potentially opening themselves up to lawsuits.\n\n'I would like to announce here today, us Epstein survivors have been discussing creating our own list. We know the names. Many of us were abused by them. Now together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know who were regularly in the Epstein world.,' victim Lisa Phillips said.\n\nShe said the public should 'stay tuned for more details'. \n\nThis came a day after the House Oversight Committee released nearly 34,000 pages of files from the Department of Justice containing information about Epstein's 2019 death while in jail and his flight logs from between 2000 and 2014.\n\nDemocratic and Republican critics alike slammed the disclosure for mostly containing information that was already publicly known.\n\n'I appreciate the efforts of my colleague James Comer, who's leading the House Oversight Committee. They may find some information, but they're allowing the DOJ to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them,' Massie said on Wednesday.\n\n'If you look at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted. And 97 percent of this is already in the public domain,' he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Massie has been pushing for a discharge petition that would force a vote on the Khanna bill that would release the Epstein files within 30 days.\n\nHe said 214 House members, including four Republicans have signed the petition thus far. \n\nIt needs 218 signatures to be successful, which means every Democrat and at least six Republicans will need to support it.\n\nAfter Wednesday's press conference, President Donald Trump reiterated his chosen response to the Epstein files controversy and insisted that it is merely a plot thought up by Democrats to hurt his presidency.\n\n'This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,' Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\n'From what I understand, I could check, but from what I understand, thousands of pages of documents have been given. But it's really a Democrat hoax because they're trying to get people to talk about something that's totally irrelevant to the success that we've had as a nation since I've been president,' he continued.\n\nMassie condemned this statements like this previously made by the president but did not name him in his rebuke.\n\n'I think it's shameful that this has been called a hoax. Hopefully today, we can clear that up. This is not a hoax. This is real. There are real survivors. There are real victims to this criminal enterprise, and the perpetrators are being protected,' he said.","summary":"Two Republican Representatives have insisted that they will read the names on the Epstein list if their effort to compel the DOJ to hand it over to Congress succeeds.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15067551/epstein-list-announced-house-floor-taylor-green-thomas-massie.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/23/101851731-0-image-m-16_1757024687682.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:56:39","author":"Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":357487948,"title":"Immigrant pleads guilty to being in US illegally after judge allegedly helped him evade agents","text":"By TODD RICHMOND\n\nMADISON, Wis.

In July, 86% of Mexico’s revenue from exports sent to the U.S. was derived from tariff-free trade, the newspaper El Financiero reported.\n\nThe publication of the U.S. data comes a week after Mexico’s national statistics agency INEGI reported that Mexico’s total export revenue in the first seven months of 2025 was $369.43 billion, a 4.3% annual increase.\n\nIn 2024, Mexico’s revenue from exports shipped worldwide exceeded $600 billion for the first time ever. The country is on track to exceed that barrier for a second consecutive year in 2025.\n\nMexico remains the top exporter to the US \n\nMexico’s exports to the United States in the first seven months of 2025 were worth 34.4% more than those of Canada, which ranked as the second biggest exporter to the U.S.\n\nIn the same period, Mexico’s exports were worth 59.7% more than those of China, which was the third largest exporter to the U.S.\n\nMexico sends a wide range of products to its northern neighbor including vehicles, auto parts, electronic goods, medical devices, fresh food and alcoholic beverages. More than 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the United States.\n\nWhile the value of Mexico’s exports to the U.S. increased 6.5% between January and July, Canada’s revenue declined 4.4% while China’s fell 18.9%.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Mexico had a 15% share of the United States’ total market for imports, ahead of Canada on 11.2% and China on 9.4%.\n\nMexico’s spending on US goods is also up\n\nThe U.S. data shows that Mexico spent $28.99 billion on U.S imports in July and $197.16 billion in the first seven months of the year.\n\nThe former figure represents a 1% annual increase while the latter represents a 1.1% year-over-year increase.\n\nMexico was the second largest importer of U.S. goods in the first seven months of the year, just behind Canada. Among Mexico’s imports from the U.S. are gasoline, natural gas, auto parts, vehicles and corn.\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum has said that Mexico is willing to look at ways it can increase its imports from the United States. Her government is seeking to reduce reliance on imports from Asian countries, especially China, as part of its Plan México industrial policy.\n\nOne of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has given for his decision to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico is that Mexico runs a significant trade surplus with its northern neighbor.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2025, Mexico’s surplus on trade with the U.S. was $112.59 billion, a 17.7% increase compared to the same period of last year. Trump would not be happy with that result.\n\nMexico and the United States are each other’s largest trade partner, and the economies of the two countries are highly-integrated.\n\nWith reports from El Economista and El Financiero","summary":"So far this year, Mexico has maintained a strong trade surplus with the U.S., its top trade partner.\n\n\nThe post Mexican exports to the US continue to grow appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/business/mexican-exports-us-grow/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2146415481.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:52:10","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":357490216,"title":"Concerns for frail ex-president Joe Biden as he wobbles through meet-and-greet with shocking head wound","text":"Former President Joe Biden has sparked health concerns after stepping out in Delaware with a large scar across his forehead. \n\nThe 82-year-old was seen looking frail in new footage leaving a church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware with what appears to be a large gash on his head. \n\nThe footage, first shared by Inside Edition, was taken by local Fred Karger who told the outlet that from up close it resembled a scar from skin cancer surgery. \n\nThe night before, he was also seen at a local ice cream shop wearing a baseball cap that appeared to cover the injury. \n\nBiden's spokesperson confirmed to the Daily Mail on Thursday that the former president recently underwent Mohs surgery. \n\nThe procedure removes thin layers of skin cancer to detect how deep the disease has spread, and former First Lady Jill Biden underwent the same surgery in early 2023. \n\nIn August, Biden was seen with a bandage covering the same spot on his forehead at the funeral for former governor and U.S. Representative Mike Castle. \n\nThe brush with skin cancer comes after Biden previously underwent surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his chest in 2023, and he is also currently undergoing treatment for stage four prostate cancer.\n\nIt comes months after Biden stunned the nation as he announced that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. \n\nTop doctors said it was 'inconceivable' that the former president's condition could have gone undetected for his four years in the White House before it had spread throughout his body. \n\nHis cancer was given a Gleason score of 9 and a Grade Group of 5, a dire stage of the rapidly-spreading disease. The diagnosis came days after doctors found a 'small nodule' on his prostate, doctors said at the time. \n\nUpon hearing the news, some of America's top doctors also questioned how a former president could be diagnosed with late stage prostate cancer - which can be detected early with routine bloodwork recommended for all men over the age of 50.\n\n'It is inconceivable that this was not being followed before he left the Presidency,' wrote Dr. Howie Forman, a professor of radiology and biomedical imaging, public health management and economics at Yale.\n\nHe noted that the test for prostate-specific antigen would have shown he had cancer 'for some time before this diagnosis', given how aggressive it is.\n\nIn February 2024, when Biden was the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, his longtime physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor deemed him 'fit to serve' following a routine physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nFollowing the news of Biden's diagnosis, Donald Trump Jr took to social media just hours later to call out the unlikelihood that it would have been missed for so long. \n\nHe questioned if there was a 'coverup' by sharing a screengrab of a post from physician Dr. Steven Quay, who called prostate cancer 'the easiest cancer to diagnose when it first starts and to watch it progress to bone metastases.' \n\nBiden's appearance in public comes days after his daughter Ashley exposed her husband's alleged affair as she announced that she was filing for divorce. \n\nTo remove his cancer, Biden underwent Mohs surgery, which is used to remove certain types of skin cancers including some melanomas, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other less common skin cancers.\n\nIt is performed in an outpatient setting and typically takes a few hours. Patients are able to remain awake for the surgery, which requires just local anesthesia to numb the area.\n\nThe objective of a Mohs procedure is to excise as much cancerous skin tissue as possible while also doing as little damage to the surrounding healthy tissue as possible. It's a gradual process and layers of skin are removed in steps.\n\nFirst, the surgeon uses a scalpel to remove the surface level cancerous skin tissue with the understanding that there might be more cancerous tissue beneath the surface as the bulk of skin cancer is usually hidden under the surface.\n\nThe surgeon maps out where on the body the cancerous tissue was extracted, takes that tissue sample to the lab, dyes it, and cuts it into sections. Specialized technicians place those tissue samples on slides to be investigated under the microscope.\n\nThe doctor then examines the edges of each section of tissue for evidence of remaining cancer. If the surgeon finds cancer cells under the microscope, their location is marked on the map.\n\nThe process is repeated until the doctor finds no evidence of cancer in the sampled tissue.\n\nSome wounds will be big enough to require sutures to close. They typically heal within a couple of weeks. Smaller wounds can heal by themselves in about a month.\n\nTypically people are able to leave between two and six hours after the outpatient surgery, though the timing depends on the size of the area effected.\n\nThe procedure is extremely common. Mohs surgery is performed on 876,000 skin cancers per year in the United States.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden stunned locals in Delaware as he stepped out with a large scar across his forehead at church in Rehoboth Beach.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15067391/Joe-Biden-head-gash-scar-skin-cancer-diagnosis-Delaware.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/04/21/101850279-0-image-m-62_1757018025831.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/19/4607102991965208161/1024x576_MP4_4607102991965208161.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:51:06","author":"Cassidy Morrison Senior,Editor,Nikki Schwab,Will Potter","authors":["Cassidy Morrison Senior","Editor","Nikki Schwab","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":357496536,"title":"Trump’s DC crime operation ‘puts safety of families first’ as arrests surge past 1,800: FBI director","text":"FBI Director Kash Patel said President Donald Trump’s \"'Make DC Safe Again' operation is delivering real results,\" announcing Thursday the initiative surpassed 1,800 arrests with dozens of guns and drugs seized in recent days.

(Photo by Diego Herrera Carcedo/Anadolu via Getty Images)\nAnadolu via Getty Images\n\nDispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,289.\n\nRussia’s Attack on Ukraine\n\nOn September 3, Ukraine reported at least one person killed and five others wounded after an overnight air strike involving 526 projectiles Ukraine’s Air Force intercepted and jammed 430 drones along with 21 of 24 missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the attack as “demonstrative,” describing it as designed to display Russian impunity. “Every Russian strike must be met with a real response,” he posted on X. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valerii Syrskyi declared that Ukraine would build a layered defense system necessary to protect its people from Russian drones.\n\nBetween September 1 and September 4, Russian strikes killed at least 21 civilians and wounded more than 70 others across Ukraine. Eastern Donetsk region, the hardest hit, suffered 14 civilians killed and 39 wounded. In the south, Kherson province recorded three fatalities and 19 wounded. Northeastern Kharkiv province posted three deaths and 10 wounded; in neighboring central Dnipropetrovsk region, one person was killed and at least three others were wounded.\n\nPutin Invites Zelenskyy to Moscow\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on September 3 that he is willing to meet Zelenskyy face-to-face in Moscow. Speaking at a press conference following the Victory Day parade in Beijing, Putin said that a visit by Zelenskyy to the Russian capital is possible, adding that he has “never excluded the possibility of meeting with him.”\n\nUkraine, however, rejected the proposal outright. “If you want no meeting to happen — then invite me to Moscow,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on September 4. Zelenskyy added that while Russia’s talk of a meeting is “already a good sign,” Kyiv sees no real Russian intentions to end the war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also dismissed the idea of talks in Moscow. He pointed to “serious proposals” from seven alternative host countries and accused Putin of “making knowingly unacceptable proposals.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPutin arrived in China on August 31 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, which included more than 20 countries. He then attended an immense military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II. The parade took place at Tiananmen Square, where Chinese authorities brutally suppressed student-led, pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nFor both China and Russia, the visit had strategic implications. Putin gained additional legitimacy in the wake of his recent meeting in Alaska with U.S. President Donald Trump. Russia also secured China’s approval for the long-awaited “Power of Siberia 2” pipeline, which will traverse Mongolia, with plans to supply 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually over 30 years. For China, the summit served as a vivid demonstration of its growing economic and military power.\n\nThe close ties between the two authoritarian leaders were further underscored by a circulated dialogue between Putin and Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, in which they discussed extending human longevity through bio-technologies, a possible indication of Putin’s intent to retain power in the Kremlin as long as possible.\n\nUkraine Cripples Russian Refineries While India Profits\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian drones have been targeting Russian oil refineries. Some of these strikes have yielded a measurable effect, knocking out as much as 20% of Russia's refining capacity. That loss represents some one million barrels a day, mostly gasoline and diesel. The result has been lines at gas stations across Russia, with reports of shortages from occupied Crimea to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East.\n\nMoreover, wholesale gas prices have skyrocketed 54% since January to a record high. To protect the domestic supply, the government has been forced to ban gasoline exports; in some regions, fuel rationing is already in place. The strain is also visible in Moscow’s finances: Russia’s budget deficit for the first seven months of 2025 hit $61.4 billion, the annual target.\n\nAt the forefront of Ukraine’s campaign is “kamikaze” drone development. First presented in May, these models are already rolling off the lines at 100 drones per day. Each costs some $55,000 but can fly up to 1,000 miles into Russia with a warhead carrying approximately 130 to 265 pounds of explosives. These characteristics make the drone cheap enough to use on a large scale and advanced enough to slip through Russian defense systems.\n\nWhile Russia grapples with domestic fuel woes, its oil exports benefit foreign buyers. India’s imports of Russian crude oil have saved its refiners at least $12.6 billion since April, 2022. Discounts were steep at that time, helping India take advantage of Russian barrels priced well below other suppliers. By the 2024-25 fiscal year, however, the savings had narrowed to $1.45 billion, as discounts shrank while shipping and insurance costs rose due to Western restrictions.\n\nIn addition to the direct savings, the real benefits for India might be even higher. Its purchases helped keep global crude prices in check, preventing a spike in the country’s import bill. For a nation that relies on imports for roughly 88% of its oil, the indirect effect of stabilizing global markets likely outweighs the reduced discounts.\n\nBuying Russian oil boosted India’s exports. India has emerged as a leading supplier of diesel to Ukraine this year, providing some 10% of total diesel deliveries. Just a year earlier, it accounted for barely 1% of the country’s imports. Between January and August, Ukraine imported 451,000 tons of diesel from India, worth approximately $333 million.\n\nThe timing for the increase has been crucial. In 2025, India reopened Red Sea shipping routes previously blocked by Yemen’s Houthis. This move has allowed Indian diesel to reach Ukraine more efficiently and compete with other sellers.\n\nThe surge, however, might not last long. Major Ukrainian fuel distributors such as WOG and OKKO have refused to import Indian diesel, citing concerns that much of it is made from Russian crude. “We clearly understand that diesel from India is produced from Russian oil, and this is unacceptable for us,” WOG told Forbes Ukraine on September 3. European sanctions could further complicate matters: the EU’s 18th package of sanctions, taking effect next January, bans imports of petroleum products made from Russian oil in third countries.\n\nGot a tip?

In a report, the utility company said it detected a “fault” on one of its transmission lines around the time that the Eaton Fire started.\n\nBut an investigation into the origins of the fire is still ongoing, and the company said it had “not conclusively determined” its equipment was to blame.\n\nStill, federal prosecutors argued there was enough material to proceed with a lawsuit. They are seeking $40m in damages for federal, state and local governments.\n\n“There’s no reason to wait,” Essayli said. “We believe that the evidence is clear that Edison is at fault, and by their own admissions, no one else is at fault.”\n\nThe second lawsuit, about the Fairview Fire, alleges that a swinging power cable made contact with a messenger cable and sparked flames that went on to burn through the San Bernardino National Forest in Riverside County.\n\nEdison spokesperson Jeff Monford has said that the utility is looking at the lawsuits.\n\n“We continue our work to reduce the likelihood of our equipment starting a wildfire,” Monford said. “Southern California Edison is committed to wildfire mitigation through grid hardening, situational awareness and enhanced operational practices.”\n\nWhile numerous factors contribute to the spread and destructiveness of a wildfire, errors by utility companies have been the cause of deadly fires in California, prompting some to call for state authorities to take greater control over utilities.\n\nIn June 2020, the energy utility PG&E pleaded guilty to dozens of manslaughter charges related to the 2018 Camp Fire, which was started due to faulty equipment that the company had failed to maintain in defiance of state regulations. The 2018 fire was the deadliest in state history, with 85 people killed.\n\nA grand jury report at the time stated that the company had ignored warning signs and had shown “a callous disregard” for human life.","summary":"The Department of Justice alleges that negligence by Southern California Edison sparked deadly Eaton Fire in January.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/4/us-files-lawsuit-against-california-utility-over-los-angeles-wildfires?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25013150590906-1736775280.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:42:55","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.728},{"id":357486124,"title":"Trump signs order to lower US tariffs on Japan autos to 15%","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday (Sep 4) to implement lower tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products that were announced in July.\n\nThe lower tariffs on autos are set to take effect seven days after publication of the order.

LIEB\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri residents denounced a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts on Thursday as Republican lawmakers pressed ahead with President Donald Trump’s strategy to bolster Republicans in next year’s congressional elections.\n\nDozens of people turned out for the first public hearing on a plan that would split up a Kansas City congressional district to give Republicans a shot at winning seven of Missouri’s eight U.S. House seats. Republicans already hold six of those seats.\n\n“Kansas City does not want to be divided. We deserve representation and a voice,” said Kristen Ellis Johnson, an attorney from Kansas City who came to the Capitol with her husband and daughter. “You are dividing the urban-dwelling, liberal-leaning population to purposely change those votes.”\n\nMissouri is the third state to join an emerging national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking advantage in the way U.S. House districts are drawn.\n\nAt Trump’s prodding, Texas redrew its U.S. House districts last month to give Republicans a chance at winning five additional seats. California countered with its own revised map aimed at giving Democrats a shot at winning five more U.S. House seats. The California plan still needs voter approval in November.\n\nThe stakes are high because, nationally, Democrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House. And, historically, the party of the president usually loses congressional seats in midterm elections, as happened during Trump’s first term in office.\n\nKansas City district would be merged with rural areas\n\nMissouri’s revised congressional map, as proposed by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, would target a seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by stretching it from Kansas City eastward to encompass rural Republican-leaning areas.\n\nWhile lawmakers heard public criticism in Jefferson City, some opponents held a press conference in Kansas City near the point where three of the newly proposed districts would intersect. Edgar Palacios, president and CEO of the Latinx Education Collaborative, wore black to the event to decry the redistricting proposal.\n\n“It feels like that, we are at a funeral — a funeral for democracy in Missouri,” Palacios said. “This gerrymander runs directly against everything we fight for. It says loud and clear, `Your voice, your community, your vote does not matter.’”\n\nAshley Sadowski, a mother whose 7- and 11-year-olds are students in Kansas City Public Schools, said the proposed map could have repercussions beyond who wins elections.\n\n“This means that I would drive from my home in one congressional district to my son’s middle school in another congressional district,” she said. “This does not make sense.”\n\n“Politicians are denying our children the unified voice they deserve in D.C,” Sadowski added.\n\nAt the legislative hearing, lobbyist Shannon Cooper said Kansas City government opposes the revised map because having a single person represent most of the city in the U.S. House has helped bring federal jobs and projects to the region.\n\nSome rural residents also said they didn’t want to be combined into the same district as Kansas City.\n\n“If they do that, people in Kansas City will not get their needs met in Congress. It totally dilutes their vote,” Glenda Bainbridge, a resident from rural Odessa, told The Associated Press as she waited her turn to testify against the bill.\n\nOnly one person spoke in favor of the new map at the hearing. A leader for Missouri Right to Life said the revised districts could help send another anti-abortion lawmaker to Washington, D.C.\n\nMissouri redistricting process facing legal challenge\n\nState Rep. Dirk Deaton, who’s sponsoring the redistricting legislation, said the proposed map would split fewer counties and cities among multiple districts than the current congressional districts.\n\n“It is an improvement. It is a reform of our current congressional map,” Deaton said.\n\nHe didn’t publicly disclose demographic data showing the racial makeup of the newly proposed districts. The Republican lawmaker said he didn’t have data on the estimated partisan composition of voters.\n\nState Rep. Mark Sharp, of Kansas City, the ranking Democrat on the redistricting committee, denounced the plan as a “morally corrupt” attempt to push Cleaver “into an early retirement.”\n\nCleaver has said he would challenge the new map in court if it passes.\n\nThe Missouri NAACP has already filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to halt the special session. It argues that Kehoe’s call for a special session is unconstitutional because no extraordinary circumstance exists to justify it.

LIEB\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri residents denounced a plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts on Thursday as Republican lawmakers pressed ahead with President Donald Trump’s strategy to bolster Republicans in next year’s congressional elections.\n\nDozens of people turned out for the first public hearing on a plan that would split up a Kansas City congressional district to give Republicans a shot at winning seven of Missouri’s eight U.S. House seats. Republicans already hold six of those seats.\n\n“Kansas City does not want to be divided. We deserve representation and a voice,” said Kristen Ellis Johnson, an attorney from Kansas City who came to the Capitol with her husband and daughter. “You are dividing the urban-dwelling, liberal-leaning population to purposely change those votes.”\n\nMissouri is the third state to join an emerging national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking advantage in the way U.S. House districts are drawn.\n\nAt Trump’s prodding, Texas redrew its U.S. House districts last month to give Republicans a chance at winning five additional seats. California countered with its own revised map aimed at giving Democrats a shot at winning five more U.S. House seats. The California plan still needs voter approval in November.\n\nThe stakes are high because, nationally, Democrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House. And, historically, the party of the president usually loses congressional seats in midterm elections, as happened during Trump’s first term in office.\n\nKansas City district would be merged with rural areas\n\nMissouri’s revised congressional map, as proposed by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, would target a seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by stretching it from Kansas City eastward to encompass rural Republican-leaning areas.\n\nWhile lawmakers heard public criticism in Jefferson City, some opponents held a press conference in Kansas City near the point where three of the newly proposed districts would intersect. Edgar Palacios, president and CEO of the Latinx Education Collaborative, wore black to the event to decry the redistricting proposal.\n\n“It feels like that, we are at a funeral — a funeral for democracy in Missouri,” Palacios said. “This gerrymander runs directly against everything we fight for. It says loud and clear, `Your voice, your community, your vote does not matter.’”\n\nAshley Sadowski, a mother whose 7- and 11-year-olds are students in Kansas City Public Schools, said the proposed map could have repercussions beyond who wins elections.\n\n“This means that I would drive from my home in one congressional district to my son’s middle school in another congressional district,” she said. “This does not make sense.”\n\n“Politicians are denying our children the unified voice they deserve in D.C,” Sadowski added.\n\nAt the legislative hearing, lobbyist Shannon Cooper said Kansas City government opposes the revised map because having a single person represent most of the city in the U.S. House has helped bring federal jobs and projects to the region.\n\nSome rural residents also said they didn’t want to be combined into the same district as Kansas City.\n\n“If they do that, people in Kansas City will not get their needs met in Congress. It totally dilutes their vote,” Glenda Bainbridge, a resident from rural Odessa, told The Associated Press as she waited her turn to testify against the bill.\n\nOnly one person spoke in favor of the new map at the hearing. A leader for Missouri Right to Life said the revised districts could help send another anti-abortion lawmaker to Washington, D.C.\n\nMissouri redistricting process facing legal challenge\n\nState Rep. Dirk Deaton, who’s sponsoring the redistricting legislation, said the proposed map would split fewer counties and cities among multiple districts than the current congressional districts.\n\n“It is an improvement. It is a reform of our current congressional map,” Deaton said.\n\nHe didn’t publicly disclose demographic data showing the racial makeup of the newly proposed districts. The Republican lawmaker said he didn’t have data on the estimated partisan composition of voters.\n\nState Rep. Mark Sharp, of Kansas City, the ranking Democrat on the redistricting committee, denounced the plan as a “morally corrupt” attempt to push Cleaver “into an early retirement.”\n\nCleaver has said he would challenge the new map in court if it passes.\n\nThe Missouri NAACP has already filed a lawsuit in state court seeking to halt the special session. It argues that Kehoe’s call for a special session is unconstitutional because no extraordinary circumstance exists to justify it. It also asserts that the Missouri Constitution prohibits redrawing congressional districts without new census data or a ruling invalidating the current districts.\n\nUnder Missouri’s current map, only one district has been even moderately competitive. Republican U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner won her suburban St. Louis seat with about 55% of the vote in each of the past two elections. Cleaver won reelection in both 2024 and 2022 with over 60% of the vote, and most of Missouri’s other districts had even larger victory margins.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Heather Hollingsworth and Nicholas Ingram contributed from Kansas City, Missouri.","summary":"Some rural residents said they didn't want to be combined with Kansas City.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/04/election-2026-redistricting-missouri/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Election_2026_Redistricting_41979-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:36:39","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":357487958,"title":"Trump’s promised immigration crackdown in Chicago could last about six weeks, suburban official says","text":"By SOPHIA TAREEN\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — The Trump administration has informed Chicago-area officials that its promised immigration enforcement surge will operate seven days a week for about six weeks, according to the mayor of a suburb that houses an immigration processing center.\n\nBroadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village’s roughly 8,000 residents this week that the Trump administration told village officials that a two-story building used to temporarily hold immigrants before they’re detained or deported will serve as the “primary processing location” for the expected operation.\n\nShe said local leaders were told the operation will run for approximately 45 days, but she didn’t say when it might start.\n\nOfficials in the village just west of Chicago declined to elaborate Thursday, saying they were focused on the safety of residents, police and businesses.\n\n“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,” said LeTisa Jones, the village administrator. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in the Windy City, as he did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.\n\nAlthough details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, local opposition is already widespread and is building in the suburbs. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.\n\nActivists, church groups and schools in the nation’s third-largest city have been preparing for the operation, during which the Department of Homeland Security intends to use a naval station north of Chicago for logistical support.\n\nIn Chicago, organizers postponed a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival scheduled for later this month because of fears in the community about the planned immigration crackdown. They did not set a new date.\n\nIn suburban communities, officials also tried to quell concerns.\n\n“We understand that these developments have created anxiety and uncertainty for many in our community,” read a statement from the city of North Chicago and Lake County. “While these developments may feel unsettling, please know this: you are not alone.”\n\nOthers issued reminders of Illinois’ sanctuary laws, which are among the strongest in the country and generally bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.\n\nDemocratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a frequent critic and target of Trump, visited a school Thursday in Berwyn, a largely Latino suburb of roughly 55,000 people, to assess the impact of the expected operation.\n\nThe Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.\n\nDHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t immediately respond to Thursday requests for comment.","summary":"Chicago is among the latest targets for President Donald Trump’s expanded federal intervention.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/04/trump-chicago-immigration-crackdown/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Chicago_59024.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-04 22:29:34","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.078}]}
