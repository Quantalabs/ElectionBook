Israel launched an aerial bombardment campaign against Iran four days ago.\n\nAt the summit, Trump warned that Tehran needs to curb its nuclear program before it’s “too late.” He said Iranian leaders would “like to talk” but they had already had 60 days to reach an agreement on their nuclear ambitions and failed to do so before the Israeli aerial assault began. “They have to make a deal,” he said.\n\nAsked what it would take for the U.S. to get involved in the conflict militarily, Trump said Monday morning, “I don’t want to talk about that.“\n\nBut by Monday afternoon, Trump warned ominously on social media, “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” Shortly after that, Trump decided to leave the summit and skip a series of Tuesday meetings that would address the ongoing war in Ukraine and global trade issues.\n\nAs Trump posed for a picture Monday evening with the other G7 leaders, he said simply, “I have to be back, very important.”\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the host, said, “I am very grateful for the president’s presence and I fully understand.”\n\nCrises abound\n\nThe sudden departure only heightened the drama of a world that seems on verge of several firestorms. Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There has been little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nBut in a deeper sense, Trump saw a better path in the United States taking solitary action, rather than in building a consensus with the other G7 nations of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held an hourlong informal meeting soon after arriving at the summit late Sunday to discuss the widening conflict in the Mideast, Starmer’s office said.\n\nAnd Merz told reporters that Germany was planning to draw up a final communique proposal on the Israel-Iran conflict that will stress that “Iran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material.”\n\nThe European leaders wanted to help de-escalate the situation, rather than enflame it in ways that could spread through the Middle East in unpredictable ways.\n\nTrump, for his part, said Iran “is not winning this war. And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it’s too late.”\n\nBut by early Monday evening, as he planned to depart Kananaskis and the Canadian Rocky Mountains, Trump seemed willing to push back against his own supporters who believe the U.S. should embrace a more isolationist approach to world affairs. It was a sign of the heightened military, political and economic stakes in a situation evolving faster than the summit could process.\n\n“AMERICA FIRST means many GREAT things, including the fact that, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media platform.\n\nIt’s unclear how much Trump values the perspective of other members of the G7, a group he immediately criticized while meeting with Carney. The U.S. president said it was a mistake to remove Russia from the summit’s membership in 2014 and doing so had destabilized the world. He also suggested he was open to adding China to the G7.\n\nTrump also seemed to put a greater priority on addressing his grievances with other nations’ trade policies. He announced with Starmer that they had signed a trade framework Monday that was previously announced in May, with Trump saying that British trade was “very well protected’ because ”I like them, that’s why. That’s their ultimate protection.”\n\nHigh tension\n\nAs the news media was escorted from the summit’s opening session, Carney could be heard as he turned to Trump and referenced how the U.S. leader’s remarks about the Middle East, Russia and China had already drawn attention to the summit.\n\n“Mr. President, I think you’ve answered a lot of questions already,” Carney said.\n\nThe German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments had each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can help to keep any public drama at a minimum, after the U.S. president in 2018 opposed a joint communique when the G7 summit was last held in Canada.\n\nGoing into the summit, there was no plan for a joint statement this year. The Trump administration appeared disinterested in building a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military.\n\nThe G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers’ meeting to address the oil crisis and evolved into a yearly summit meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems. It briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation.\n\nBeyond Carney and Starmer, Trump had bilateral meetings or pull-aside conversations with Merz, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nHe talked with Macron about “tariffs, the situation in the Near and Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine,” according to Macron spokesperson Jean-Noël Ladois.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump had been scheduled before his departure to meet with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said one of the topics for discussion would be a “defense package” that Ukraine is ready to purchase from the U.S. as part of the ongoing war with Russia, a package whose status might now be uncertain.\n\nTariff talk\n\nThe U.S. president has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.\n\nThe trade framework signed Monday with the United Kingdom included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would largely remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts.\n\nCanada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump’s first term.\n\nMerz said of trade talks that “there will be no solution at this summit, but we could perhaps come closer to a solution in small steps.”\n\nCarney’s office said after the Canadian premier met with Trump on trade that “the leaders agreed to pursue negotiations toward a deal within the coming 30 days.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Over the weekend, a panel on MSNBC discussed the recent wave of political violence over the past decade, ranging from the shooting at the congressional Republicans' baseball practice and the attempts on Donald Trump’s life to the more recent murders of two Israeli Embassy workers and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The panel's conversation was spurred by the killing of former Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as the related shootings of State Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. The suspect in these attacks is Vance Luther Boelter, who was captured after a two-day manhunt, and has since been charged with two counts of stalking, two counts of murder and two counts of firearm-related crimes in federal court. During the panel, Mohyeldin turned to former New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and asked whether the recent trend of political violence can be blamed on the system for failing to hear voters' concerns. SOCIAL MEDIA SUPPORT FOR ACCUSED KILLERS LUIGI MANGIONE, ELIAS RODRIGUEZ AN 'EXCEPTIONALLY BAD SIGN': EXPERT \"Do you believe there’s a correlation between how efficiently our democracy and our government runs and the risk of political violence?\" Mohyeldin asked. \"That when people out there who feel a sense of desperation — and by no means is this a justification, but I’m thinking of Luigi Mangione, who killed in cold blood the CEO of a healthcare company — Do you believe when people don’t have any political outlets, when the government or the system is not representative of the will of the people, these lone wolves, these self-radicalized people then resort to this type of violence? Or do you believe this type of violence will always exist in our society, no matter how efficiently our system of governance works?\" \"There has always been, through history, a correlation to the political moment and whether society is serving people or not,\" the former mayor answered, warning that even so, \"there’s never a justification for political violence.\" De Blasio argued that while there have been times of relative peace, \"the '60s was a time of great political violence, these last years as well, where the level of political conflict intensified and, of course, where there were those voices giving a permission structure.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE After citing past examples of violence by both state and non-state actors in the past, the former mayor suggested, \"I think it’s also fair to say that when the public in general feels that society is serving them, when there’s a sense of belonging, when there’s a sense of people being included and respected, it takes the temperature down, it gives less oxygen for fringe elements or violent elements to exist. And I think we can get back there.\" He then suggested that the rise of Trump is at least partially to blame for recent political violence.

These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. That is why they believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role. You don’t hear about Sanctuary Cities in our Heartland!”\n\n“The heartland” just told Trump to stop his draconian immigration enforcement, lest he destroy rural economies, and Trump listened. And who knew about this unholy alliance between immigrant workers and transgender people? Dastardly! \n\nRelated | Why do Republicans hate American cities?\n\nTrump, clearly still butthurt over the embarrassing turnout at his poorly executed, creepy $45 million military-themed birthday parade, is doing what authoritarians always do: lashing out at his enemies. And no one triggers him more than the people living in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York—three cities that hosted massive “No Kings” protest rallies, eclipsing Trump’s grotesque celebration. So he wants ICE to punish them.\n\nBut Trump and ICE have a problem: Sanctuary cities don’t cooperate. Local law enforcement won’t help federal agents. And these cities are in blue states with Democratic governors who despise Trump. As I’ve written before, federal agencies operating solo simply don’t have the capacity to pull off large-scale raids.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol only has 20,000 agents, 17,000 of whom patrol the border (that isn’t about to stop, is it?). And as the CNN article cites, Homan said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has only 6,000 officers—not nearly enough to deport millions of people. \nAs Trump’s former Border Patrol Commissioner Mark Morgan said in an interview with Stateline, “It’s not going to be successful, as long as we have sanctuary cities and states that refuse to allow local and state police departments to work with ICE.” \n\nSo here’s the pickle: If Trump targets areas where he can rack up arrest stats—like Republican farm country—he guts the GOP’s agricultural base. But if he sticks to terrorizing sanctuary cities, he faces a hostile, organized citizenry that increasingly knows how to block ICE. Community watch groups and mobile alerts now routinely warn immigrants when raids are coming, slowing federal agents struggling to meet quotas to a crawl.\n\nYes, Trump and his masked ICE goons (the bad guys always hide their faces) can spread fear. But practically speaking? The federal government simply doesn’t have the boots on the ground to make a meaningful dent in the undocumented population of sanctuary cities.\n\nThe right can rant and rage about it all they want—but sanctuary cities are built to resist.","summary":"On Sunday, just two days after President Donald Trump pulled another TACO twist on immigration raids by suspending enforcement at farms, hotels, and restaurants, he rage-posted on his Truth Social site, demanding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers ramp up deportations in America’s sanctuary cities.\n\n\n\n\nA protester yells at California National Guard members protecting a federal building in Downtown Los Angeles on June 9.\n\n\n“[W]e must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” he wrote. “These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens.

For one thing it could spark a wider conflict in the region that could be difficult to handle and wrap up in a short span of time.\n\nFor another, the US through the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history going beyond the Cold War years to know what “regime change” could at times result in: something worse than what had just been disposed. And the neighbourhood of Latin America is a good example.\n\nThe lightening strikes against Iran of June 13 by Israel now seems to have had more than the single objective of ridding nuclear and missile sites. The deadly blows also took out the top echelons of the military leadership and that of the Revolutionary Guards Corps. And now word comes that Washington asked Tel Aviv not to personally target Ayatollah Khamenei after being informed of a “credible” plan to that effect.\n\nIsraeli officials called the reports to kill the Iranian leader “fake”; and Netanyahu maintained that regime change “could certainly be the result of the conflict” as the regime is “very weak”.\n\nAborted N-deal\n\nIt is not just an expanded conflict in the Middle East that US President Donald Trump is worried about in cautioning Netanyahu from going after Ayatollah Khamenei. Trump has invested a lot of time and political capital in getting a nuclear deal with Teheran, something said to be different than the one he walked out of in his first term. Washington and Teheran have been at it for several rounds and there is a big question mark if Iran would want to continue. Some reports have indicated that Iran sees the Trump administration as being complicit in the Israeli offensive.\n\nNetanyahu’s pointer that the regime in Teheran is “very weak” might not quite be valid as far as internal political stability is concerned; the country may be weakened as a result of developments in the region. Without a doubt Iran has been dented by a loss of its proxies in the Hamas in the Gaza and the Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nA bigger blow came by way of Bashar al Assad fleeing Damascus depriving Iran of one its last strongholds. A reported debt of some $30 billion has also added to its economic woes.\n\nThe Israeli leadership cannot be under the impression that physically eliminating Ayatollah Khamenei — who is already said to be in frail health — could lead to regime change. Or, that the obliteration of nuclear and missile sites will engineer a popular movement strong enough to oust the clergy that has been in power since the overthrow of the Shah in 1979.\n\nFor all the civil rumblings over the last few years and in the occasional statements from leaders in exile, opposition to the existing regime has not been strong enough to serve as a rallying point of displeasure against the current goings on. The missile barrage against the Jewish state is a visible attempt by the regime in Iran to showcase its resolve to its people.\n\nIf the last 40-odd years is anything to go by in Iran, it is that hardliners in the clergy have had their sway for the most part. Hence a calculation that ridding Ayatollah Khamenei might bring about a “different” regime could be misplaced. Given that Israel has for long been the central rallying point, it is unlikely that Netanyahu is going to find a group of politicians in Teheran who will voluntarily dismantle their nuclear plants and missile sites or stop calling for the extermination of the Jewish state. To put an old adage differently: Even if things change, they will remain the same.\n\nThe writer is a senior journalist who has reported from Washington DC on North America and United Nations\n\nPublished on June 17, 2025","summary":"The Iranian regime is weakened by loss of allies in West Asia.

He also said he is in daily touch with U.S. President Donald Trump, who posted an ominous message on his social media site later Monday calling for the immediate evacuation of Tehran.\n\nIsrael had warned hundreds of thousands of people in the middle of the Iranian capital to evacuate ahead of the strike against the TV station, which the military said provided a cover for Iranian military operations.\n\nThat warning came on the fourth day of the conflict, when the Israeli military claimed it had achieved air superiority above the Iranian capital and could fly over the city without facing major threats.\n\nTrump posted his own message while in Canada attending the G7 summit. He has repeatedly said — and said more than once during the day — that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon. He emphasized that again in his post, writing “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,” adding that Iran should have signed the “deal” he told it to sign to prevent what he said was “a shame, and waste of human life,” referring to Israel’s attack last week.\n\nTrump ended the post with, “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on social media shortly after Trump’s post that he was departing the summit on Monday night, leaving for Washington a day early due to the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nTehran is home to around 9.5 million people. Earlier Monday, Israel’s military issued an evacuation warning affecting up to 330,000 people in a part of central Tehran that includes the country’s state TV and police headquarters, as well as three large hospitals, including one owned by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Israel’s military has issued similar evacuation warnings for civilians in parts of Gaza and Lebanon ahead of strikes.\n\nState-run television abruptly stopped a live broadcast after the station was hit, according to Iran’s state-run news agency.\n\nWhile on the air, an Iranian state television reporter said the studio was filling with dust after “the sound of aggression against the homeland.” Suddenly, an explosion occurred, cutting the screen behind her as she hurried off camera.\n\nThe broadcast quickly switched to prerecorded programs. The station later said its building was hit by four bombs.\n\nAn anchor said on air that a few colleagues had been hurt, but their families should not be worried. The network said its live programs were transferred to another studio.\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said his country’s forces had “achieved full aerial superiority over Tehran’s skies.”\n\nThe military said it destroyed more than 120 surface-to-surface missile launchers in central Iran, a third of Iran’s total, as well as two F-14 planes that Iran used to target Israeli aircraft and multiple launchers just before they launched ballistic missiles towards Israel.\n\nIsraeli military officials also said fighter jets had struck 10 command centers in Tehran belonging to Iran’s Quds Force, an elite arm of its Revolutionary Guard that conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran.\n\nThe Israeli strikes “amount to a deep and comprehensive blow to the Iranian threat,” Defrin said.\n\nElsewhere, three drones struck South Pars, Iran’s main gas production center, according to Iranian state news. The report did not specify the extent of the damage.\n\nIran, meanwhile, announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for the sweeping attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure that have killed at least 224 people in the country since Friday.\n\nSo far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 injured, Israeli officials said, after Iran launched more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones.\n\nOne missile fell near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, with its blast waves causing minor damage, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said on X. He added that no American personnel were injured.\n\nThe latest conflict began when Israel launched an assault on Iran’s top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists that it said was necessary to prevent its longtime adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon.\n\nIran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not pursued a nuclear weapon since 2003. But the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned that the country has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs if it chooses to do so.\n\nIran has retaliated by firing waves of ballistic missiles at Israel. The back-and-forth has raised concerns about all-out war between the countries and propelled the region, already on edge, into even greater upheaval.\n\nPowerful explosions rocked Tel Aviv shortly before dawn Monday, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky over the coastal city.\n\nAuthorities in the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva said Iranian missiles hit a residential building there, charring concrete walls, shattering windows and ripping the walls off multiple apartments.\n\nIranian missiles also hit an oil refinery in the northern city of Haifa for the second night in a row. The early morning strike killed three workers, ignited a significant fire and damaged a building, Israel’s fire and rescue services said. The workers were sheltering in the building’s safe room when the impact caused a stairwell to collapse, trapping them inside.\n\nFirefighters rushed to extinguish the fire and rescue them, but the three died before rescuers could reach them.\n\nThe Israeli Magen David Adom emergency service also reported that five people were killed in the strikes in central Israel.\n\nPetah Tikva resident Yoram Suki rushed with his family to a shelter after hearing an air-raid alert. They emerged after it was over to find his apartment destroyed.\n\nDespite losing his home, he urged Netanyahu to keep up the attacks on Iran.\n\n“It’s totally worth it,” the 60-year-old said. “This is for the sake of our children and grandchildren.”\n\nIn addition to those killed, the emergency service said paramedics evacuated another 87 wounded people to hospitals, while rescuers were still searching for residents trapped beneath the rubble of their homes.\n\n“When we arrived at the scene of the rocket strike, we saw massive destruction,” said Dr. Gal Rosen, a paramedic with the service who said he rescued a 4-day-old baby as fires blazed from the building.\n\nIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, appeared to make a veiled outreach Monday for the U.S. to step in and negotiate an end to hostilities between Israel and Iran.\n\nIn a post on X, Araghchi wrote that if Trump is “genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential.”\n\n“It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu,” Iran’s top diplomat wrote. “That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.”\n\nThe message to Washington was sent as the latest talks between the U.S. and Iran were canceled over the weekend after Israel targeted key military and political officials in Tehran.\n\nOn Sunday, Araghchi said that Iran will stop its strikes if Israel does the same. But after a day of intensive Israeli aerial attacks that extended targets beyond military installations, the Revolutionary Guard struck a hard line on Monday, vowing that further rounds of strikes would be “more forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.”\n\nHealth authorities reported that 1,277 people were wounded in Iran. Iranians also reported fuel rationing.\n\nRights groups such as the Washington-based Iranian advocacy group Human Rights Activists have suggested that the Iranian government’s death toll is a significant undercount. The group says it has documented more than 400 people killed, among them 197 civilians.\n\nAhead of Israel’s initial attack, its Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran. Since then, Iran has reportedly detained several people and hanged one on suspicion of espionage.\n\nAssociated Press writers Amir Vahdat and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran; Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv; Isaac Scharf and Julia Frankel in Jerusalem; Isabel DeBre in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Farnoush Amiri in New York; Darlene Superville in Washington and David Rising in Bangkok contributed to this report.","summary":"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes have set Iran’s nuclear program back a “very, very long time.”\n\n\nThe post Israel strikes state-run Iranian TV during live broadcast while Trump issues warning to Tehran appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/world-news/2025/06/16/israel-strikes-state-run-iranian-tv-during-live-broadcast-while-trump-issues-warning-to-tehran/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Israel_Iran_Mideast_Wars_51599-6850bcf7e6b88-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:58:57","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":332117564,"title":"Israel-Iran conflict live: Trump tells Tehran to ‘evacuate’ as Macron says US president has made ceasefire ‘offer’","text":"From 20m agoDonald Trump has said “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” hours after Israel issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran on Monday.“Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign.

Trump will be leaving the G7 Summit in Canada early.There are few other details available.US defence ministry spokespeople have denied reports online that the US has joined attacks on Iran. “This is not true”, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell wrote on X in response to one such post. In another, he wrote:\n American Forces are maintaining their defensive posture & that has not changed. We will protect American troops & our interests.\nHours before Trump’s post about evacuating Tehran, US defence secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed that he had ordered the deployment of “additional capabilities” to the Middle East.Hegseth did not disclose what military capabilities he sent to the region. But Reuters was the first to report earlier on Monday a deployment of a large number of US military refueling aircraft and the movement of an aircraft carrier to the Middle East.In a post on social media Hegseth wrote:\n Protecting US forces is our top priority and these deployments are intended to enhance our defensive posture in the region.\nMoments after Donald Trump’s social media post telling Tehran’s 9 million residents to evacuate, the White House announced he was leaving the G7 leaders summit in Canada early citing the situation in the Middle East.“Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X.Trump was originally supposed to arrive back in the US in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to people familiar with the matter.Donald Trump has said “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” hours after Israel issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran on Monday.“Iran should have signed the “deal” I told them to sign.

An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions,” Macron told reporters at the G7.\n “We have to see now whether the sides will follow.”Macron’s remark came only an hour after Trump issued his evacuation warning, adding in a post on his social media platform Truth Social “Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life.”Moments later the White House announced Trump was leaving the G7 leaders meeting in Canada early, citing the situation in the Middle East.Washington and Tehran had been in the midst of nuclear negotiations when Israel launched its shock attack on Iran on Friday. Trump’s comments came hours after Israel issued an evacuation order to residents of a large part of Tehran.Iran and Israel have exchanged waves of missiles since Friday. Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Israel says 24 people have been killed, all of them civilians.In other developments:\n\n Israel indicated that its attacks on Iran are unfinished, and that it would not rule out targeting the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in interviews with US media today. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Associated Press that Israeli strikes have set Iran’s nuclear program back a “very, very long time” and he would “not be surprised” if the attacks toppled the Iranian government. Speaking on ABC News, Netanyahu added that killing Khamenei would not “escalate the conflict” but rather “end it.” On social media, Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar wrote that he had told the European Union’s foreign minister Kaja Kallas that its military operation in Iran was unfinished and that “Israel will act to complete it.”\n\n Meanwhile, Iran said its counter-attacks on Israel were self-defense and appealed to Gulf State leaders for aid asking Donald Trump to help negotiate a ceasefire with Israel. Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations told the body’s Security Council that its strikes on Israel are “proportionate defensive operations directed exclusively at military objectives and associated infrastructure”, Reuters reports. Iranian officials have also asked the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to mediate discussions with the United States, Reuters reports.\n\n The United States has relocated refueling aircraft to Europe in order to give Donald Trump military options as hostilities escalate between Iran and Israel, Reuters reports. Reuters and the New York Times also report that the USS Nimitz, an aircraft carrrier, is en route to the Middle East as part of a planned deployment. The news comes even as US senator Tim Kaine introduced legislation to restrict Donald Trump’s war powers.\n\n Group of Seven leaders drafted a joint statement calling for de-escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict, according to two sources and a draft seen by Reuters. The draft commits to safeguarding market stability, including energy markets, and says Israel has the right to defend itself. Donald Trump does not intend to sign the statement, CBS News reports, citing unnamed US officials.\n\n European countries have begun evacuating their citizens from Israel. Germany will evacuate its citizens via Jordan’s capital Amman, with a charter flight scheduled for Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK is establishing a system for UK nationals to register their presence in Israel.\n\n Russia believes Iran is exercising its right to defend itself against attack by Israel, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said. Russian news agencies also quoted Ryabkov as saying that Russia was discussing the crisis with the United States as well as maintaining contacts with both Israel and Iran.","summary":"US president will leave G7 summit in Canada early due to situation in the Middle East, White House says; French president says ‘an offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions’\n\n\nIsrael issues Tehran evacuation order as Iran threatens to leave nuclear weapons treaty\n\n“You probably see what I see and I have to be back as soon as I can,” Donald Trump said in an apparent nod to the intensifying conflict in the Middle East, when asked why he’s cutting short his G7 trip and heading back to Washington tonight.\n\nPresident Trump has directed national security staff to convene in the situation room, both CNN and Fox News are reporting, citing a White House official.

A good chunk of MAGAworld seems to think otherwise.\n\nAs Iran and Israel trade missile salvos and analysts repeatedly raise the prospect of direct U.S. involvement in the burgeoning conflict, the isolationist wing of Donald Trump’s coalition increasingly seems to be feeling left in the dust.\n\nThey’re beginning to voice their displeasure at that new reality.\n\nOn Monday, two of Trump’s biggest populist conservative backers — Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson — were in Washington. They sat down for a chat on the issue of Israel and Iran, during which Carlson laid out a view he has enunciated before, though with less urgency.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, another vocal Trump ally in Congress, dumped on the prospect of U.S. intervention last week, and again on Monday.\n\n“A full-scale war with Iran, would end, I believe, Trump's presidency, effectively end it,” warned the former Fox host.\n\nHe urged that Trump embrace the kind of tough talk that even the Biden administration, with its much frostier relationship with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, would not say publicly.\n\n“I think this can be stopped,” said Carlson. “But it's going to require a really tough step which is to say to our client state which is to say, 'We love you, we want to help you, we don't think you're acting in your own interest.”\n\n“We're not going to … imperil American national security, the American economy, or America itself on your behalf,” he continued.\n\nThe president did not take kindly to Carlson making his point known publicly.\n\n“I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen,” the president remarked to reporters on the sidelines of the G7 in Canada.\n\nHe followed up in a Truth Social post Monday evening: “Somebody please expain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, “IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.”\n\nCarlson’s ideological and personal differences with Trump aside, from a strategic point of view he’s likely correct that the direct involvement of U.S. armed forces in a war with Iran would sap a great deal of whatever political capital the administration can spend before the midterms — a worrying prospect for Republicans who are still trying to pass a major package of tax cut extensions and border security funding through the congressional budget reconciliation process.\n\nCombined with a possible Democratic takeover of Congress at the end of 2026, the Iran conflict could end up impeding Trump’s domestic agenda.\n\nThe president surprised many in his coalition last week when he announced that the U.S. was supporting the Israeli military operation aimed at targeting key officials and facilities related to Iran’s nuclear weapons program and military command structure. Trump had previously confirmed that he urged Israel not to take such action to avoid blowing up negotiations taking place between Washington and Tehran.\n\nReports suggested that the president’s shift in posture came after the administration concluded that the Iranian nuclear weapons program was active.\n\nBut Fox News and other journalists have pushed for evidence to back up that assertion, given that Trump’s intelligence director testified to Congress earlier this year that the program was not active. Israeli officials and their U.S. counterparts have not released any evidence to support the claim that the program was resumed or remained active over the past two decades.\n\nAn Iranian dissident group, the NCRI/MEK, claimed at a news briefing last week to have determined otherwise and laid out what the group said its sources inside Iran identified as facilities key to weapons development programs.\n\nMeanwhile, there are signs that the administration’s sudden shift towards an interventionist foreign policy is isolating more than just the hardcore MAGA populists aligned with the president.\n\nOpposition to U.S. involvement seems to be quickly seeping through other parts of the 2024 Trump coalition. Dave Smith, a comic with a cult following among America’s capital-L Libertarians, apologized on camera for his support of the president in the last election during an interview Monday on Breaking Points, a favorite political podcast/newscast for left and right anti-establishment types.\n\nAnd Tim Dillon, another comic who, like Smith, has appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience, unleashed a rant of his own this weekend in response to Kemi Badenoch’s statement of support for Israel’s “proxy war” against Tehran and other targets.\n\n“This is the craziest sh*t I've ever heard,” Dillon said on his own podcast. “What is she talking about?”\n\n“Is Iran the reason that no one can afford a house? Is Iran the reason that there's fentanyl everywhere?” Dillon asked.\n\nIt remains to be seen if U.S. support for the Israeli war effort will evolve further. A U.S. carrier group, the USS Nimitz strike group, was headed to the Middle East “ahead of schedule”, Fox News reported on Monday.\n\nIt seems almost implausible, given Trump’s record with his subordinates and various allies, that the U.S. president would allow Israel’s prime minister to endanger his second-term agenda in such a way. But the dissolution of U.S. negotiations with Iran could also force him into a corner if de-escalation isn’t achieved and Iran begins targeting U.S. forces in retaliation.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/maga-no-more-wars-wing-234104583.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2af6d36dc88af65afbab2587a9418d69","video":"","publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:56:34","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":332118538,"title":"World News | Trump to Exit G7 Summit Early Citing Middle East Tensions, Confirms White House","text":"Kananaskis [Canada], June 17 (ANI): President Donald Trump is expected to depart the G7 Summit early and return to Washington tonight, CNN reported.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on social media about the president's plan to cut short his attendance at the summit in Kananaskis, Canada.\nAlso Read | Israel-Palestine War: UN Rights Chief Volker Turk Urges Governments To 'Wake Up' to 'Horrifying' Suffering in Gaza.\n\"President Trump had a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Soon before the White House announced his early departure, Trump posted on Truth Social that \"Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\" as the conflict between Iran and Israel escalates.\nAlso Read | Why Israel’s Attacks Aim to Cripple Iran’s Energy Sector.\nAmid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) urged civilians to \"immediately evacuate Tehran,\" shortly after which the White House announced he would be departing the G7 summit early to \"attend to many important matters.\"\nIn a series of posts on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump strongly reiterated his long-held stance on Iran's nuclear ambitions, warning of serious consequences.\n\"Iran should have signed the 'deal' I told them to sign. What a shame, and waste of human life. Simply stated, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. I said it over and over again!\" Trump wrote, urging immediate action as tensions rise. \"Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\" he added.\nIn a follow-up post, Trump tied his firm stance on Iran's nuclear program to his broader political message, stating, \"AMERICA FIRST means many GREAT things, including the fact that, IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\nIsrael has been conducting strikes in Tehran since Thursday night, but the US has so far declined to join the operation. Shortly after Trump's post, Iranian media reported explosions and heavy air defense fire in Tehran. It's unclear if there was any relation between Trump's post and that attack.\nTehran is home to around 10 million people, with around 17 million in the metropolitan area. Trump's evacuation warning came around 2 am local time. The Israeli military has said it has complete control of the skies over Tehran.\nIt signaled Monday that it's expanding its targets beyond strictly military or nuclear sites, including by bombing Iranian state TV.\nIsrael issued several evacuation orders for civilians in Tehran, in areas where hundreds of thousands of people live. One of those evacuation orders focused on the neighborhood where Iran's state TV is located.\nIt's not clear how many civilians have managed to evacuate, or whether such a mass exodus is even possible on such a short timetable.\nLess than two hours before his Truth Social post, Trump said at the G7 summit in Canada that the U.S. was talking to the Iranians by phone and even suggested it will be \"better to talk in person.\"\nTrump expressed hope that Iran would make a deal. \"I think a deal will be signed. I think Iran is foolish not to sign one,\" he said.\nIran has called on the United States to intervene and help bring an end to the aerial attacks, which have escalated over the past few days.Earlier in the day, Trump said a diplomatic deal with Iran to end the conflict could happen soon after he leaves the G7 summit.\n\"I think Iran is basically at the negotiating table and wants to make a deal. As soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something,\" he said at the summit. The summit had already generated a degree of division in the few hours Trump attended. He signaled his intention to not sign a joint statement drafted by G7 leaders calling for de-escalation between Israel and Iran, according to a person familiar with the matter, though officials preparing the document held out hope that he could eventually be convinced to add his name, reported CNN.\nThe G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies has been marked by a significant divide between US President Donald Trump and his counterparts over a joint statement on the Middle East. Trump has declined to sign the statement, which affirms Israel's right to defend itself and opposes Iran's nuclear ambitions.\nTrump believes Iran wants to de-escalate the conflict and is open to talks. He issued a two-month ultimatum to Iran this spring, and on the 61st day, Israel launched strikes on Iran's nuclear program and military leaders, reported CNN.\nEuropean leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, had been working to finalize a consensus on the Middle East situation. However, Trump's veto would prevent a show of unity among the G7 leaders.

Gathering with other leaders for a customary photo ahead of dinner Monday, the president added, “You probably see what I see and I have to be back as soon as I can.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt informed reporters late Monday that Trump would be returning to Washington after participating in the G7 “family photo” with other world leaders, with his early departure allowing him to “attend to many important matters.” The president had been expected to remain at the conference through Tuesday.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Leavitt said Trump would depart following a dinner with his fellow G7 heads of state and government, attributing the move to “what’s going on in the Middle East.”\n\nTrump said he thought the group had \"got a lot done\" in the time he attended the G7. \"I wish I could stay for tomorrow, but they understand,” he said.\n\nCanada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, in response to a question on whether he'd been briefed on why Trump was leaving, said he was \"very grateful for the president's presence,” and “I fully understand.”\n\nLeavitt’s announcement came approximately one hour after the president took to his Truth Social platform to complain that Iranian leaders had not “signed the ‘deal’” Trump had “told them to sign” as part of talks held over the last few months over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nHe called the situation “a shame” and “a waste of a human life” and reiterated the longtime American position that Tehran “CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.”\n\n“I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” Trump added.\n\nThe president’s warning to Tehran residents comes amid questions over whether the United States would join Israel’s days-old effort to cripple the Iranian nuclear program by destroying nuclear sites, targeting scientists for assassination, and taking out military leaders and much of Iran’s military capabilities.\n\nWhile Israeli forces claim to have had significant successes in taking out numerous targets associated with Iranian nuclear weapons research and development, one obstacle that remains is the Fordow enrichment facility, located deep inside a mountain near the city of Qom.\n\nBecause the facility is deep underground, successfully destroying it would require dropping so-called “bunker-buster” munitions into the facility from heavy bomber aircraft. Israeli forces do not possess such weapons, but the United States does.\n\nTrump, who has long boasted of his record in keeping American forces out of what he calls “endless wars” in the Middle East, and has sought to redirect American foreign policy in a more isolationist direction not seen since the period leading up to the Second World War, has thus far maintained that the U.S. is not involved and has not been involved in Israel’s operations against Iran.\n\nBut the American president, who generally appears to dislike multilateral organizations such as the Group of Seven, was also understood to be unwilling to sign on to a G7 statement that would have called for Israel and Iran to de-escalate the days-old conflict.\n\nThe statement was understood to have clearly stated that Israel has the right to self-defense and proclaim that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon, but Trump did not want to add his name to the statement nevertheless. Leaving the summit early will allow him to avoid discussions on that topic, as well as the subject of the three-year-old Russian war against Ukraine.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump told reporters that he believed he could still broker a diplomatic agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear ambitions despite the Israel effort to accomplish the same by force of arms.\n\n“I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table where they want to make a deal, and as soon as I leave here, we’re going to be doing something,” he said.\n\nStefan Kornelius, a spokesperson for the German government, told reporters gathered at the summit site earlier in the day that the ball was in the Americans’ court on the matter of a G7 statement.\n\n“We’ll see in the end, it’ll be up to the American side to decide whether we’re going to have a G7 statement on the Middle East or not,” he said.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-departs-g7-early-warning-234812334.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2af6d36dc88af65afbab2587a9418d69","video":"","publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:56:12","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":332117582,"title":"Is THIS the world's most stubborn homeowner?

Email: sophia.stanford@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SOPHIA STANFORD \n Published:01:38 BST, 17 June 2025 |Updated:01:56 BST, 17 June 2025 \n\nA stubborn homeowner has defied property developers who demolished his neighbours' houses - by refusing to budge and building his own 10-storey tower.\nMost of Chen Tianming's village in Guizhou province, southwestern China, was razed in 2018 to build a lucrative tourist resort.\nBut the 42-year-old refused to leave and, after the project faltered, ignored a flurry of demolition notices to build his family's humble stone bungalow higher and higher.\nThe higher floors where he sleeps sway in the wind and dozens of ropes and cables tether the house to the ground as if the whole thing might one day float away. \nBuilt with faded ply-boards and contorted beams, the teetering structure is a monument to one man's stubbornness. \nHe now presides over a bewildering 10-storey, pyramid-shaped warren of rickety staircases, balconies and other add-ons, drawing comparisons in Chinese media to the fantastical creations of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki.\n'I started building out of practicality, trying to renovate and expand our home,' Chen explained while climbing ladders and ducking wooden beams in his labyrinthine construction.\n'But then it became more of an interest and hobby that I enjoyed,' he said.\n\nA stubborn homeowner has defied property developers who have demolished his neighbours' houses - by building his own 10-storey tower\n\nChen Tianming's village in southwestern China was razed in 2018 to build a lucrative tourist resort and instead began building the huge structure after the project faltered\n\nBuilt with faded ply-boards and contorted beams, the teetering structure is a monument to one man's stubbornness\n'People often say it's unsafe and should be demolished... but I'll definitely never let anyone tear it down.'\nLocal authorities once had big plans to build an 800-acre tourist resort - including a theatre and artificial lake - in the region known for its spectacular rice paddies and otherworldly mountain landscapes.\nThey promised to compensate villagers but Chen's parents refused and he vowed to help them protect the home his grandfather had built in the 1980s.\nWhile neighbours moved out and their houses were bulldozed, Chen stayed put, even sleeping alone in the house for two months 'in case [developers] came to knock it down in the night'.\nSix months later, like many development projects in highly indebted Guizhou, the resort was cancelled.\nVirtually alone among the ruined village, Chen was now master of a 'nail house' - a Chinese term for those whose owners dig in and refuse to relocate despite official compensation offers.\nA quirk of China's rampant development and partial private property laws, nail houses sometimes make headlines for delaying money-spinning construction projects or forcing developers to divert roads or build around shabby older homes.\nEven as Chen forged ahead, completing the fifth floor in 2019, the sixth in 2022 and the seventh in 2023, he continued to receive threats of demolition.\n\nThe higher floors where he sleeps sway in the wind and dozens of ropes and cables tether the house to the ground as if the whole thing might one day float away\n\n ‹ Slide me ›\nChina's strangest nail house has been compared to the madcap buildings in Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli masterpieces 'Howl's Moving Castle'\n\n'I started building out of practicality, trying to renovate and expand our home,' Chen explained while climbing ladders and ducking wooden beams in his labyrinthine construction\n\nHe now presides over a bewildering 10-storey, pyramid-shaped warren of rickety staircases, balconies and other add-ons\n\nChen's 'nail house' - a Chinese term for those whose owners dig in and refuse to relocate despite official compensation offers - has drawn national attention\n\nLike many development projects in highly indebted Guizhou, the resort was cancelled after six months of development\nLast August, his home was designated an illegal construction, and he was ordered to destroy everything except the original bungalow within five days.\nHe said he has spent thousands of pounds fighting the notices in court, despite losing several preliminary hearings.\nBut he continues to appeal and the next hearing has been delayed.\n'I'm not worried. Now that there's no one developing the land, there's no need for them to knock the place down,' he said.\nIn recent years, ironically, Chen's house has begun to lure a steady trickle of tourists itself.\nOn Chinese social media, users describe it as China's strangest nail house, likening it to the madcap buildings in Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli masterpieces 'Howl's Moving Castle' and 'Spirited Away'.\n\nIn recent years Chen's house has begun to lure a steady trickle of tourists itself, with one resident saying it could become an official local attraction\n\nWhen dusk falls, Chen illuminates his home with decorative lanterns, and people gather on the nearby dirt road to admire the scene\n\n'People often say it's unsafe and should be demolished... but I'll definitely never let anyone tear it down,' he said\nWhen dusk falls, Chen illuminates his home with decorative lanterns, and people gather on the nearby dirt road to admire the scene.\n'It's beautiful,' local resident He Diezhen said, 'if there are no safety issues, it could become an [official] local landmark'.\nChen said the house makes many visitors remember their whimsical childhood fantasies.\n'[People] dream of building a house for themselves with their own hands... but most can't make it happen,' he said.\n'I not only thought of it, I made it a reality.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nIs THIS the world's most stubborn homeowner?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:46 BST, 17 June 2025 |Updated:01:55 BST, 17 June 2025 \n\nBarbra Streisand admitted that she has no memory if she had slept with a legendary Hollywood lothario in the past. \nThe Funny Girl actress, 83 - who is currently married to fellow actor James Brolin - opened up about the topic during a recent interview with The New Yorker which was published this past weekend. \nThe Oscar winner previously mentioned a brief fling with icon Warren Beatty in her 2023 memoir My Name Is Barbra. \nAnd during her conversation with the outlet, the interviewer brought up the book and her mention of Beatty - who is known for movies such as Dick Tracy as well as Bonnie And Clyde. \n'I know I slept in the bed with him, but I can't remember if we actually had penetration,' Streisand stated. 'I swear to God, I can't. There are certain things I block out.' \nThe interviewer then told Barbra that perhaps Warren 'remembers one way or another' which prompted the star to share how they are still close pals. \n\nBarbra Streisand, 83, admitted that she has no memory if she had slept with a legendary Hollywood lothario in the past; seen in 2017 in NYC\n\n'I know I slept in the bed with him, but I can't remember if we actually had penetration,' Streisand stated. 'I swear to God, I can't. There are certain things I block out'; Barbra and Beatty seen in 2005 \n'But I know we're still friends,' she said. 'Every year on my birthday, he calls me and we have a wonderful talk about our lives, our children, and so forth. \n'So we're still friends. I met him when I was fifteen years old, and he was twenty-one, I think.' \nThe two stars first crossed during the production of A Hatful Of Rain which was being shown in Connecticut. \nIn her 2023 memoir, she first touched on the possibility of having sex with Beatty and had penned, per Entertainment Weekly, 'Warren and I go back a long way (back to summer stock) and there's some water under that bridge.' \nStreisand added, 'Recently, we were on the phone talking politics and who knows what else when he said, \"I remember why we broke up.\"\n'I said, \"When were we together?\" Then I hung up and asked myself, \"Did I sleep with Warren?\" I kind of remember. I guess I did. Probably once.' \nIn the book, The Way We Were actress also recalled when she first met the legendary actor in Connecticut at the Clinton Playhouse. \n'He asked me to cue him on his lines. If that was a come-on, I missed it entirely. He also played the piano. I was impressed.'\n\n'But I know we're still friends,' she said. 'Every year on my birthday, he calls me and we have a wonderful talk about our lives, our children, and so forth'; seen in 2023 in Malibu \n\nIn her 2023 memoir, she first touched on the possibility of having sex with Beatty and had penned, per Entertainment Weekly, 'Warren and I go back a long way (back to summer stock) and there's some water under that bridge'\n\n'He asked me to cue him on his lines. If that was a come-on, I missed it entirely. He also played the piano. I was impressed,' she said; Beatty seen above in Bonnie And Clyde (1967)\nShe continued, 'We used to eat together occasionally and talk about life. He was twenty-one, tall with movie-star looks, and women were already falling at his feet. I was sixteen.' \nBarbra then shared that in Beatty's memory of when they crossed paths - he had made a move on the actress, but she rejected him. \n\n Barbra Streisand gives rare look at her $16.5M Malibu compound \n'In any event, Warren and I became friends for life. He had star quality then and he still has it now. And every time we get together we reminisce about those days.' \nDuring an interview for CBS Sunday Morning with Gayle King, Barbra explained that she didn't want to add details about her past romances in the memoir. \n'Listen, I didn't want to write about any of them!' the performer expressed, which caused King to reply with, 'But you did!'\nThe star then stated that she had been told to do so and explained, 'My editor said, \"You have to leave some blood on the page.\"'\nComedian Kathy Griffin also wrote a book in 2016 titled Celebrity Run-ins and recalled a time when she overheard a conversation taking place between Barbra and Warren, per The Hollywood Reporter. \nShe had been talking to the songstress at a party which Beatty had also been attending and at one point, had made his way over to them. \n\nShe continued, 'We used to eat together occasionally and talk about life. He was twenty-one, tall with movie-star looks, and women were already falling at his feet. I was sixteen'; Warren seen in 1956\nGriffin wrote that Warren had 'asked, \"What's going on at this table?\" I said, \"Barbra's rehashing that story about how you always claim to have hooked up in the back of a car.\" \n'Beatty took the bait. \"I thought we did.\" Barbra started shaking her head. \"Warren, I'm not going to have this fight with you again. We nev-ah hooked up.\"'\nThe actor had responded with, '\"Noooo, Barbra, I think we did. We were coming back from that little club in the Catskills.\"' \nKathy also added, 'I realized these two have probably known each other since the early '60s. He's going waaaaay back, and he's bringing up details like it all happened yesterday.' \nBeatty then told Streisand, '\"There was a time when you got a little handsy in the backseat,\" but the actress continued to eat her meal while adding little \"No, Warren's.\"'\nThe Bugsy actor has been linked to a number of celebrities over the course of his career, such as Joan Collins, Cher, Madonna, Diane Keaton and also Brigitte Bardot. \nWhile talking to AARP The Magazine in 2016, the actor addressed rumors that he had bedded nearly 13,000 women. \n\nDuring an interview for CBS Sunday Morning with Gayle King, Barbra explained that she didn't want to add details about her past romances in the memoir; seen in 2016 in L.A. \n\nWhile talking to AARP The Magazine in 2016, the actor addressed rumors that he had bedded nearly 13,000 women; seen in 2017 in Hollywood \n'Think about it, sleeping with 12,775 people,' Warren stated. 'That would mean not just that there were multiple people a day, but that there was no repetition.'\nIn 1992, Beatty officially tied the knot with actress Annette Bening and the couple share four children. \nStreisand has also been involved in various romances, including with Richard Baskin, Don Johnson, Richard Gere, Liam Neeson, Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight and James Newton Howard. \nShe was previously married to Elliott Gould from 1963 until their divorce was finalized in 1971. \nBarbra later tied the knot once again in 1998 to James Brolin - who is known for his roles in projects such as The Amityville Horror and Burlesque. \n\nBarbra later tied the knot once again in 1998 to James Brolin - who is known for his roles in projects such as The Amityville Horror and Burlesque\nAnd during an interview with People a few months earlier in April, Brolin offered a secret to their nearly 30-year marriage. \n'The best investment we've ever made is our mattress. And don't misunderstand me. We're both lazy. We love to sleep late. We do a lot of our work on the phone, on paper, reading, right next to each other.' \nHe also reflected on taking long walks with his wife and said, 'You learn to take a walk. Both of us, not just me! I just think you gotta say, \"Okay, take a deep breath, take a walk.\"\n'Because animals do the same thing, you know? Humans do it to each other, animals do it to each other.' \nConnecticut\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBarbra Streisand 'can't remember' if she had sex with this legendary Hollywood lothario\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the attacks, saying Iran was on the verge of building a nuclear weapon. Though Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved, American forces did help intercept an Iranian barrage of missiles aimed at Israel.\n\nThe former Fox News personality called Trump “complicit” in Israel’s attacks in his newsletter Friday and said that his involvement could lead to a “all-out war.”\n\nWhen the president was asked for a response to the criticism from his one-time staunch supporter, Trump was quick to push Carlson back down.\n\n“I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,” Trump said. “Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.”\n\nWatch the exchange here:\n\nLater this afternoon, Trump posted to Truth Social, mocking “kooky Tucker Carlson.”\n\nSince being fired from his post at Fox News as the host of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” in 2023, the media personality relaunched his show on X. In 2024 Carlson launched a weekly podcast, “The Tucker Carlson Show.”\n\nThough the controversial, right-wing commentator does not appear on a television network, his podcast averages about 250,000 listens on Spotify per episode. The media personality has over 4 million subscribers on YouTube and averages about 450,000 views per video. \n\nCarlson has not posted a new episode of his show in five days, though he typically releases episodes on Mondays. \n\nEarlier in the day Monday, Carlson appeared on Steve Bannon’s show “War Room” and gave his up-to-date take on the president.\n\n“I actually really love Trump. I think he’s a deeply humane, kind person,” Carlson said. “But I’m really afraid that my country’s going to be further weakened by this. I think we’re gonna see the end of the American empire.”\n\nYou can watch Trump’s response to Carlson in the video above.

Subsequent raids took out senior intelligence officers, according to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIran struck back with fury, unleashing hundreds of missiles - including unstoppable hypersonic weapons - to target Israel's defence ministry, military sites and some residential areas.\n\nNow, as the death toll rises and the risk of a wider regional war grows by the hour, the international community is urging restraint, but not without expressing support for one side or the other - some more vigorously than others. \n\nMany have made their positions clear. The US and Europe have backed Israel's 'right to self-defence', albeit with varying levels of enthusiasm, while Iran's proxy forces and allied militias have issued scathing condemnations of Israel's actions.\n\nBut the conflict has also exposed nations whose self-interest appears to outweigh loyalty to traditional allies.\n\nFor example, Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine has been made possible by enduring support from Tehran, and the two signed a sweeping strategic partnership in January to formalise their military and political alignment.\n\nYet the Kremlin, while denouncing Israel’s assault, has stopped short of backing Iran. Instead, Moscow is manoeuvring to present itself as a regional power broker. \n\nA statement at the weekend reminded Tehran that 'the US is ready to hold another round of talks with Iran on the latter's nuclear programme in Oman' - while Vladimir Putin personally telephoned the White House on Saturday to offer himself as a mediator.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the international reaction as the Middle East’s most powerful foes come to blows - and a look at who stands where. \n\nCondemning Israel \n\nIran has for decades used its so-called Axis of Resistance - a collection of political-military groups funded, armed and backed by Tehran - to expand its influence and advance its interests throughout the Middle East. \n\nUnsurprisingly, each one of these groups has harshly condemned Israel's strikes and pledged its support to its chief backer. \n\nBut only one member of the group - Yemen's Houthi rebel group known as Ansar Allah - has openly committed to striking Israel on Iran's behalf.\n\nThe Houthis have launched intermittent attacks on Israel ever since the Jewish state's declaration of war against Hamas in response to the October 7, 2023 attacks. \n\nThey have also managed to significantly disrupt global shipping by sending missiles, drones and even fast boats to intercept cargo ships in the Red Sea. \n\nA spokesperson for the group on Friday told Newsweek: 'We have been at war for some time with the Zionist enemy entity,' before vowing to continue attacking Israel in the wake of Operation Rising Lion against Iran.\n\nHours later, air raid sirens in Israel blared following the launch of a missile from Yemen which ultimately landed in Hebron - a city in the West Bank under partial Israeli control. \n\nThe other key members of the resistance - Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - issued scathing retorts to Israel's strikes. But neither group volunteered to fight back in solidarity. \n\nThis is a testament to the efficacy of Israel's military operations, which have significantly eroded the capacities of both Hezbollah and Hamas. \n\nHezbollah last year suffered a vital blow as thousands of its members were killed or injured when their communications devices exploded in their hands - the product of a stunning operation by Mossad. \n\nThis, plus a campaign of punishing airstrikes that eliminated senior leadership, including longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah, forced the Lebanese outfit to strike a peace deal with Israel in November. \n\nHamas meanwhile has suffered horrific losses amid the ongoing war in Gaza, with Israel having bombed much of the territory into rubble and killed most of its senior leadership. \n\nThere are a smattering of other Shia Islamist militias, including the likes of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) and Ka'taib Hezbollah, that are supporters of the Islamic Republic and would likely fight on behalf of Tehran in event of an all-out war. \n\nBut it is believed their leaders have been warned by Iraq's central government to avoid getting involved in the conflict. \n\nBesides these groups, much of the Arab world has publicly denounced Israel's attacks on Iran. \n\nSaudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman - the nation that this weekend was set to host more talks between US and Iranian negotiators until their cancellation amid Operation Rising Lion - have roundly objected to Israel's aggression. \n\nBut the support of these countries for Tehran is unlikely to extend beyond words given their relationships with the United States and their desire to expand their own influence in the region.\n\nBesides Bahrain, all of the aforementioned countries are also majority Sunni Muslim, split across sectarian lines from Iran's Shia majority population.\n\nThe position of Russia, whose President Putin is evidently keen to inextricably insert himself into Israel and Iran's affairs, is tied closely to its war in Ukraine. \n\nNot only does the conflict between Tehran and Jerusalem distract from the Russian armed forces' incessant assault of Ukraine's territory, but a successful resolution of the Israel-Iran hostilities thanks to Russian mediation would be hugely beneficial for Moscow's profile on the world stage.\n\nIt would also likely earn Putin a significant amount of good grace from his American counterpart for ongoing ceasefire negotiations in Ukraine. \n\nOther key international players to have condemned Israel's attacks are China, Turkey Brazil and South Africa. \n\nIn a disquieting development, nuclear-armed Pakistan not only harshly criticised Israel's strikes but warned that it would deploy its thermonuclear weapons against the Jewish state should the Israeli military use any of its own nuclear devices on Tehran. \n\nMeanwhile, the fall of former Syrian President and close ally of Iran Bashar al-Assad has dramatically weakened Iran's regional support base. \n\nUnder the leadership of Sunni Islamist group HTS, Syria severed ties with Iran and is now seemingly committed to preventing the flow of funds and arms from Tehran to Hezbollah in Lebanon. \n\nCondemning Iran \n\nIsrael is thus far going it alone in its assault on its arch nemesis, with no country openly taking part in attacking Iran on its behalf. \n\nBut it has a slew of powerful enemies that have expressed support for Israel's right to self-defence. \n\nOthers have generally warned against an escalation in the conflict but have not condemned Israel's actions - and all are quietly thankful for Operation Rising Lion amid fears Iran was closing in on developing nuclear weapons. \n\nChief among Israel's supporters is the United States. \n\nPresident Donald Trump had for months cautioned Israel against attacking Iran as he attempted to negotiate with the Islamic Republic, offering sanctions relief in exchange for Tehran abandoning its nuclear enrichment programme.\n\nBut in the days before the launch of Operation Rising Lion, he reportedly became convinced of the need for Israel to strike - and was convinced on Thursday when the UN's nuclear watchdog officially warned that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. \n\nIn the wake of the attacks he urged Iran to 'make a deal' with the US to avoid more bloodshed and at the weekend told reporters that it was 'possible' Washington could get involved. \n\n'There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end. Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left,' he said. He also quipped that Israel's punishing attacks 'may have forced a deal to go quicker, actually'.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington appears to be taking steps to stabilise the situation - and discourage Iran from further aggression. \n\nThe USS Nimitz aircraft carrier, set to appear in Vietnam on June 20, has seemingly reversed course and his now heading back West, presumably on course for the Middle East.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer issued a general caution against further hostilities in the hours following initial attacks on Friday.\n\n'Stability in the Middle East must be the priority, and we are engaging partners to de-escalate... Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy,' he said. \n\nBut in a phonecall, Starmer told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that London believes Israel has the right to 'self defence' and has 'grave concerns' over Iran's nuclear programme. \n\nFrance took it a step further, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring that Tehran bore 'heavy responsibility in the destabilisation of the whole region'.\n\n'If Israel were to be attacked in retaliation by Iran, France, if in a position to do so, would take part in protection and defence operations,' he said - though he added that Paris would not take part in any offensives on Iran.\n\nAnd German Chancellor Friedrich Merz backed 'Israel's right to defend its existence and the security of its citizens', adding: 'The goal must remain that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons.'\n\nOther Western aligned nations including Canada, Australia and Argentina equally denounced Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and perceived role in destabilising the region. \n\nIn Latin America, Javier Milei of Argentina took an opposing tack to neighbours Brazil, siding with Israel and condemning Iran's vile attack.\n\nMilei's office also hit out at Iran's appointment of Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi as the new head of the Revolutionary Guard following the assassination of Hossein Salami. \n\nVahidi is one of several Iranian military members that Argentine authorities believe are responsible for the bombing of a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in 1995 - a terror attack in which 85 people perished. \n\nBeyond this, most countries have either issued general calls for de-escalation and restraint, without coming down on either side. \n\nOne notable abstainer from condemning Israel's attacks was India, which refused to join its fellow members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a pan-Asian political and security bloc, in doing so. \n\nNew Delhi is playing a balancing act as a leading purchaser of Israeli military technology and defence equipment, but also as a key economic partner of Iran - not to mention its robust relationship with the United States.","summary":"As the death toll rises and the risk of a wider regional war grows by the hour, the international community is urging restraint, but not without expressing support for one side or the other","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14816305/The-world-picks-Israel-Iran-conflict-war-Middle-East-exposed-deepening-East-West-divisions-countries-start-declare-allegiances.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/16/17/99419685-0-image-a-2_1750092092427.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:53:09","author":"David Averre,Editor","authors":["David Averre","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.081},{"id":332117598,"title":"Christine Lampard displays her impressive figure in a navy halterneck bikini as she joins husband Frank on family holiday in Lake Como","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jun 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump calls for 'immediate evacuation of Tehran' and brands Iran 'foolish' amid ceasefire calls - while Netanyahu refuses to rule out assassinating Supreme Leader as war enters fifth day\n\nDonald Trump DROPS historic UK-US trade deal as it is officially agreed and leaves Starmer scrambling\n\nExperts FINALLY pinpoint cause of autism - landmark discovery paves the way for drug treatments\n\nANDREW NEIL: Iran's dictators have one final suicidal weapon they are now threatening to unleash.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:33 BST, 17 June 2025 |Updated:01:51 BST, 17 June 2025 \n\nLily Allen and James Norton have seemingly struck up a very unlikely romance after being spotted on what was an apparent first date on Saturday.\nThe former party girl, 40, and straight-laced actor, 39, looked cosy as they watched Charli XCX perform at Lido Festival in London, after they were said to have met on exclusive celebrity dating app Raya. \nLily ended her marriage to Stranger Things star husband David Harbour, 50, in December after four years, following her discovery that he had a secret profile on Raya. Meanwhile James is said to have split from model girlfriend Charlotte Rose Smith, 26, last month.\nThe new paring left onlookers 'doing double-takes' and its no surprise with them seeming like complete opposites, her a mother-of-two with an outspoken public persona and him a bachelor who hides behind his screen roles. \nWhile Lily has revealed with heartbreaking honesty that she had children for 'all the wrong reasons' as she searched for 'unconditional love'. James has held off on starting a family, saying it wouldn't be fair' on them amid his blossoming career.\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail’s new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop.\n\nLily Allen, 40, and James Norton, 49, have seemingly struck up a very unlikely romance after being spotted on what was an apparent first date on Saturday\n\nThe new paring, who are said to have met on celeb dating app Raya, left onlookers 'doing double-takes' and its no surprise with them seeming like complete opposites\nHowever the unlikely lovebirds do appear to have a connection after both struggled through difficult childhoods to find success and make names for themselves. \nPop star Lily is the daughter of actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen, while Happy Valley star James started life outside the spotlight with both parents being teachers who sent their son to the £40K-a-year Ampleforth College in York - dubbed the 'Catholic Eton'.\nSpeaking on her podcast Miss Me? last year, she said: 'I think I had children for all the wrong reasons really because I was yearning for unconditional love, which I haven't felt in my life since I was a child.' \nLily, who shares daughters Ethel, 13, and Marnie, 11, with her ex-husband Sam Cooper, has long been candid about the struggles she faced in childhood and how it continues to affect her today; and her fractious relationship with her father.\nSoon after Lily's birth, Keith began an affair with a brigadier's wife who lived near the set of a film he was working on in Dorset. By 1989, the marriage to Alison had run its course and he walked out on her when his daughter was four. \nShe has previously said of her childhood: 'One of my earliest memories is of when Mum and Dad split up. We were in our council flat in Bloomsbury and Dad was saying: 'Me and Mum are splitting up now.'\n'I was about four and I was thinking: 'Does that mean we've got to look for a new dad?' It was very hard for Mum. She was producing her first film and my younger brother, Alfie, was a difficult kid.\n'I just lived within my own brain. I had this blanket and I'd suck my thumb and watch the world go by.'\n\nHowever the unlikely lovebirds do appear to have a connection after both struggled through difficult childhoods to find success and make names for themselves\n\nLily, who shares daughters Ethel, 13, and Marnie, 11, with her ex-husband Sam Cooper, has long been candid about the struggles she faced in childhood (pictured in 2022)\n\nThe singer has recalled how Keith walked out on her and her brother Alfie (pictured) when she was just four years old\n\nMeanwhile James was the victim of vicious bullying at his swanky school and the taunts pushed him towards the school’s theatre department, where he became a mainstay\n\nLily ended her marriage to Stranger Things star husband David Harbour , 50, in December 2024 following her discovery he had a secret profile on Raya (pictured 2023)\n\n James is said to have split from model girlfriend Charlotte Rose Smith (pictured) last month \nIn 2015, Lily also tweeted: 'My dad walked out on me when I was 4, I'm sick of this. My dad was at Latitude when I headlined and didn't even come to see me. I've probably spent more time walking my dogs than I have with my dad my entire life.' \nSpeaking to the Guardian in 2018, she also spoke of the difficult times she experienced with her mother following the split.\nWhen the singer was eight years old, she walked into the bathroom to find Owen on the floor with empty bottles of alcohol and pills around her, as she screamed. She was taken to rehab shortly afterwards.\n\n Lily Allen's friends get a wake-up call as star jokes she ranks them in order of how much she likes them - and schedules catch ups accordingly \nMeanwhile James was the victim of vicious bullying at his swanky school, where he boarded as a red-headed, freckly child. The taunts pushed him towards the school’s theatre department, where he became a mainstay.\nThe son of a teachers Lavinia and Hugh the actor, he was born in Lambeth, South London, before enjoying an idyllic childhood in the market town of Malton, North Yorkshire. \n‘I had a complicated time at school. I didn’t have the greatest time,’ he admitted in 2023. ‘It wasn’t helped by the fact that I was bullied. I was quite badly bullied for five years and I was also at boarding school so I couldn’t leave.\n‘But I owe that school a lot. I loved theatre, I made some good friends. There’s a magic to the place. It’s intoxicating to be part of something so big, with that atmosphere of grandeur, when you’re in such a period of flux.’\nThe abuse, he says, left him ‘hyper aware socially’. ‘Possibly to a fault,’ he adds. ‘I constantly critique how I’m affecting people and how I’m being judged.\nHis bullying experiences were so bad that he sought psychological help to get through it ‘With the help of a therapist, in a weird, perverse way I’m kind of grateful for it.\n‘I’ve had a great therapist for the last four years, and it’s not from a place of drama. I’m luckily not suffering from depression or anything like that but it’s been really, really helpful in understanding what [happened to me at school].’ \n\nJames has held off on starting a family, saying it wouldn't be fair' on them amid his blossoming career\n\nDuring their date the pair were spotted enjoying alcohol free beer, with Lily having been open about her battles with addiction (pictured)\n\nMeanwhile James' previously gave up drinking for his starring role in bleak three hour long play A Little Life in 2023 (James, R, pictured in the play) \n\nLily told how addiction for her was always a case of 'when' and not 'if' as she recalled her actor father Keith's troubles with drugs [pictured together in 2007]\n\nHe later went to Cambridge University where he was awarded a first in Theology. \nMeanwhile on the prospect of starting a family he told The Sunday Times last year: 'I love hanging out with kids — most of my friends have kids so I'm not quite in step with my peers — but the past few years have been the busiest I've been, so it would not have been fair to bring a child into that.\n'Also, the inherently unfair benefit of being a man is there is less rush. I am lucky I can have kids later, so now I'm happy, actually, with my life. I feel really excited by the choices I've made.'\n\n Lily Allen's fractious childhood - as she reveals she had 'children for all the wrong reasons' \nDuring their date the pair were spotted enjoying alcohol free beer, with Lily having been open about her battles with addiction, meanwhile James' previously gave up drinking for his starring role in bleak three hour long play A Little Life in 2023.\nThe Smile hitmaker, who is now six years into her sobriety, said how quitting alcohol and drugs was the best decision she had ever made.\nIn a frank new interview with The Times, Lily told how addiction for her was always a case of 'when' and not 'if' as she recalled her actor father Keith's troubles with drugs. \nOver the years, film star Keith, 71, has spoken about his battle with substance abuse, with the publication documenting Lily's admission that her earliest memories revolves around drink and drugs and that she'd even seen her father take cocaine.\nDetailing how it was somehow inevitable that she'd follow a similar path, Lily said: 'I think that addiction runs deep in my family, so self-medicating was going to be on the cards. For me, it didn’t really feel like an ‘if’, it was a ‘when’.”\nThe Smile hitmaker, who has recently become an ambassador for addiction charity the Forward Trust, also hinted how the presence of drink and drugs while growing up made her feel 'unsafe' as she told how the most important thing about her sobriety is that her own children feel safe.\n\nOver the years, film star Keith, 71, has spoken about his battle with substance abuse, with the Lily's admission that her earliest memories revolves around drink and drugs [Lily in 2009]\n\nNot long before Lily split from husband David, she turned amateur sleuth after speculating that David had 'cheated' on the same dating app where they met (pictured 2023) \n\nJames previously dated actress Imogen Poots, they in 2017 while working on BBC's War and Peace. They became engaged in 2022 but parted ways in 2023 (pictured 2022)\n\nLily shared: 'My kids feel safe. That’s the main thing for me. I felt very unsafe in my childhood, and my kids feel safe.'\nIndeed, it is her children who help keep her on the right path, with Lily quipping that her children 'monitor' her AA meeting attendance.\nShe said her girls would often question whether she'd been to her meetings, noting that her daughters are aware that staying on the path of sobriety 'it takes work' and that it's something Lily has to 'prioritise'.\nPerhaps the key to Lily staying on track for her girls is the shocking moment in her past as she hit rock bottom amidst her battle with booze.\nDuring her interview, Lily recalled drunkenly turning up at her ex-husband's house to confront him after learning he'd started seeing someone new, with the altercation startling her young children.\nLily said: 'I drank myself into oblivion. I went over to his house and started screaming at him, woke the kids up, you know, really distressed the children. They remember that. And they know that I was under the influence then, and that it’s important that Mummy avoids getting into those situations.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily Allen and James Norton's VERY unlikely 'romance': As former party girl and outspoken singer 'enjoys first date' with straight laced actor their surprising connection is revealed\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kick-start broader discussions,\" Macron told reporters.\n\n\"We have to see now whether the sides will follow.\"\n\nG7 leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the U.S., along with the European Union, had convened in the resort area of Kananaskis in the Canadian Rockies until Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier, Trump said the former Group of Eight had been wrong to kick out Russia in 2014 after it annexed Crimea.\n\n\"This was a big mistake,\" Trump said, adding he believed Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022 had Putin not been ejected.\n\n\"Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else ... he's not a happy person about it. I can tell you that he basically doesn't even speak to the people that threw him out, and I agree with him,\" Trump said.\n\nThough Trump stopped short of saying Russia should be reinstated in the group, his comments had raised doubts about how much Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy can achieve when he is scheduled to meet the leaders on Tuesday.\n\n\"It was a rough start,\" said Josh Lipsky, a former senior IMF official who now chairs the international economics department at the Atlantic Council.\n\nEuropean nations had wanted to persuade Trump to back tougher sanctions on Moscow.\n\nA spokesperson for the Ukrainian embassy in Canada said Zelenskiy was still planning to come to Canada.\n\nCanada has abandoned any effort to adopt a comprehensive communique to avert a repeat of the 2018 summit in Quebec, when Trump instructed the U.S. delegation to withdraw its approval of the final communique after leaving.\n\nLeaders have prepared several draft documents seen by Reuters, including on migration, artificial intelligence, and critical minerals. None of them have been approved by the United States, however, according to sources briefed on the documents.\n\nWithout Trump, it is unclear if there will be any declarations, a European diplomat said.\n\nCarney invited non-G7 members Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, as well as Ukraine.\n\nTrump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday they had finalized a trade deal reached between the two allies last month, making Britain the first country to agree to a deal for lower U.S. tariffs.\n\nCarney said in a statement he had agreed with Trump that their two nations should try to wrap up a new economic and security deal within 30 days.\n\nTrump said a new economic deal with host Canada was possible but stressed tariffs had to play a role, a position the Canadian government strongly opposes.\n\n\"Our position is that we should have no tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States,\" said Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to Washington.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump is leaving the Group of Seven summit in Canada a day early due to the situation in the Middle East, the White House said on Monday.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-to-leave-g7-summit-early-due-to-middle-east-situation/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-543.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:51:22","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Reuters 51am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Reuters 51am"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":332117588,"title":"Lily Allen and James Norton 'share a backstage snog as they party with Charli XCX after enjoying an unlikely first date at her Lido Festival show'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jun 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump calls for 'immediate evacuation of Tehran' and brands Iran 'foolish' amid ceasefire calls - while Netanyahu refuses to rule out assassinating Supreme Leader as war enters fifth day\n\nDonald Trump DROPS historic UK-US trade deal as it is officially agreed and leaves Starmer scrambling\n\nExperts FINALLY pinpoint cause of autism - landmark discovery paves the way for drug treatments\n\nANDREW NEIL: Iran's dictators have one final suicidal weapon they are now threatening to unleash.

They make a lovely couple.'\nNot long before Lily split from husband David, she turned amateur sleuth after speculating that David had 'cheated' on the same dating app where they met. \n\nThe singer and actor were pictured cosying up to one another as they watched Charli's show in the capital, before heading to a backstage compound to party with the singer\n\nLily ended her marriage to Stranger Things star husband David Harbour, 50, in December 2024 following her discovery he had a secret profile on Raya (pictured 2023) \n\nMeanwhile James is said to have split from model girlfriend Charlotte Rose Smith (pictured) last month and was also spotted back on the exclusive dating site.\n\n Lily Allen jokes she ranks her friends in order of how much she likes them \nShe was left in 'agony' when she allegedly discovered the actor had a secret profile, The Mail on Sunday revealed.\nThe pop star joined the app herself, pretending to be 'looking for women' – and allegedly found that David had already set up a dating profile.

Reader discretion is advised. A former Coast Guard lieutenant was recently arrested for allegedly making threats to kill President Donald Trump, according to court documents obtained by Fox News. The suspect, Virginia resident Peter Stinson, served as an officer in the United States Coast Guard from 1988 to 2021. He was a sharpshooter as well as a FEMA instructor during that time. In an affidavit filed on Friday, a task force officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed details about the myriad of online threats that Stinson allegedly made. In one instance, Stinson reportedly wrote that Trump needed to be \"[L]uigied,\" on May 9. The post was a reference to Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year. FLORIDA POLICE ARREST MAN FOR MAKING 'WRITTEN THREATS TO KILL' TRUMP Stinson allegedly made graphic threats aginst Trump involving guns, poisoning and even knives on multiple social media platforms. Stinson also allegedly referenced \"not having the necessary skills,\" to successfully complete an assassination, but also eerily suggested that he wasn't being entirely truthful. FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS MAN FOR THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP AFTER REELECTION The document also alleges that Stinson made several references to 8647, which government officials say \"is likely in reference to an Instagram post made by former FBI Director James Comey.\" \"The post by Comey was interpreted in the news media as a violent threat to President Trump and prompted an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Secret Service. STINSON has since made 13 additional posts on Bluesky including the text, '8647',\" the document states. The affidavit also alleges that Stinson \"has self-identified as a member of ANTIFA.\" On Feb. 2, Stinson allegedly posted on his X account, \"Sure. This is war. Sides will be drawn. Antifa always wins in the end. Violence is inherently necessary.\" The most recent post referenced in the document was published on BlueSky on June 11, when Stinson allegedly wrote, \"When he dies, the party is going to be yuge.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Stinson was charged with making threats to kill the president and is slated to make an initial appearance in federal court on Wednesday. Fox News Digital's Brooke Curto contributed to this report.","summary":"Ex-Coast Guard officer Peter Stinson faces federal charges after allegedly posting numerous threats against President Trump on various social media platforms.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-coast-guard-officer-arrested-after-allegedly-threatening-assassinate-trump-fbi","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/adobe-express-file-13.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:40:25","author":"Andrea Margolis,Jake Gibson","authors":["Andrea Margolis","Jake Gibson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":332118510,"title":"Trump says US-UK deal ‘done’ as steel tariffs still up in air","text":"Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer have finalised a US-UK deal that will slash trade barriers on goods from both countries, but leaves the future of tariffs on British steel up in the air.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the move marked a “very important day” for both sides as the US president announced the agreement was “done” in a joint appearance on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada.\n\nThe deal will grant British carmakers a reprieve by the end of June as levies drop from 25% to 10%, while the aerospace sector will face no import taxes.\n\nBut tariffs for the steel industry, which is of key economic importance to the UK, will stand at 25% for now rather than falling to zero as originally agreed.

government to reveal more about the information-sharing implications of the bill due to a possible risk to human rights.\n\nA preliminary Citizen Lab analysis of the bill also raises questions about how any new information-sharing plans would comply with Canada's policy on tabling treaties in Parliament.\n\nThe analysis released Monday notes the legislation refers to the potential for agreements or arrangements with a foreign state.\n\nThe bill also mentions the possibility that people in Canada may be compelled to disclose information by the laws of a foreign state.\n\nThe government says the legislation is intended to keep borders secure, fight transnational organized crime, stop the flow of deadly fentanyl and crack down on money laundering.\n\nThe government introduced the bill this month under pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has cited concerns about the southbound flow of irregular migrants and fentanyl in imposing tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nThe bill has won applause from Canada's police chiefs, the national fentanyl czar and child protection advocates working to protect young people from online predators.\n\nThe International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, a coalition of human rights and civil society organizations, has called for the bill's withdrawal, saying the government seeks powers related to immigration and

a new data-sharing treaty known as the \"second additional protocol\" to the Budapest Convention.\n\nThe Citizen Lab contends the treaty is designed to bypass existing mutual legal assistance frameworks between countries, and to expand the speed and volume of data-sharing between law enforcement authorities in different countries.\n\n\"The United States is a signatory of the treaty and

the U.S. Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act. The legislation allows Washington to sign bilateral agreements with other countries to simplify the sharing of information on criminal justice matters.\n\nThe analysis warns that the second additional protocol and the CLOUD Act data-sharing frameworks \"have each been shown to carry significant constitutional and human rights risks.\"\n\nThe Citizen Lab analysis says that the federal policy on tabling treaties in Parliament makes it clear the government should not quietly introduce treaty-implementing legislation through the back door without making its intentions explicit.","summary":"An organization that monitors the effect of information flows on human rights says the new federal border security bill appears to &amp;quot;roll out a welcome mat&amp;quot; for expanded data-sharing agreements with the United States and other countries.

None have thus far been able to obtain a sufficient amount of popular support or material means to pose an existential challenge to the current system led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Each group also has its own aims and tactics, some of which directly conflict with others, complicating efforts to establish a united front amid the country's most devastating conflict since the 1980s Iran-Iraq War.Israeli officials have declined to comment on record regarding potential efforts to foster ties with opposition groups active in Iran, but reports have emerged of operations tied to Israel taking place within the country, in addition to the large-scale air war being conducted by Israeli warplanes and drones since late Thursday.With enthusiasm building among opponents of the Iranian government, analysts and former officials are treating with caution speculation of an insurrection capable of actually ousting the country's leadership.'Three Levels' of CooperationGiora Eiland, an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reserve major general who previously served as head of Israel's National Security Council, told Newsweek that he believed \"Israel is being assisted this way or that way by some Iranians,\" though the true degree of cooperation remained opaque.\"We can assume that there are three levels of Iranians that, directly or indirectly, might help us,\" Eiland said. \"First, when we located some of the Israeli groups that were inside Iran and launched drones from short distances against Iranian facilities, they might have been given some assistance from locals, I cannot verify it, but this makes sense.\"\"Secondly,\" he continued, \"Israel is probably encouraging some groups in Iran, and I cannot exclude even an approach to some of the military forces in Iran, not the Revolutionary Guard, but some of the conventional military or regular Iranian army, that maybe the time is now for them to do something. It might be done in a very, very tacit way, but I cannot exclude it.\"\"And number three,\" he added, \"in a way, Israel, even formally is calling the Iranian to try to rise against the government.\"Yet he remained somewhat skeptical that Iranians were prepared to mobilize in substantial numbers against the government at this time, both due to the powerful influence of the Basij paramilitary force tasked with maintaining internal security, as well as the potentially problematic nature of collaborating with an enemy during wartime.\"Usually, people don't tend to resist or to rise against their own government during the war, because it is not patriotic enough,\" Eiland said. \"They might respond later, after the war is over, and then they might decide the time has come to do something more than only, let's say, to complain.\"But I cannot hide that this is the goal of the Israeli government that something similar to this will occur soon,\" he added. \"As I said, personally, I don't think that might happen in the near future.\"The Monarchy and the MojahedinBut even if the Iranian government is eventually threatened with collapse, deep uncertainties surround the projected alternatives.The two Iranian dissident leaders that most often garner international headlines are Reza Pahlavi, son of Iran's last shah who was deposed during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and Maryam Rajavi, head of the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MeK), also known as the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), and the associated National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).Pahlavi, based in Washington, D.C., has defended the Israeli attacks, dubbed \"Operation Rising Lion,\" and, like Netanyahu, has issued calls for Iranians to rise up against the government.The MeK, whose leadership is based in France and Albania, has also sought to capitalize on the mayhem to claim new subversive measures within Iran, including the dissemination of anti-government messages. Just days before the Israeli operation, the group released information from its Washington office purporting to show how Iran was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons.Iranian officials have always denied seeking a nuclear bomb, but such claims served as the pretext for Israel's military intervention.While both Pahlavi and the MeK claim to seek establishment of a secular and democratic Iran, they often criticize one another. The MeK, spawned as a leftist rebel group in 1965, has a legacy of conducting attacks during the reign of Pahlavi's father before the Islamic Revolution, which the group initially supported.\"The only reason for Reza Pahlavi's notoriety is that he is the son of the last dictator of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who ruled along with his father for 57 years, with repression and a dreaded secret police called SAVAK and the killing of freedom fighters, a one-party rule and plundering the people of Iran,\" MeK spokesperson Shahin Gobadi told Newsweek. \"The Shah eventually was forced to flee Iran as a result of a popular revolution.\"\"Reza Pahlavi has nothing of his own, and anyone who is serious about the future of Iran does not take him seriously at all,\" Gobadi added. \"For the past four decades, he has been living comfortably with the money looted by his father. Even his former closest associates now acknowledge that his political efforts have not lasted more than a few weeks or at most a few months, due to his dictatorial approach. His meetings outside Iran, despite the publicity and hype in cyberspace, do not exceed to draw a few hundred people at best.\"Newsweek has reached out to Pahlavi's press office and the Iranian Mission to the United Nations for comment.Pahlavi has said he does not advocate for the restoration of the Iranian monarchy. The MeK has denied allegations that it collaborated with Israel.But a number of observers argue that neither Pahlavi nor the MeK hold the necessary influence in Iran to substantially affect the country's future.\"The NCRI/MEK, which relocated Iraq and collaborated with the Iraqi Army throughout the war against Iran, has been reduced to a cult-like political sect lacking any significant domestic constituency,\" Ali Alfoneh, senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told Newsweek.\"As for Mr. Reza Pahlavi, for a time, he was perceived as a symbolic alternative by segments of the Iranian public nostalgic for a bygone era, when meat was affordable and taxi drivers polite,\" Alfoneh said. \"However, his overt alignment with Israel is likely to delegitimize him in the eyes of broad constituencies, particularly amidst rising civilian casualties.\"Muhammad Sahimi, professor at the University of Southern California, also outlined a difficult situation for both MeK and monarchy supporters.\"Reza Pahlavi and his monarchist supporters have firmly allied themselves with Israel, and are hoping that Israel's attacks on Iran will lead to toppling of the regime in Tehran and its replacement with them,\" Sahimi told Newsweek. \"Pahlavi has not condemned Israel's attacks, and in fact has directly or indirectly supported them.\"\"The MEK has had long-standing relations with Israel, and they too hope that they can come to power, although they are universally despised by Iranians from all walks of life, due to their siding with Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq during its war with Iran,\" Sahimi said. \"At the same time, their members are all in their 60s and 70s, and in exile. They are a spent force.\"Threats From WithinWhile both the MeK and Pahlavi claim to have a presence of supporters within Iran, a number of other dissident groups based within the country have waged their own anti-government campaigns, both civil and military. These include militias established among non-Persian ethnic groups such as Arabs, Azeris, Baloch and Kurds who seek greater decentralized rule or, in some cases, total independence.Kurdish groups, in particular, have a history of seeking closer coordination with the United States, which has helped backed Kurdish forces to establish autonomous regions in Iraq and Syria. Israel, too, has long courted Kurdish groups in the region.\"Some of the Kurdish groups have been in contact with Israel over the past several decades, and some of their leaders, such as Mostafa Hejri, secretary-general of Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran, have explicitly asked Israel for help,\" Sahimi said. \"When NATO imposed no flight zone over Libya in 2011, Hejri asked for the same over Iran's province of Kurdistan.\"On the other hand, he said that \"Arabs and Azeri people are overwhelmingly against any separatist movement, and a small Arab terrorist group was eliminated.\" As for the Baloch, he explained that \"there is small Balochi terrorist group in Iran's province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which has been carrying out terrorist operations, but it does not have any significant military power to make any difference.\"\"So, I would say, if the U.S. and/or Israel were to exploit this, the Kurds would be their target,\" Sahimi said.In addition to the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), other Kurdish movements in Iran include the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) and the Komala Party of Iranian Kurdistan, which itself has splintered into several factions. Iranian Kurdish militias have at times fought against one another as well.In a recent interview with Newsweek, Komala Secretary-General Abdulla Mohtadi said his group has renounced the use of armed means to topple Iran's government, though he appealed for greater support from the U.S. and Israel to Iranian dissident groups.Mohtadi said at the time that he had forged an alliance with the PDKI amid the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" movement protests that erupted nationwide in response to the death of 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish Mahsa Amini in police custody in September 2022.But he remained critical of \"extremist\" opposition groups, including certain monarchist supporters, whom he accused of doing more harm than good to the anti-Iranian government cause.Since Israel's operation began, the PDKI has stated that \"the first and most important prerequisite for saving Iran's citizens from this crisis, destruction, and darkness is to completely remove and end this regime,\" while PAK leader Hussein Yazdanpanah issued a statement urging \"a nationwide uprising to end the regime or to reduce it in Tehran.\"However, Alfoneh noted that Iranians had a tendency to rally behind the government against perceived separatism during times of national strife, as occurred during the Iran-Iraq War and in the aftermath of World Wars I and II.\"Each time, the urban middle class, prioritizing national cohesion, set aside grievances and aligned with the central state to suppress secessionist movements,\" Alfoneh said. \"I am expecting Israeli-backed secessionist insurgencies in Kurdistan, Baluchestan, and potentially Khuzestan (Ahvaz), but as in the past, the middle class is likely to lend conditional support to an otherwise unpopular regime to prevent fragmentation of Iran.\"So, while he suspected that \"regime change, and fragmentation of Iran through a civil war is the real strategic objective of Prime Minister Netanyahu, and that the nuclear dossier merely serves as a pretext to achieve those objectives,\" he felt \"the risk of a civil war and fragmentation of the country is likely to mobilize the middle class\" behind the government.Alireza Taghavinia, a Tehran-based security analyst, echoed the belief that Iranians were largely standing together in the face of Israeli attacks rather than siding with civil or armed opposition movements.\"The Iranian people have an important characteristic: they unite when there is foreign aggression against their homeland,\" Taghavinia told Newsweek. \"Even serious opponents of the Islamic Republic government are now standing by this government to repel Israel's aggression against their land.\"\"Iranians have a very strong sense of nationalism,\" he added.At the same time, he acknowledged that \"Kurdish terrorist groups could be a security threat to Iran, not a military threat,\" noting in particular alleged ties between Komala and the PDKI to Israel. Still, he argued that \"Iran's intelligence agencies and military power on its western borders are high and can control the situation.\"\"Iran has both an army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the Popular Mobilization Forces, and it feels no shortage of ground forces for war,\" Taghavinia said. \"So, there is no need to worry.\"Unintended ConsequencesIn addition to potentially galvanizing Iran's government, Israel's operations and potential aid to internal actors within Iran may run other risks that contradict the interests of Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump.These include fortifying calls for the country to develop a nuclear deterrent, a debate that has increasingly intensified within the Islamic Republic amid tensions with Israel that have mounted since the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023.\"Another point is that Netanyahu's big mistake and the attack on Iran, which was coordinated by Trump, has strengthened the position of those in Iran who wanted to build nuclear weapons, and I have told you this before,\" he added. \"Now, most Iranians want to build nuclear weapons.\"Sina Toosi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, argued that propping up either Pahlavi or the MeK could ultimately harm more organic efforts for change within Iran.\"While these groups will likely seek to use the current crisis to boost their visibility and present themselves as viable alternatives, empowering them would be a grave miscalculation,\" Toosi told Newsweek. \"It would further discredit any externally backed initiative for political change and would undermine the broader Iranian pro-democracy movement, which overwhelmingly rejects foreign interference and sectarian or authoritarian alternatives.\"Even seeking to forge ties with individuals associated with the Iranian military, as Eiland had proposed, carries the threat of bringing to power new leaders whose interests do not align with those of Israel or the U.S., he explained.\"There are certainly factions within the Iranian political and security apparatus—especially hardliners—who may seek to use the current crisis to consolidate power, suppress rivals, or justify more aggressive internal crackdowns,\" Toosi said.\"Paradoxically, some of the strongest opposition to US or Israeli interference often comes from grassroots civil society actors and reformist or moderate political currents, not the security establishment,\" he added. \"Undermining those internal voices—who support democratic change but oppose war and foreign manipulation—could inadvertently strengthen the very forces Israel and the U.S. claim to be opposing.\"Toosi also warned of the potential blowback associated with backing ethnic movements looking to seize on the chaos.\"Promoting such forces risks inflaming ethnic tensions, encouraging violent backlash, and destabilizing not just Iran but the broader region,\" Toosi said. \"A weakened central government in Iran could create power vacuums with unpredictable and highly dangerous outcomes. Attempts to leverage these groups may serve short-term tactical interests for Israel or others but would come at immense long-term strategic cost.\"The Iranian government's efforts to crack down on subversive elements does not only target groups claiming to seek a more democratic rule, but also those with explicitly fundamentalist outlooks, such as the Islamic State militant group, particularly its Khorasan faction that conducted the deadliest attack in Iran's history in January 2024, and Baloch Islamist movements like Jaish ul-Adl and Ansar al-Furqan.As was the case in neighboring Iraq, following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam in 2003, militant groups often seize on national insecurity to wreak further havoc, and Iran's porous borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan have already proven a persistent and deadly source of unrest in the region.For now, Toosi argued that these fears, along with a mounting death toll due to Israeli strikes, appear to be reinforcing rather than undermining nationwide support for the Islamic Republic.\"The Iranian leadership is navigating an unprecedented moment of pressure,\" Toosi said. \"The recent Israeli strikes—as they kill civilians or target infrastructure—are likely to strongly unify various factions within the Islamic Republic and shift public focus away from domestic grievances toward external threats.\"\"While discontent with the government remains, many Iranians oppose war and see foreign attacks as the greatest threat,\" he added. \"This dynamic could reinforce state cohesion, at least in the short term.\"","summary":"\"Israel is being assisted this way or that way by some Iranians,\" ex-Israeli National Security chief Giora Eiland told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/israel-eyes-regime-change-irans-opposition-divisive-divided-2086253","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2664189/iran-protest-against-israel.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:38:43","author":"Tom O'connor","authors":["Tom O'connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.033},{"id":332117596,"title":"Nicola Peltz blows kisses and rolls her eyes in post about 'incompetent men' amid feud with husband Brooklyn Beckham's family","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jun 17th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump calls for 'immediate evacuation of Tehran' and brands Iran 'foolish' amid ceasefire calls - while Netanyahu refuses to rule out assassinating Supreme Leader as war enters fifth day\n\nDonald Trump DROPS historic UK-US trade deal as it is officially agreed and leaves Starmer scrambling\n\nExperts FINALLY pinpoint cause of autism - landmark discovery paves the way for drug treatments\n\nANDREW NEIL: Iran's dictators have one final suicidal weapon they are now threatening to unleash.

The House-passed version of the legislation quadrupled the cap to $40,000. Republicans in the Senate want to see that pared back.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee essentially punted on SALT for the time being. Instead of inserting a new SALT cap number, they pegged the SALT cap at $10,000 in their forthcoming legislation as a placeholder for negotiations over the contentious issue.\n\nHouse “SALT caucus” members immediately pushed back on the placeholder inclusion, with some saying they are unwilling to budge on the $40,000 cap that House Speaker Mike Johnson successfully negotiated with them last month. The showdown over SALT will be a key issue to watch as the bill is debated in the Senate.\n\nA smaller boost to the child tax credit\n\nThe Senate legislation bumps the child tax credit permanently to $2,200 and indexes it to inflation thereafter.\n\nThe House legislation, in comparison, raised the child tax credit to $2,500, but only through 2028. It would revert to $2,000 in 2029, although it would still be indexed to inflation after that. \n\nPopulist conservatives like Vice President JD Vance and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) have pushed for a bigger child tax credit, even as high as $5,000, so both versions of the legislation are likely a disappointment for them.\n\nBusiness tax breaks are made permanent\n\nThe Senate bill makes several major tax breaks for business investment permanent. \n\nThe House bill extends those tax breaks, but only temporarily. \n\nSpecifically, the Senate bill would permanently allow companies to immediately deduct domestic research and development costs. It would also permanently allow full expensing for new capital investment, such as factory machinery, and would restore interest deductibility to help finance investments.\n\nThe business provisions are a key priority for lawmakers because incentives for business are thought to be especially helpful in boosting economic growth. In theory, they could help make the bill less costly to the treasury, because with the increased growth comes increased revenue capture.\n\nA smaller tax on university endowments and private foundations\n\nThe Senate scales down a tax on large university endowments included in the House bill. The Senate version would tax universities with the highest student-adjusted endowments — for instance, Harvard University — at an 8% rate. The rate would be 21% in the House version of the bill, in line with the corporate tax rate.\n\nThe top rate is 1.4% under current law, which was set by the 2017 GOP tax overhaul\n\nRepublicans have increasingly scrutinized universities in the fallout from the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent the subsequent fallout and protests.\n\nThe Senate legislation also omits a tax hike on large private foundation investment income. In the House bill, the rate would be raised from 1.39% to as high as 10%. \n\nLimits on Trump tax breaks on overtime, tips, Social Security, and auto loans\n\nFor the new tax breaks for individuals that Trump promised on the campaign trail, the Senate tax legislation includes limits that are not present in the House version. \n\nNo Taxes on Tips: The Senate legislation sets a $25,000 limit for deductions for income earned as tips. The deduction also phases out at a 10% rate starting at $150,000 in income for a single filer and $300,000 for a joint filer.\n\nNo Taxes on Overtime: The Senate legislation sets a $12,500 limit on deductions for overtime pay. The deduction phases out at a 10% rate starting at $150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint filers.\n\nNo Tax on Car Loan Interest: The Senate legislation sets a $10,000 limit on deductions for auto loan interest paid. The deduction phases out starting at at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers. Also, the break is only available for new cars assembled in the U.S. \n\nNo Taxes on Social Security: The Senate version of the legislation provides a $6,000 deduction for seniors over the age of 65, a provision meant to fulfill Trump’s campaign promise to end taxes on Social Security benefits. That is larger than the similar deduction in House version of the legislation of $4,000. The Senate bill, though, phases out the deduction faster for single filers earning in excess of $75,000 or married couples earning more than $150,000. \n\n Notably, in both versions those provisions are temporary and will expire at the end of 2028. \n\nSlower phase-outs for IRA clean energy credits\n\nThe Senate version of the includes a slower phase-out of clean energy credits than the House-passed version of the bill.\n\nSpecifically, it implements a slower phaseout of the Clean Electricity Production Credit (PTC) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (ITC) for electricity generated by wind or solar technologies.\n\nBoth versions of the Republican tax legislation would roll back energy tax credits created or expanded by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA was a signature piece of legislation passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden.\n\nSENATE GOP MEGABILL WOULD DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\nNo boost for “pass-through” businesses\n\nThe Senate legislation does not include the enlarged tax break that was included in the House bill for businesses that file through the individual side of the tax code. \n\nThe House bill would raise the deduction for income earned by pass-throughs from 20%, where it was set by the 2017 tax overhaul, to 23%. The Senate bill keeps it at 20%, although it makes it permanent. under current law, it expires at the end of this year. \n\nRepublicans defend the tax break as a key pro-growth provision for the many small businesses that are organized as pass-throughs.","summary":"The tax plan Senate Republicans released Monday as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act differs in several key ways from the House version that advanced last month.

You talk about not being able to put your trousers on...' referring to the day after the NTAs.\nDanny candidly replied: 'I had a moment of clarity where I had been on it all night after the NTAs.\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the Daily Mail's new showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop.\n\nDanny Dyer has now revealed the moment he realised he had a drinking problem (pictured in March 2024)\n\nDanny discussed his moment of clarity to make a change after being 'off his head' following the NTAs in 2017 (pictured)\n'I think I'd won and that's always on like a Tuesday or something and I had to go to work.\n'There's another thing with EastEnders, is that they go, \"Yeah, come celebrate NTAs, but you are up at seven in the morning\". So anyway, I'd just overdone it again and I just could not work out how to get my jeans on. \nWanting Danny to explain further, Louis asked him: 'Which part of it?' \nDanny replied: 'I was just sitting on my en suite toilet trying to work out what leg goes in what, and I don’t why. \n'I've sort of had many of them moments over the years of me being completely off my head. \n'But that one really resonated with me. It was more because I looked up, my wife was just watching me and she looked shattered and she looked ill.\n'And of course, you know, the drug taking and the madness that comes with it, you're destroying yourself and your body and you're slowly killing yourself, but you also, you’re really upsetting the people around you. \n'I just looked at her, even through this moment, I was off my head. But everything seemed to just sort of go, what the f*ck are you doing to people around you that love you?\n\nDanny then candidly revealed that he had a 'moment of clarity' when he struggled to put his trousers on for work one day after 'being on it all night' after the NTAs (pictured this year)\n\nHe also credited his EastEnders co-star Luisa Bradshaw-White for being one of the only ones to tell him he had an issue (both pictured 2016)\n'And it was that moment and I could hear Artie, my son, who's now 11, he must have been 3. He was running around downstairs and I think I'd got rid of the last straggler out the house.' \nWhen asked what the time would have been Danny added: 'Well it would've been about 6.30-6.45.'\nClarifying further, Louis asked the star: 'What in the morning?'\nTo which Danny replied: 'Yeah, So I had a car picking me up to take me to work and it was just this moment I thought, \"s**t, you're going to die. \n'You're going to kill yourself. You're not happy. You're spanking all your money on drugs. You're destroying everything around you.\" \nHe continued: 'It's weird, that moment, because I went straight to work that day and I was a bit off my head and I did say, \"Listen, I need help. I can't do this anymore, \n'I need help.

Also Read | Israel-Palestine War: UN Rights Chief Volker Turk Urges Governments To 'Wake Up' to 'Horrifying' Suffering in Gaza.\nTrump - unprompted, and with Carney at his side - complained that the G7 \"used to be the G8\" until \"Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn't want to have Russia in.\"\nTrump reiterated his long-standing view on Russia's expulsion from the G7, saying, \"The G7 used to be the G8. Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn't want to have Russia in, and I would say that that was a mistake, because I think you wouldn't have a war right now if you had Russia in, and you wouldn't have a war right now if Trump were President four years ago, but it didn't work out that way.\"\nAlso Read | Why Israel’s Attacks Aim to Cripple Iran’s Energy Sector.\nHe further elaborated on the consequences of that decision, saying, \"They threw Russia out, which I claimed was a very big mistake, even though I wasn't in politics then. I was very loud about it. It was a mistake in that you spend so much time talking about Russia, and he's no longer at the table, so it makes life more complicated.\"\nTrump stated that \"Russia should never have been kicked out of G7\" and doubled down on tariffs. He also brushed aside Carney's proposals, saying \"they're good\" but asserted \"mine are better\", adding \"we'll see what we can do.\"\nhttps://x.com/MarcNixon24/status/1934640373823136024\nTrump's comments were met with awkwardness from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who stood beside him during the press conference. Carney's government had previously expressed concerns about Trump's stance on Russia.\nDiscussing Russia's place in the G7, Trump said, \"I'm not saying he should at this point, because too much water has gone over the dam, maybe. But it was a big mistake. Obama didn't want him, and the head of your country, the proud head of your country didn't want him.\"\nHe went on to say, \"This was a big mistake. You wouldn't have that war. You know, you have your enemy at the table. I don't even consider him, he wasn't really an enemy at that time. There was no concept. If I were president, this war would have never happened.\"\nTrump further reinforced his belief by saying, \"But likewise, if he were a member of what was called the G8 at that time, it was always the G8, you wouldn't have a war right now.\"\nSpeaking again about Russia, Trump said, \"Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else. He doesn't want to talk.\"\nDescribing Putin's reaction to being expelled from the G8, Trump concluded, \"Because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8, as I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. He was very insulted. And, I mean, he was thrown out by Trudeau, who convinced one or two people, along with Obama. He was thrown out. And he's not a happy person about it, I can tell you that. He doesn't even speak to the people that threw him out. And I agree with him.\"\nTrump blamed Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau for the move, Trudeau was not in power at the time. In March 2014, Trudeau was just over a year into his time as the head of Canada's Liberal Party. And at the time, Canada's government was led by the Conservative Party of Canada and prime minister Stephen Harper. Trudeau would not become prime minister until November 2015.\nCarney stood and watched as Trump continued speaking and taking questions from reporters. Russia was suspended from the G8 in 2014 due to its annexation of Crimea. Trump has repeatedly expressed support for Russia's readmission, despite opposition from other G7 leaders.\nTrump reinforced his stance on global leadership, criticizing Russia's exclusion from the group and outlining his position on trade, tariffs, and escalating tensions in the Middle East.\nOn the topic of trade and collaboration, Trump said, \"I appreciate it, and we've developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things, and we have a whole group of people, some traders and some other people. I see my top economy people, but we have a very talented group of people, and you do too, and I know they've worked together very well. I look forward to that.\"\nShifting focus to trade, Trump outlined his expectations: \"And other than that, I think we're going to accomplish a lot, and I expect to. And I think our primary focus will be trade and trade with Canada, and I'm sure we can work something out.\"\nCarney has been keen to ink a deal with Trump on trade and security, and for the US president to drop his punishing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum and the auto industry. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, sparking reciprocal measures from the Canadian government.\nHe then explained the key differences in trade strategy, stating, \"It's not so much holding up. I think we have different concepts. I have a tariff concept. Mark has a different concept, which is something that some people like. But we are going to see if we can get to the bottom of it today.\"\nTrump's tariffs campaign has rattled markets and unsettled the global trade outlook, with Canadian leaders vowing to raise the issue in every meeting with Trump. Relations between the US and Canada have been strained, with Trump threatening to impose further tariffs and even suggesting the possibility of annexing Canada.\nReinforcing his stance, Trump said, \"I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff. It's simple, it's easy, it's precise, and it just goes very quickly. And I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good. So we're going to look at both, and we're going to see what we're going to come out with something, hopefully.\"\nWhen asked about the possibility of a deal, Trump responded, \"Yeah, it's achievable. Both parties have to agree, yeah, sure.\"\nTurning attention to the situation in the Middle East, Trump addressed Iran's position: \"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. I had 60 days, and they had 60 days, and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. They have to make a deal. And it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war.\"\nHe added a cautionary note: \"And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.\"\nHe also commented on America's support to Israel, stating, \"We've always supported Israel. We have for a long period of time, strongly. And Israel is doing very well right now.\"\nAddressing the possibility of China joining the group, Trump said, \"Why not have China at the G8? Why not have China here, the biggest economy in the world, after the United States? Well, it's not a bad idea. I don't mind that.\"\nClarifying further, he added, \"If somebody wants to suggest China coming in, I think we suggest. But you want to have people that you can talk to, you know. They don't talk to you.\"\nThe G7 summit highlighted the challenges faced by US allies in dealing with Trump's unconventional approach to diplomacy. European diplomats have expressed concerns about Trump's influence on US foreign policy, particularly regarding trade and Russia.\nThe G7, or Group of Seven, is an informal organisation that includes the world's seven wealthiest democracies.\nIt was founded in 1975 when France hosted the first meeting.\nThe current members are the UK, the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy. The European Union is also represented.\nEach year, the leaders meet for a summit, where they discuss pressing economic and geopolitical issues of the day and coordinate policy actions.\nTopics can range from trade to the environment to nuclear safety.\nSince the first summit in France, hosting duties have rotated between member countries. This is Canada's seventh time as host.

A strike in central Israel killed an 80-year-old woman, a 69-year-old woman and a 10-year-old boy, officials said.\n\nCasualty figures weren’t immediately available in Iran, where Israel targeted its Defense Ministry headquarters in Tehran as well as sites that it alleged were associated with the country’s nuclear program. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard claimed that Iranian missiles targeted fuel production facilities for Israeli fighter jets, something not acknowledged by Israel.\n\nAmid the continued conflict, planned negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear program were cancelled, throwing into question when and how an end to the fighting could come.\n\n“Tehran is burning,” Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on social media.\n\nBoth Israel’s military and Iran state television announced the latest round of Iranian missiles as explosions were heard near midnight, while the Israeli security cabinet met.\n\nIsrael’s ongoing strikes across Iran have left the country’s surviving leadership with the difficult decision of whether to plunge deeper into conflict with Israel’s more powerful forces or seek a diplomatic route.\n\nUrgent calls to deescalate\n\nWorld leaders made urgent calls to deescalate and avoid all-out war. The attack on nuclear sites set a “dangerous precedent,” China’s foreign minister said. The region is already on edge as Israel makes a new push to eliminate the Iranian-backed militant group Hamas in Gaza after 20 months of fighting.\n\nIsrael — widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East — said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days have killed a number of top generals, nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran’s nuclear program. Iran’s U.N. ambassador has said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency have repeatedly said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon before Israel unleashed its campaign of airstrikes targeting Iran beginning Friday. But Iran’s uranium enrichment has reached near weapons-grade levels, and on Thursday the U.N.’s atomic watchdog censured Iran for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran’s nuclear program his top priority, said Israel’s strikes so far are “nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.”\n\nIn what could be another escalation if confirmed, semiofficial Iranian news agencies reported an Israeli drone struck and caused a “strong explosion” at an Iranian natural-gas processing plant. It would be the first Israeli attack on Iran’s oil and natural gas industry. Israel’s military did not immediately comment.\n\nThe extent of damage at the South Pars natural gas field was not immediately clear. Such sites have air defense systems around them, which Israel has been targeting.\n\nIran calls nuclear talks ‘unjustifiable’\n\nThe sixth round of U.S.-Iran indirect talks on Sunday over Iran ‘s nuclear program will not take place, mediator Oman said. “We remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,” said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomacy.\n\nIran’s top diplomat said Saturday the nuclear talks were “unjustifiable” after Israel’s strikes.

He identified himself as Frontier Valley’s founder.\n\n“America, it’s time to wake up and fight,” Ingallinera said in a video posted to social media platform X, citing the need for the U.S. to lead on artificial intelligence and other advanced technology. If the U.S. falls behind, Ingallinera argued, “China will crush us and that will be the end of America as the world’s greatest superpower.”\n\nIngallinera urged President Donald Trump to issue an executive order re-taking property for the project, by declaring a “national security emergency” over America’s technology leadership.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions about the proposal. Frontier Valley did not immediately respond to questions about whether it had financial backing, and who beside Ingallinera might be leading the purported project.\n\nThe City of Alameda’s Henry said, “No reasonable fact supports the proposed declaration of emergency at Alameda Point.” No one from Frontier Valley had contacted the city by Monday afternoon, Henry said.\n\nThe city is working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a Congressionally authorized VA medical facility at Alameda Point, and also collaborating with the East Bay Regional Park District to develop a 158-acre park beside that facility, Henry said.\n\nIngallinera is listed as an adviser to Carboncopies, a San Francisco non-profit dedicated to replicating the human brain in software to free people from “physical constraints of a body.”\n\nLast July, on the day a would-be assassin wounded Trump, Ingallinera said on X that he would vote for Trump in November and “voice my support publicly and unabashedly, social and financial consequences be damned.”\n\nTrump in 2023 called for a contest to create 10 “freedom cities” on federal land to boost Americans’ standard of living.\n\nOn the video, Ingallinera said the 500-acre Frontier Valley site would be “totally secure” with “personnel screening” at the “perimeter,” along with “completely independent governance.”\n\nRenderings on the Frontier Valley website show futuristic scenes of flying vehicles whizzing around skyscrapers, and people mingling with robots.\n\n“We will have total independence from the surrounding Bay Area and the State of California,” Ingallinera said. “Our zone will be led by America’s most bad-ass, deep-tech founders, who also crucially embody pro-human, pro-freedom ideas.”\n\nThe development would function as a template for “cities of the future,” which would be “nearly fully automated, AI- and robotics-driven cities,” Ingallinera said.\n\nThree-quarters of the property would host commercial and industrial enterprises — with hundreds of startups and larger organizations — and much of the rest would go toward housing for up to 10,000 people, Ingallinera said. Also in the plan are a “downtown strip” and 60-acre waterfront park, Ingallinera said.\n\nHe and Frontier Valley’s website promised a focus on new computer chips, energy sources, robots, drones, military technology, quantum computing and biotechnology.\n\nIngallinera in the video attacked what he called a “totally bogus determination” that the development area provides important nesting habitat for the endangered California least tern, a waterbird.\n\nThe claimed project echoes the proposed utopian “California Forever” plan to build a city from scratch in Solano County. Its proponents backed off from the plan in the face of widespread local opposition, but have pivoted to promoting a shipyard-focused project.\n\nBoth Frontier Valley — whose website calls for creation of “self-replicating, sovereign zones” — and California Forever fit the model of the “network state” espoused by certain libertarian-minded technology figures seeking to build micro-nations, said Bay Area journalist Gil Duran, former press secretary to California Gov. Jerry Brown and a former Mercury News reporter, who researches such plans.\n\n“If the plan gains traction, it could become a precedent for companies writing their own rules on public land, testing courts, Congress, and California’s ability to stop it,” Duran wrote Sunday on his blog.","summary":"The claimed project echoes the proposed utopian \"California Forever\" plan to build a city from scratch in Solano County.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/16/trump-supporting-brain-emulation-federal-takeover-alameda-air-station-tech-utopia/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EBT-L-ALAMEDA-04XX-4.jpg?w=1024&h=593","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:07:56","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.244},{"id":332115240,"title":"What is known about Vance Boelter so far?","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Vance Boelter, the man accused of assassinating the top Democrat in the Minnesota House held deeply religious and politically conservative views, telling a congregation in Africa two years ago that the U.S. was in a “bad place” where most churches didn’t oppose abortion.\n\nVance Luther Boelter, 57, was captured late Sunday following a two-day search authorities described as the largest in the state’s history. Boelter is accused of impersonating a police officer and gunning down former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home outside Minneapolis. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz described the shooting as “a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nSen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were shot earlier by the same gunman at their home nearby but survived.\n\nRelated: ‘Her mirthful eyes, her sharp humor’: Colleagues remember Melissa Hortman, assassinated at age 55\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by AP described Boelter as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for President Donald Trump. Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota where voters don’t list party affiliation.\n\nNear the scene at Hortman’s home, authorities say they found an SUV made to look like those used by law enforcement. Inside they found fliers for a local anti-Trump “No Kings” rally scheduled for Saturday and a notebook with names of other lawmakers. The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nRelated: Sen. Tina Smith contemplates increased security after shooting of Democratic lawmakers\n\nBoth Hortman and Hoffman were defenders of abortion rights at the state legislature.\n\nBoelter not believed to have made any public threats before attacks, official says\n\nDrew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said at a briefing on Sunday that Boelter is not believed to have made any public threats before the attacks. Evans asked the public not to speculate on a motivation for the attacks. “We often want easy answers for complex problems,” he told reporters. “Those answers will come as we complete the full picture of our investigation.”\n\nFriends told the AP that they knew Boelter was religious and conservative, but that he didn’t talk about politics often and didn’t seem extreme.\n\n“He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,” said Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.\n\nA glimpse of Boelter’s beliefs on abortion during a trip to Africa\n\nBoelter, who worked as a security contractor, gave a glimpse of his beliefs on abortion during a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023. While there, Boelter served as an evangelical pastor, telling people he had first found Jesus as a teenager.\n\n“The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong in many churches,” he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.\n\nHe appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.\n\n“He never talked to me about abortion,” Schroeder said. “It seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.”\n\nThe church Boelter attended outside Minneapolis issued a statement Sunday condemning the shootings as “the opposite of what Jesus taught his followers to do.”\n\n“This incident has devastated our church family and does not reflect our values or beliefs,” the Jordan Family Church said on its website, adding it was cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nSeeking to reinvent himself\n\nA married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.\n\nHe worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online.\n\nAfter getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master’s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.\n\nAfter moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.\n\nIn that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.\n\nLaunching a security firm\n\nRecords show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter’s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company’s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and “Praetorian” painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company’s name across the front.\n\nIn an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.\n\n“It has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,” he wrote in a message shared with the AP.\n\nBut once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities — a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter “voluntarily left” that position about four months ago.\n\n“This is devastating news for all involved,” Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter’s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.\n\nBoelter had also started spending some nights away from his family, renting a room in a modest house in northern Minneapolis shared by friends. Heavily armed police executed a search warrant on the home Saturday.\n\nBoelter: ‘I’m going to be gone for awhile’\n\nIn the hours before Saturday’s shootings, Boelter texted two roommates to tell them he loved them and that “I’m going to be gone for a while,” according to Schroeder, who was forwarded the text and read it to the AP.\n\n“May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” Boelter wrote. “I don’t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don’t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I’m sorry for the trouble this has caused.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Mike Balsamo contributed to this report from Washington.

Thompson se hizo eco de las palabras del propio Walz, que calificó el incidente como un ataque por motivos políticos.\n\n“Se trató de un asesinato político, una palabra que no usamos muy a menudo en Estados Unidos”, dijo el fiscal federal interino, que apuntó que este es un ejemplo más de la creciente ola de extremismo violento en el país. \n\nEntre los nuevos detalles que revelaron las autoridades pudo conocerse que tras disparar a los dos legisladores y sus parejas, Boelter intercambió tiros con la policía y huyó en un auto que compró en efectivo y luego abandonó a unos cuatro kilómetros de su casa en la localidad de Green Isle, en Minesota.\n\nImágenes mostradas por la policía del interior del todoterreno que el detenido había modificado para que pareciera una patrulla policial y que abandonó frente al domicilio de Hortman muestran que Boelter transportaba, aparte de la pistola semiautomática con la que disparó a sus víctimas, al menos dos subfusiles, un fusil semiautomático AR-15 y un fusil Kalashnikov.\n\nTambién se sabe que Boelter llamó a la puerta de los Hoffman luciendo lo que la policía ha definido como “una máscara de látex hiperrealista\".\n\n“Papá se fue a la guerra anoche. No quiero decir más porque no quiero implicar a nadie”, escribió Boelter a su esposa horas después del tiroteo, según documentos de la acusación. “No hay palabras para explicar cuánto siento esta situación”, escribió en otro mensaje. Los ataques han sido ampliamente rechazados por personalidades de todo el espectro político estadounidense.\n\n “Una violencia tan horrible no será tolerada en EE.UU”, dijo el sábado el presidente Donald Trump, quien adelantó que “la fiscal general, Pam Bondi, y el FBI están investigando la situación y procesarán a todos los involucrados con todo el rigor de la ley\".","summary":"Washington, (EFE).- Autoridades estadounidenses acusaron este lunes al sospechoso de asesinar a tiros a una congresista estatal de Minesota (EE.UU.) y a su esposo, y de disparar a otro legislador y su pareja, con seis cargos federales, incluidos acoso, asesinato y delitos con armas de fuego, varios de los cuales podrían acarrear la cadena perpetua.

She added that the president had “a great day at the G7, even signing a major trade deal with the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.” Leavitt said, “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight.” Tensions in the Middle East dominated talks among world leaders at the summit, held in Canada. The conflict between Israel and Iran entered its fourth day of violence, prompting urgent diplomacy. By Monday afternoon, Trump issued a stark warning on social media, saying: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” The US president has repeatedly urged Iranian leaders to return to the negotiating table, saying they have failed to act even after being given time. “They have to make a deal,” he said, adding that Iranian leaders would “like to talk” but did not do so during the 60-day window before Israel launched its aerial strikes. “They are not winning this war,” Trump said of Iran. “And they should talk and they should talk immediately before it’s too late.” When asked if the US would consider military involvement, Trump responded, “I don’t want to talk about that.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the summit’s host, described the moment as historically significant. “We’re gathering at one of those turning points in history,” he said. “The world’s more divided and dangerous.” Other G7 leaders moved quickly to respond to the crisis. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held informal talks late Sunday to discuss the growing instability in the Middle East. Starmer’s office confirmed the hour-long discussion. Germany is preparing a draft summit statement that will underline the G7’s united stance on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. “Iran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material,” Merz told reporters.","summary":"Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, US President Donald Trump will depart the G7 summit early.

The tech giant's updated community guidelines said its platforms would permit users to accuse people of \"mental illness\" or \"abnormality\" based on their gender or sexual orientation.\"These policy shifts signified a dramatic reversal of content moderation standards the company had built over nearly a decade,\" said the survey published by digital and human rights groups including UltraViolet, GLAAD, and All Out.\"Among our survey population of approximately 7,000 active users, we found stark evidence of increased harmful content, decreased freedom of expression, and increased self-censorship.\"One in six respondents in the survey reported being the victim of some form of gender-based or sexual violence on Meta platforms, while 66 percent said they had witnessed harmful content such as hateful or violent material.Ninety-two percent of surveyed users said they were concerned about increasing harmful content and felt \"less protected from being exposed to or targeted by\" such material on Meta's platforms.Seventy-seven percent of respondents described feeling \"less safe\" expressing themselves freely.The company declined to comment on the survey.In its most recent quarterly report, published in May, Meta insisted that the changes in January had left a minimal impact.\"Following the changes announced in January we've cut enforcement mistakes in the US in half, while during that same time period the low prevalence of violating content on the platform remained largely unchanged for most problem areas,\" the report said.But the groups behind the survey insisted that the report did not reflect users' experiences of targeted hate and harassment.\"Social media is not just a place we 'go' anymore.

While Baker concedes that Trump is unpopular, he describes pro-MAGA voters as “the most consequential political force of modern times, rewriting all of the rules along the way.”\n\nHere’s some context on Baker’s purple prose: Trump’s most significant political victory came in 2024 where he won the popular vote by 1.5% over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump lost the 2020 election by almost 5 points against former President Joe Biden and lost the popular vote in 2016 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Former President Barack Obama, the most recent two-term president before Trump, won by over 7 points in 2008 and nearly 4 points in 2012.\n\nEven worse, Baker’s column comes after yet another bloody weekend during a Trump presidency, not to be confused with the steady succession of bloody weekends that occurred during his first term as COVID-19 ravaged the nation and he pushed quack medicine and anti-Chinese racism.\n\nOn Sunday, Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot dead in an apparent political assassination. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were also shot at their home, but are expected to recover. Early reporting indicates the alleged shooter was a Trump fan who espoused similar views to him opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. The shooting follows years of Trump endorsing and encouraging political violence—including the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that he incited.\n\nOn the same day the killings occurred, Trump was indulging in another fantasy of his, presiding over a military parade on the streets of Washington, D.C. While the president previously expressed envy at well-organized military parades in other nations, the D.C. event was a sparsely attended affair that didn’t even have the polish of a military parade held the same day at Disney World.\n\nBut millions of Americans turned out on the very same day to protest Trump and his lackeys like Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and billionaire benefactor Elon Musk at “No King” protests across the nation. Unsurprisingly, the Times could only muster a print headline noting “thousands” had marched.\n\nThis is an ongoing pattern at the Times. The writers there have veered from a cringe-inducing review of Trump’s presidential portrait (they claimed he was “smizing,” Tyra Banks-style) to uncritically regurgitating his spin on taxes to presenting an obvious political operative as a simple man-on-the-street Black Trump supporter.\n\nThe past 10 years have seen the mainstream media trying over and over to normalize Trump despite all his obvious abnormalities, and the Times has led the charge. Trump is unpopular, which shows that the public doesn’t buy the lies—but the Times is too busy cheering on and normalizing his administration to notice.\n\nRelated | 10 years of trouble, terror, and tussling thanks to Trump","summary":"The New York Times’ chief White House correspondent Peter Baker penned a “news analysis” on Monday that goes on at length about “The Age of Trump.” The cringe-worthy column, meant to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of Donald Trump first entering the Republican presidential race by maligning Mexican people as rapists, comes as the nation continues to deal with the fallout from his time in office—including rampant crime, countless deaths, and rising authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nBaker sounds more like a fan gushing over a celebrity than a journalist discussing a conspiracy theorist bigot with dictatorial aspirations.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump salutes during a parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with his 79th birthday on June 14 in Washington, as Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and first lady Melania Trump watch.\n\n\n“Ten years of jaw-dropping, woke-busting, scandal-defying, status quo-smashing politics that have transformed America for good or ill in ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/6/16/2328426/-New-York-Times-proclaims-The-Age-of-Trump-as-nation-goes-to-hell?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1445760/story_image/AP25165681279913.jpg?1750110299","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:01:09","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":332116404,"title":"What is President Sheinbaum’s agenda at the G7?","text":"President Claudia Sheinbaum will hold bilateral talks with several world leaders at the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada on Tuesday, but U.S. President Donald Trump will not figure among them.\n\nSheinbaum was scheduled to meet with Trump on Tuesday.

She was invited to attend the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, by Prime Minister Carney.\n\nThe leaders of several other non-G7 nations, including those of India, Ukraine, Brazil and Australia, will attend the annual meeting of the G7, which includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nSheinbaum’s full schedule for Tuesday, as reported by Mexican media, appears below.\n\n11:20 a.m. – 11:30 (local Alberta time): Participation in the official G7 photo shoot.\n11:40 – 12:10: Meeting with von der Leyen and Costa.\n12:20 – 12:50: Bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi.\n13:00 – 15:30: G7 plenary session.\n15:40 – 16:40: CANCELED: Bilateral meeting with U.S. President Trump.\n16:40 – 17:40: Bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Merz.\n17:40 – 18:10: Bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Carney.\n\nThe New York Times reported that both the global economy and the war in Ukraine will be “difficult topics” at this year’s G7 Summit.\n\nSheinbaum pledged to defend Mexicans on both sides of the border in meeting with Trump \n\nSheinbaum has spoken to Trump by telephone on seven separate occasions since she became president last October. However, the meeting in Canada was to be the first time the two leaders had held face-to-face talks.\n\nAt an event in Tlaxcala on Saturday, the president had noted that she would meet with Trump “and his team” in Canada.\n\n“You should know that we will honorably defend Mexicans here and on the other side of the border,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum said she would be “firm” in her meeting with Trump, but open to dialogue and committed to “seeking agreements for the well-being of our nations and people.”\n\nShe also said she would convey the message that “when we’re together we’re stronger” and that “when we respect each other we’re stronger.”\n\n“That’s what we’re going to defend, always with our heads held high, always with valor, because we defend and represent the people of Mexico, a generous, brave, hardworking people, who work here in our country and also on the other side of the border,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nSecurity, migration and trade would have been other top issues for discussion in the president’s meeting with Trump.\n\nThe number of encounters between U.S. authorities and migrants, and fentanyl seizures at the Mexico-U.S. border, have declined significantly since Trump began his second term on Jan. 20, indicating that the northward flow of migrants and fentanyl has fallen in recent months.\n\nEarlier this month, Sheinbaum attributed the “very significant” decline in fentanyl seizures at the border to her government making fentanyl busts on “this side of the border” — including the largest bust in Mexican history last December.\n\nUnited States officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have acknowledged Mexico’s cooperation on security matters, but trade remains a contentious issue between the two countries.\n\nAfter a meeting last Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, Sheinbaum acknowledged that there are a range of “issues” (and tensions) in the Mexico-United States relationship.\n\n“There’s the cattle issue,” she said, referring to the United States’ suspension of livestock imports from Mexico due to the detection of New World screwworm cases in Mexican cattle.\n\n“[There is] the issue of taxes on remittances, there is the steel and aluminum [tariff],” Sheinbaum said.\n\nPrior to Trump’s abrupt departure from the G7 on Monday, Barthélémy Michalon, an international relations professor at the Tec. de Monterrey University, told the news website Expansión that Sheinbaum’s meeting with Trump at the G7 Summit would take place on a “stage” that would be “much less tense” than a meeting at the White House.\n\n“We’ve been witness to receptions of political leaders there with a rather adverse environment toward the guest,” he said, referring to Trump’s meetings at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February, and with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May.\n\n“So [the G7 Summit provides] a way to meet with Trump without these conditions of possible hostility,” Michalon said.\n\nTrump has called Sheinbaum a “terrific person” and a “fantastic woman,” but has also accused her of being “afraid” of Mexican drug cartels.\n\nThe White House asserted in February that “the government of Mexico has afforded safe havens for the cartels to engage in the manufacturing and transportation of dangerous narcotics, which collectively have led to the overdose deaths of hundreds of thousands of American victims.”\n\nSheinbaum says ‘the people of Mexico’ will accompany her on trip to Canada\n\nIn Tlaxcala on Saturday, Sheinbaum declared that “the people of Mexico” will accompany her on her trip to Canada — her third international trip as president after journeys to Brazil, to attend the G20 Summit last November, and to Honduras, to attend the summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) in April.\n\nSalimos de la Ciudad de México a la Cumbre de Líderes del G7 en Canadá. pic.twitter.com/5HVbGeXsU5\n— Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo (@Claudiashein) June 16, 2025\n\n“On Monday, we’re going to a meeting to which we were invited. I use the plural because the people of Mexico are going, all of us together. When the presidenta goes to international meetings, we all go together. We’re going to honorably represent the people of Mexico,” she said.\n\nOn Monday morning, Sheinbaum shared photos to social media that showed her at the Mexico City airport and boarding her Air Canada flight to Vancouver, from where she was scheduled to travel to Calgary, Alberta, on Monday afternoon. Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente is among the Mexican officials who will be present at the G7 Summit alongside the president.\n\nRafael Velázquez Flores, president of the Mexican Association of International Studies, told Expansión that Sheinbaum made the “right” decision in taking up Carney’s invitation to attend the G7 Summit.\n\n“Mexico must be present in the main global forums to take advantage of opportunities that promote the national interest,” he said.\n\n“Not every country is invited to this [G7] meeting, so it is a privilege for Mexico,” Velázquez said.\n\nWith reports from Radio Fórmula and El Universal","summary":"Sheinbaum departed Mexico City on Monday for the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada, where she will hold bilateral talks with several world leaders.\n\n\nThe post What is President Sheinbaum&#8217;s agenda at the G7? appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/sheinbaum-agenda-g7/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GtmlD1na0AICIbm.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:01:07","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.275}]}
