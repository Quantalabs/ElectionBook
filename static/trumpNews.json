Before his arrest, he told NBC News, he was taking out his phone. One ICE agent threw it on the ground, and another grabbed him. \n\n “I’m a citizen!” he said, according to video. \n\n “He’s a citizen, bro!” an onlooker yelled. \n\n Garcia Venegas, whose parents are from Mexico, told Noticias Telemundo that Immigration and Customs Enforcement said his REAL ID was fake. They detained him in a vehicle, where he gave officials his Social Security number. He was released hours later. \n\n “They took out my wallet, took out my ID,” he told the outlet in Spanish, via The Latin Times. “And they told me it was fake. Said it wasn’t valid and that it was fake. My ID. They handcuffed me and they handcuffed me really tight.”\n\n “I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that’s happening,” he said.\n\n Immigration officials have arrested and deported thousands of people, making good on Trump’s xenophobic campaign promises. Citizens have been deported, including at least two children with cancer. Trump has defied a judge by deporting people to a notorious prison in El Salvador. And earlier this week, he deported two Asian immigrants to South Sudan, violating a court order. \n\n “He was actually pretty sore when he got back,” Garcia Venegas’ cousin Shelah Venegas told NBC News. “He said his arms were hurting and his hands. His wrists, you could see where he had all the marks from the handcuffs. … The way they put him on the ground, his knees also were hurting.”\n\n “Apparently a REAL ID is not valid anymore. He has a REAL ID,” she said. “We all made sure we have the REAL ID and went through the protocols the administration is asking for. … He has his REAL ID and then they see him and I guess because his English isn’t fluent and/or because he’s brown it’s fake, it’s not real.”\n\n A REAL ID is an identification card that can be used to fly and enter federal buildings. It has higher federal security standards than a driver’s license. A rule went into effect earlier this month that travelers need a REAL ID or a passport in airports. \n\n ICE also detained Garcia Venegas’ brother, who was not in the country legally. He reportedly signed deportation papers, wanting to avoid another family member’s experience of spending months in a detention center. \n\n Garcia Venegas “physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, told NBC News. “Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”\n\n Venegas said her family owns a contracting company, and some people are refusing to come to work in the current political climate. \n\n “It’s just insane we can’t be different, the color that we are. We contribute to this country the same way every other citizen does with their taxes,” she said. “But we have to be the ones that every time we go to work, we are going to be scared that we’re going to get discriminated [against].”","summary":"The arrested construction worker had to tell officials his Social Security number before he could be released","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-ice-detains-u-s-citizen-real-id-1235347874/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PoliceICEphoto-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 01:11:44","author":"Althea Legaspi,Naomi Lachance","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Naomi Lachance"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":324565906,"title":"Bank of England warned Downing Street against building a Chinese embassy near sensitive financial centres in London, Trump security advisers have revealed","text":"The Bank of England has warned Downing Street against allowing a Chinese embassy to be built near sensitive financial centres in London, Donald Trump’s security advisers have revealed.\n\nThe plan for the ‘super embassy’ was blocked by the previous government amid British intelligence warnings about its location and espionage risk, but has now been revived.\n\nMapping data shows the proposed site lies directly between financial hubs in the City and Canary Wharf and close to three major data centres.\n\nDowning Street refused to say if it was backing the embassy plans to boost trading relations with the Chinese.\n\nWithin a fortnight of Chancellor Rachel Reeves returning from an official visit to China this year, both Scotland Yard and Tower Hamlets Council mysteriously dropped their objections to the project.\n\nNow the Bank of England’s opposition to building the embassy has been revealed by American intelligence sources to justify the US’s own concerns.

West","text":"Syrian authorities on Saturday announced an interior ministry restructuring that includes fighting cross-border drug and people smuggling as they seek to improve ties with Western nations that have lifted sanctions.\n\nKeen to reboot and rebuild nearly 14 years after a devastating civil war broke out, the new authorities in Damascus have hailed Washington's lifting of US sanctions.\n\nThe move was formalised Friday after being announced by President Donald Trump on a Gulf tour this month during which he shook hands with Syria's jihadist-turned-interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nSpokesman Noureddine al-Baba said the interior ministry restructure included reforms and creating \"a modern civil security institution that adopts transparency and respects international human rights standards\".\n\nIt includes setting up a citizens' complaints department and incorporating the police and General Security agency into an Internal Security command, he told a press conference.\n\nA border security body for Syria's land and sea frontiers will be tasked with \"combating illegal activities, particularly drug and human smuggling networks\", Baba said.\n\nThe restructure includes \"strengthening the role of the anti-drug department and further developing its importance within Syria and abroad\" after the country became a major exporter of illicit stimulant captagon, he added.\n\nAnother department will handle security for government facilities and foreign missions, as embassies reopen in Syria following Bashar al-Assad's ouster in December.\n\nA tourism police body will secure visitors and sites as the war-torn country -- home to renowned UNESCO World Heritage sites -- seeks to relaunch tourism.\n\n- 'Of critical importance' -\n\nSyria's foreign ministry welcomed Washington's lifting of sanctions, calling the move \"a positive step in the right direction to reduce humanitarian and economic struggles in the country\".\n\nTurkish foreign ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said the recent US and European Union steps to lift sanctions were \"of critical importance in efforts to bring stability and security to Syria\".\n\nThe European Union announced the lifting of its economic sanctions on Syria earlier this month.\n\nSharaa met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday on his third visit to Turkey since taking power on a visit to discuss \"common issues\", Syria's presidency said.\n\nAnkara is a major backer of Syria's new authorities, who are negotiating with Kurdish forces that control swathes of the northeast and that Turkey considers \"terrorists\".\n\nA government delegation made a first visit Saturday to the notorious Al-Hol camp in the northeast that hosts families of suspected Islamic State (IS) group jihadists.\n\nTrump said he wanted to give Syria's new rulers \"a chance at greatness\" after their overthrow of Assad.\n\nWhile in Istanbul, Sharaa met with the US ambassador to Turkey, who doubles as Washington's Syria envoy.\n\nIn a statement, Tom Barrack said: \"President Trump's goal is to enable the new government to create the conditions for the Syrian people to not only survive but thrive.\"\n\nHe added that it would aid Washington's \"primary objective\" of ensuring the \"enduring defeat\" of IS.\n\nUS sanctions were first imposed on Syria in 1979 under the rule of Bashar al-Assad's father Hafez.\n\nThey were sharply expanded after the bloody repression of anti-government protests in 2011 triggered Syria's civil war.\n\nThe new administration has been looking to build relations with the West and roll back sanctions, but some governments expressed reluctance, pointing to the Islamist past of leading figures.\n\n- 'Recovery and reconstruction' -\n\nThe sanctions relief extends to the new government on condition that Syria does not provide safe haven for terrorist organisations and ensure security for religious and ethnic minorities, the US Treasury Department said.\n\nConcurrently, the US State Department issued a 180-day waiver for the Caesar Act to make sure that sanctions do not obstruct foreign investment in Syria.\n\nThe 2020 legislation severely sanctioned any entity or company cooperating with the now ousted government.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the waiver would \"facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation, and enable a more effective humanitarian response across Syria\".\n\nHowever, Rubio cautioned that Trump \"has made clear his expectation that relief will be followed by prompt action by the Syrian government on important policy priorities\".\n\nHe said lifting the sanctions aims to promote \"recovery and reconstruction efforts\".\n\nSyria's 14-year civil war killed more than half a million people and ravaged its infrastructure.\n\nThe interior ministry's spokesman said around a third of the population had been under suspicion by the Assad government's feared intelligence and security services.\n\nAnalysts say a full lifting of sanctions may take time, as some US restrictions are acts that need to be reversed by Congress.\n\nSyrian authorities also need to ensure an attractive environment for foreign investment.\n\nbur-nad/lg/dcp/ysm","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/syria-hails-us-lifting-assad-092742026.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/53c606c14eb8ddae8f859555a7519ccc","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25

fight them off to avoid swallowing them.\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted a \"planned partnership\" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., saying it would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the world's biggest economy.\n\nA White House official said Trump's post on social media suggested he had approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, despite Washington's concerns that the deal could heighten national security risks.\n\nWASHINGTON - The United States is increasingly recognizing the importance of Japan for its economy, the Asian country's chief tariff negotiator said Friday, after holding another round of talks with U.S. Cabinet members aimed at an early trade deal.\n\nRyosei Akazawa said he was

From drag queens to trophy wives, the president’s ramblings covered a wide range of bizarre topics in between shots at Russia, Biden, and Obama as he spoke to the graduating cadets.\n\nHowever, one avenue of free-associative speculation Trump meandered along while speaking about military investment seemed to confirm that one of his much-derided beliefs remains intact: the president seems to genuinely believe that so-called “stealth” fighter jets—military aircraft designed to be difficult to detect by radar—are actually invisible. \n\n“We are buying you new airplanes, brand new beautiful planes, redesigned planes, brand new planes, totally stealth planes,” Trump said, speaking to a proposed record increase in defense spending. \n\n“I hope they’re stealth. I don’t know, that whole stealth thing, I’m sort of wondering.\n\n“We shape a wing this way, they don’t see it. But the other way they see it? I’m not so sure, but that’s what they tell me!“\n\nThis is familiar territory for Trump, who has made similar remarks since at least 2017. In October of that year, Trump concerned reporters when discussing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in Puerto Rico.\n\n“Amazing job,” Trump said at the time. “So amazing we are ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the Air Force, especially the F-35. You like the F-35? ... You can’t see it. You literally can’t see it. It’s hard to fight a plane you can’t see.”\n\n“That’s an expensive plane you can’t see.”\n\nAt a Thanksgiving Day visit to a Coast Guard Station in Florida that same year, Trump doubled down on this seeming belief, saying he had asked “some Air Force guys” whether flying an “invisible” plane would look like what he had seen in films. \n\n“I said, ‘How good is this plane?’ They said, ‘Well, sir, you can’t see it.’ I said, yeah, but in a fight—you know, a fight, like I watch in the movies—they fight, they’re fighting. How good is this? They say, ‘Well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it. Even if it’s right next to it, it can’t see it.’ I said, ‘That helps. That’s a good thing.’”\n\nYears of experience as Commander in Chief do not seem to have steered Trump toward the realization that such planes, which are shaped to either deflect or absorb incoming radar signals used to track movement, are meant to be difficult to detect. But can still be seen by the naked eye. In 2020, there was this remark: \n\n“[The F-35 is] the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by far. Stealth. Totally stealth. You can’t see it. Makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot, ‘What do you think is better: This one? This one? That one?’ Talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes. He said, ‘Well, the advantage we have is you can’t see it.’ So when we’re fighting, they can’t see us. I say, ‘That sounds like a really big advantage to me.’”\n\nWhile Trump is no stranger to wild exaggerations and hyperbolic comparisons, the repeated factual inaccuracy over the invisibility capabilities of military aircraft continues to raise eyebrows. \n\nBritish journalist Mehdi Hassan, in picking up on the most recent “invisible” planes comment, wrote that it was difficult to determine if such remarks are “ignorance” or “inanity.”\n\n”His weirdness cannot be overstated,“ Hassan concluded.","summary":"NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP via Getty ImagesAs expected, President Donald Trump‘s commencement speech at West Point on Saturday was packed with characteristically unhinged tangents.

Sharaa, an Islamist rebel, initially came to Syria from Iraq to fight Assad with the support of the Islamic State, but later broke with the group and pledged allegiance to al-Qaida. He broke with al-Qaida as well, in 2016.\n\nHis militant group, the al-Nusra Front, rebranded twice, becoming Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in 2017. HTS was designated a terrorist organization by the United States.\n\n“President al-Sharaa praised America’s fast action on lifting sanctions,” Trump’s envoy reported after the talks on Saturday.\n\n“This meeting was historic, putting the issue of sanctions – as President Trump has indicated – far behind us, and resulting in joint commitment of both our countries to drive forward, quickly, with investment, development, and worldwide branding of a new, welcoming Syria without sanctions.”\n\nAmong the projects now possible is a Trump Tower Damascus, proposed as part of an effort to entice the US president into removing sanctions. Trump himself appears to have been impressed by a recent meeting with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia; the US president told reporters that the former commander of al-Qaida’s franchise in Syria was a “young, attractive guy, tough guy, you know. Strong past. Very strong past.

On stage, Panahi received cheers from Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at Cannes had held up Panahi’s name to honor the filmmaker while he was under house arrest.\n\nOn stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.\n\n“Let us join forces,” said Panahi.\n\n“No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do.

(Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP)\n\nThe win for It Was Just an Accident extend an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d’Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired It Was Just an Accident for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for Parasite, Titane, Triangle of Sadness, Anatomy of a Fall and Anora.\n\nAll those films were Oscar contenders and two, Parasite and Anora, won best picture.\n\nLast year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike is friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn’t for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.\n\nIt Was Just an Accident was inspired by Panahi’s experience in prison.

Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.\n\nIn 2009, he was banned from from travelling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continue to make films illegally in Iran, without permit, and having his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.\n\n“The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,” Binoche told reporters after the ceremony.\n\n“Art will always win.

The festival’s films, he said, supplied “all the needed electricity.”\n\nOther winners at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival\n\nThe Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family drama Sentimental Value, his lauded follow-up to The Worst Person in the World. Some had expected Sentimental Value to win the Palme, but Trier â whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve â still took a major prize.\n\n“We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,” said Trier.\n\n“And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.”\n\nDirectors Jean-Pierre Dardenne, left, and Luc Dardenne, winners of award for best screenplay.

Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for The Secret Agent showed the jury’s strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, “That was our wish.”\n\nThe wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles’ I’m Still Here in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, said the awards “show that our country’s cinema is second to none”.\n\nThe jury prize was split between two films: Ãliver Laxe’s desert road trip SirÃ¢t and Mascha Schilinski’s German, generation-spanning drama Sound of Falling.

Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world’s largest movie market, US President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100 per cent tariff on movies made overseas.\n\nMost filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. “Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn’t ship that way,” said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, The Phoenician Scheme at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honourary Palme d’Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump “America’s philistine president.”\n\nOther top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee’s Highest 2 Lowest (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner Mission: Impossible â Final Reckoning, and Ari Aster’s Eddington, which found a divisive reaction.\n\nWhat Muhammad Ali was shouting in the most famous sports photo of all time\n\nPanahi’s win put him in rare company. He’s now won Cannes’ Palme d’Or, Venice’s Golden Lion (for The Circle) and Berlin’s Golden Bear (for Taxi). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.\n\nAddressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, “even in complicated situations.”\n\n“They must realise that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,” said Panahi.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi took home the Palme d&#8217;Or at the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Exonerated Iranian Director Receives Prestigious Cannes Prize first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/exonerated-iranian-director-receives-prestigious-cannes-prize/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Formerly-jailed-Iranian-filmmaker-wins-top-Cannes-award.au2Ffs2F637d60dc-afc7-4f3e-9e32-c9f984060608.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 00:04:39","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.259},{"id":324561592,"title":"Trump's new Middle East leaves Israel out - and it's a wake up call","text":"US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Gulf signals the dawn of a new Middle East paradigm where Israel finds itself uninvited to the table it helped set. And as the old saying goes, “If you’re not at the table, you’re probably on the menu.”For over 18 months, Israel shouldered the weight of regional conflict, achieving significant military objectives that provided the political oxygen for Trump’s grand Gulf summit. The decimation of Hezbollah, the isolation of Hamas, the weakening of Iran, and the collapse of Assad’s regime – none would have occurred without Israel’s strategic pressure campaign. Yet when Trump convened leaders in Riyadh, Doha, and Abu Dhabi to discuss a new regional compact, Israel was nowhere in sight.Why? Because Israel’s current leadership is stuck fighting yesterday’s wars. If Israel wants back in, it must rethink what it is offering, not only as a fortress, but as a bridge.console.log(\"2390 BODY2.

Trump’s Middle East vision prioritizes results over sentiment. He praised the Gulf states for achieving “peace, prosperity, and progress” through self-reliance, cultural authenticity, and sovereign ambition, explicitly distancing himself from the neoconservatism and nation-building vision of previous administrations.“You achieved a modern miracle the Arabian way,” Trump told Gulf leaders, signaling that the US now seeks business partners, not ideological allies. Israel can no longer rely on being “the only democracy in the Middle East.” The bar has shifted from shared values to demonstrated value.Iraninan newspapers, including one with a cover photo of US President Donald Trump and his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, are on display in Tehran this week. The only deal Iran might accept would essentially resemble the JCPOA, with all its inherent flaws, the writer cautions. (credit: WEST ASIA NEWS AGENCY/REUTERS)The Israeli government’s commitment to “total victory” has led Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing partners to misread the room entirely. The first weeks after Trump’s election seemed like a wet dream for Jerusalem: Trump threatened that “hell will break out” if the hostages weren’t released, lifted the block on 2,000-pound bombs, and invited Netanyahu to the White House for a red-carpet rollout of the controversial “Gaza plan.”But what Israeli officials mistook for a blank check was a deal with a clear expiration date. The signals came quickly: Trump’s envoy initiated quiet talks with Hamas behind Israel’s back. Netanyahu’s emergency DC visit yielded no strike on Iran. Instead, Trump announced direct diplomatic talks with Tehran. Soon after, American strikes on the Houthis stopped without guarantees for Israeli security. Trump is serious about his ambition to be peacemakerTHESE ACTIONS demonstrate that Trump is serious about his ambition to be a peacemaker and deliver on his promise of no new wars. The Israeli Right now confronts a deeper American strategy: stabilizing the Middle East in favor of those ready to do business, all in service of building a unified front against America’s real threat: China and the emerging AI war.This strategic “pivot to Asia” began under Obama, but global crises kept pulling the US back into the region, whether it was the Arab Spring and Syrian civil war, or the Russia-Ukraine war and resulting energy crunch that pushed former US president Joe Biden back toward Riyadh. Trump now believes the conditions are finally ripe to lock in a Middle East policy that reflects clear American priorities.Israel may understand this shift intellectually, but the current leadership remains structurally incapable of adapting. A political coalition rooted in hawkish rhetoric and domestic survivalism struggles to wield diplomatic tools effectively.Trump didn’t come to save Israel. He came to save America. If Israel wants to join the ride, it’s welcome aboard. If not, it will be left fading in the rearview mirror.Though often couched in the language of shared values, the Israel-US special relationship has fundamentally been interest-driven. America supported Israel primarily because it served American strategic interests. This pattern has repeated throughout history: Wilson backed the Balfour Declaration to support Britain in WWI; Eisenhower’s anger over the 1956 Suez Crisis gave way to deeper Cold War ties and the Eisenhower Doctrine; Reagan signed groundbreaking economic and military agreements despite frustrations over Lebanon; and post-9/11, Israel positioned itself as a key ally in the war on terror [officially known as Global War on Terrorism (GWOT)].In each era, Israel presented itself as America’s most efficient and loyal partner. That logic still holds: To regain relevance, Israel must offer more than firepower. It must become a regional connector, a diplomatic broker, a tech and trade facilitator. However Israel isn’t alone in struggling to adapt. The American Jewish community, long a reliable bridge between Jerusalem and Washington, is also at a moment of reckoning. Then-president Harry Truman’s swift recognition of Israel in 1948 followed years of intense lobbying, and for decades, Jewish organizers built a bipartisan wall of congressional support through sophisticated grassroots activism and strategic donor positioning.Political fragmentation, rising antisemitism erodes political capitalTODAY, POLITICAL fragmentation, rising antisemitism, and internal divisions have eroded their political capital. While Jews still overwhelmingly vote Democratic, on matters related to Israel, they increasingly find themselves aligned with evangelical Republicans, placing them at odds with their own political camp. Groups such as AIPAC remain powerful but reactive, focused on blocking anti-Israel candidates rather than articulating a compelling pro-Israel vision.Israel’s current exclusion, paradoxically, offers opportunity.Trump still envisions a broader Abraham Accords framework that could potentially include Syria, Lebanon, and others. In Trump’s calculus, normalization with Israel serves several ends: regional prosperity, security cooperation, containment of Iran, and his coveted Nobel Peace Prize.This moment in the Middle East proves how vital it is for Israel to adapt and rethink its regional positioning.To reclaim its strategic relevance, Israel must offer more than military strength. Its cutting-edge AI and defense technologies can form a crucial third pillar in a new regional triangle to address the challenges of the 21st century: Gulf investment, US power projection, and Israeli R&D.Israel must signal readiness to end the war on terms balancing justice and pragmatism: the full return of all hostages, reconstruction of Gaza with a meaningful GCC presence and a technocratic Palestinian Authority (PA), and the total disarmament of Hamas. As Hamas attempts to replicate Hezbollah’s model of political integration without disarmament, Israel must set a firm boundary while offering incentives like expanded West Bank autonomy.Economically, Israel must elevate its role in the IMEC corridor, positioning itself as a builder of a land bridge that undercuts Houthi maritime threats. This includes deepening integration with Jordan and Egypt, as well as pragmatic cooperation with Syria and Turkey.American Jews must also rise to the moment. Institutional leaders who failed to prepare for today’s antisemitism must make room for younger, bolder voices. A new generation of post-October 7 Jews must reengage in civic and political life, reclaiming Jewish representation across the political spectrum.American Jews should rally around a new strategic vision of the Abraham Accords, not as a diplomatic footnote but as a central pillar of Jewish life in the 21st century.Just as previous generations mobilized to support the founding of the State of Israel, this generation must champion a bold future rooted in regional integration and shared prosperity. This must include investing in educational and civic partnerships that strengthen ties not just between governments, but between peoples.The Israel-US relationship has always rested on two pillars: effective political organizing by American Jews and smart Israeli strategies that align with core American interests. Today, those systems are out of sync, creating a dangerous vulnerability. But if both can recalibrate and recommit to the shared project of alignment with American interests, they won’t need to beg for a seat at the table. They will help design it.The writer is the Middle East Initiative fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and an Elson Israel fellow at the Jewish Federation of Tulsa.","summary":"The Israel-US relationship has always rested on two pillars: effective political organizing by American Jews and smart Israeli strategies that align with core American interests.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-855271","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/664769","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 00:00:51","author":"Barak Sella","authors":["Barak Sella"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":324567364,"title":"China, Indonesia will promote true multilateralism: Li","text":"SHANGHAI: China’s Premier Li Qiang said on Saturday that China and Indonesia will promote “true multilateralism”, the official Xinhua news agency reported, as he landed in Jakarta on a two-day visit to Southeast Asia’s largest economy.\n\nChina has intensified engagement with countries in the region since US President Donald Trump announced hefty import tariffs on its global trading partners earlier this year.\n\nSome levies have since been delayed, while China and the US agreed this month to pause some of their tariffs.

He’s likely hoping that by ramping up tariffs on the EU, he can pressure Brussels into granting significant concessions amid his ongoing global trade battles.\n\nHowever, this approach is fraught with risk. While negotiations between the US and the EU were progressing at a slow pace, Trump’s recent announcement of a possible 50 per cent tariff on all imports from the EU starting June 1 has sharply increased both the economic and diplomatic stakes.\n\nThis strategy could undermine the recent uplift in global stock markets, which were buoyed by Trump’s softer approach and willingness to negotiate with other countries like the UK and China. Additionally, this move might worsen already tense transatlantic relationships.\n\nThe gamble reflects the frustration of the president and his top officials with what they view as the EU’s obstruction in the negotiations — and a belief that Brussels will concede first or suffer more than the US if there is no deal.\n\n“It’s a classic Trump bullying tactic, it’s what he does. If he doesn’t get what he wants, he pushes back and makes more threats, and then he waits to see what happens,” said Bill Reinsch, a trade policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n\n“It’s intended to get the Europeans to back down — my reading of them is that they won’t,” he added. \n\nIn the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, Trump insisted he wasn’t looking for a quick agreement with Brussels, and vowed that the 50 per cent tariffs would take effect on June 1 as planned. “That’s the way it is,” he said. \n\nUS Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the purpose of the planned tariffs was to “light a fire under the EU” — suggesting that there was some leeway for negotiations before or after the June 1 deadline. \n\nBut the brinkmanship creates uncertainty, warn economists. “The proposed tariffs on the EU highlight a key forecast risk, whereby tariffs remain an ongoing tool to be wielded by the Trump administration whenever negotiations hit a snag. Repeated tariff threats and rollbacks will keep policy uncertainty elevated,” consultancy Oxford Economics wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nWashington’s precise demands on Brussels are unclear. In his social media post on Friday, Trump rattled off his dissatisfaction with many aspects of EU tax, regulatory and trade policy that would be hard to address quickly. \n\nTrade experts in Washington say the administration is frustrated that the EU’s offers are no different from those it has made to the US in the past. \n\n“Normal methods of diplomacy and traditional approaches to trade negotiations have not resulted in a US-EU trade agreement by any administration. So I’m not surprised to see the president take a very different tack with the EU,” said Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House official during Trump’s first term, and a partner in international trade policy at law firm Akin Gump. \n\n“These threats of much higher tariffs do create an action forcing event, where the two sides are either going to come to an agreement or they aren’t,” she added. \n\n“The American point of view is that the Europeans don’t understand that this time is different, and it’s not a conventional negotiation,” said Reinsch at CSIS. \n\nOn Friday, EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič spoke with US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and trade representative Jamieson Greer, but there did not appear to be a breakthrough. \n\n“EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests,” Šefčovič wrote on X after the discussions.\n\nEU officials chafe at Trump’s demands, questioning why the world’s biggest trading bloc should offer unilateral concessions.\n\nThey argue that there is only about a 1 percentage point difference between EU and US tariffs and say that value added tax is roughly equivalent to US sales tax.\n\nBrussels is also reluctant to give the US market access denied to other countries, which would breach World Trade Organization rules.\n\nOfficials also point out that while trade policy is handled by the European Commission, many of the barriers the US has issues with are national. \n\n“EU negotiators should hold their nerve. It certainly signals Washington’s edginess and impatience to get a deal,” said Georg Riekeles, associate director at the European Policy Centre in Brussels. \n\nRiekeles urged the EU to copy Canada and China by retaliating strongly. “If the EU is ready to fight back, US bullying and escalation is ultimately so self-harming that you can enter deal territory.”\n\nHowever, countries such as Ireland and Italy, which rely on US exports, have lobbied hard against strong countermeasures — and Trump will be counting on schisms within the bloc to force the EU’s hands.\n\nBut Michael Smart, a former Democratic congressional trade counsel now at Rock Creek Global Advisors, a consulting group in Washington, warned that “if Trump’s plan is to divide the bloc, it likely will have the opposite effect”. \n\nMost member states have so far backed the commission’s approach of engaging but eating up time, believing that eventually Trump will back down because of the damage his tariffs will inflict on the US economy. They have indicated that Brussels is minded to stand firm.\n\n“One of the reasons markets have calmed down is that they have already factored in more concessions from Trump,” said one EU diplomat.\n\n“We don’t make policy decisions on the basis of tweets, at least not on this side of the Atlantic,” said another.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump prides himself on his deal-making skills.

(AP) President Donald Trump used the first service academy commencement address of his second term Saturday to laud graduating West Point cadets for their accomplishments and career choice while also veering sharply into a campaign-style recitation of political boasts and long-held grievances.\n\n“In a few moments, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Trump said at the ceremony at Michie Stadium. “And you will become officers of the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military. And we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.”\n\nWearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, the Republican president told the 1,002 members of the class of 2025 at the U.S. Military Academy that the United States is the “hottest country in the world” and underscored an “America First” ethos for the military.\n\n“We’re getting rid of distractions and we’re focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America’s adversaries, killing America’s enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before,” Trump said. He later said that “the job of the U.S. armed forces is not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures,” a reference to drag shows on military bases that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration halted after Republican criticism.\n\nTrump said the cadets were graduating at a “defining moment” in Army history as he accused political leaders in the past of sending soldiers into “nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us.” He said he was clearing the military of transgender ideas, “critical race theory” and types of training he called divisive and political. \n\nPast administrations, he said, “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars.”\n\nAt times, his remarks were indistinguishable from those heard in a political speech, from his assessment of the country when he left office in January 2021 to his review of last November’s victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, arguing that voters gave him a “great mandate” and “it gives us the right to do what we want to do.”\n\nFrequently turning the focus on himself, he reprised some of his campaign rally one-liners, including the claim that he has faced more investigations than mobster Al Capone.\n\nAt one point the crowd listened as Trump, known for his off-message digressions, referred to “trophy wives” and yachts during an anecdote about the late real estate developer William Levitt, a billionaire friend who Trump said lost momentum.\n\nBut the president also took time to acknowledge the achievements of individual graduates.\n\nHe summoned Chris Verdugo to the stage and noted that he completed an 18.5-mile march on a freezing night in January in just two hours and 30 minutes. Trump had the nationally ranked men’s lacrosse team, which held the No. 1 spot for a time in the 2024 season, stand and be recognized. Trump also brought Army’s star quarterback, Bryson Daily, to the lectern, where the president praised Daily’s “steel”-like shoulder. Trump later used Daily as an example to make a case against transgender women participating in women’s athletics. \n\nIn a nod to presidential tradition, Trump also pardoned about half a dozen cadets who had faced disciplinary infractions.\n\nHe told graduates that “you could have done anything you wanted, you could have gone anywhere.” and that “writing your own ticket to top jobs on Wall Street or Silicon Valley wouldn’t be bad. But I think what you’re doing is better.” \n\nHis advice to them included doing what they love, thinking big, working hard, holding on to their culture, keeping faith in America and taking risks.\n\n“This is a time of incredible change and we do not need an officer corps of careerists and yes men,” Trump said. “We need patriots with guts and vision and backbone.”\n\nJust outside campus, about three dozen demonstrators gathered before the ceremony and were waving miniature American flags. One in the crowd carried a sign that said “Support Our Veterans” and “Stop the Cuts,” while others held up plastic buckets with the message: “Go Army Beat Fascism.”\n\nOn Friday, Vice President JD Vance spoke to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Vance said in his remarks that Trump was working to ensure U.S. soldiers are deployed with clear goals, rather than the “undefined missions” and “open-ended conflicts” of the past.\n\nTrump gave the commencement address at West Point in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the school forced cadets spread out across the country to travel, risking exposure on public transportation, and then land in New York, a coronavirus hot spot.\n\nSwenson reported from Bridgewater, New Jersey.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWEST POINT, N.Y.

However, the nation wants to know how it actually happened (despite several press briefings by the government and the defence forces), so each day Prime Time TV news helpfully brings in bristling moustaches, anchors who literally froth at the mouth and many busybodies who apparently know it all.My earnest plea, therefore, is to declare a ceasefire here in our own country between the two main national parties, the woke and un-woke and the ‘specialists’ of public policy and defence analysts. The nation has moved on and — barring the loonies in every religious and ideological group — people want to hear about other important matters that relate to their welfare and peaceful co-existence. I am reminded of a basic tenet of the Christian faith called the Doctrine of Forbidden Knowledge. When He created the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve, God gave them everything they needed to survive but also warned them, firmly, never to taste the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. We all know what happened when Eve broke that vow. In our own mythology, Sita was asked never to step beyond the Lakshman Rekha and we know what happened when she crossed it.In both cases, the point is that it is best to accept certain boundaries for a harmonious existence. Both sides have scored spectacular self-goals by not heeding this wise advice. The result is that neither can see the good in the other and devise more and more lunatic questions to embarrass their rivals. In fact, it is the Omar Abdullahs and the Owaisis who have won hearts by their dignified responses. There will come a time when they will ask those questions that trouble us all, but timing is so essential. Take the case of the Professor from Ashoka University whose Facebook post led to such a brouhaha that he found himself in custody. Or that pipsqueak who said vile things about one of the Indian Army spokespersons, or the trolls that went after the Foreign Secretary and his daughter…As for our social media warriors and the troll armies, you can almost predict what they are going to say. Can no one see the harm we do to our national reputation worldwide if we treat this sad episode like a World Cup cricket match between Pakistan and India? With so many differing voices, naturally any foreign country will think 10 times before standing up for us. Standing up for whom? This version or that?Let us now switch to something that has really made me feel good and so proud that I’m almost bursting. This is the news that a little-known Indian author, Banu Mushtaq, has been awarded the prestigious International Booker Prize for her short story collection ‘Heart Lamp’, translated by Deepa Bhasthi from Kannada into English. For one, unlike most previous Indian winners of the Booker, Banu comes from a non-English-speaking, economically backward family, is a Muslim woman and a feisty activist who fights for Muslim women’s rights, their education and the stranglehold of the patriarchal families that deny them the space and independence that they seek. Above all, she fights for all those women, Hindu or Muslim, who are poor and are eternally dependent on men. The cruelty they endure, their ceaseless humiliation and marginalisation is different when it comes from the heart of a writer who has actually suffered all this. Unlike the fiction that speaks of an imagined community, Banu’s work has the raw pain and ironic humour that is also so much a part of those who suffer silently.Her translator, Deepa Bhasthi, says that to find the vocabulary to bring Banu’s world into English, she delved deep into how misogyny unfolds by entering kitchens, bedrooms, prayer rooms and the silent soliloquies of women. It is obvious that the same lamp lit both their hearts and the reader begins to understand what the cryptic title of this collection is about. As a translator, I rejoice that we are finally getting to hear voices that never reach our ears. Readers like us who are educated, born into liberal middle-class families, speak mainly in English and brought up in cities and towns are often blind and deaf to the raw language of hardship.Many contemporary feminist writers whose heart bleeds for the poor, the marginalised or the abused are guilty of making their stories vehicles for peddling their own brand of militant literature, that is often presented without those human nuances that come from the heart. Mushtaq says, “I don’t engage in extensive research: my heart itself is my field of study.” It is to her work in upholding Dalit and farmer rights’ movements and her writings as a reporter from Hassan in Lankesh Patrike that she owes her literary career.Her experience as a reporter gave her a deep understanding of how religion, society and politics demand unquestioning obedience from women to turn them into being subordinates forever. Coupled with her own strong heartbeats, her work reached out to a jury that had probably never imagined such lives or heard such tales.This is what I call a true Indian victory.— The writer is a social commentator","summary":"Now that a ceasefire has been declared between India and Pakistan, supposedly achieved by Donald Trump — the new Superman of our planet — we can expect some relief.

And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military. And we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump salutes during the United States Military Academy commencement ceremonies in West Point. (AP)\n\nWearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat, the Republican president told the 1002 members of the class of 2025 at the US Military Academy that the United States is the “hottest country in the world” and underscored an “America First” ethos for the military.\n\n“We’re getting rid of distractions and we’re focusing our military on its core mission: crushing America’s adversaries, killing America’s enemies and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before,” Trump said.\n\nHe later said that “the job of the US armed forces is not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures,” a reference to drag shows on military bases that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration halted after Republican criticism.\n\nCadets listen as President Donald Trump, seen on screen, speaks to United States Military Academy graduating cadets. (AP)\n\nTrump said the cadets were graduating at a “defining moment” in Army history as he accused political leaders in the past of sending soldiers into “nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us”.\n\nHe said he was clearing the military of transgender ideas, “critical race theory” and types of training he called divisive and political.\n\nPast administrations, he said, “subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars.”\n\nProtesters across US rally against Trump and Musk’s ‘hostile takeover’\n\nAt times, his remarks were indistinguishable from those heard in a political speech, from his assessment of the country when he left office in January 2021 to his review of last November’s victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, arguing that voters gave him a “great mandate” and “it gives us the right to do what we want to do”.\n\nFrequently turning the focus on himself, he reprised some of his campaign rally one-liners, including the claim that he has faced more investigations than mobster Al Capone.\n\nAt one point the crowd listened as Trump, known for his off-message digressions, referred to “trophy wives” and yachts during an anecdote about the late real estate developer William Levitt, a billionaire friend who Trump said lost momentum.\n\nBut the president also took time to acknowledge the achievements of individual graduates.\n\nHe summoned Chris Verdugo to the stage and noted that he completed an 18.5-mile (29.7 km) march on a freezing night in January in just two hours and 30 minutes. Trump had the nationally ranked men’s lacrosse team, which held the No. 1 spot for a time in the 2024 season, stand and be recognised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to deliver the commencement speech for the United States Military Academy graduating cadets. (AP)\n\nTrump also brought Army’s star quarterback, Bryson Daily, to the lectern, where the president praised Daily’s “steel”-like shoulder. Trump later used Daily as an example to make a case against transgender women participating in women’s athletics.\n\nIn a nod to presidential tradition, Trump also pardoned about half a dozen cadets who had faced disciplinary infractions.\n\nHe told graduates that “you could have done anything you wanted, you could have gone anywhere.” and that “writing your own ticket to top jobs on Wall Street or Silicon Valley wouldn’t be bad. But I think what you’re doing is better.”\n\nHis advice to them included doing what they love, thinking big, working hard, holding on to their culture, keeping faith in America and taking risks.\n\n“This is a time of incredible change and we do not need an officer corps of careerists and yes men,” Trump said. “We need patriots with guts and vision and backbone.”\n\nJust outside campus, about three dozen demonstrators gathered before the ceremony and were waving miniature American flags. One in the crowd carried a sign that said “Support Our Veterans” and “Stop the Cuts,” while others held up plastic buckets with the message: “Go Army Beat Fascism.”\n\nOn Friday, Vice President JD Vance spoke to the graduating class at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Vance said in his remarks that Trump was working to ensure US soldiers are deployed with clear goals, rather than the “undefined missions” and “open-ended conflicts” of the past.\n\nTrump gave the commencement address at West Point in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the school forced cadets spread out across the country to travel, risking exposure on public transportation, and then land in New York, a coronavirus hot spot.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump used the first service academy commencement address of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Address to Military Grads: &#8216;Eliminating Threats to America&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/trumps-address-to-military-grads-eliminating-threats-to-america/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/039Killing-America039s-enemies039-Trump039s-speech-to-military-graduates.au2Ffs2F9dc7adf0-4b19-45b5-989c-512119663d5f.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 23:10:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":324561016,"title":"Young US men are joining Russian churches promising 'absurd levels of manliness'","text":"\"A lot of people ask me: 'Father Moses, how can I increase my manliness to absurd levels?'\"\n\nIn a YouTube video, a priest is championing a form of virile, unapologetic masculinity.\n\nSkinny jeans, crossing your legs, using an iron, shaping your eyebrows, and even eating soup are among the things he derides as too feminine.\n\nThere are other videos of Father Moses McPherson - a powerfully-built father of five - weightlifting to the sound of heavy metal.\n\nHe was raised a Protestant and once worked as a roofer, but now serves as a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) in Georgetown, Texas, an offshoot of the mother church in Moscow.\n\nROCOR, a global network with headquarters in New York, has recently been expanding across parts of the US - mainly as a result of people converting from other faiths.\n\nIn the last six months, Father Moses has prepared 75 new followers for baptism in his church of the Mother of God, just north of Austin.\n\n\"When my wife and I converted 20 years ago we used to call Orthodoxy the best-kept secret, because people just didn't know what it was,\" he says.\n\n\"But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size.\"\n\nDuring the Sunday liturgy at Father Moses's church, I am struck by the number of men in their twenties and thirties praying and crossing themselves at the back of the nave, and how this religion - with traditions dating back to the 4th century AD - seems to attract young men uneasy with life in modern America.\n\nSoftware engineer Theodore tells me he had a dream job and a wife he adored, but he felt empty inside, as if there was a hole in his heart. He believes society has been \"very harsh\" on men and is constantly telling them they are in the wrong. He complains that men are criticised for wanting to be the breadwinner and support a stay-at-home wife.\n\n\"We are told that's a very toxic relationship nowadays,\" Theodore says. \"That's not how it should be.\"\n\nAlmost all the converts I meet have opted to home-school their offspring, partly because they believe women should prioritise their families rather than their careers.\n\nFather John Whiteford, an archpriest in the ROCOR from Spring, north of Houston, says home-schooling ensures a religious education and is \"a way of protecting your children\", while avoiding any talk about \"transgenderism, or the 57 genders of the month or whatever\".\n\nCompared to the millions of worshippers in America's evangelical megachurches, the numbers of Christian Orthodox are tiny - only about one percent of the population. That includes Eastern Orthodoxy, as practised across Russia, Ukraine, eastern Europe and Greece, and the Oriental Orthodox from the Middle East and Africa.\n\nFounded by priests and clergy fleeing the Russian Revolution in 1917, ROCOR is seen by many as the most conservative Orthodox jurisdiction in the US. Yet this small religious community is a vocal one, and what's unfolding within it mirrors broader political shifts, especially following President Donald Trump's dramatic pivot toward Moscow.\n\nThe true increase in the number of converts is hard to quantify, but data from the Pew Research Centre suggests Orthodox Christians are 64% male, up from 46% in 2007.\n\nA smaller study of 773 converts appears to back the trend. Most recent newcomers are men, and many say the pandemic pushed them to seek a new faith. That survey is from the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), which was established by Russian monks in Alaska in the late 18th Century and now has more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries, and institutions in the US, Canada and Mexico which identify as Russian Orthodox.\n\nProfessor Scott Kenworthy, who studies the history and thought of Eastern Orthodox Christianity - particularly in modern Russia - says his OCA parish in Cincinnati \"is absolutely bursting at the seams\".\n\nHe's attended the same church for 24 years and says congregation numbers remained steady until the Covid lockdown. Since then, there has been constant flow of new inquirers and people preparing to be baptised, known as catechumens.\n\n\"This is not just a phenomenon of my own parish, or a few places in Texas,\" Prof Kenworthy says, \"it is definitely something broader.\"\n\nThe digital space is key in this wave of new converts. Father Moses has a big following online - when he shares a picture of a positive pregnancy test on his Instagram feed he gets 6,000 likes for announcing the arrival of his sixth child.\n\nBut there are dozens of other podcasts and videos presented by Orthodox clergy and an army of followers - mainly male.\n\nFather Moses tells his congregation there are two ways of serving God - being a monk or a nun, or getting married. Those who take the second path should avoid contraception and have as many children as possible.\n\n\"Show me one saint in the history of the Church who ever blessed any kind of birth control,\" Father Moses says. As for masturbation - or what the church calls self-abuse - the priest condemns it as \"pathetic and unmanly\".\n\nFather Moses says Orthodoxy is \"not masculine, it is just normal\", while \"in the West everything has become very feminised\". Some Protestant churches, he believes, mainly cater for women.\n\n\"I don't want to go to services that feel like a Taylor Swift concert,\" Father Moses says.\" If you look at the language of the 'worship music', it's all emotion - that's not men.\"\n\nElissa Bjeletich Davis, a former Protestant who now belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church in Austin, is a Sunday school teacher and has her own podcast. She says many converts belong to \"the anti-woke crowd\" and sometimes have strange ideas about their new faith - especially those in the Russian Church.\n\n\"They see it as a military, rigid, disciplinary, masculine, authoritarian religion,\" Elissa says. \"It's kind of funny. It's almost as if the old American Puritans and their craziness is resurfacing.\"\n\nBuck Johnson has worked as a firefighter for 25 years and hosts the Counterflow podcast.\n\nHe says he was initially scared to enter his local Russian Orthodox Church as he \"looks different, covered in tattoos\", but tells me he was welcomed with open arms. He was also impressed the church stayed open throughout the Covid lockdown.\n\nSitting on a couch in front of two huge TV screens at his home in Lockhart, he says his newfound faith is changing his view of the world.\n\n\"Negative American views on Russia are what worry me,\" Buck says. He tells me the mainstream, \"legacy\" media presents a distorted picture of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"I think there's a holdover from the boomer generation here in America that lived through the Cold War,\" Buck says, \"and I don't quite grasp why - but they say Russia's bad.\"\n\nThe head of the Russian Church in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, has doggedly backed the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a Holy War, and expressing little compassion for its victims. When I ask Archpriest Father John Whiteford about Russia's top cleric, who many see as a warmonger, he assures me the Patriarch's words have been distorted.\n\nFootage and photographs of Putin quoting Bible verses, holding candles during services in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and stripping down to his swim trunks to plunge into icy water at Epiphany, seem to have struck a chord. Some - in America and other countries - see Russia as the last bastion of true Christianity.\n\nNearly a decade ago, another Orthodox convert turned priest from Texas, Father Joseph Gleason, moved from America to Borisoglebskiy, a village four hours' drive north of Moscow, with his wife and eight children.\n\n\"Russia does not have homosexual marriage, it does not have civil unions, it is a place where you can home-school your kids and - of course - I love the thousand-year history of Orthodox Christianity here,\" he told a Russian video host.\n\nThis wispy-bearded Texan is in the vanguard of a movement urging conservatives to relocate to Russia. Last August, Putin introduced fast-track shared values visa for those fleeing Western liberalism.\n\nBack in Texas, Buck tells me he and his fellow converts are turning their backs on instant gratification and American consumerism.\n\n\"We're thinking of things long term,\" Buck says, \"like traditions, love for your family, love for you community, love for neighbours.\n\n\"I think that orthodoxy fits us well - and especially in Texas.\"","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/young-us-men-joining-russian-230519070.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.P.LFpgrrM1K8rOy1PNbWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/8e9359b3e157ef48ab213de2ec664b96","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 23:05:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":324554754,"title":"Palace breaks silence on Princess' future amid shocking Trump administration decision","text":"The Royal Palace of Brussels has been forced to offer a statement after President Donald Trump attempted to deny thousands of international students, including Princess Elisabeth, the heir to the Belgium throne, the ability to study at Harvard University.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth, 23, recently completed her first year of a graduate school program at the world-famous institution, and is now back in Belgium for the summer.\n\nHowever Trump's order — which already has a temporary restraining order against it by a Massachusetts judge – will impact the 2025/2026 class if it goes ahead.\n\nPalace statement\n\nThe palace’s communications head, Xavier Baert, said: \"We are looking into the situation, to see what kind of impact this decision might have on the princess, or not.

After Biden’s catastrophic 2024 debate performance against Trump revealed the extent of his declining health and marked the end of his campaign, why would anyone pay the former president to speak? And who would want to fund a Biden presidential library, as a monument to his legacy in office, when his legacy now includes Trump’s lawless and destructive second term? \n\n Now that the election is over — and the damage is mounting from Trump’s presidency — people are becoming more comfortable talking about what went wrong. One new book in particular outlines how Biden and his inner circle covered up the extent of his failing health. Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, written by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, is based on 200 interviews with Biden insiders who say that things were much worse behind the scenes than his team let on. \n\n This week, Biden’s personal office revealed he has stage 4 prostate cancer. The diagnosis is also putting more pressure on Biden to quickly build an inheritance for his grandchildren, as WSJ said in its report on Saturday. \n\n Biden’s speaking fees — $300,000 to $500,000 — are reportedly below what former President Barack Obama charges, according to the paper. And that is if people hire him. He has given at least one paid speech, but “few organizations have been willing to pay for Biden,” wrote WSJ, which noted that some companies and organizations are reportedly afraid to provoke Trump. \n\n Many Democratic donors are hesitant to donate to Biden’s presidential library. Fundraising for the library “will be a heavy lift in light of all that has transpired,” John Morgan, a lawyer and former major Biden donor, told WSJ. \n\n Morgan said that Biden, who once promised to be “a bridge” candidate, failed to create a bridge for the next generation of Democratic leaders. Donors who supported Biden said they don’t plan to give to his library, and some allies worry the library won’t open in Biden’s lifetime. \n\n Tapper and Thompson’s book has drawn attention for showing that Biden was not in shape to have a second term. \n\n “What we found by writing this book is that everything that we saw going on in front of the camera was much worse behind the scenes,” Tapper told The New Yorker’s David Remnick. \n\n One glaring example highlighted in the book was when Biden did not recognize Democratic fundraiser and A-list actor George Clooney, even when an aide told him, “you know George.” \n\n Tapper and Thompson reported that Biden’s White House produced an atmosphere that stifled dissent, where insiders blocked the president from criticism.\n\n “The point with Biden was such that I have never seen, until maybe the current administration — an administration where the president is so surrounded by people who will never tell him anything negative, ever, and in fact will block negative stuff from coming to him,” Tapper told the New Yorker. \n\n In another book, journalist Chris Whipple writes that Ron Klain, Biden’s former chief of staff, was “struck by how out of touch with American politics he was” on the campaign trail.\n\n Earlier this month, Biden denied claims that his mental status is declining. “They are wrong. There’s nothing to sustain that,” he said on ABC’s The View. \n\n “Then he launched into a rambling response that was consistent with some of the behavior that had alarmed some people who met with him,” WSJ wrote.","summary":"The former president is reportedly having difficulty finding organizations to pay him to speak and donors to fund his presidential library","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-failure-raise-funds-post-presidency-trump-1235347803/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/biden-money-one.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 22:21:13","author":"Althea Legaspi,Naomi Lachance","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Naomi Lachance"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":324555018,"title":"Trump attacks past US policy in speech to new army officers","text":"President Donald Trump salutes cadets during the US Military Academy commencement ceremony at West Point. (AP pic)WEST POINT: President Donald Trump lambasted previous US leaders and policies in a campaign-style speech Saturday to graduating army officers, underscoring his determination to remold the apolitical military to his right-wing ideology.The address to newly minted junior officers at the famed West Point academy in New York featured the annual event’s traditional shout-outs to top students, jokes, and praise for the cadets’ sporting achievements.However, the 78-year-old Republican, who has used the first four months of his second term to attack critics and concentrate power in the White House, quickly turned to edgier topics.The blistering rhetoric got only muted applause from the rows of grey-uniformed cadets.Justifying his isolationist policies and mistrust of historic US alliances, Trump said that for at least two decades, US leaders have “dragged our military into missions…, wasting our time, money and souls.”Troops were “led by leaders who didn’t have a clue in distant lands.”Trump also focused on his decision to rid the military of so-called DEI policies, which are meant to encourage participation by racial and sexual minorities in the ranks, including women.The drive to rid the armed forces of what Trump derides as “woke” initiatives has also seen the removal from military academy bookshelves of scores of books that cover the painful US history of racism.Trump told graduating cadets that his predecessors had been “abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments.”“They subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes while leaving our borders undefended,” he said.“All of that’s ended. You know that,” Trump said. “They’re not even allowed to think about it anymore.”“The job of the US armed forces is not to host drag shows,” he said. “The military’s job is to dominate any foe, to annihilate any threat to America, anywhere.”Criticism of US alliesTrump has successfully channelled disillusionment among Americans after the long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq triggered by the Sept 11, 2001, attacks. He vowed at West Point that the US will not attempt to “spread democracy… at the point of a gun.”But his post-9/11-era reset also includes unprecedented scorn for US allies in Europe and Asia, which he again said on Saturday had been cheating the US.“They don’t rip us off anymore,” he boasted.Adding to the partisan tone of the speech, Trump wore one of his red election campaign hats throughout and talked up his November victory as a “great mandate” which “gives us the right to do what we want to do.”Army officers are not allowed to engage in politics and even when Trump paused for applause, the clapping from the cadets was often sporadic. Those invited to speak briefly at Trump’s podium kept their messages strictly personal – not so much as referring to the president.However, the refashioning of the Pentagon, led by Trump’s ultra-loyal defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has caused open unease in some quarters.Graham Parsons, a professor of philosophy at West Point, resigned this month, saying that the academy had “abandoned its core principles” to comply with White House ideological demands and that he was “ashamed.”New teaching guidelines on shunning discussion of racism or sexism, while insisting on promoting the idea of America as a constant force for good, “were brazen demands to indoctrinate, not educate,” Parsons wrote in The New York Times.","summary":"The president dives into edgier topics at West Point, underscoring efforts to align the military around his ideology.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/05/25/trump-attacks-past-us-policy-in-speech-to-new-army-officers/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dededfa1-donald-trump-west-point-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 22:16:03","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":324547632,"title":"Donald Trump's 'Trophy Wife' Remarks in West Point Speech Raise Eyebrows","text":"President Donald Trump went off on a tangent about a \"trophy wife\" during his commencement address at West Point on Saturday—drawing scrutiny and backlash from some critics online.\"He ended up getting a divorce.

(AP pic)WASHINGTON: Social media platform X was hit by a two-hour outage Saturday, prompting owner Elon Musk to say he needs to spend more time focusing on his companies.His statement echoed comments earlier this month suggesting he would reduce his role in US President Donald Trump’s administration.The world’s richest person has an extraordinarily full plate as owner/CEO of X, xAI (developer of the AI-powered chatbot Grok), electric-car maker Tesla and rocket builder SpaceX – not to mention his recent polarising efforts to help Trump slash the size of the US federal government.As backlash to those cuts grew and Tesla share prices slipped, Musk began drawing away from the government role, confirming last week that he was down to one or two days a week at the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency.”Still, the man who contributed more than US$235 million to Trump’s election campaign remains a close advisor to the US president, attending an Oval Office meeting with the South African president on Wednesday.After the X outage on Saturday, Musk suggested that he may have been away from his companies for too long.“As evidenced by the X uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made,” he said.“The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.”X had largely returned to normal service by 11am US Eastern time (1500 GMT) Saturday.The SITE Intelligence Group reported that hacker-activist group DieNet had claimed responsibility for the outage.DieNet, it said, had called the attack a “test” of its so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) capabilities – flooding the system with online traffic to make it inaccessible to legitimate users.AFP was unable to independently verify DieNet’s claim of responsibility, and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the outage.‘Super focused’ “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,” Musk posted on X.“I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.”SpaceX announced Friday that it plans to attempt a new launch of its mega-rocket Starship next week. Still under development, Starship exploded in flight during two previous launches.Starship is key to Musk’s long-term plans to colonise Mars, and SpaceX has been betting on the launch of numerous Starship prototypes – despite the explosive failures – to quickly identify and address problems.The South African-born billionaire has for weeks been signaling that he would reduce his political role to refocus on his businesses.Early this month, Musk acknowledged that his ambitious effort to slash US federal spending did not fully reach its goals, despite tens of thousands of job cuts and drastic budget reductions.This week, he said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, although he did not rule out backing future causes “if I see a reason.”Of his recent political donations, he said: “I did what needed to be done.”","summary":"The South African-born billionaire admits that he may have been away from his companies for too long.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/05/25/after-brief-x-outage-musk-says-refocusing-on-businesses/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/0e20f829-elon-musk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 21:58:15","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":324549472,"title":"Maryland father mistakenly deported to Salvadoran prison really did flee to avoid MS-13 gang, his teacher and a classmate said","text":"A Maryland father who was erroneously deported back to El Salvador really did flee his home country to avoid gang recruitment, school records obtained by The Washington Post show.\n\nThere is no official evidence linking Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the MS-13 gang, despite repeated claims from Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nThe president and administration officials claim Abrego Garcia’s tattoos are evidence of alleged gang ties, but law enforcement officials and gang experts say they do not definitively indicate any gang affiliation.\n\nAlthough the Salvadoran boy was of prime age to be recruited by MS-13, like many boys in his neighborhood, Abrego Garcia was not one of them, his teacher and a classmate said in the report provided to The Washington Post.\n\nSchool records from 2003 to 2011 reportedly state that Abrego Garcia consistently demonstrated “very good conduct.”\n\nHis friends, however, did become concerned during his school years that Abrego Garcia may be having issues at home.\n\n“He seemed sad, like his mind was on something else,” an anonymous classmate told the outlet.\n\nAbrego Garcia fled to the United States in 2011 at age 16 to join his older brother after gang threats against him and his family, according to his attorneys.\n\nLast month, Abrego Garcaa’s wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura told The Washington Post that her husband’s fears from childhood followed him for years, making him cry and sweat in his sleep.\n\n“He never talked about them, but I could see it,” Vasquez Sura said.\n\nFollowing a March traffic stop, Abrego Garcia was detained by federal agents and deported to El Salvador’s brutal Terrorism Confinement Center despite a court order preventing his removal from the country. He was later transferred to a Salvadoran prison for non-gang members.\n\nHe had been working as a sheet-metal apprentice and living with his wife and their 5-year-old child, both U.S. citizens, along with two other children from a previous relationship.\n\nLast month, District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Xinis’s ruling and called his removal “illegal.”\n\nXinis has since clashed with government attorneys as they push to withhold details on what, if anything, has been done to return him.\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador to meet Abrego Garcia as members of Congress demand the administration return him to U.S. soil, where government attorneys can present evidence against him to support his removal.\n\nMaryland Rep.

As of April, the U.S. made up around 42 percent of Nvidia business, versus China and Hong Kong's 15.5 percent, according to financial data compiled by CSI Market.President Donald Trump has pushed to shift global manufacturers back to the U.S. to avoid his tariffs and create more jobs and growth for the American economy. He had hit China with a 145 percent tariff on all goods, but then days later added exemptions for smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts.As part of that, he expedited the approval of permits so that Nvidia could start investing around $500 billion in chip manufacture infrastructure domestically period.China remains a huge market for Nvidia despite the trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The U.S., however, continues trying to restrict China's access to high quality chips to limit their growth and development of AI.What To KnowThe new chip is part of the Blackwell dash architecture series and is expected to cost significantly less than its predecessors. Previous chips cost between $10,000 and 12,000, while the new chips are expected to be priced between $6,500 and $8,000.However, the lower price point indicates \"weaker specifications and simpler manufacturing requirements,\" according to Reuters.The chip will not use advanced packaging technology as part of its production, which may explain its reduced price.Nvidia attempted to repackage and develop a downgraded version of its H20 chip in order to get around export controls implemented by Trump, but the plan did not work out, Reuters reported.Recent export restrictions introduced a limit on the memory bandwidth of GPU chips, which would in turn continue to limit the ability of other nations to develop AI.Despite these efforts, China was able to produce the DeepSeek AI, which utilized the lower grade chips available to the country thanks to U.S. controls. The AI model was also trained and developed at a reportedly and relatively low cost of $6 million.What People Are SayingAn Nvidia spokesperson told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Saturday afternoon: \"We are still evaluating our limited options.

And if this rate keeps up— if Trump keeps bringing people together where others are afraid to go— then the world needs to ask itself a new question: What if Donald Trump has permanently changed the rules of diplomacy?\n\nBackchannel discussions, private envoys, and an unexpected surge in communications between Trump supporters and Kremlin officials were the first rumours in Washington.Trump, known for his previous warmth toward Putin, entered the scene with strategy rather than bluster as Russian artillery pounded eastern Ukraine and NATO prepared for escalation.\n\nTrump quietly orchestrated a deal that gave both sides political breathing room, according to several diplomatic insiders, thereby facilitating a freeze in hostilities. By making concessions linked to the lifting of sanctions, he gave Putin a way out while encouraging Zelenskyy’s supporters to adopt a more practical negotiating stance.One European diplomat remarked, “He made the call no one expected.” And it was successful. Within days, the shelling ceased.\n\nPeace in the traditional sense was not brought about by Trump’s intervention. On live television, there was no handshake or formal treaty. However, the violence decreased. The supply corridors were reopened. Without the sound of rockets in the distance, Ukrainian citizens returned to their damaged cities.Diplomacy wasn’t the norm. It was unvarnished, quick, and surprisingly successful Trump diplomacy. Another crisis simmered half a world away while the situation in Ukraine subsided. Following an alleged cross-border attack close to Kashmir, tensions between India and Pakistan escalated in South Asia.\n\nWith two rivals armed with nuclear weapons lurching toward conflict once more, the world feared the worst.\n\nTrump used his personal connections with leaders in New Delhi and Islamabad to engage in covert high-level diplomacy while former President Biden made public appeals for calm. Leaked intelligence memos claim that he offered incentives for infrastructure investment to Pakistan in exchange for de-escalation while putting economic pressure on India by threatening to mobilize Gulf oil producers against them.\n\nThe outcome? a rare announcement in which both nations agreed to resume diplomatic negotiations and exercise military restraint. Trump allegedly stated, “I told them both— nobody wins a nuclear war. They listened.”\n\nAt least eight times since May 10, Donald Trump has called for peace between India and Pakistan in public, offering to mediate the protracted dispute over Kashmir. The frequency and persistence of Trump’s calls indicate otherwise, despite India’s persistent denials of any third-party involvement and dismissal of his offers with typical haughtiness.\n\nIn an apparent reference to covert diplomacy that prevented war, Trump has publicly taken credit for lowering tensions, including during the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot standoff. India’s persistent diplomatic gaslighting and deflection only serve to underscore New Delhi’s insecurity, as its government is unwilling to acknowledge that an outsider, particularly Trump, had to step in and save them from the precipice. Pakistan, meanwhile, applauded Trump’s initiatives, acknowledging the importance of an impartial mediator in the face of India’s thumping nationalism. If anything, Trump’s audacity revealed the hypocrisy of India’s refusal to participate in genuine peace negotiations, demonstrating that sometimes a disruptor— rather than a diplomat— is necessary to persuade a reluctant bully to attend a meeting.This could prove as a test to Trump’s ability to bring India to the negotiating table to discuss the highly sensitive issues of the Indus Water Treaty, Kashmir and terrorism in India and Pakistan. Considering the fact that both India and Pakistan serve as a very crucial part of the South Asian region for Trump.\n\nTrump made another subtle but important move by moving closer to officially recognizing Syria, ending years of unclear US policy and bringing Damascus closer to being accepted as an essential actor in maintaining regional stability. Trump’s recognition signaled a strategic shift away from perpetual isolation and toward reintegration, whereas previous administrations lacked resolve and let Syria’s humanitarian crisis fester in a geopolitical limbo. It sent a message to the area that diplomacy, even with enemies, is possible and that chaos is not the default.Trump indicated an end to the policy of constant regime change and the start of possible long-term stabilization by recognizing Syria’s role in the future of the Middle East. By doing this, he established the foundation for a peace framework that encompasses not only Western favorites but also all important players.\n\nTrump has threatened tariffs, floated mediation summits, and even proposed a trilateral intelligence-sharing mechanism that was previously dismissed as a pipe dream, according to aides.Trump’s efforts to promote peace continued after that. His impact is being felt in hotspots all over the world, despite being less dramatic.\n\nNorth Korea: According to reports, Trump assisted in defusing a recent military standoff over missile testing through unofficial channels he had established during his first term.percent Middle East: According to analysts, his ongoing good relations with Israel and Saudi Arabia opened the door for new backroom talks with Jordan and Egypt. China: According to reports, an informal halt in retaliatory sanctions resulted from a previously undisclosed meeting between Chinese tech delegates and Trump-affiliated business envoys in Dubai. In Latin America and Africa, Trump’s team has been discreetly negotiating investment guarantees and resource access in return for collaborations on migration control.\n\nEscalation hotspots have significantly decreased, according to global conflict indices. Investor confidence has increased by 4-6 in a number of emerging economies, and this increase is directly related to areas that were previously thought to be volatile, stabilizing. Everyone loved to despise Trump. His syntax was ridiculed in late-night monologues. According to polls, he is not electable. He was laughed at by foreign leaders. Recent polls, however, point to a startling change. According to a Gallup International Leadership Poll, Trump’s approval rating has increased 17 points worldwide in just six months, especially among Middle Eastern and European countries. Once outspoken in their skepticism, policy analysts are now reevaluating their positions with caution.\n\nAccording to Dr. Helena Koenig, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, “Trump’s diplomacy is unconventional, but not without precedent.” “He forces actors to the table by using leverage, optics, and surprise.” It is disruptive, but occasionally diplomacy requires disruption. Even Trump’s detractors admit that it’s getting more difficult to ignore his results.\n\nWe are seeing a recalibration of statecraft, not merely a PR makeover. The transactional, theatrical, and highly personal nature of Trump’s approach runs counter to the formalities of conventional diplomacy. However, it might work because of that very unpredictability.World leaders are adjusting. According to Washington insiders, Trump’s European allies now view him as a wild card that they need to play. Middle Eastern and Asian countries are developing new backup plans in case Trump’s influence regains its hegemony in 2025. This is not just an oddity in diplomacy. It’s a change in the way that power is used globally.\n\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict is the one that most urgently requires Trump’s intervention if he is to genuinely establish himself as a world peacemaker. The continuous genocide of Palestinians has become a moral stain on the conscience of the world, as pictures of demolished homes and uprooted families saturate the media worldwide. Trump has a distinct advantage over other leaders because of his strong connections to Israel’s leadership, his legitimacy in the Arab world as a result of the Abraham Accords, and his unparalleled capacity to control headlines and change perceptions.\n\nHe could save thousands of lives and accomplish something that no contemporary president has: a genuine, enforceable peace in Palestine if he decides to intervene now and use his power to demand a ceasefire, negotiate a route to Palestinian sovereignty, and end the humanitarian crisis.For Trump, this is more than just a chance; it’s a litmus test for whether his newfound role as a global negotiator involves speaking up for the voiceless and putting an end to one of the worst tragedies in modern history.\n\nHe was derided as the man who would initiate the third world war. He may now be the man who stopped it twice. This arc isn’t one of redemption. It’s an odd change that no one, not even Trump, anticipated. And if this rate keeps up— if Trump keeps bringing people together where others are afraid to go— then the world needs to ask itself a new question: What if Donald Trump has permanently changed the rules of diplomacy?\n\nKeep paying attention. Perhaps the most unpredictable person in the world could also be its most successful peacemaker.","summary":"Nobody expected him to avert a war. Twice. Donald J.

One option: buy American.\n\nEurope has neither the stocks of arms nor the capacity to make them in large enough volume as it becomes clear that the U.S. won’t be delivering any more. The White House has also refused Europe’s appeals to keep up the push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire by stepping up sanctions.\n\nInstead, the Kremlin seems to be stalling on peace talks promised to Trump as it prepares for a summer offensive, according to people familiar with the matter. A proposal that’s gaining more credence is to purchase more American systems — and then send those weapons on to Ukraine, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.\n\nThe idea is that if Trump refuses to send U.S. weapons to Ukraine, Europe will.\n\nThat would help Ukraine deter Russia’s advance and might put fresh pressure on Putin to get serious about a ceasefire. And if the Europeans can persuade Trump to keep up supplying intelligence to Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may be able to hang on.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union is considering cutting more than 20 banks from SWIFT, the international payments system, as well as lowering a price cap on Russian oil and banning the Nord Stream gas pipelines as part of a new sanctions package to pressure Russia.\n\n“It’s not entirely clear to me how bad it would be if the United States walks away while keeping open the possibility of allowing Europe or Ukraine to buy U.S. weapons and allows U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine to continue,” said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It’s not an ideal outcome. It’s certainly suboptimal, but it’s not the total worst case that a lot of us have been worried about.”\n\nThe pivot would essentially force Trump to pick between two competing desires: his desire to avoid antagonizing Putin against his wish to bring in more cash for the U.S. via the sale of big-ticket defense items.\n\nTrump spoke separately earlier this week with Putin and European leaders, saying later that he would “back away” if sufficient progress was not made in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. “This is a European situation,” the president said at the White House. “It should have remained a European situation.”\n\nThe people said they expect the U.S. to continue sharing intelligence with Ukraine to aid in targeting. A brief cutoff of that cooperation created operational challenges for Kyiv, but also sparked wider fears among U.S. allies that they could face similar treatment in the future.\n\nTime is running out. Experts say arms transfers to Ukraine approved and funded by former President Joe Biden could run out this summer, and that Europe will struggle to produce enough weapons to fill the void. Putin will try to take advantage of this dynamic, experts said.\n\nGiven the defensive nature of the current fight and the vital role of domestically produced drones, “it’s not going to be catastrophic” if there is not another supplemental funding package from Washington, said Samuel Charap, distinguished chair in Russia and Eurasia policy at RAND.\n\nArming Ukraine with U.S.-made weapons, either purchased or donated, is the only way to convince Putin to end the war, said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA natural-resources deal signed with Ukraine gives the president space to go to Congress to seek additional funding for Ukraine and to argue that it is a contribution to the joint investment fund rather than a burden on U.S. taxpayers, he said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that the U.S. is urging NATO allies to send more Patriot batteries to Ukraine, but that countries want to use the systems to protect their own territory. Zelenskyy told reporters in April that his government wants to buy at least 10 Patriot batteries from the U.S., and that he is waiting for a response from Washington.\n\nTrump “understands that if he were to throw under Ukraine under the bus and Russia were to secure Ukraine’s capitulation, that’s a resounding political defeat for Donald Trump,” Kupchan said. “Ukraine becomes Trump’s Afghanistan, if not worse.”","summary":"European leaders are racing to figure out how to keep Ukraine supplied with weapons as U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be walking away from the war.

The speech was originally focused on West Point graduates and their accomplishments, but Trump soon turned toward other topics.\n\nThe commander in chief of the U.S. military used his keynote address to highlight his efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the country. He claimed to have “liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” and said there will be “no more critical race theory or transgender for everybody.”\n\nThis follows his January executive order that sought to deny the existence of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people throughout government.\n\n\"The job of the U.S. Armed Forces is not to host drag shows to transform foreign cultures, but to spread democracy to everybody around the world at the point of a gun,” he said. “The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime and any place.”\n\nWest Point disbanded several clubs based on race, ethnicity and gender in the wake of Trump’s anti-DEI executive order earlier this year. These groups included the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Native American Heritage Forum, the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers Club.\n\nTrump, wearing a red cap featuring his political slogan “Make America Great Again,” went on to praise his administration’s crackdown on immigration. This comes just hours after a federal judge ordered the administration to return a Guatemalan man “wrongfully” deported to Mexico.\n\n“Our country was invaded for the last four years, and they've allowed people to come into our country that shouldn't be, they shouldn't be here…We're getting them out and bringing them back where they came from,” Trump said.\n\n“Hopefully the courts will allow us to continue,” he added. “You know, we had the greatest election victory. This was November 5. We won the popular vote by millions of votes.”\n\nTrump also brought up some of his favorite famous names, including retired professional golfer Gary Player.\n\n“To be really successful, you're always going to have to work hard,” Trump said. “An example is a great athlete, Gary Player, great golfer. He wasn't as big as the other men that were playing against him. Great, big, strong guys. Gary was a smaller guy.\n\n“He’s a friend of mine, he gets a little angry at people. He hits the ball just this far,” Trump continued. “He said, ‘I hit the ball further than them. Why am I small?’ But he worked very, very hard. He was always doing exercise. He was always he was well ahead of his time. He never stopped.”\n\nTrump then pivoted to a discussion about real estate developer William Levitt, who is widely considered the inventor of the modern American suburb. Levitt died in 1994.\n\n“He was great at what he did,” Trump said of Levitt. “You see him all over the country, still Levittowns. This was a long time ago, but he was a first of the really, really big home builders, and he became very rich, a very rich man, and then he decided to sell.\n\n“And he sold his company, and he had nothing to do. He ended up getting a divorce, found a new wife. Could you say a trophy wife? I guess we can say a trophy wife. It didn't work out too well, but it doesn't – that doesn't work out too well, I must tell ya. A lot of trophy wives.”\n\nThe president also spoke about his past legal challenges, claiming he was investigated more than the infamous mob boss Al Capone. Trump made this comparison several times on the campaign trail last year. Last spring, he also made history by becoming the first criminally convicted former president.\n\n“I was investigated more than the great late Alphonse Capone,” Trump told the West Point graduates. “Alphonse Capone was a monster. He was a very hardened criminal. I went through more investigations than Alphonse Capone, and now I'm talking to you as president. Can you believe this?”\n\nTrump left the ceremony before noon and flew to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nIt was almost five years since a previous address at West Point led to negative news coverage that Trump brought up repeatedly over the next few years. After finishing his address in June 2020, Trump visibly struggled to walk down a ramp from the stage, leading to questions over his physical fitness.\n\nTrump reacted angrily, saying the ramp had no grip and that he was walking slowly because he didn’t want to slip.\n\nFollowing the latest speech at West Point, the president exited the stage not by the ramp at the front but by walking to the side and down a short staircase.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-gives-rambling-speech-trophy-171502863.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2b60a68ce78c371b4eca9ab6c6bf1bf4","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-24 21:26:51","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.203},{"id":324542836,"title":"Slovakia party to demand Ukraine compensate aid","text":"Lawmakers in Slovakia’s ruling coalition will push to demand compensation from Kiev for the military and financial aid Bratislava has provided it over the course of the Ukraine conflict, according to state news agency TASR.\n\nThe Slovak National Party (SNS) leader Andrej Danko will call on Prime Minister Robert Fico to begin EU proceedings regarding the bloc’s stake in Ukrainian mineral production, following the example of the US, head of the lawmaker’s office, Zuzana Skopcova told TASR on Saturday.\n\nWashington, Kiev’s biggest military donor, inked a major minerals agreement with it last month, giving the US preferential access to Ukrainian mineral wealth.

He said the US is “learning” from the tactics used by both Moscow and Kiev and that it was important to stay “at the top” amid the rapidly changing nature of warfare. \n\n“We are studying it. We are seeing different forms of warfare, we are seeing the drones that are coming down at angles, with speed, with precision. We have never seen anything like that. We are learning from it,” the president said, referring to their use in the current struggle. \n\nHe then called on the cadets to “have the courage to take risks and do things differently” in a bid to stay up-to-date in the field of military tactics and strategy. \n\nHis comments came as The Times reported that Russia was beating Ukraine in “the drone race” when it comes to both the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their use on the battlefield. It particularly pointed to the fiber optic drone types connected directly to their operators through a gossamer thin fiber optic thread that makes them difficult to detect or intercept.\n\nSuch drones are “essentially a wire-guided, highly maneuverable killer drone, impervious to jamming, and difficult to track by radio-based drone detector units,” The Times reported, adding that the Russian UAVs were “altering the physical make-up of the front line, the tactics of the war and the psychology of the soldiers fighting it” and were “devasting” the Ukrainian military’s logistics in the process. \n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin highlighted the important role drones had been playing on the battlefield back in April. Speaking at a meeting of the Russian military-industrial committee, he called UAVs “one of the serious factors of battlefield success.” According to the president, some 4,000 first-person view (FPV) drones were sent to the troops daily throughout 2024. \n\nFPV UAVs have mostly been used as kamikaze drones by the Russian military to strike a wide array of targets, ranging from tanks and armored vehicles to other drones.

The opposition, led by exiled former president Rafael Correa, has denounced what it says was election fraud and boycotted Saturday's inauguration ceremony. Those allegations have been dismissed by international election observers. Noboa, a wealthy businessman, first became president of the country of 18 million following early elections in 2023 that came amid a wave of drug-linked violence. Criminal groups specializing in cocaine smuggling pose a challenge to the government, as drug-related violence has given Ecuador the highest homicide rate in South America, according to the Insight Crime think tank. During Noboa's first year in office the homicide rate fell, which he attributed to his crackdown on crime. Among other things, he declared Ecuador to be in an internal armed conflict, empowering him to deploy the armed forces in the streets and prisons. Noboa touted the drug fight as a center point of his campaign. His youth and Correa's unpopularity among many voters helped power him to re-election, analysts say.But the fight against crime is far from over. Between January and April, Ecuador counted 3,084 homicides, making it the bloodiest start to any year since records were kept.Noboa promised on Saturday not \"to look the other way,\" saying he would carry on the fight against criminals \"who believed they own the country.\"Seeking to strengthen an alliance with the United States in the fight against crime, Noboa said he would allow foreign forces into the country. He also said recently that Israel wanted to \"help\" Ecuador with intelligence for the anti-crime struggle.Among foreign dignitaries attending Noboa's inauguration was US health secretary Robert F.

They rifled through his belongings, in particular his books and magazines, which included a book by conservative author Douglas Murray and Spectator Magazine.\n\nIn the search, one of the officers said that his materials contained “very Brexit-y things,” which is interesting because Brexit was passed by U.K. voters and is the law of the land.\n\nFox reported that “police seized his electronic devices and detained Foulkes for eight hours before issuing him a caution—a formal warning given to a person who admits to an offense to avoid prosecution.”\n\nThe police eventually apologized for the incident, which many have aptly called “Orwellian,” but the fact remains that the police thought they had a right to harass and arrest a man over a social media post. One that was calling out antisemitism to boot.\n\nStories like this have become so common that even the reliably liberal Economist magazine recently admitted that Vance was right, Europe and the U.K. really do have a free speech problem.\n\nAnd the issue in many cases seems to be tied to the European elites’ infatuation with mass, limitless migration.\n\nLucy Connolly, a mother of three, has been sentenced to nearly three years in prison for “inciting racial hatred.” Her request to reduce the sentence was denied.\n\nHours after Axel Rudakubana, the child of parents from Rwanda, went on a stabbing spree last July and killed three children, Connolly posted on X: “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f—ing hotels full of the b——s for all I care, while you’re at it, take the treacherous government politicians with them. I feel physically sick knowing what these [Southport] families will now have to endure. If that makes me racist, so be it.”\n\nShe took down the post a few hours later and apologized, but that didn’t prevent her arrest and eventual prison sentence.\n\nWas it the nicest thing to say? No. But it’s absurd to jail someone for this.\n\nThe case has received the attention of the White House and is being looked into by the State Department according to The Telegraph. As many have noted, it’s outrageous that this woman gets years in jail while pedophiles and rapists get lesser sentences.\n\nThis gets to the additional problem that not only is the U.K. engaging in suppression of free speech, it also has a racial two-tier sentencing system. An antisemitic mob can march down the streets of London shouting “kill the Jews” and receive no punishment at all.\n\nWhen U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the Connelly case he plead ignorance, claimed to be for free speech, and said he was against incitement.\n\nIn the United States, cases of incitement must have explicit instructions. Locking Connelly up at all would be a clear-cut violation of the First Amendment.\n\nStuff like this only confirms my opinion that the American Revolution was a good idea.\n\nBut it seems like there are even concerns about the U.K.’s speech laws that could affect Americans given that they police social media platforms.\n\nDuring a meeting between Starmer and President Donald Trump in February, The Daily Signal’s Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell asked the president to comment on the U.K.’s free speech violations that could affect Americans.\n\nVance answered for Trump saying that while the U.S. does have a special relationship with the “U.K. and also the civilian European allies,” there have been serious violations of free speech going on across the Atlantic.\n\n“Of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them, but it also affects American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,” Vance said.\n\nStarmer chimed in too.\n\n“We’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time,” he said. “Well, no, I mean, certainly we wouldn’t want to reach across, U.S. citizens, and we don’t, and that’s absolutely right. But in relation to free speech in the U.K., I’m very proud of our history there.”\n\nIt’s true that the U.K. has a stronger tradition of free speech than continental Europe and most of the world, but it never had anything like the First Amendment that explicitly protects speech in America. That’s looking like a mistake. Worse, the country seems to be throwing that tradition away in the name of “tolerance” and multiculturalism.\n\nThe U.K.’s trajectory on speech is appalling. It is creating a system where debate can be shut down, where being offended can be weaponized to censor fellow citizens, and where issues fester and percolate rather than being openly debated, making violence much likelier.\n\nLet’s hope that the people across the Atlantic wake up and hold their leaders accountable for the unacceptable loss of their liberties.","summary":"Every day that goes by brings more confirmation that&#160;Vice President JD Vance was right: Europe has a massive free speech problem.

Their friends, and many others in their community, feared the annual Latin music festival could be targeted by federal immigration enforcement.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t come in because of it,” Montoya said. “They didn’t want to risk it, it’s too scary. … [But] I’m not giving up.”\n\nThey were among the thousands still showing up at the festival in light of fears of immigration raids, with the lines to enter extending from the fest’s entrance at Van Buren Street and Michigan Avenue around to Jackson and Columbus Drives before doors opened on Saturday. \n\nAs of Saturday, about 95% of the passes to the event were sold out, according to the website. The inaugural festival attracted more than 80,000 people over two days. Last year, more than 60,000 people attended each day of the two-day festival despite stormy weather forcing evacuations.\n\nFestival organizers weren’t immediately available for comment.\n\nAs U.S. citizens, Montoya and Morales felt slightly safer, but they still had reservations given the arrests of American citizens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in recent months.\n\n“We were the testers to come in here and test the atmosphere for our friends back home,” Montoya said. “I’m not giving up, I’ll fight for my people. Strength in numbers.”\n\nIt comes on the heels of the cancellation of Michelada Fest earlier this month, which had been planned for July 19-20 at Oakwood Beach. Organizers cited the “rapidly changing political climate,” as well as concerns about visas for international artists, among the reasons for the cancellation.\n\nIt follows a pattern of fear in the community that muted the usual celebrations for Cinco de Mayo in Little Village, leaving the main stretch of 26th Street without a parade or any other fanfare. It’s even led to hundreds of Chicagoans missing medical appointments.\n\nIt’s why Montoya said he and Morales wanted to avoid heavily Latino neighborhoods: “We’re not trying to get in some B.S., so what can you do?”\n\nJasmine Arciga, a lifelong Little Village resident, said her neighborhood had seen foot traffic drop off as people fear the worst in light of Chicago being an early target of immigration raids by the Trump administration.\n\nAnxiety has grown in recent days as plainclothes ICE agents have been arresting immigrants outside immigration court hearings in Chicago and across the country.\n\nArciga said that although the muted Cinco de Mayo celebration was concerning, Mexican Independence Day in September — and its downtown car caravan — will be the true indication of whether enforcement fears are dampening spirits in the community.\n\n“It was very noticeable; people were scared to go outside,” Arciga, 24, said. “But independence day will be the real test.”\n\nArciga said she wasn’t shocked by the fear either. In Facebook pages for Sueños, she’s seen posts from concerned attendees about the possibility of ICE showing up to the festival, but she never got any certain answers.\n\n“I do think people are worried about it, especially with some of the artists not getting visas” for Michelada Fest, Arciga said.\n\nAt the festival, controversy has sprung up around President Donald Trump.\n\nIn February, a petition calling for Texas-based Mexican American group Grupo Frontera to be ousted from the festival circulated, garnering more than 10,000 signatures, over rumors the band was supportive of the president.\n\nIt followed a video posted by Grupo. Frontera vocalist Adelaido “Payo” Solís’ grandmother dancing like Trump does to the Village People’s song “YMCA” as well as a video by the band dancing to the same song; videos also were released showing members had liked Trump’s posts or were following him. The group is scheduled to play Sunday at 6:05 p.m. on the festival’s main stage.\n\nBut the festival’s healthy turnout gave some attendees hope.\n\nLupe Berrera, a 19-year-old who lives in Little Village, bought a Mexican flag from a vendor right outside the gates — and was far from alone, as many carried Colombian, Puerto Rican and Mexican flags over their shoulders.\n\nThe neighborhood she now calls home, after moving there from Brighton Park last year, has been a “ghost town.” But at Sueños, where people were proudly displaying their heritage as part of the weekend’s festivities, she said she was overcome with a “comforting feeling.”\n\n“I’m really big with my culture. I like expressing it and where I come from,” Berrera said. So “it feels like I’m finally able to express something I haven’t been able to with everything going on. … It’s important to come together as a community and celebrate our roots.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/suenos-music-festival/2025/05/24/suenos-festival-attendance-immigration-enforcement-music-chicago","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a18c4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5377x3069+0+258/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F7d%2F36db085e4acbaf3920d477e4fb1f%2Fdsc-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 20:56:17","author":"Violet Miller","authors":["Violet Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":324536896,"title":"Russia strikes Kyiv amid POWs exchange","text":"Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 attack drones overnight, adding that it downed six missiles and 245 drones.\n\nKyiv was “the main target of the enemy attack”, the air force said in a statement.\n\n“With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.\n\n“Only additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to cease fire,” he said.\n\nKyiv city officials reported fires and fallen debris in several parts of the Ukrainian capital, after AFP journalists heard explosions overnight.\n\nOfficials said 15 people were injured in Kyiv itself and five civil\n\nians were killed by Russian strikes in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.\n\nThe Russian military meanwhile said Ukraine had targeted it with 788 drones and missiles since Tuesday.\n\nDozens of drones targeting Moscow have been shot down over the past week.

Trump’s efforts to broker a ceasefire in Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II have so far been unsuccessful, despite his pledge to rapidly end the fighting.\n\nOne of the soldiers formerly held captive, 58-year-old Viktor Syvak, told AFP it was hard to put words to his emotional homecoming.\n\nCaptured in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, he had been held for 37 months and 12 days.\n\n“I didn’t expect such a welcome.

While he supports Trump, he has been critical of some actions by the president and has recently raised concerns about the budget reconciliation bill.The bill narrowly passed the House successfully on a party-line vote this week, with Trump's support, and now goes to the Senate. Bannon's concerns about the math of the bill are echoed by many conservatives and liberals alike. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has scored the legislation and said Wednesday that it would add $3.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.What to Know\"We just don't see how the math works,\" Bannon said on Friday segment of his War Room podcast. \"Unless in the Senate there's going to be a tax increase.\"Earlier this week, Bannon raised related concerns about the legislation, which Trump has described as \"one big, beautiful bill.\"\"I have not changed my mind one bit on this bill. This bill could be a lot better,\" Bannon said. \"I'm very concerned about the deficits in the short term...and I'm very upset.\"Bannon has long said that the government should increase taxes on wealthy Americans. While Trump floated the idea of allowing taxes to increase for the wealthy, the current bill renews tax cuts he pushed through with Republicans during his first term in 2017.Back in April, Bannon said in a Gettr post that taxes would likely need to increase for the wealthy to fund Trump's other priorities.\"No Tax on Tips , No Tax on Overtime, No Tax on Social Security—without Massive Spending Cuts or Dramatic Growth the Math DICTATES that you CANNOT Extend the Tax Cuts to the Upper Bracket without Driving an Even Bigger Deficit,\" he wrote.What's in the 'Big, Beautiful' Bill?The bill includes a targeted tax break for seniors receiving Social Security. Specifically, the bill provides a new $4,000 deduction for individuals aged 65 and older, designed to reduce the taxable portion of their benefits.It raises the state and local taxes (SALT) deduction cap for middle-income households, including measures like a 3.5 percent tax on remittances and greater scrutiny of nonprofits.Regarding health care and social programs, the bill introduces work requirements and cost-sharing measures for Medicaid recipients and tightens eligibility and funding rules for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). It also bans federal Medicaid funds from being used for gender-affirming care and further restricts abortion-related spending.National defense and border security will also see significant boosts. The bill authorizes an additional $150 billion for military spending and $70 billion for border enforcement, including over $46 billion for new wall construction and high-tech surveillance.The legislation also includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase. The bill, which overall includes about $4.9 trillion in tax breaks, was passed after weeks of negotiations and talks with Republicans, some of whom were concerned about constituents losing critical benefits and others who called for further budget cuts.What People Are SayingHouse Speaker Mike Johnson in a statement on Thursday: \"Today, the House has passed generational, nation-shaping legislation that reduces spending, permanently lowers taxes for families and job creators, secures the border, unleashes American energy dominance, restores peace through strength, and makes government work more efficiently and effectively for all Americans.\"President Donald Trump in a Thursday Truth Social post: \"'THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' has PASSED the House of Representatives! This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country! The Bill includes MASSIVE Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for the Golden Dome, 'TRUMP Savings Accounts' for newborn babies, and much more!\"Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday: \"Under Trump's 'big, beautiful bill', the top 0.1% will see their income increase by nearly $400,000 next year, while Americans making less than $51,000 will see their incomes GO DOWN.

Keep the pressure on and we can stop them in the Senate.\"What Happens NextThe Republican budget package will now move to the Senate after narrowly passing in the House early Thursday morning.Some Senate Republicans have already expressed skepticism about the bill's provisions.

Two years later, he earned a master's degree in political economy from the University of Pennsylvania.Sun then attended Hupan University — a Chinese business school started by Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma in 2015 — where he wrote a thesis on the blockchain industry, titled \"The Birth of a Decentralized Internet.\"Sun was the youngest member of Hupan's inaugural class, which included 30 students whom Ma recruited because he believed they could revolutionize the Chinese business world, the South China Morning Post reported. Sun graduated from Hupan in 2018.Sun's oldest Instagram photo shows him receiving a certificate from Ma. The caption reads, \"Inspired by the best to shape the future for the better. \"Sun worked at San Francisco-based crypto company, Ripple Labs, a cryptocurrency startup that has received backing from Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and other blue-chip investors.In 2013, Sun founded a social chat room app called Peiwo. The app matched users with each other based on their interests and 10-second audio clips. However, China ultimately kicked Peiwo off the Android and Apple app stores and shut it down for disrupting \"socialist values,\" The Verge reported.In 2017, Sun founded Tron, a blockchain company with its own cryptocurrency that is \"dedicated to building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized internet.\" Tron says its network has over 308 million users on the blockchain and has had over 10.4 billion transactions.Less than a year later, Tron acquired BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing service, for a reported $126 million.In 2022, Sun joined the Global Advisory Board of cryptocurrency exchange HTX, then known as Huobi Global.Sun has amassed more than 3.8 million followers on X and 240,000 Instagram followers, where he has posted pictures of himself posing with celebrities such as Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant.Forbes included Sun in its 30 under 30 Asia list for Consumer Technology in 2017, and more recently, the outlet featured Sun as its digital daily cover in March of this year.In 2019, Sun bid $4.57 million on an eBay-sponsored charity lunch with Warren Buffett. Sun said he planned to use the meal to convert Buffett, a notorious skeptic of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, into a true believer. Buffett has said bitcoin has \"no unique value\" and will ultimately become worthless, and derided it as a \"delusion\" and \"probably rat poison squared.\"Sun postponed the dinner with Buffett, citing kidney stones, which sparked conspiracy theories that he was being pressured by China. But months later, Sun finally had his dinner with Buffett in January 2020, inviting eToro founder and CEO Yoni Assia, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, and other crypto advocates to dine with them.In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges against Sun and three of his companies — Tron Foundation, BitTorrent Foundation, and Rainberry.The federal agency accused Sun of offering and selling crypto asset securities without proper registration. Sun is also facing allegations of fraud for manipulating the market price of his cryptocurrency, TRX.Sun was additionally charged with not disclosing how much he compensated celebrities like Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and Soulja Boy to promote his cryptocurrency, which would have violated federal securities laws.In December 2024, Sun purchased $30 million in crypto tokens from World Liberty Financial, making him the largest investor in the new venture backed by Trump and his family. On February 26, the SEC filed a motion to pause its case against Sun and allowed a 60-day period to explore a potential settlement.Since then, Sun has invested an additional $45 million in WLF. On January 22, Sun posted on X that if he \"made any money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump.\"In November 2024, Sun purchased Maurizio Cattelan's conceptual artwork titled Comedian, which consisted of a banana duct-taped to a wall, for $6.2 million at a Sotheby's auction.The sale of the highly divisive piece significantly exceeded its estimated value of $1 to $1.5 million.Shortly after the acquisition, Sun consumed the banana during a press event in Hong Kong, stating that \"the real value is the concept itself.\" He said that the act was not about destroying the artwork but about highlighting its ephemeral nature.At the live event, Sun also pledged to purchase 100,000 bananas from the New York street vendor who sold the original fruit used in the artwork.\"To thank Mr. Shah Alam, I've decided to buy 100,000 bananas from his stand in New York's Upper East Side,\" Sun wrote on X.This isn't the only time Sun splurged on artwork.In December 2021, he bought a Joker-themed NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club Tron collection for $15 million, one of the most expensive NFT purchases.Sun also spent $78.4 million on Giacometti's cast bronze sculpture Le Nez, adding to his collection of a $20 million Picasso portrait of Marie-Thérese, a triptych of \"fright wig\" portraits by Andy Warhol for $2 million, and KAWS' Untitled (Kimpsons) for $323,647, Artnet reported.Aside from art, Sun also spent $28 million to secure a seat on a Blue Origin flight to space, which he revealed after winning the bid at auction for the first crewed mission on the New Shepard rocket.Samantha Delouya contributed to an earlier version of this post.","summary":"The crypto billionaire now sports a Trump-branded watch after an exclusive dinner with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-should-know-about-justin-sun-trump-watch-crypto-2025-5","image":"https://i.insider.com/68311fedc6ad288d1481db22?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-24 20:51:04","author":"Grace Eliza Goodwin,Katherine Li,Theron Mohamed","authors":["Grace Eliza Goodwin","Katherine Li","Theron Mohamed"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.274},{"id":324536288,"title":"HAMISH MCRAE: Bumpy summer ahead for Britain's finances","text":"The bond vigilantes are on the warpath, and this is bad news for the Chancellor. They are prowling the streets everywhere, hunting down any government they think is borrowing too much and beating it up by pushing up long-term interest rates.\n\nThe UK is not alone. The US and Japan also saw the cost of financing their national debt rise last week. In the case of America, it was mostly a reaction to Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' passed by the House of Representatives, which cut taxes and increased spending. It looks like it will boost their fiscal deficit to 7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), scary indeed.\n\nFor Japan it was a more general concern that since the national debt is more than double its GDP, the declining population will not be able to pay the interest on it, let alone get the number down.\n\nBut while other countries have dodgy national finances, we are very much in the firing line – and for good reason. Last week there were two chunks of bad news.\n\nOne was inflation, with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) climbing to 3.5 per cent. This was billed as 'unexpected', although anyone who didn't expect it has been reading the wrong newspaper.\n\nIt certainly makes a mockery of the recent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England, given that the bank has a mandate to bring inflation down to 2 per cent.\n\nThe City expects at least one further rate cut this year, but I think it is perfectly possible the next move will be up, not down.\n\nThe other was the news that in April, the first month of the new financial year, the Government's deficit went up. Revenues were £5.6 billion higher than in April 2024, but spending was up by £6.6 billion. The increases in public sector pay more than wiped out the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions and the Chancellor's other tax increases.\n\nLooking ahead, it gets worse. A quarter of our national debt is index-linked, and to the Retail Price Index, which was 4.5 per cent last month, even higher than the CPI. Inflation is also likely to push up the state pension next year. This has just gone up 4.1 per cent, thanks to the so-called triple lock, where pensions rise by the highest of three things: the CPI, average earning increases in the previous autumn, or 2.5 per cent.\n\nThis year it's been rises in earnings that were the top marker. We don't know what they will be in four months, but they are now 5.6 per cent and inflationary pressures may push them higher still.\n\nSo the Government may have to confront the harsh fact that, if it honours its commitment to keep the triple lock, that will blow an even bigger hole in the finances.\n\nThe bond market knows all this – that is why it pushed the yield on ten-year gilts above 4.75 per cent in trading on Friday. The US is paying about 4.5 per cent.\n\nIs it unfair that we should have to pay more since objectively our national finances are no worse than theirs, arguably a bit better?\n\nSure, but markets are not fair and our Government must live with the fact that it is distrusted by those who can lend it money.\n\nThe practical question for the rest of us is how to protect ourselves if there is a coming crunch.\n\nIn the continuing chaos we have to accept two things.\n\nOne is that short-term interest rates may not fall further and may start climbing again. The other is that Government bond yields will probably rise, with ten-year gilts settling above 5 per cent. If that is right, anyone needing to borrow should bolt down the best deal as soon as possible. Pessimistic, yes, but better safe than sorry.\n\nAs for investment, higher bond yields are usually been associated with lower equity prices, but equities give protection against inflation and the UK market is cheap by historical standards.\n\nSo the common sense rules still apply: in the long view shares are better than bonds and you should always spread risk. We shouldn't be frightened by what is happening. But we should be aware that if markets are bumpy now, they are likely to be a lot more so through the summer and beyond.","summary":"The common sense rules still apply: in the long view shares are better than bonds and you should always spread risk.

This time, its futuristic silhouette appeared near Andratx, drawing the gaze of beachgoers and onlookers who quickly reached for their cameras to capture the scene from shore.\n\nThe vessel belongs to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, emir of Qatar and a frequent summer visitor to the Balearic island. It is not the first time the yacht has sailed Spanish waters; it was previously anchored off Palma in the summers of 2018 and 2019, becoming a floating symbol of opulence in the Mediterranean.\n\nAt 123 metres in length—longer than a football pitch—and with a 23-metre beam, Al Lusail is a floating city. It was built by German shipyard Lürssen in 2017, with H2 Yacht Design handling the exterior and March & White overseeing the lavish interior. The result is a marine palace worth an estimated €500 million and weighing close to 8,500 tonnes.\n\nDesigned with royalty in mind, the yacht features 18 high-end suites capable of hosting up to 36 guests, all attended to by a crew of 56. Among its amenities are a private cinema, spa, gym, sea-level swim platform, multiple pools, helipad and even an outdoor barbecue. Underwater lighting adds a dramatic flair when the vessel is anchored by night.\n\nA high-flying gift for Trump\n\nIn parallel with his yacht’s presence in Mallorca, Emir Al Thani has also made headlines for a gesture that blends politics, diplomacy and extravagance: his reported intention to gift a customised Boeing 747-800 to Donald Trump. The aircraft, estimated to be worth around €400 million, has long served as the official jet of Qatar’s royal family and has landed on numerous occasions at Son Sant Joan Airport.\n\nIts last recorded visit to Mallorca took place on 4 August 2022. The aircraft features luxurious additions such as an internal lift, two en-suite bedrooms, and a limited seating capacity to maximise comfort. Given its state ownership, its flight path is blocked from public tracking platforms.\n\nOn Monday, May 13, morning, Mark Zuckerberg’s Launchpad, a striking 118-metre vessel reportedly worth $300 million, entered Palma’s harbour at around 10:30am.

Now, the thing is that a lot of people may be in the dark as to what exactly it means to have African leaders or world leaders converge on Rome for the inauguration of the Pope. Can you explain the significance of this and what this means for Africa and perhaps the world in general?\n\n I think the worry should be who was not in Rome and as you saw, I mean luckily I was in Rome for the burial of Pope Francis, and again something very dramatic happened because every square inch of that territory is a space for negotiation at the highest level. \n\nYou saw, for example, after the Mass during the burial, (President) Volodymyr Zelensky (of Ukraine) and (US President Donald) Trump just securing a little space to have a conversation, that was very profound. So, when anything happens in the Vatican, everybody who is anybody wants to show up, there is always drama because usually, Vatican protocol is slightly different from the things you’re familiar with.\n\nI remember the burial of Pope John Paul II when we had this drama of (former President Robert) Mugabe, for example, being beside the United Kingdom, Iran being beside Israel, and so on and so forth. So, because they are arranged in alphabets, sometimes the most unlikely people show up, including people who are not talking to one another and that’s why it’s a massive moral space, and that’s why you saw the kind of people that showed up. But even most importantly, it is that the Pope, any Pope, for that matter, that has been the story throughout history. It has always been the moral compass for where the world is going.\n\nWhat moral implication does it have globally?\n\nI think usually every world leader defines their moral relevance or even their relevance by how near they are to the Pope. So, it was not really for everybody to have had a chance to be invited, it was something to celebrate and for us in Nigeria, at least at the inauguration of a Pope, it is the first time that a Nigerian President will be there.\n\nI was there at the burial of Pope John Paul II, and (former) President (Olusegun) Obasanjo was also there but this was a very special memory for us in part because as you saw some of the video clips, our President had a good opportunity to shake hands with the Pope and have even a bit of conversation because the Pope as you know was born in Chicago and the President also had spent some time in Chicago. So, it’s a good starting point.\n\nIs it also palatable, so to speak, to hold on to the argument of those who say that there should have been an African Pope?\n\nWell, let’s win the World Cup first. I think we still have a long way to go, I did write an article in the course of all of this and I remember remarking something that happened when Pope John Paul II died and the speculators thought that Cardinal Arinze came very close. \n\nBut as you know, electing a pope is not like that, it’s not an ‘Emilokan’ scenario in which you say, ‘These people have had their turn, now it’s our turn.’ No, it doesn’t work like that. And then the pundits who think that this is like betting on a horse or whatever.\n\n You always notice that by and large when people begin to make their speculations, they are using human parameters of their calculation, and very often, most of those who make these calculations simply accumulate their data and suggest this is where it’s going to go. But always, people are shocked in part because the election of a Pope is not like any other election anywhere in the world.\n\nWhat is that so?\n\nWhat is very interesting about the election is that it is an election in which you know you’re going out to vote; you are both a candidate and a voter, so you are voting. I don’t think people vote for themselves necessarily, but it means whatever vote you cast, you know somebody else is voting for you because you also have a right to be chosen. \n\nWhat was even more spectacular about the election of Pope Leo was that there were 133 men (cardinals). They know one another but not in a very close way; I mean I was at the Synod and I met the current Pope Leo, he opened the door for me, but sometimes I look back and say, ‘Oh my goodness! If I had known he was going to be Pope, maybe I would have done a little bit more, but nobody saw it coming and suddenly, we went in there.\n\nIs the election not an exercise carried out by people who are familiar with one another?\n\nEvery Catholic and every Christian believes that it is the Holy Spirit that does this because 133 people go in with name tags because everybody doesn’t know everybody, there are few people who have been friends, and Cardinals were made just at the last consistory. So, there are people who are just walking into this for the very first time; they’ve never had this experience before, and they don’t know one another. \n\nSo, it’s not as if you’ve had any opportunity to lobby or to put a manifesto, anything of the sort, and then as now we have always believed and believe solidly or equivocally that the Holy Spirit has his way of aggregating what He wants. So, we are going to do what human beings do, but God already has an idea about what exactly it is that He wants of his church, and from the time of Peter till date, the Holy Spirit has not failed the church.\n\nLet me put it that way: when we look at the Pope, we see a man who has so much respect from world leaders and Africa has a situation where it requires a lot of assistance from Western countries or more developed countries. What do you expect of this Pope concerning how influential he could be on world leaders to offer the necessary assistance to Africa or in fact, to Africa’s development in general?\n\nLook, I’m a very proud Nigerian. Nigeria is not Sudan; we’re not Gaza, Nigeria is not Syria, Nigeria is not Libya, Nigeria is not just any country, we are a heck of a country with massive resources that can take care of us and take care of our neighbours. So, for me, it’s not the job of a Pope to decide how the corrupt Nigerian state addresses the problems of how it manages its resources; it’s not the business of the Pope. Of course, maybe I shouldn’t say it was not the business, but I was in Congo when the Pope visited in 2023, I represented the bishops of West Africa, and of course, you remember what the holy father said, telling the international community to take its hands off Africa.\n\nNow, those are the only kind of things that the Pope can say, but in the final analysis, it is not the fault of the Pope, and it’s not the Pope’s business to decide why Nigeria and other leaders in Africa have turned politics into a criminal enterprise, it’s not the business of the Pope. \n\nAll the Pope can do is offer a moral guide and, of course, even when people talk about an African Pope or a Nigerian Pope, it might only just be so nominally, but like I say and I’ve often said there’s nothing like an African pope because if it is an African pope, Africans have to elect him and he has to only govern the church in Africa, but you can have a Pope who is an African, you can’t have an African pope.\n\nWhat about that feeling of the Pope coming from a particular region?\n\nBut the point to make is, as you saw with Pope Francis, he never went back to Argentina, and there are video clips, for example, of this current Pope. I just watched the clip with him shaking his elder brother, you could see from the brother’s face — after he finishes embracing him, that is about the best he could get, he has to move on. \n\nSo, he’s no longer a family matter. So, I don’t think that Africa should expect that it will have these kinds of advantages because we Africans like to make this projection, “The President is from my town, therefore, it’s our turn. The governor is from my community, therefore, my community will change.”\n\nThe Pope has a duty and a responsibility, but it depends on how Africans prepare themselves and how the leadership in Africa arranges because I can speak rather authoritatively. I think it’s very important to make this point that for Nigeria, a country of this nature, we’ve had two papal visits — Pope John Paul II came in 1982, he came back again in 1998, and what was very interesting is that in all those visits, Muslims were in charge of Nigeria, (former President Shehu) Shagari in 1982, and (the late General Sani) Abacha in 1998 before his death, and then now, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu. \n\nI think that speaks a lot to the nature of the sense of urgency that Nigerian leaders and Nigerian Christians and Muslims, the investment that we must make in avoiding the collision that is created in the name of religion.\n\nYou know, we are a postcolonial state. Before the British came, there was no Nigeria, there were kingdoms, and there were ethnic groups, and so on and so forth, and I think this is important to understanding whether it’s Boko Haram or whether is wherever we find ourselves today. Before the British, you had the empires, whether it’s the Benin Empire or whether it is Oyo but perhaps the most dominant was the Sokoto Caliphate, with a total land mass of about 250,000 square kilometers, which is huge because that’s about half the size of Nigeria. But then, in 1903, the British defeated the caliphate and that set the tone.\n\nI think that anybody who is a student of religion and politics in Nigeria must come to terms with the fact that to understand the ongoing tension, to understand why Boko Haram is making the claims it is making, to understand why Muslim politicians continue to talk about living under Sharia law, to understand the mind of the average Muslim, especially in northern Nigeria, you must return to that point where people felt a sense of defeat and along with that defeat came the decapitation of the institutions of power.\n\nSo, for example, if you read Lugard’s speech, Lord Lugard said, “Now that I’ve defeated you.” The Sultan had the power to appoint Emirs, and his Emirs had power over taxation. The first thing Lugard did was to say, “I take the power to appoint Emirs away from you, I take the power to appoint, to generate taxes away from you.”\n\nAnd that subordinated the rump of the caliphate, and the result is that we are still dealing with some of those issues, that’s why today, the appointment of a Sultan, the appointment of an Emir is the business of the state governor and the governor will choose whomever he wants to choose, not necessarily based on the kind of moral credential because no Emir needs to show evidence that they have a degree in Islamic Studies, for example.\n\nIs that the same for Christianity?\n\nAlong with that, then comes Christianity, coming from a Western liberal. Of course, the mistake that many people make is that Christianity came with colonialism. History doesn’t lead to that conclusion, but you can see that whereas Islam tends to focus on building a theocracy, Christianity focuses on a liberal environment in which all of us can thrive. \n\nWhen they were debating what now became the United Nations Human Rights Declaration, the government of Saudi Arabia said no because we don’t accept the idea that people can be individuals, and we also don’t accept the idea of human rights. So, there are a lot of these healthy tensions; they’ve been with us. \n\nBut one of the most tragic things that hasn’t happened in Nigeria is that the Nigerian state. I mean those who govern Nigeria, have not had the political will, you know, to set the tone to put religion where it ought to be and to put the state where it ought to be, because now we have Section 10 of the Constitution that simply says that no state shall adopt any religion as a state religion, but you know that is not the truth in practice. So, it’s a very delicate balance.\n\nWhat then, should the modern state focus on?\n\nThe point I’m making is that many Muslims in northern Nigeria are still nostalgic about the caliphate that has moved on, but as you can see from ISIS and Boko Haram, there are still people largely political; science calls them Islamists, that is those who believe that Islam can now become the tools for building now that democracy has failed. \n\nBut truth be told, the modern state must focus on the fact that Islam can be a source of law, Christian values can be a source of law, and African traditional rights can be a source of law. But all of us must become citizens under one law.\n\nWhat leadership roles do traditional and religious leaders play here?\n\nI’m reading a book now that I wish everybody should read; it’s a book written by the current INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood (Yakubu), excellent book, it’s about traditional rulers and politicians, and it’s an excellent book to read because the distortions are still basically the same. \n\nWhat were the issues? The colonial state simply corrupted the traditional institutions as junior partners, and the welfare and well-being of the average citizens became suspended animation. So, traditional rulers oversaw the collection of taxes. In exchange, they got a little bit of the action. \n\nThe modern Nigerian state has not improved on that relationship and I don’t want to go into the debate because I don’t know how it’s going to function, whether a place for traditional law in the Constitution suggests we’re going to have it remove the signboard that talks of three-armed zones and have a four-armed zone, whether we’re going to have a replication of all this at the level of the states, and whether all that is going to displace all the Constitution, the amendments that have been made and that have placed traditional institutions where they ought to be.\n\nSome people seem to have some level of spiritual reverence for traditional rulers. Don’t they?\n\nI don’t know the politics but for me, many people mistakenly think about traditional rulers and collapse them into religious leaders. Traditional rulers are not religious leaders necessarily because, as I said to you, after 1903, that role ended. For example, I am a bishop, I’m a priest, and I have to produce my certificates to show that I went to a school of theology before I got to where I am. \n\nThe traditional leader doesn’t need it; all he needs is the goodwill of the governor. He’s not the same person who leads prayers. I cannot be a bishop and not be in my cathedral leading prayers. So, the roles are different, but I think we’ve watched the contaminating and the toxic effect of politics in religion and the traditional institutions and I don’t know those who want to take that risk and what the attractions really are.\n\nBut it is a difficult thought to see how we can ride this tiger without ending up in his stomach. I was at a conference of West African bishops in Dakar (Senegal) only about a fortnight ago, and one of the bishops from Ghana said they now have 350 cases in different courts in Ghana relating to traditional institutions. \n\nSo, I don’t know how, but I believe that maybe in their wisdom, the traditional leaders will make their case. Other Nigerians will make their case, but I just know that we have seen records of people being removed because of political affiliation or lack of it, and as I said, frankly, it is difficult for me because I don’t know what the attractions are.\n\n.
