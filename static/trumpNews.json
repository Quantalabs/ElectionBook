The 9th Circuit decision keeps a block on the Trump administration enforcing the order that would deny citizenship to children born to people who are in the United States illegally or temporarily. “The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order's proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional. We fully agree,” the majority wrote. Also Read | Fact Check: Is Westarctica a Real Country or Fictional Name? Know the Truth As UP STF Nabs Harsh Vardhan Jain for Operating Fake Embassy in Ghaziabad. The 2-1 ruling keeps in place a decision from U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour in Seattle, who blocked Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship and decried what he described as the administration's attempt to ignore the Constitution for political gain. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The Supreme Court has since restricted the power of lower court judges to issue orders that affect the whole country, known as nationwide injunctions. But the 9th Circuit majority found that the case fell under one of the exceptions left open by the justices. The case was filed by a group of states who argued that they need a nationwide order to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship only being the law in half of the country. “We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a universal injunction in order to give the States complete relief,\" Judge Michael Hawkins and Ronald Gould, both appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote. Judge Patrick Bumatay, who was appointed by Trump, dissented. He found that the states don't have the legal right, or standing, to sue. “We should approach any request for universal relief with good faith skepticism, mindful that the invocation of complete relief' isn't a backdoor to universal injunctions,” he wrote. Bumatay did not weigh in on whether ending birthright citizenship would be constitutional. The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment says that all people born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. Justice Department attorneys argue that the phrase “subject to United States jurisdiction” in the amendment means that citizenship isn't automatically conferred to children based on their birth location alone. The states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that ignores the plain language of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898 where the Supreme Court found a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil. Trump's order asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. At least nine lawsuits challenging the order have been filed around the U.S. (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

He said Ukraine had proposed a meeting before the end of August between Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added: \"By agreeing to this proposal, Russia can clearly demonstrate its constructive approach.\" Russia&apos;s chief delegate Vladimir Medinsky said the point of a leaders&apos; meeting should be to sign an agreement, not to \"discuss everything from scratch\". He renewed Moscow&apos;s call for a series of short ceasefires of 24-48 hours to enable the retrieval of bodies. Ukraine says it wants an immediate and much longer ceasefire. The talks took place just over a week after US President Donald Trump threatened heavy new sanctions on Russia and countries that buy its exports unless a peace deal was reached within 50 days. There was no sign of any progress towards that goal, although both sides said there was discussion of further humanitarian exchanges following a series of prisoner swaps, the latest of which took place on Wednesday. Medinsky said the negotiators agreed to exchange at least 1,200 more prisoners of war (POWs) from each side, and Russia had offered to hand over another 3,000 Ukrainian bodies. He said Russia was working through a list of 339 names of Ukrainian children that Ukraine accuses it of abducting. Russia denies that charge and says it has offered protection to children separated from their parents during the war. \"Some of the children have already been returned back to Ukraine. Work is underway on the rest. If their legal parents, close relatives, representatives are found, these children will immediately return home,\" Medinsky said. Umerov said Ukraine was expecting \"further progress\" on POWs, adding: \"We continue to insist on the release of civilians, including children.\" Ukrainian authorities say at least 19,000 children have been forcibly deported. Before the talks, the Kremlin had played down expectations, describing the two sides&apos; positions as diametrically opposed and saying no one should expect miracles. At 40 minutes, the meeting was even shorter than the two sides&apos; previous encounters on 16 May and 2 June, which lasted a combined total of under three hours. Oleksandr Bevz, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, said his country had proposed a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in August because that would fall within the deadline set by Trump for a deal. Putin turned down a previous challenge from Zelenskyy to meet in person and has said he does not see him as a legitimate leader because Ukraine, which is under martial law, did not hold new elections when Zelenskyy&apos;s five-year mandate expired last year. Trump has patched up relations with Zelenskyy after a public row with him at the White House in February, and has lately expressed growing frustration with Putin. Three sources close to the Kremlin told Reuters last week that Putin, unfazed by Trump&apos;s ultimatum, would keep fighting in Ukraine until the West engaged on his terms for peace, and that his territorial demands may widen as Russian forces advance. download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"The meeting was the latest in a series of peace talks and lasted just 40 minutes.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/no-progress-on-ceasefire-deal-after-russia-ukraine-peace-talks/1icowuz5z","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/cdbc0f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5307x2985+1+394/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2Fc7%2F72f8f18e43b7b93a24c4fd6071c1%2F20250724114259741240-original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 01:14:50","author":"Aap / Alexander Ryumin/tass/sipa Usa","authors":["Aap / Alexander Ryumin/tass/sipa Usa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":344636768,"title":"Appeals court finds Trump’s effort to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional, upholds block","text":"A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday (July 23, 2025) that President Donald Trump’s order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision that blocked its enforcement nationwide.\n\nThe ruling from a divided panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes after Mr. Trump’s plan was also blocked by a federal judge in New Hampshire.

Know the Truth As UP STF Nabs Harsh Vardhan Jain for Operating Fake Embassy in Ghaziabad.\nIt remains unclear in what context Trump's name appeared in the documents. As CNN noted, Trump was among several prominent individuals associated with Epstein during the 1990s, when Epstein actively courted celebrities and influential figures to boost his public profile. The new revelations do little to expand on the public's existing understanding of Trump's ties to Epstein.\n\"The White House is not surprised by this - Trump's name was present in the binders that Bondi produced and handed out,\" a White House official told CNN. The official added that many of the materials already released by the Justice Department had included mention of Trump's name. \"The White House does not view this as groundbreaking or new or surprising at all,\" the official said, emphasizing that there is no evidence implicating Trump in any wrongdoing.\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung also responded to the developments in a statement to CNN, saying, \"The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\"\nCNN reported that the Wall Street Journal first broke the story about Bondi informing Trump in May that his name appeared in the Epstein-related documents. The revelations appear to contradict Trump's more recent denial that he was aware of being named in the files. When pressed last week about whether Bondi had informed him, Trump responded, \"No, no. She's given us just a very quick briefing.\"\nThe issue has added to growing political pressure on the administration following its decision not to release additional Epstein-related documents, a move that has drawn sharp criticism from Trump's supporters, according to CNN. White House officials were reportedly frustrated that Bondi did not redact Trump's name from the binders distributed to conservative influencers in February, calling it a longstanding point of contention between the DOJ and the White House.\nIn a joint statement issued on Wednesday, Bondi and Blanche said, \"The DOJ and FBI reviewed the Epstein Files and reached the conclusion set out in the July 6 memo. Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution, and we have filed a motion in court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts. As part of our routine briefing, we made the President aware of the findings.\"\nWhile the White House has dismissed the continued scrutiny of the Epstein files as politically motivated and distracting, bipartisan calls for full transparency have intensified. A House Oversight subcommittee voted Wednesday to subpoena the Department of Justice to release all documents related to Epstein, forcing GOP leaders to cut short the legislative session to avoid further votes on the matter.\nAdding to the controversy, the Wall Street Journal reported last week that a letter bearing Trump's name and an outline of a naked woman was part of a photo album gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter and has filed a lawsuit against the publication over the article, CNN reported.

The orders are part of Trump’s broader campaign against diversity initiatives and come as he pledges to make the US an “AI export powerhouse”.Speaking at an AI summit in Washington, he said that the world is now, whether we like it or not, in a rapid race to develop and shape a revolutionary technology, one that will play a defining role in the future of civilisation, thanks to the brilliance and creativity coming out of Silicon Valley.\"America is the country that started the AI race and as president of the United States, I am here today to declare that America is going to win it.\"\"We are going to work hard. We are going to win it,\" Trump said.He added that the US will not allow any other nation to beat it and \"children will now live on a planet controlled by the algorithms.\" The executive orders include, acrackdown on so-called “woke” AI, streamlining federal permits for datacentre infrastructure and directive to boost American AI exports.These actions were unveiled alongside a 24-page “AI Action Plan”, titled Winning the Race, which outlines the administration’s roadmap for accelerating AI adoption across federal agencies and cementing US leadership in the field. The document replaces a previous Biden-era executive order that had introduced regulatory standards and safeguards for AI, as per The Guardian. “Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since the dawn of the space age,” Trump said, urging American tech companies to “put America first”.However, what counts as political bias in AI is still unclear and debated, which has raised concerns that the government might use these new powers to unfairly go after certain companies.The Trump also suggested rebranding the very name of the technology. “I don’t even like the name, you know? I don’t like anything that’s artificial. So could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that,” he said. “It’s not artificial. It’s genius.”At the summit, he declared, “The American people do not want woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models, and neither do other countries.” A second executive order focuses on deregulating AI development and accelerating the construction of datacentres, often massive, resource-intensive facilities that power AI models. This includes rolling back environmental protections that might obstruct such projects, The Guardian reported. While datacentres are essential for hosting AI infrastructure, they consume vast amounts of energy and water and are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental groups have raised alarms over rising air and noise pollution, and some communities have resisted the expansion of these facilities in their neighbourhoods. Despite this, Trump’s order supports long-standing demands from tech firms to ease permitting laws and ramp up energy infrastructure. It also frames AI development as a matter of geopolitical urgency, pointing to China’s heavy investments in AI chips and datacentres. Companies like Deepseek have emerged as formidable challengers to Silicon Valley’s dominance. The administration’s offensive against “woke” AI reflects deeper ideological tensions. Conservatives have increasingly shifted their criticism from social media moderation to generative AI tools, accusing them of suppressing right-wing viewpoints.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also lauded the order, citing the advantage of having Donald Trump as the president. \"America’s unique advantage that no other country can possibly have is President Trump,\" television host Ed Ludlow quoted Huang. The tweet was later shared by the US president.","summary":"Donald Trump signed executive orders to reshape America's AI landscape, targeting 'woke' AI and streamlining data center permits.

Trump has targeted universities including Columbia since returning to the White House in January over the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled college campuses last year. In March, the Trump administration said it was penalizing the university over how it handled last year's protests by canceling $400 million in federal funding. It contended that Columbia's response to alleged antisemitism and harassment of Jewish and Israeli members of the university community was insufficient. \"Under today's agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 - will be reinstated and Columbia's access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,\" Columbia said in a statement. The university said it has also agreed to settle investigations brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for $21 million and that its deal with the Trump administration preserved Columbia's \"autonomy and authority over faculty hiring, admissions, and academic decision-making.\" After the government announced the funding cancellations, the school announced a series of commitments in response to the Trump administration's concerns. Last week, Columbia adopted a definition of antisemitism that equates it with opposition to Zionism. The school also said it would no longer engage with pro-Palestinian group Columbia University Apartheid Divest. The Trump administration had no immediate comment on Wednesday. Trump had said in recent weeks that a deal with Columbia was close. The government has labeled pro-Palestinian protesters as antisemitic and as sympathizers of extremism. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the Trump administration has wrongly conflated their criticism of Israel's military assault in Gaza with antisemitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism. Wednesday's announcement came one day after the university disciplined dozens of students over a pro-Palestinian protest in May in which demonstrators seized Columbia's main library. The government has attempted to use the leverage of federal funding with other educational institutions as well, including Harvard University, over campus protests. It has also tried deporting some foreign pro-Palestinian students but has faced judicial roadblocks. Rights advocates have raised concerns about due process, academic freedom and free speech over the government's actions.","summary":"Columbia says most of its suspended federal funds will be restored as part of deal; Trump administration had suspended funds in March","url":"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-07-24/ty-article/columbia-university-to-pay-over-200-million-to-resolve-trump-antisemitism-probes/00000198-39bf-d47b-adbe-fbbf03940000","image":"https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/00000195-3999-d98c-abf5-fdff3ea00000/26/c8/ee13fb4646b1a16d6345a374a36f/370747.jpg?precrop=1603,1603,x0,y0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:54:42","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.007},{"id":344634120,"title":"Elon Musk Predicts Challenging Times for Tesla as Trump Ends EV Incentives","text":"Tesla has issued a caution regarding additional revenue setbacks due to Donald Trump’s trade war and anti-electric vehicle initiatives in the US president’s “big, beautiful bill,” further dimming the forecast as second-quarter profits fell by 23 percent.\n\nTrump’s prominent fiscal policy jeopardizes a vital profit stream for Tesla, which had enabled the electric-vehicle manufacturer to sell billions of dollars in regulatory credits to more polluting competitors to compensate for their emissions.\n\nThe impact on Tesla from these presidential policies — including the removal of incentives for electric vehicles and solar power — has intensified the conflict between CEO Elon Musk and Trump, drawing the world’s wealthiest individual back into the political arena despite his vow to investors to concentrate his efforts on the electric-car company.\n\n“We are in the transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,” Musk said. “We probably could have a few rough quarters.” \n\nTesla shares fell more than 4 per cent in after-market trading on Wednesday following Musk’s comments, and have dropped 30 per cent from a peak in mid-December.\n\nThe billionaire’s close relationship with Trump, after supporting his re-election bid, was initially interpreted as beneficial to Tesla. However, Musk’s role at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alienated some customers as he celebrated brutal cuts to the federal workforce.\n\nHe left the White House in May after falling out with the president, becoming a fierce critic of the Republican’s spending bill and pledging to launch his own political party. \n\nConsumer backlash against Musk’s political activities has contributed to a sales slump at Tesla, which is also suffering from an ageing model line-up and greater EV competition from Chinese and western rivals. \n\nThe Austin, Texas-based company on Wednesday reported that its adjusted net income came in close to analysts’ expectations at $1.4bn for the three months through June, down more than a fifth from $1.8bn a year earlier.\n\nThe carmaker warned Trump’s policies would add to its difficulties in the coming months. \n\nChief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla had a limited supply of vehicles and might not be able to deliver enough cars in time to meet orders if consumers rushed to beat the September deadline for the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases and leases. \n\nTesla stands to lose much of the income from the sale of its regulatory credits after Trump’s bill eliminated fines for non-compliance, throwing the future of emissions trading programmes in doubt. Revenue from the credits almost halved to $439mn in the quarter from a year before. Last year, the company made $2.8bn from these sales. \n\nThe bill also threatens Tesla’s other business lines by removing a range of incentives for renewable energy.\n\nTaneja said Tesla faced $300mn in additional tariff-related costs in the second quarter and warned this figure would increase through the year. The US has imposed higher tariffs on foreign-sourced cars and components, including battery cells that Tesla imports from China.\n\n“While we are doing our best to manage these impacts, we are in an unpredictable environment on the tariff front,” he added.\n\nIn a bid to revive its sales momentum, the company said it would aim to begin mass production of its delayed affordable model during the second half of the year. \n\nTesla’s revenue fell 12 per cent to $22.5bn in the second quarter from a year earlier, close to the average $22.7bn analyst estimate, according to data from Visible Alpha. Its operating margin dropped to 4.1 per cent, from 6.3 per cent. Reported net income declined 16 per cent to $1.2bn. \n\nWith the slide in its automotive revenue, Musk has tried to convince investors that the company’s future lies in the growth of its self-driving robotaxi service, which launched in Austin last month.\n\nMusk said the number of robotaxis in operation would increase at “a hyper-exponential rate”, making the ride-hailing service available to half of the US population by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval. \n\nHe also predicted that Tesla would be producing 100,000 of its Optimus AI-powered robots within five years. \n\nDespite the release of an upgraded version of its flagship Model Y sport utility vehicle, Tesla’s sales have continued to sag in big European markets.\n\nMusk said he expected sales to improve in Europe if and when Tesla gets regulatory approval for its “full self-driving” technology, which he said could happen this year. \n\nEarlier this month Tesla disclosed that it sold 384,122 vehicles in the quarter, below the 389,000 forecast by analysts and down 13 per cent from 443,956 in the same period last year.\n\nBarclays analyst Dan Levy said the result was “positive, with improved fundamentals and narrative intact”. \n\nBut he added “the volume outlook remains uncertain” and Tesla did not give a forecast for the number of cars it would build, as investors had expected. Tesla scrapped its guidance in April, blaming economic uncertainty from tariffs.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the Editor’s Digest for free Tesla has issued a caution regarding&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk Predicts Challenging Times for Tesla as Trump Ends EV Incentives first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/elon-musk-predicts-challenging-times-for-tesla-as-trump-ends-ev-incentives/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Elon-Musk-warns-of-‘rough-quarters-ahead-for-Tesla-after.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:51:36","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":344635206,"title":"Australia Lifts Trade Barriers On US Beef","text":"Australia said Thursday it would lift trade barriers on beef from the United States, removing a major point of friction between Canberra and the Trump administration. US President Donald Trump singled out Australia as he unveiled his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April, accusing the close ally of banning American meat while cashing in on exports to the United States. Australia's stringent biosecurity rules block imports of cattle slaughtered in the United States, but born in Canada or Mexico. Threatened with 10 percent tariffs on beef shipped to the United States, one of its largest red meat markets, Australia has now dropped these barriers.Agriculture minister Julie Collins said the United States had adopted new quality controls that soothed Australia's worries. \"The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is satisfied the strengthened control measures put in place by the US effectively manage biosecurity risks,\" she said in a statement. \"Australia stands for open and fair trade -- our cattle industry has significantly benefited from this.\" Australia suspended US beef imports in 2003 after an outbreak of mad cow disease, a fatal and infectious condition that slowly eats away at the nervous system of cattle. Most of these restrictions were lifted in 2019, although some barriers remained on cattle slaughtered in American abattoirs but born elsewhere. Trump said Australians were \"wonderful people\" but accused them of banning US beef while exporting billions of dollars worth of meat to America. \"They don't take any of our beef,\" he complained in April.US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick -- one of the architects behind the US tariff blitz -- had also namechecked Australia. \"Our farmers are blocked from selling almost anywhere. Europe won't let us sell beef, Australia won't let us sell beef,\" Lutnick said earlier this year. Almost five percent of all the beef eaten in America is Australian, and that largely goes into burgers.In the first three weeks of July, Australia shipped almost 25,000 tonnes of beef and veal to the United States, official figures show. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been unusually frank in his condemnation of Trump's trade war against allies and foes alike.\"This is not the act of a friend,\" Albanese said in April after the first wave of tariff announcements. \"These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted,\" he said.\"This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship.\"","summary":"Australia said Thursday it would lift trade barriers on beef from the United States, removing a major point of friction between Canberra and the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/australia-lifts-trade-barriers-us-beef-3779279","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4612460/cattle-graze-paddock-near-australian-farming-town-gunnedah-united-states-major-export.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=0a5cfdc2ad3b97225b7cb9a278c845a1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:42:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.016},{"id":344636180,"title":"Columbia University agrees to pay more than $220M to restore federal funding","text":"As part of the deal, Columbia agreed to a series of changes previously announced in March, including reviewing its Middle East curriculum to make sure it was “comprehensive and balanced” and appointing new faculty to its Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies.

He described this situation as the largest reduction in Medicaid funding in U.S. history, affecting a time when Medicaid supports 70% of seniors in Georgia’s nursing homes.\n\nThe law aims to make $1 trillion dollars in cuts to Medicaid through new work requirements and a reduction in federal funding.\n\nThe facilities deemed at risk were identified by Brown University, considering factors such as the percentage of residents primarily using Medicaid, the occupancy rate of Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF), and their star ratings.\n\nSenator Ossoff said this will impact those rural communities already facing challenges.\n\nOssoff stressed that this funding cut could compromise the financial stability of hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, particularly affecting the residents of rural Georgia, including seniors living in these areas.\n\nMost of the changes to the program aren’t expected until 2027 or 2028.\n\nSenator Ossoff said he hoped the provisions of this law can be repealed before then.\n\n“We’re talking about our seniors, the elders in our community, those who need care, who need support, our parents, our treasured grandparents and loved ones.

Trump's executive action seeks to prevent children born on U.S. soil from automatically receiving citizenship if neither parent was an American citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth.Wednesday's decision from the appeals court reinforced the 14th Amendment's longstanding interpretation making birthright citizenship accessible to nearly all individuals born in the U.S., regardless of their parents' legal status.What To KnowThe appeals court ruled on Wednesday that Trump's executive order is unconstitutional and upheld a lower-court decision that blocked its nationwide enforcement.Judge Ronald Gould, writing the opinion for the court, said Trump's executive order \"contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment's grant of citizenship.\"The ruling added: \"The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order's proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional. We fully agree.\"Wednesday's ruling was 2-1, with two judges appointed by President Bill Clinton forming the majority, while one judge appointed by Trump dissented.In an executive order posted on the day Trump was inaugurated, the president said that \"the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'\"What People Are SayingTrump in his January executive order in part: \"Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: (1) when that person's mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth, or (2) when that person's mother's presence in the United States at the time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth.\"The federal court's ruling in part: \"Article II of the Constitution establishes the scope of presidential powers ... The President has the power to issue executive orders if they 'stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself,' on matters that fall within that scope established by Article II ... But one power that the President was not granted, by Article II or by any other source, is the power to modify or change any clause of the United States Constitution.\"Representative Claudia Tenney, a New York Republican, on X on Wednesday: \"Birthright citizenship was never meant to be a reward for breaking our immigration laws. The Constitutional Citizenship Clarification Act makes it clear: No citizenship for children born to illegal aliens, foreign spies, or terrorists.\"Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown, a Democrat, on X on Wednesday: \"The Ninth Circuit affirms our nationwide injunction in birthright citizenship. The court agrees that the president cannot redefine what it means to be American with the stroke of a pen. He cannot strip away the rights, liberties, and protections of children born in our country. This lawsuit was the first case I brought as Attorney General, and I am proud that courts at every level agree with us. - NB\"What Happens Next The Trump administration retains the option to appeal the decision, setting the stage for the U.S. Supreme Court to potentially rule on the constitutionality of President Trump's birthright citizenship order.Legal experts and advocates anticipate that the dispute will likely resolve only through Supreme Court review, given the scale of the states and individuals affected.Update 7/23/25 8:38 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.","summary":"The ruling by the federal appeals court marks a significant setback for President Trump's efforts to redefine U.S. citizenship rules.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-birthright-citizenship-appeals-court-2103224","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2689117/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=81288f80e58277fa27ecf83cb3ebd8be","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:32:54","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":344634008,"title":"Trump says a China trip is ‘not too distant’ as trade tensions ease","text":"President Donald Trump yesterday [Macau time] said a trip to China might be “not too distant,” raising prospects that the leaders of the world’s two largest economies may meet soon to help reset relations after moving to climb down from a trade war.\n\nTrump made the remarks while hosting Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the White House, where he praised the “fantastic military relationship” with Manila as the U.S. looks to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nYet, Trump still said the U.S. is “getting along with China very well.

China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in response to Trump’s hiking the tax on Chinese goods to 145%.\n\nBoth sides also imposed on each other harsh trade restrictions on critical products: China on rare earths, and the U.S. on computing chips and jet engine technology.\n\nTrade tensions, however, eased following two rounds of high-level talks in Geneva and London, when the two sides agreed to lower tariffs — pending a more permanent deal by mid-August — and pull back on trade restrictions.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria” that he will be meeting with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm next week to work on “what is likely an extension” of the Aug. 12 deadline.\n\n“I think trade is in a very good place with China,” Bessent told host Maria Bartiromo. “Hopefully, we can see the Chinese pull back on some of this glut of manufacturing that they’re doing and concentrate on building a consumer economy.”\n\nHe said he also expects to bring up China’s purchases of Russian and Iranian oil and Beijing’s role in aiding Moscow in its war against Ukraine.\n\nBeijing has not announced any travel plans for Vice Premier He Lifeng, who led trade negotiations in both Geneva and London on behalf of the Chinese government, but it is not unusual for China to make such announcements closer to a travel date.\n\nIn a possible friendly gesture, Beijing on Tuesday said it suspended an antitrust investigation into chemical maker DuPont’s operations in China. DuPont said in a statement that it is “pleased” with China’s action.

Trump was told that numerous high-profile individuals were mentioned in the Epstein files, which included unverified claims the department deemed not credible, among them, those involving Trump.Two White House officials said the meeting focused broadly on the department’s findings and did not center specifically on Trump. Still, the revelation contradicts Trump’s recent public denial that he was informed his name was in the files.“No, no. She’s given us just a very quick briefing,” Trump said last week when asked about Bondi’s notification.Officials were reportedly frustrated that Bondi did not redact Trump’s name from materials made publicly available earlier this year, including a set of binders distributed to conservative influencers in February.Live EventsCommunications Director Steven Cheung also defended the president, stating:“The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep.”Sources inside the Justice Department confirmed that investigators found no so-called \"client list\" and no evidence to challenge the official ruling that Epstein died by suicide in 2019.The controversy has placed Trump at odds with parts of his base, who have pushed for full transparency on the Epstein case. It has also triggered rare bipartisan pressure on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday(July 23), a House Oversight subcommittee voted to subpoena the DOJ for additional documents.Adding to the pressure, a recent Wall Street Journal report described a 2003 birthday gift to Epstein, an album allegedly containing a letter with Trump’s name and a sketch of a nude woman. Trump has denied writing the letter and is suing the Journal over the publication.In a joint statement, Bondi and Blanche said:“Nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution. As part of our routine briefing, we made the President aware of the findings.”Still, the political fallout is far from over.

I am not saying that we will, but we could,” the chief executive said.\n\nAuto revenue for Tesla came in at $US16.7 billion ($25.3b) in the second quarter, down from $US19.9b in the same quarter last year. Of that sum, revenue from sales of auto regulatory credits declined to $US439m from $US890m a year earlier.\n\nIn early July, Tesla reported a 14 per cent year-over-year slide in vehicle deliveries to 384,000 for the second quarter. Deliveries are the closest approximation of EV sales reported by Tesla but aren’t precisely defined in its shareholder communications.\n\nTesla’s slump this year is partly due to backlash against the company in the US and Europe, after Musk spent heavily to help re-elect President Donald Trump, endorsed Germany’s extreme anti-immigrant AfD party and then led the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nThere, Musk slashed the federal workforce, rolled back regulations and eliminated the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nThe company’s shares were down about 18 per cent for the year as of their last close, making it the worst performance among tech’s megacaps. The Nasdaq is up about 9 per cent in 2025.\n\nThe stock was flat in extended trading until the earnings call, but it began to dip after Taneja said the so-called “big beautiful bill” recently passed by Congress would affect Tesla’s business. The bill ends a federal $US7500 EV tax credit at the end of September.\n\nTesla has also shifted aspects of its supply chain to deal with Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“Given the abrupt change, we have limited supply of vehicles in the US this quarter,” Taneja said. “We may not be able to guarantee delivery orders placed in the later part of August and beyond.”\n\nTesla’s net income fell to $US1.17b in the second quarter, from $US1.4 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn its shareholder deck, Tesla said it began its “first builds of a more affordable model in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025”.\n\nTesla has to this point put off the production of a less pricey “model 2” EV. Meanwhile, other automakers are now offering a greater variety of vehicles, and China-based competitors are selling affordable EVs with high-tech self-driving features as a standard rather than premium option.\n\nMusk has tried to keep fans and investors focused on Tesla’s future, which he envisions as being dominated by the company’s robotaxis and humanoid Optimus robots. Musk has said Tesla’s robotaxis could work for their owners, making them money while they sleep. Optimus robots, he has said, will be so sophisticated that they can serve as factory workers or babysitters.\n\nIn June, Tesla began testing a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, which operates in a limited area with a human valet on board.

This vision was unveiled during the Pennsylvania Energy Summit and Expo in Pittsburgh, where interim CEO Dan Sumner met with President Donald Trump to discuss this transformative endeavor.\n\nExecutive Orders Catalyst\n\nOn 23 May, President Trump signed four pivotal executive orders intended to revolutionize the US nuclear sector and aim for quadruple growth in nuclear capacity by 2050. These orders not only enhance the civil nuclear energy framework but also propel the development of advanced nuclear technologies vital for security and economic growth. They set a national vision in motion that emphasizes both innovation and national capacity.\n\nA Vision for the Future\n\nDuring the Summit, hosted by US Senator David McCormick, Sumner emphasized the economic boons tied to this initiative. “Deploying this fleet of reactors aligns with the President’s vision, injecting USD75 billion of economic value across the nation and creating or sustaining over 55,000 jobs,” Sumner declared. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania alone is poised to gain USD6 billion in value—creating over 15,000 jobs across sectors such as manufacturing, engineering, and construction.\n\nPennsylvania’s Strategic Advantage\n\nPennsylvania, as the second-largest energy-producing state, is uniquely poised to harness this nuclear revolution. Senator McCormick highlighted the state’s strengths: skilled workforce, top-tier universities, and strategic location. These assets, he argued, position Pennsylvania as a linchpin in realizing the nation’s energy aspirations.\n\nA Broader Commitment to Innovation\n\nThe Expo also spotlighted a USD92 billion commitment to AI and energy innovations. Utility Constellation’s pledge to invest USD2.4 billion in the Limerick nuclear power plant, boosting production by 340 MWe and creating 3,000 jobs annually, showcases the synergistic potential of AI and nuclear power.\n\n“As a leader in nuclear power, Pennsylvania supports the demands of the growing AI and advanced manufacturing industries,” said McCormick. “This initiative is a beacon of energy security and economic prosperity.”\n\nAccording to World Nuclear News, these developments position the US on a trajectory toward sustainable and strategic energy dominance.\n\nWith firms like Westinghouse seizing the helm in this nuclear and AI confluence, the nation’s energy landscape is on the brink of a transformative era—one that harnesses cutting-edge technology for a greener and more powerful future.","summary":"By 2030, Westinghouse aims to revolutionize US energy with ten AP1000 reactors, promising vast economic and job growth.","url":"https://internetprotocol.co/wtf/2025/07/24/westinghouse-to-launch-transformative-nuclear-reactor-initiative-by-2030/","image":"https://internetprotocol.co/content/images/2025/07/3330553241.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:16:39","author":"Kay Lee","authors":["Kay Lee"],"language":"en","source_country":"co","sentiment":0.465},{"id":344629370,"title":"Democrats are Setting the Stage for Another Government Shutdown Showdown","text":"On Tuesday, The Daily Signal was the first to report that the White House would be sending another rescissions package—the same mechanism that President Donald Trump and Republicans just used to defund NPR and PBS—to Capitol Hill that focuses on education. With the Sept. 30 government funding deadline fast approaching, Democrats are threatening a government shutdown. \n\n“We Democrats want a bipartisan deal,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday. “The bottom line is Republicans are making it much harder—rescissions, impoundment, pocket rescissions directly undoes this.”\n\nAs a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, is intimately involved in the current effort to fund the government and answer the American people’s call for a return to fiscal sanity in Washington. He joined “The Signal Sitdown” to discuss how Democrats—and even some Republicans—might try to railroad President Trump’s agenda in the coming weeks.\n\nAfter Democrats suffered defeat at the hands of Trump yet again, Cloud “thought there would be at least some moderation by the Dems. Maybe not in true heart, but at least in presentation, when it came to how they would approach this term.” \n\nAs another shutdown showdown takes shape, it’s becoming increasingly clear that has not happened. “They’ve continued to double down, and radically so, on the same principles that lost them the hearts and minds of the American people,” Cloud told The Daily Signal.\n\nThat’s especially been the case on the appropriations committee. “We started having these committee hearings and they kept doubling down,” Cloud explained. “We’re not where we were a generation ago, where it’s like the political discussion was you wanted the same things for the country and the conversation was what’s the best way to get there.”\n\nWhen it comes to appropriations, that means a return to normalcy is all the more difficult because, unlike budget reconciliation, Republicans will need Democrat votes to get past the Senate filibuster and send appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to the president’s desk by Sept. 30.\n\nCloud explained how appropriations—by statute—is supposed to work: “The appropriations process is how the government is supposed to be funded, and that’s split up between 12 different bills that each have a different area of jurisdiction.”\n\nFor decades, however, Congress has failed to do things by the book. Year after year, “we get to September 30th and Congress acts like that’s a date that was new, like ‘September 30th is here! Oh my gosh!’” Cloud said. “And then, too often we end up with this big, huge, massive omnibus bill—thousands of pages long—on Christmas Eve or Christmas Eve-eve, and that’s a recipe to getting to 37 trillion in debt.”\n\nIt’s not just the Democrats’ fault — establishment Republicans share the blame, as well. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, for example, is the appropriations committee chair in the Senate. There’s an old saying in Washington: There’s Democrats, Republicans, and appropriators. \n\nAs appropriators draw up plans for discretionary spending levels, Cloud suggested they are not keen on cutting. “When you talk to the appropriators, they’ll say, ‘Well, you know, most of that spending is on the mandatory side,’” Cloud said. “‘Mandatory [spending]—that’s where the real savings and fiscal change needs to happen.’ There’s a little truth to that, but it’s our job to right-size a bloated government.”\n\n“Sometimes, you know, we’d say, ‘Well, we need to cut this department,’” Cloud continued. To which these squeamish appropriators would reply, “‘If we do that, we’re going to have to fire people.’”\n\n“Well, that’s kind of the goal,” Cloud would reply. “This is about getting back to the core functions of what a constitutional republic is supposed to be doing, and you do a lot of that through how you manage the checkbook, which is our number one task as Congress.”\n\nBecause of these dynamics in years past, Republicans would enter shutdown negotiations with an incredibly weak hand. “Too often we negotiate with ourselves,” Cloud said of the House appropriations process. Whether it’s appropriations bills or a continuing resolution, “we pass what we think the end product should be, and then we show up to that with the negotiating table, and then it moves even further away.”\n\nCloud says House Republicans are working to make sure things are different this time. “We’ll get to the negotiating table with the strongest negotiating position possible,” he said. \n\nTrump, Cloud suggested, is taking a similar approach. “He’s a reformer. He’s not just coming in and saying, okay, we’re gonna do the same thing as last year,” the congressman said of “The Art of the Deal” author.\n\nRepublicans will likely try, and fail, to move appropriations bills through the Senate because of Democrat obstruction. Which sets the table for yet another gamble with government funding leading up to Sept. 30.\n\nCloud remains confident. \n\n“People have doubted what we’ve been able to do in the Republican conference, and yet at every hurdle, we’ve been able to get through it,” he told The Daily Signal. “We realize that this is a unique moment in history with a transformative president and a unique opportunity and window of time to actually make a difference and save this country.”","summary":"On Tuesday, The Daily Signal was the first to report that the White House would be sending another rescissions package—the same mechanism that President Donald...

However, he was surprised by the events that unfolded, as he shared exclusively with the Daily Mail.\n\nCernovich and the others had been told they would meet Vice President JD Vance and perhaps a few other officials as an informal welcome to Trump 2.0.\n\n‘A bunch of people were invited, no one really knew the agenda,’ he said. ‘The purpose was to meet with administration officials.’\n\nDuring the meeting, Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared unexpectedly with gifts. According to administration sources, Bondi surprised White House officials by attending the meeting unannounced and distributing white folders.\n\n‘She walks in; she goes, “hey, I’ve got a surprise for you guys, here are the binders,”‘ revealed conservative commentator Rogan O’Handley, also known online as dc_draino, another one of the attendees.\n\nO’Handley explained on his Instagram channel: ‘We were pretty excited because the night before [Bondi] said on Jesse Watters, “We’re going to be releasing Epstein stuff.” I was like, holy c***, we got the Epstein files.’\n\nEarlier, Bondi even told Fox News that a list of Jeffrey’s Epstein’s clients was ‘sitting on my desk right now to review.’ \n\nThe 15 influencers walked out of the White House following the meeting aglow with the supposed possession of juicy secrets, proudly displaying for the cameras their ring binders, labeled ‘The Epstein Files: Phase 1.’\n\n‘Only 15 binders were printed, given to 15 independent journalists now included in a growing press pool,’ wrote Jessica Reed Kraus, another attendee, on Instagram.\n\n‘Proof that a powerful shift is happening,’ she bragged. ‘Trump walked in and told us we are the most trusted media now. And that he counts our efforts as the reason he won.’\n\nThe elation of the MAGA-verse punditry was short-lived.\n\nThe ‘Epstein Files’ turned out to be nothing but a wholly redacted list of 254 ‘masseurs’, flight logs which had been available online since at least 2019, and Epstein’s redacted address book, equally well-thumbed.\n\nOne meeting attendee told the Daily Mail that they then found themselves on the defensive against critics who accused them of acting like ‘shills’ for the administration.\n\nFive months later, a group of MAGA-friendly podcasters are feeling similarly duped by the White House, lamenting their lack of transparency around the investigation into the disgraced deceased pedophile.\n\nThe grumbling into their microphones has sparked a rare clandestine White House pressure campaign to try and tone down the festering criticisms.\n\nCernovich said the only way to resolve the rift was to release ‘the original search warrant applications’ for Epstein’s 2019 arrest, which he says Bondi ‘could have done already.’\n\n‘This is more a job for an Inspector General,’ he said. ‘A real hard ass, by-the-book person who doesn’t have patience for nonsense, and can order everyone to testify under oath.’\n\nCernovich noted that the Justice Department does not need a court order to unseal the documents: ‘To me that’s sus. Why don’t we have this basic stuff?’\n\nIndeed, the MAGA world fury is not dying down after Bondi’s Justice Department released a July 7 memo on their investigation.\n\nThe document stated that the DOJ was not a possession of an ‘incriminating’ Epstein ‘client list,’ had no credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals and concluded that the convicted pedophile was not murdered in prison.\n\n‘No further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted,’ the DOJ flatly declared.\n\nSuffice to say, it didn’t go over well.\n\nTim Dillon, a popular podcaster who interviewed Vice President Vance on October 26 in the run-up to the 2024 election, said he was invited to a dinner last week with Vance, who told him that the 10,000 hours of video files in connection to the Epstein case were ‘commercial pornography’ and cannot be released.\n\nDillion claims Vance told him ‘they do not have videos of any powerful person in a compromising position,’ before remarking with skepticism, ‘That’s the party line that they’re going with?’\n\n‘What I told Vance, I said, “If you don’t disclose everything, you’re done. Nobody will support you guys. You are fully and completely part of this coverup if everything doesn’t come out.” I think it paralyzes their presidency,’ said Dillon, adding, ‘[Vance] agrees with me.’\n\nConspiracy theorist and InfoWars host Alex Jones appeared on Dillion’s podcast on Monday to say that he, too, has been contacted by the White House.\n\n‘I’ve had the White House call up and be like in the last week, “What do you want?”,’ Jones said.\n\nJones said he told a White House staffer, ‘I want you to do what you were elected to do,’ a reference to Trump’s campaign trail pledges for complete transparency in the Epstein investigation.\n\nDillon then replied: ‘They want this to go away… [But] it’s not going to go away until [they] disclose the information [they] have.’\n\nThe Daily Mail can also report that the White House reached out to Charlie Kirk, the highly influential leader of youth movement, organized under his non-profit organization Turning Point USA.\n\n‘I am not minimizing this,’ Kirk said on his podcast on July 15. ‘I am just the messenger here. I am simply the interlocutor. The young men, and the Gen-Z audience that I represent, they are flaming mad about this stuff.’\n\nKirk explained the conservative people he speaks to refuse to drop the issue because ‘they want to go after the deep state of government.’\n\nTrump, increasingly irritated at the fixation of erstwhile allies, picked up the phone to Kirk.\n\nA day later, Kirk appeared to backpedal: ‘Honestly, I’m done talking about Epstein for the time being. I’m going to trust my friends in the administration, I’m going to trust my friends in the government to do what needs to be done, solve it, ball’s in their hands.’\n\nOn Tuesday, Attorney General Bondi announced that her deputy, Todd Blanche, would ‘in the coming days’ visit Epstein’s convicted accomplice and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell at the federal low-security prison in Tallahassee where she is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in a sex trafficking ring.\n\nMaxwell was sentenced in June 2022, and the Daily Mail reported exclusively last week that she is willing to reveal everything she knowns about Epstein. The Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee announced on Tuesday that they would issue a subpoena for her testimony.\n\nBut also on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that he was sending the House home early for the summer on Wednesday to avoid holding votes on a bipartisan measure (sponsored by Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA)) to force the release of files related to Epstein.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that DOJ officials told Trump is May that his name appears in a ‘truckload’ of documents related to Epstein.\n\nFor his part, Cernovich told the Daily Mail that he had not been leaned on by anyone in the White House to stop talking about Epstein – and added that he would refuse to do so if asked.\n\n‘No one has asked me to stop or tried to shape discourse,’ he said. ‘Whole thing is strange to me. Suddenly we are supposed to stop talking about Epstein? Suddenly, Democrats and Massie (who hates Trump, and did zero to try unsealing documents during Biden’s time) are saying they want the files. Bizarre all around.’\n\nIn a statement the White House told the Daily Mail: ‘We hold regular meetings and phone calls with influencers and new media individuals, which began at the start of the White House administration. We discuss a range of issues, including current news and stories that aren’t being covered.’\n\nBut Cernovich warned: ‘This might be the only issue where the MAGA base will truly assert itself. On about any other issue, Trump can drive the train wherever he wants. Not on Epstein.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAfter only 38 days back in the White House, President Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Top Trump Supporters Unveil Hidden Meetings on Epstein &#8216;Cover-up&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/top-trump-supporters-unveil-hidden-meetings-on-epstein-cover-up/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trumps-biggest-allies-reveal-secret-Epstein-cover-up-meetings.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:13:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":344629724,"title":"Musk Claimed Trump Was In The Epstein Files In June—And Has Trolled Him Ever Since","text":"Elon Musk, President Donald Trump’s former “first buddy,” has blasted the president for his handling of the Epstein files this week, pressing Trump over a month after he first alleged the “real reason” the files have not been made public was because Trump was named in them.\n\nMusk alleged Trump was in the files in a since-deleted tweet from June.

Musk deleted the tweet days later, taking a reconciliatory tone with Trump for a few weeks, though disputes between them sparked once again at the start of July (see a timeline of their feud here).\n\nWho Else Has Musk Implicated In The Epstein Files?\n\nMusk has also implicated former Trump strategist and convicted felon Steve Bannon in the files. Bannon said in July he is \"totally and completely focused on” Musk’s destruction, prompting Musk to accuse him of being in the Epstein files and that he should go back to prison after serving a four-month sentence last year. Bannon has suggested Musk should be deported.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal report alleging Trump was informed of his name being in the Epstein files noted the president was also told the files contained what senior officials believed to be unverified hearsay about people including Trump. The briefing with the president did not focus on the appearance of his name in the files, which does not explicitly mean he committed any wrongdoing. Officials described the briefing to the Journal as routine.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump, who was friends with Epstein before the late financier’s first arrest, said last year he would declassify the Epstein files in an interview with Fox News. By this month, Trump was telling his supporters to \"not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.” Trump was shielding Bondi from a wave of backlash over her claim she had the Epstein client list on her desk, while she faced immense blowback over a DOJ memo announcing no further information in the Epstein investigation would be released. Bondi has also received scrutiny from providing right-wing commentators with “phase 1” of the Epstein files, even though the binders given to the commentators had largely redacted pages already made available to the public. Democrats have attempted to force a vote in the House on the release of the Epstein files. Johnson, who has called for “transparency” around the files, blocked Democrats from forcing the vote Tuesday and has said he will shut down further votes next week. However, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have pushed a bipartisan discharge petition that could force a floor vote when the House returns from recess.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Musk Vs.

Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes. These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio.\"\nThere's still no evidence the 2020 election was rigged.

The report took issue with the conclusion reached in December 2016 that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had favoured Trump.\nKash Patel, now Mr. Trump's F.B.I. director, was a key author of the report released on Wednesday, according to officials. Only Republicans on the committee participated in the drafting of the 2017 report and revisions in 2020, as reported by The New York Times.\nThe House report found that most of the judgments made by the intelligence community in 2016 were sound. But it argued that the work was rushed, as a recent tradecraft analysis by the C.I.A. also found. The assessment that Mr. Putin had favoured Trump did not follow the \"professional criteria\" of the other findings, the House report said, as per the New York Times.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: The White House pulled out all the stops Wednesday to promote claims that Barack Obama headed a \"treasonous conspiracy\" against Donald Trump, seeking to redirect public attention from uproar over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein affair.\nTrump's intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard told a White House press briefing there had been a \"years-long coup\" by Obama.\nThe extraordinary narrative essentially rehashed Trump's longstanding argument that investigations into Russia's multi-layered attempts to disrupt the 2016 election, where he beat Hillary Clinton, were a \"hoax\" against him.\nGabbard touted newly declassified intelligence that she said provided \"irrefutable evidence\" that Obama had ordered intelligence assessments to be manipulated to accuse Russia of election interference to help Trump.\nThe justice department announced the formation of a \"Strike Force\" to examine the allegations with \"utmost seriousness.\"\nBut Gabbard's findings run up against four separate criminal, counterintelligence and watchdog probes between 2019 and 2023 - each of them concluding that Russia did interfere and did, in various ways, help Trump.\nAs a way to distract from the intensifying speculation over Trump's handling of the case against the late sex offender and reputed pedophile pimp to the powerful Epstein, the Obama accusations had some effect.\nWhite House journalists at the briefing barely asked about Epstein, focusing instead on Gabbard's claims, and Fox News heavily promoted the Obama story to its right-wing audience.\nHowever, the Epstein scandal quickly roared back, showing just how hard it is for 79-year-old Trump to maintain his usual mastery of driving news agendas - even within his fervently loyal \"MAGA\" base.\nTrump's name in files\nEpstein was a financier and friend to numerous high-profile people -for years, including Trump - who was convicted of sex crimes and then imprisoned pending trial for allegedly trafficking underage girls.\nHis 2019 prison cell death - ruled a suicide - supercharged a conspiracy theory long promoted by many of Trump's supporters that Epstein had run an international pedophile ring and that elites wanted to make sure he never revealed their secrets.\nAfter Trump came to power for a second term this January, his administration promised to release Epstein case files.\nBut when US attorney general Pam Bondi announced on July 7 that she had nothing to release, Republicans were furious - and Trump has been attempting to control the scandal ever since.\nThings got even more complicated for him after The Wall Street Journal last week reported that Trump had written a lewd birthday letter to Epstein in 2003. Trump denies this and has sued the Journal.\nOn Wednesday, the Journal dropped a new story, saying Bondi had informed Trump in May that his name appeared several times in the Epstein files, even if there was no indication of wrongdoing.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung called this \"fake news\" and said Trump had long ago broken with Epstein and \"kicked him out of his club for being a creep.\"\nHowever, the drip-drip of reminders of Trump's close former relationship with Epstein is proving hard to stop.\nSeveral of Trump's most effective promoters over the years - including new FBI director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino - made careers of fanning the rumours about Epstein.\nDemocrats are piling on the pressure. Republican leaders in the house of representatives sent lawmakers home early for a six-week summer break Wednesday to avoid being forced into holding politically awkward votes on the affair.\nBut some lawmakers on the \"MAGA\" right have indicated they are in no mood to let Epstein drop, and several bids for transparency are in the works.\nJust before the declared recess, Democrats on a House subcommittee panel forced a vote on subpoenaing the justice department for documents regarding Epstein.\nThe measure passed with bipartisan support.\nIn another bid to satisfy his base, Trump had told Bondi to release \"credible\" Epstein information and to seek release of grand jury transcripts from the 2005 and 2007 investigations of Epstein.\nBut on Wednesday a judge rejected this, citing legal secrecy protocols.","summary":"Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard says at a White House briefing that the 'years-long coup' leads back to the former president.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/07/24/white-house-pushes-obama-coup-story-to-distract-from-epstein","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/c611440e-tulsi-gabbard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 00:02:07","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":344633964,"title":"NZ Government is Captured","text":"In politics, regulatory capture is a form of corruption of authority that occurs when a political entity, policymaker, or regulator is co-opted to serve the commercial, ideological, or political interests of a minor constituency.1\n\n… As a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit…\n\nWe propose the general hypothesis: every industry or occupation that has enough political power to utilize the state will seek to control entry.\n\nGeorge Stigler, The Theory of Economic Regulation (1971)\n\nLast year, I observed that our government had been captured by corporate interests.\n\nDon’t get me wrong here – there’s nothing wrong with businesses.\n\nEvery government serves constituents.\n\nAnd businesses have always been an integral part of modern economics.

Vehicles made in Mexico for export to the United States have, on average, 40% U.S. — and thus duty-free — content, lowering the effective tariff rate to 15%.\n\nSheinbaum acknowledged that automakers with lower U.S. content in their vehicles that export to the United States in accordance with “most favored nation” rules, rather than under the USMCA, face a higher tariff.\n\nHowever, those “mainly European” automakers haven’t said they’re leaving the country either, she said.\n\n“We’re in personal contact with all the companies … and none has suggested moving [out of Mexico]. Nissan even … moved part of production of one of its models from Argentina to Mexico and there will be greater production in our country,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nHer remarks came after Automotive News published an article on Monday under the headline “Nissan shutting Mexico plant that was company’s first outside Japan by early 2027.”\n\n“According to two people with knowledge of the matter, Nissan is expected to shut down its nearly 60-year-old Civac plant in south-central Mexico no later than March 2027, the end of the Japanese carmaker’s business year,” the website said.\n\n“Additionally, Nissan is expected to dissolve its COMPAS joint venture with Mercedes after crossover production at the 2.37-million-square-foot factory in Aguascalientes, Mexico, concludes early next year,” Automotive News said.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Nissan hadn’t commented publicly on the claims in the Automotive News report.\n\nRodrigo Centeno, president and general director of Nissan Mexicana, said in April that Nissan was sticking to its current production and investment plans for Mexico despite the United States’ imposition of tariffs on imported vehicles.\n\n“There is no modification to short-term plans because to a large extent those decisions aren’t short-term ones,” he said at the time.\n\n“… We don’t have any change on the table at this time. We have the pedal to the metal,” Centeno said.\n\nHis assertion served as reassurance for the Mexican auto sector as Nissan’s CEO Makoto Uchida said in February that the automaker could leave Mexico if 25% tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump were to take effect.\n\nNissan has three plants in Mexico — two in the state of Aguascalientes and one in Morelos — from which it exports about 320,000 vehicles to the U.S. each year. The company sold more cars in Mexico last year than any other automaker.\n\nChicharito ‘has a lot to learn’ about women, says Sheinbaum \n\nA reporter asked the president about recent remarks made by soccer star Javier “Chicharito” Hernández that have been widely criticized and described as sexist and misogynistic.\n\nHernández, a former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Mexican national team footballer who now plays for the Chivas de Guadalajara, made the remarks in a series of videos posted to social media.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nIn one, he says: “Women, you are failing. You are eradicating masculinity, making society hyper-sensitive. You embody feminine energy: caring, nourishing, receiving, multiplying, cleaning, maintaining the home that is the most precious place for us men. Don’t be afraid to be women, to allow yourselves to be led by a man who only wants to see you happy.”\n\nSheinbaum said that Chicharito is a “very good soccer player,” but with regard to his opinions about women, she declared: “I think he still has a lot to learn because women can be whatever we want to be.”\n\nA relationship between a woman and a man is “a relationship of equality,” the president said, pointing out that the concept of “substantive equality” is now in the Mexican Constitution.\n\n“It’s equality, but each [gender] with its own characteristics,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… In terms of access to all rights, there is equality,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum said that the idea that a woman’s place is in the home is a “very sexist” idea.\n\n“It’s not about arguing with ‘el Chicharito’ because he’s a great soccer player and has represented Mexico at different times. But it is important that all men in our country recognize women as people,” she said.\n\n“… Women can be whatever we want to be. This is a learning not just for women … but also for men, for society as a whole,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"The president addressed rumors on Wednesday that Nissan is planning to close two of its three plants in Mexico, a claim that the company has not yet confirmed.\n\n\nThe post Neither Nissan nor any other automaker is leaving Mexico, says Sheinbaum: Wednesday&#8217;s mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/nissan-leaving-mexico-wednesdays-mananera-recapped/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1040940_Mananera-Claudia-Sheinbaum_impreso.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 23:52:39","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.6},{"id":344626248,"title":"Mike Lindell Reacts After Appeals Court Victory Over 2020 Election Claims","text":"A federal appeals court delivered a win to MyPillow founder Mike Lindell on Wednesday, ruling he does not have to pay a $5 million award to a software engineer who challenged Lindell's claims that China interfered in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals found that an arbitration panel exceeded its authority in awarding the money to Robert Zeidman, a Las Vegas-based engineer who participated in Lindell's 2021 \"Prove Mike Wrong Challenge.\"\"It's a great day for our country,\" Lindell said in an interview following the decision. \"This is a big win. It opens the door to getting rid of these electronic voting machines and getting paper ballots, hand-counted.\"Lindell has been a leading voice in promoting claims that the 2020 election was rigged, despite more than 50 failed court challenges from allies of President Donald Trump and clear statements from Trump's own Justice Department rejecting widespread fraud.As part of a \"Cyber Symposium\" Lindell hosted in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, he promised $5 million to anyone who could prove that the packet capture data he released were not from the 2020 election. Zeidman submitted a 15-page report debunking the data and, after contest officials refused to declare him the winner, he filed for arbitration. A panel of three arbitrators—including one chosen by Lindell—ruled in Zeidman's favor and awarded the $5 million. U.S. District Judge John Tunheim later upheld the decision, despite calling the contest rules a \"poorly written contract.\"However, the appeals court disagreed. In its ruling, the 8th Circuit said the arbitrators strayed beyond the contract's clear terms.\"Whatever one might think of the logic of the panel's reasoning, it is contrary to Minnesota law. ... Fair or not, agreed-to contract terms may not be modified by the panel or by this court,\" the court wrote. The case was remanded to the lower court with instructions to vacate the award.Zeidman's attorney, Brian Glasser, criticized the ruling and encouraged the public to evaluate the original arbitration decision for themselves.\"Judge for yourselves if the Eighth Circuit's decision today is more persuasive, or rings in truth louder, than the unanimous contrary decision of three arbitrators who heard all the evidence, including one appointed by Mr. Lindell,\" he said.The ruling comes amid a string of legal battles for Lindell. Just last month, a Colorado jury found him liable for defaming a former voting machine company employee by accusing him of treason, awarding $2.3 million in damages. Lindell is appealing that verdict as well, claiming it was a personal loss and not one for MyPillow, which was not held liable.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"The ruling comes amid a string of legal battles for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mike-lindell-mypillow-wins-court-appeal-2020-election-2103219","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2689111/lindell-wh.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=986f4e8037512424245bf776c7a54906","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 23:52:16","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.491},{"id":344627462,"title":"World News | State Department Approves $322 Million in Proposed Weapons Sales to Ukraine","text":"Washington, Jul 24 (AP) The State Department said Wednesday that it has approved $322 million in proposed weapons sales to Ukraine to enhance its air defense capabilities and provide armored combat vehicles, coming as the country works to fend off escalating Russian attacks. The potential sales, which the department said were notified to Congress, include $150 million for the supply, maintenance, repair and overhaul of U.S. armored vehicles, and $172 million for surface-to-air missile systems.

The approvals come weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed a pause on other weapons shipments to Ukraine to allow the Pentagon to assess its weapons stockpiles, in a move that caught the White House by surprise. President Donald Trump then made an abrupt change in posture, pledging publicly earlier this month to continue to send weapons to Ukraine. “We have to,” Trump said. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now. We're going to send some more weapons — defensive weapons primarily.” Also Read | Fact Check: Is Westarctica a Real Country or Fictional Name?

Trump recently endorsed a plan to have European allies buy U.S. military equipment that can then be transferred to Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how the latest proposed sales related to that arrangement. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. has provided more than $67 billion in weapons and security assistance to Kyiv. Since Trump came back into office, his administration has gone back and forth about providing more military aid to Ukraine, with political pressure to stop U.S. funding of foreign wars coming from the isolationists inside the Trump administration and on Capitol Hill. Over the course of the war, the U.S. has routinely pressed for allies to provide air defense systems to Ukraine. But many are reluctant to give up the high-tech systems, particularly countries in Eastern Europe that also feel threatened by Russia.

The company did not provide an update on its full-year deliveries forecast, citing the economy and timing of the new car rollout.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"Tesla's disappointing results aren't surprising given the rocky road it's traveled recently,\" said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"A truly affordable model will hit the bullseye in terms of boosting sales if Tesla can effectively position it right without detracting from its higher-priced models.\"\n\nThe second straight quarterly revenue drop, with a 12% fall, comes despite the launch of a refreshed version of its best-selling Model Y SUV that investors had hoped would help revive demand.\n\nA 51% dive in sales of automotive regulatory credits, which other automakers who have difficulty complying with government emissions rules buy from Tesla, also hurt revenue and profit.\n\nRevenue fell to $22.5 billion for the April-June quarter from $25.50 billion a year earlier, slightly behind analyst targets compiled by LSEG. Adjusted profit per share of 40 cents lagged the Wall Street consensus.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV598963 \nAbout ConnatixV598963 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nThe automotive gross margin, which excludes regulatory credits, was 14.96%, above Wall Street estimates, helped in part by lower cost per vehicle.\n\nPricing and margins are important as Tesla wrestles with demand and faces falling government support. Tesla global deliveries dropped 13.5% in the second quarter, and the U.S. government later this year is cutting $7,500 tax credits for EV buyers.\n\n\"We probably could have a few rough quarters,\" Musk said, when asked about the credits. \"I'm not saying we will, but we could - you know, Q4, Q1, maybe Q2, but once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I think I'd be surprised if Tesla's economics are not very compelling.\"\n\nAUTONOMOUS RIDE HAILING\n\nTesla had said in April it would start producing the more affordable model by the end of the first half and sources had told Reuters the vehicle, a stripped-down version of its Model Y SUV, would be delayed by at least months. Tesla on Wednesday did not disclose any details of the model, how many units it had made, or how it would be priced. Musk responded to a question of what the vehicle would look like by saying, \"It's just a Model Y,\" joking that he \"let the cat out of the bag there.\"\n\nTesla's lineup is relatively old, despite a recent refresh of the flagship Model Y, and it faces rising competition from cheaper EVs, especially in China, and a persistent backlash against Musk's far-right political views.\n\nThe company also said it continued to expect volume production of its custom-built robotaxi - called the Cybercab - and Semi Truck in 2026.\n\nMuch of the company's trillion-dollar valuation hangs on its bet on its robotaxi service - a small trial of which was started in Austin, Texas, last month with about a dozen Model Y SUVs - and on its development of humanoid robots.\n\n\"Autonomy is the story,\" Musk said on the conference call, describing plans to roll out autonomous ride hailing to about half of the U.S. population by the end of this year. Tesla is looking for robotaxi regulatory approval in the San Francisco Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida and other places, he said, and the company is close to getting regulatory approval for supervised Full Self-Driving driver assistance software in the Netherlands. The robotaxi business was likely to have a material impact on financials around the end of next year, Musk said.\n\nInvestors are concerned about whether Musk will be able to devote enough time and attention to Tesla after he locked horns with Trump by forming a new political party this month. He had promised weeks earlier that he would cut back on government work and focus on his companies.\n\nA series of high-profile executive exits, including a longtime Musk confidant who oversaw sales and manufacturing in North America and Europe, is also adding to the concerns.\n\nReporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson, Anil D'Silva and Matthew Lewis\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nGet the key points from this story with Reuters AI\n\nAkash SriramThomson ReutersAkash reports on technology companies in the United States, electric vehicle companies, and the space industry.

Still, his release has been once again delayed for a period of 30 days, at the request of Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, who fear he could be deported.\n\nSimultaneously on Wednesday, a second court hearing was unfolding in Maryland under US District Judge Paula Xinis.\n\nShe has been hearing arguments about Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to El Salvador, as part of a lawsuit filed by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura.\n\nGiven that Trump officials have signalled they plan to deport Abrego Garcia if he is released, Xinis issued a ruling requiring that immigration officials to give him notice of three business days if they initiate removal proceedings.\n\nThe Trump administration, Xinis wrote, has “done little to assure the court that, absent intervention, Abrego Garcia’s due process rights will be protected”.\n\nXinis also ordered the government to restore the legal status that Abrego Garcia had previously been under, which allowed him to live and work in Maryland.\n\nAbrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring him from being sent back to his home country.\n\nHis lawyers have maintained that Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador as a teenager to avoid gang threats.\n\nThe government acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador had been the result of an “administrative error”.\n\nJudge Xinis — and later the US Supreme Court — ultimately ruled that the Trump administration had a responsibility to “facilitate” his return to the US.\n\nBut the Trump administration doubled down, arguing that Abrego Garcia’s removal was lawful and painting him as a member of MS-13.\n\nTrump even posted a picture of himself to social media holding a photo of Abrego Garcia’s knuckles, with the letters and numbers for “MS-13” digitally superimposed on each finger, next to real tattoos of a smiley face and marijuana leaf.\n\n“He’s got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles,” Trump wrote, falsely, on April 18.\n\nJudge Xinis had threatened to find the Trump administration in contempt of court for failing to adequately facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, or provide meaningful updates. Officials had argued that they had little power to bring him back, given that he was held in El Salvador.\n\nBut in early June, the Trump administration abruptly announced Abrego Garcia’s return to the US. At the same time, the Justice Department revealed it had obtained an indictment to criminally charge Abrego Garcia.\n\nAt the centre of the government’s case is a video from a November 2022 traffic stop, showing Abrego Garcia driving a Chevrolet Suburban SUV with three rows of seats. A police officer heard in the footage speculates that the nine passengers could be involved in human smuggling, but no charges were brought at that time.\n\nHis lawyers have dismissed the government’s case as “preposterous”.\n\nStill, before Xinis’s ruling, the lawyers had requested Abrego Garcia remain in custody as he awaits trial, for fear that he might be immediately deported if released.\n\nWhile Abrego Garcia cannot be sent to El Salvador again, the Trump administration has maintained he can be legally deported to a third country, even one where he has no personal ties.\n\nLast month, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could, at least in the short term, continue to deport individuals to such third-party countries while legal challenges proceed against the practice.\n\nSome of those third-party countries have included South Sudan and Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, both of which have faced accusations of human rights abuses in their prisons.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security took to the social media platform X on Wednesday to criticise Xinis’s latest ruling.\n\n“The fact this unhinged judge is trying to tell ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] they can’t arrest an MS-13 gang member, indicted by a grand jury for human trafficking, and subject to immigration arrest under federal law is LAWLESS AND INSANE,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote, reiterating unproven claims.\n\nAbrego Garcia’s lawyers, however, applauded Wednesday’s court decisions.\n\n“These rulings are a powerful rebuke of the government’s lawless conduct and a critical safeguard for Kilmar’s due process rights,” lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement.","summary":"Trump officials have indicated they plan to deport Abrego Garcia to a third-party country if he is released from jail.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/23/us-court-decisions-allow-for-abrego-garcias-release-bar-his-deportation?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-04T025620Z_305732609_RC2U9FAW5CYV_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-ABREGO-GARCIA-1753306119.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 23:47:53","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":344631858,"title":"Steve Witkoff will push for Gaza ceasefire during Middle East visit, State Department says (Video)","text":"President Donald Trump's Mideast envoy is headed to the region and that could mean good news for Gaza ceasefire prospects.

Last week, President Donald Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue the release of secret records tied to Epstein’s long-standing sex trafficking allegations, in a bid to promote transparency.However, the Justice Department clarified in a recent memo that only a fraction of the documents related to the Epstein case were ever presented to a grand jury. Thousands of other records remain in government custody and are not subject to the same legal protections.Live EventsThe department also reiterated in the memo that there is no evidence suggesting Epstein had compiled a so-called list of influential men involved in his alleged trafficking network. Additionally, the memo reaffirms the government’s longstanding position that Epstein died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019, dismissing persistent conspiracy theories about his death.In a related matter, a separate federal judge, Paul Engelmayer, denied a request by Epstein’s former associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, to view the grand jury transcripts ahead of formally stating her position on their possible unsealing.“It is black-letter law that defendants generally are not entitled to access grand jury materials,” Engelmayer wrote in his ruling.Maxwell’s lawyers had asked to review the materials before responding to the Justice Department’s petition to release them. Judge Engelmayer ruled there was “no compelling necessity” for such access, but left open the possibility of sharing limited excerpts if he later deems it appropriate.The Justice Department has been ordered to submit further legal arguments supporting the release of the transcripts by next week.

Despite the degrees of separation, the plaintiff still did not point to a person specifically aggrieved, Skavdahl said.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with the Washington Examiner, Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, whom the Equality State Policy Center had sued as Wyoming’s chief elections officer, applauded the case outcome.\n\n“We’re leading the nation on this issue. This marks a huge victory for the people of Wyoming and the truth,” Gray told the Washington Examiner. “Marc Elias was no match for this vigorous defense. We put together a great team.”\n\nDEMOCRATS WANT NONCITIZENS TO VOTE IN OUR ELECTIONS\n\nGray, a Republican, thanked the Trump administration and the Republican National Committee for supporting the state in this case. The U.S. Department of Justice submitted a statement of interest siding with Wyoming, and the RNC moved to intervene and join Gray as a defendant.\n\nDhillon Law Group, the law firm of Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ’s civil rights division, served as Gray’s outside counsel.\n\nIn a public statement celebrating the lawsuit’s dismissal, Gray had hailed H.B. 156 as “common-sense” legislation in line with President Donald Trump’s agenda on election integrity reform.\n\nH.B. 156, a state-level version of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act that’s progressing through Congress, requires prospective registrants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship or Wyoming residency, such as a driver’s license, a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork.\n\nEffective July 1, the bill became law without the signature of Gov. Mark Gordon (R-WY), who refused to sign it.\n\nTHE GOP MUST SEIZE ITS CHANCE TO ENACT ELECTION INTEGRITY\n\nIn the thrown-out suit, the Equality State Policy Center had contended that H.B. 156 was “far more likely” to disenfranchise U.S. citizens who may be unable to provide the necessary documentation than prevent non-citizens from unlawfully voting.\n\nInvoking the history of women’s suffrage in Wyoming, the first U.S. state to grant women the right to vote, the complainant claimed that female voters, married women in particular, would face barriers at the registration booths because of marital name-changes.\n\nAmong others purportedly without access to acceptable forms of ID, the Equality State Policy Center asserted that those “disproportionately” affected by the Wyoming bill include the state’s homeless population, low-income individuals whose licenses were suspended on account of unpaid fines, youth aging out of the juvenile justice system and child welfare programs, strictly Spanish-speaking Hispanic citizens, and transgender voters who legally changed their identities.\n\nGray said the statute is not discriminatory.\n\n“The Left trots out these slogans that are false, and we debunked them in our response,” Gray told the Washington Examiner. “This law is applied equally to everybody and is non-discriminatory. Everybody is equal under the rule of law. These sorts of worn-out narratives that are false that the Left brings up, we countered those in our response, and we won.”\n\nNO ONE IS BUYING THE DEMOCRATS’ GENDER WAR ATTACKS ON VOTER ID AND THE SAVE ACT\n\nThe now-granted motion to dismiss said that the plaintiff relied exclusively on “a slew of hypothetical scenarios premised on speculative arguments.” According to the defense’s filing, no evidence identified a single, and otherwise qualified, Wyoming resident who would be barred from registering to vote under H.B. 156’s regulations.\n\nSkavdahl agreed Tuesday that the Equality State Policy Center’s claims were “broad, conclusory allegations lacking factual substance.”\n\nElias losing the Wyoming non-citizen voting case marks his second election-related legal defeat in recent weeks.\n\nElias tried to block a law banning foreign actors from funneling money into ballot initiatives in Kansas.\n\nRepresenting the foreign-funded Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, a coalition of abortion-rights activists, the Elias Law Group argued that the ban at issue infringed on the free speech rights of those who accept foreign-traced funds and then lobby in favor of or against a specific policy position.\n\nMARC ELIAS LOSES LAWSUIT OVER ALLOWING FOREIGN FUNDING IN KANSAS BALLOT CAMPAIGNS\n\nOn June 30, a different Obama-appointed federal judge issued a scathing ruling squashing the plaintiff’s bid to block the campaign finance bill, which prohibits donations from foreign nationals in support or defeat of proposed amendments to the Kansas constitution.\n\n“Kansas has identified a compelling interest in preventing foreign influence in Kansans’ decisions about its foundational governing document,” the court ruled.\n\nThe Washington Examiner contacted The Elias Law Group for comment.","summary":"An Obama-appointed federal judge has handed Marc Elias, the Democratic Party&#8217;s go-to election lawyer, another litigation loss after his law firm sought to stop a Wyoming law from imposing proof-of-citizenship and -residency requirements in the state&#8217;s voting registration process.
