US President Donald Trump intends to put pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to convince the parties to the conflict to come to the negotiating table, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.\n\n\"President Trump is trying to explore ways to continue the pressure on [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, continue the pressure, quite frankly, on [Ukrainian President] Vladimir Zelensky, and also look for new ways to continue to press, to bring both sides to the table to agree to a ceasefire, end the war, and just end the killing,\" he said in an interview with Newsmax.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil and their 34 subsidiaries. White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Washington expects these restrictions to put significant pressure on Moscow as the conflict in Ukraine rages on.\n\nPutin said earlier that the new American restrictions will not significantly affect the \"economic well-being\" of the country. Putin pointed out that the sanctions represent an unfriendly act against Moscow, and \"will not strengthen Russian-American relations, which have just begun to recover.\" With such actions, the US only damages Russian-American relations, the president stated.","summary":"US President Donald Trump is trying to explore ways \"to bring both sides to the table to agree to a ceasefire, end the war, and just end the killing,\" US Permanent Representative to NATO said","url":"https://tass.com/world/2034447","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-24 00:19:08","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.393},{"id":372029072,"title":"China and US to launch more trade talks today in Malaysia","text":"Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Malaysia from today for four days of high-level trade talks, multiple media outlets are reporting.\n\nThe meetings, confirmed by China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on Thursday, coincide with an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit Malaysia is hosting between 24 and 27 October.

Reid noted Hashmi is the only candidate of the six running for statewide office to decline a debate. A representative for Reid ensured that the AI only envisaged Hashmi’s likeness and voice -- and that of the moderator – and that the responses given by the representation of Hashmi were based on her prior quotes or publicized policy positions.

While some NBA personalities were front and center in these arrests, Smith shared his speculation about the next area of focus in the investigation.In light of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups being arrested, Smith issued a vague warning about President Donald Trump coming for certain individuals and groups. He then turned to panelist Monica McNutt and brought up the subject of the WNBA, though his comments were more conjecture than evidence-based reporting.\"Don't be surprised if the WNBA is next on his [Trump's] list,\" Smith said. \"When you have all these protesters and what have you, this man is coming. He's coming, and I've been saying it for a long time.\"Though Smith offered no further details that clearly pointed to the WNBA being targeted by Trump, he called attention to the fact that no less than FBI Director Kash Patel addressed the public about the recent arrests, which involved more than 30 people.\"I watched a press conference with the director of the FBI. Tell me when we've seen that,\" SAS asserted. \"It's not an accident.

Anna Paulina Luna said Thursday on a podcast that Democrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom has “feminine tendencies” as he “bitches on the internet all the time” despite pressing issues in his state.\n\nIn recent months, Newsom and his press office have become increasingly vocal online against the Trump administration and Republicans, with his office’s X account appearing to mimic President Donald Trump’s posting style. While speaking with podcaster Patrick Bet-David on his “PBD Podcast” on YouTube, the two were discussing California Democrats when Bet-David brought up Newsom. (RELATED: Gavin Newsom Reveals He Was Victim Of Ultimate Troll By Trump Supporter)\n\n“You’re either a great troll or you’re trying to be,” Bet-David said. “Like Newsom is dying to be Trump, but he’s not. Newsom is trying to be Trump. Newsom’s not Trump, right? Nowhere near him. But everything he does, he’s trying to be — the Trump of the left.”\n\nLuna told Bet-David she had recently appeared on a talk show, explaining the context behind her remarks about Newsom.\n\n“I was on a show recently. I think it was on Comedy Central, it was like an evening talk show. And they’re talking about the ‘No Kings’ protests and I made a joke and I was like, ‘Well if you’re talking about Gavin Newsom it would be the ‘No Queens’ protest,” Luna responded.\n\n“And he was like, ‘Well is that homophobic?’ I was like, ‘No he [Newsom] just has feminine tendencies,’ and it’s totally true,” Paulina Luna added. “I don’t know, like — he bitches on the internet all the time. It’s like what are you doing, Gavin? You know, you have fires in the Palisades — what’s going on?”\n\nBet-David agreed with Luna’s take on Newsom, echoing her sentiment by saying the governor had “metro” tendencies.\n\nAmid speculation that California Gov. Gavin Newsom may run for president in 2028, the Democrat has been increasingly vocal online against Trump, with his press office attempting to adopt the White House’s strategy of using memes and trolling adversaries.\n\nDespite his online presence, many Californians remain skeptical of his leadership and priorities. A Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll from April found that 54% of 6,201 registered voters believe Newsom is “doing things that might benefit him as a possible candidate for president,” while just 26% think he’s “governing the state and helping to solve its problems.”\n\nThe poll notably followed two major fires in Los Angeles County, which destroyed thousands of homes and left residents questioning the state’s leadership. With damages totaling over $60 billion, many affected residents have spoken out about the slow pace of promised state assistance.\n\nOne Pacific Palisades resident told the Los Angeles Times in August that the process to return home has been far from straightforward, forcing her to navigate insurance adjusters, contractors and testing specialists who have provided no clear answers.\n\nNewsom’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

LIEB\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Democrats are taking steps to redraw their state’s U.S. House districts, hoping to boost their party’s chances in next year’s midterm elections and counter President Donald Trump’s push for more partisan districts in Republican-run states.\n\nVirginia House Speaker Don Scott sent a letter Thursday to members telling them to convene Monday for a special session but did not state a reason. The purpose includes congressional redistricting aimed at gaining more Democratic-held seats, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because they are not authorized to publicly discuss them.\n\nVirginia would be the second state with a Democratic-led legislature after California to enter a national redistricting battle with enormous stakes. If Democrats gain just three more seats, they would take control of the House and effectively impede Trump’s agenda.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina already have approved new congressional maps aimed at helping their party win more seats and retain the slim GOP House majority. And even more states are considering redistricting as the battle front widens.\n\nA spokeswoman for Democrats’ House campaign arm characterized Virginia’s effort as the party pursuing “every available tool to counter Republicans’ desperate attempts to steal the midterms.”\n\n“Virginia’s decision to convene and preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” said Courtney Rice, communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nRepublicans vowed to fight. Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said Democrats missed their opportunity to carry out this procedure by 2026 and that it’s “too late constitutionally” to do so.\n\n“We are going to do everything legally we can do to stop this power grab,” Kilgore said.\n\nVoting districts typically are redrawn at the start of each decade to account for population changes noted by the census. But Trump took the unusual step over the summer of urging Republican-led states to reshape key districts to try to buck a historical trend of a president’s party losing seats in midterm elections.\n\nVirginia currently is represented in the U.S. House by six Democrats and five Republicans who ran in districts whose boundaries were imposed by a court after a bipartisan redistricting commission failed to agree on a map after the 2020 census.\n\nThe effort to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts comes in the final weeks before the Nov. 4 state legislative and statewide elections. But Monday’s session is just the start of what could be a long legislative process, running past the election.\n\nBecause Virginia’s redistricting commission was established by a voter-approved constitutional amendment, the electorate must sign off on any changes. And any proposed change to the constitution must first pass the legislature in two separate sessions. Democrats are scrambling to hold that first vote this year, so that they can approve the change a second time after a new legislative session begins Jan. 14.\n\nVoters still would have to approve a change in the constitution to allow using the new House map. And that vote would need to occur before congressional primaries, which are currently set for June 16 — though dates for such elections have been pushed back in the past.\n\nIn many states, congressional districts are drawn by state lawmakers, subject to the approval of the governor. But North Carolina’s new map, which received final approval Wednesday from the Republican-led Legislature, did not have to go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. Those changes target a swing district held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis by adding areas that contain more Republican-leaning voters.\n\nLike Virginia, California has a constitutionally established redistricting commission, which approved maps after the 2020 census. California voters are to decide in a Nov. 4 election whether to temporarily suspend those districts and instead use a map approved by the Democratic-led Legislature that could help Democrats pick up as many as five additional seats.\n\nNo voter approval is necessary for the revised districts in Missouri, North Carolina or Texas, though opponents in Missouri are gathering petition signatures to try to force a statewide vote on their new map.\n\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri.

But in relaying their call, the president hinted that Thursday’s decision may not be his final word on the matter.\n\n“He asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,” Trump said of Lurie in his post.\n\n“I told him I think he is making a mistake, because we can do it much faster, and remove the criminals that the Law does not permit him to remove. I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?'”\n\n‘Cruel, un-American tactics’\n\nSince taking office for a second term in January, Trump has led a campaign of mass deportation that has prompted protests and concerns about human rights violations.\n\nTrump has answered those protests, in part, by sending National Guard troops to major cities with the stated aim of protecting federal immigration agents.\n\nBut critics, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, have repeatedly warned that the military deployments not only ratchet up tensions but run afoul of the law.\n\nLurie, one of the heirs to the Levi Strauss jeans company fortune, was among those critics.\n\nOn Wednesday, bracing for an impending deployment, the mayor gave a news conference surrounded by city officials, calling on the residents of San Francisco to stand united.\n\n“We have already seen this federal administration deploy cruel, un-American tactics to target immigrant communities in our city. If we see these kinds of tactics used again or escalated, we will protest,” Lurie said.\n\nHe emphasised that local law enforcement would not assist federal forces in carrying out immigration raids.\n\n“San Francisco will never stand by as our neighbours are targeted, and neither will I,” Lurie continued.\n\nThe state government of California, meanwhile, had warned earlier in the week that it was prepared to sue as soon as any federalised National Guard troops arrived in San Francisco.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act, it pointed out, expressly prohibits federal troops from acting as civilian law enforcement, unless called upon by the state.\n\nIn a statement, Governor Newsom, who is considered a leading Democratic contender in the next presidential race, compared Trump’s actions to those of a “wannabe tyrant”.\n\n“The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty – it’s a direct assault on the rule of law,” Newsom said.\n\nSeries of crackdowns\n\nBut despite outcry from states like California and Illinois, Trump has pushed ahead with National Guard deployments, leading to a spate of lawsuits.\n\nCalifornia continues to be embroiled in a legal fight over Trump’s decision to send troops to Los Angeles in June, when the city convulsed with protests and outrage over immigration raids at workplaces, shopping centres and parks.\n\nDemonstrations, the majority of them peaceful, spilled into the streets. Trump nevertheless accused protesters of being violent and sent as many as 4,000 members of the California National Guard to the city, over Newsom’s opposition.\n\nWhile Newsom has argued that the deployment was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, the Trump administration has cited lines from the US Code as justification.\n\nThe US Code allows for the federalisation of state National Guard troops if there is the threat of invasion or rebellion, or if the federal government is unable to otherwise carry out its laws.\n\nThough the Los Angeles protests have largely subsided, the Trump administration has proceeded to send National Guard troops to other Democrat-led jurisdictions, despite pushback from local leaders.\n\nEarlier this month, for instance, Trump authorised the National Guard to go to Chicago, Illinois, prompting a lawsuit from that state.\n\nAnd in late September, the president announced on Truth Social he would send troops to “war-ravaged” Portland, Oregon, a move that was blocked by an emergency court petition.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has touted the benefits of military deployments to Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee, arguing that the presence of the troops lowered crime in both cities.\n\nSan Francisco on the radar\n\nAs a longtime left-wing bastion, San Francisco has long been a punching bag for Trump and other Republicans.\n\nEven on the campaign trail, the president took shots at the city’s Democratic leadership, blaming it for San Francisco’s “destruction”.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Trump closed in on the city as the subject of his next crime and immigration crackdown.\n\n“We’re going to go in San Francisco,” Trump told Fox News on October 19. “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”\n\nTrump’s decision to reverse course on Thursday mirrored that of one of his supporters, Marc Benioff.\n\nThe billionaire’s software company, Salesforce, is based in San Francisco, and Benioff holds a weekend-long tech conference in the city every year.\n\nBut on the eve of this year’s event, Benioff told The New York Times that he would welcome the National Guard in San Francisco, echoing Republican calls to “clean” up the city.\n\n“We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I’m all for it,” Benioff said.\n\nThose comments drew instant backlash from city officials, and comedians slated to perform at his annual conference dropped out. Days later, Benioff took to social media to apologise for his comments.\n\n“I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco,” Benioff wrote, citing his conversations with locals.\n\n“My earlier comment came from an abundance of caution around the event, and I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused.”\n\nBenioff was among the advisers Trump cited as an influence in Thursday’s decision to back down from his long-threatened deployment.\n\nAlready, protests had erupted outside the US Coast Guard facility in Alameda, part of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nFor his part, Mayor Lurie said he would welcome “continued partnerships” with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as the city struggles to reduce accidental overdoses.\n\nBut, Lurie added, that invitation did not include military involvement.\n\n“Having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” he said in a statement.","summary":"The US president credits billionaire tech entrepreneurs with helping change his mind on the National Guard deployment.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/23/donald-trump-backtracks-on-plans-to-surge-military-to-san-francisco?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296706100883-1761258757.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:58:47","author":"Allison Griner,Apps Support","authors":["Allison Griner","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":372018972,"title":"I watched the last episode of Strictly being recorded before hosts Tess and Claudia quit - Tess wasn't herself at all - and now I know why","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Oct 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves 'is in active discussions about breaking Labour's manifesto pledge and putting a penny on income tax to fill £30billion budget gap' - and holiday flights are also in her sights\n\nTrump threatens to cut all support for Israel in extraordinary escalation after JD Vance 'personal insult'\n\nNHS doctor accused of praising Hamas's October 7 attack wears 'celebratory' number 7 necklace at fitness to practice hearing\n\nThe 'hush-hush' REAL reason Claudia quit Strictly which BBC is trying to keep 'very quiet': TV insiders tell every detail of shock Strictly exit to KATIE HIND and ALISON BOSHOFF\n\nRICHARD EDEN: Dark suspicions about Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

It was like she had lots on her mind.\nShe seemed a bit distracted and kept fluffing her lines during the results show, so she had to retake them. She told the audience. 'I don't normally mess up.'\n\nI consider myself to be a huge Strictly fan and it's always been my dream to get to watch a live show - something I finally got to do this weekend\n\nLittle did I know that it would be the last main run before hosts Tess Daly and Claudia WInkleman would shock the nation by announcing they would both be quitting the show\nNo doubt she was being too hard on herself, ever the professional, she does way more than just present.\nShe really knows her stuff and it's clear when you watch her present that she almost takes on a producer-type role.\nShe offers suggestions on where to stand or ad-libbing, and I frequently saw her chatting to members of the crew between takes.\nAfter reports that it was Claudia who first mooted the decision to step down, we know that Tess and Claudia both agreed that if one should leave then the other should follow suit, so it's no surprise that they are going together.\nThe show has also been rocked by a string of scandals in recent years, so perhaps the pair thought now was the best time to leave.\nSitting in the studio, which feels much smaller in person that it looks on screen, Tess appeared rattled as she tried to get her lines out perfectly on the night.\nIt is well known that both installments of the show are filmed on Saturday night, after the live show airs, Sunday's results show is also recorded.\n\nAt the time I was clueless to the impending announcement, but while filming both the live and the results show, I noticed Tess seemed a little grumpy and not her usual self off screen\n\nSitting in the studio, which feels much smaller in person that it looks on screen, Tess appeared rattled as she tried to get her lines out perfectly on the night (pictured in Saturday's live show)\n\nEXCLUSIVE Claudia Winkleman emerges after quitting Strictly amid claims 'she led Tess Daly to leave show' \nWhile Tess was relaxed in her clothing choices, taking off her heels for a more comfortable pair of slippers.\nShe didn't seem like the lady she appears on TV on the night. \nClaudia, who did seem more composed, also made a couple of mistakes throughout the night.\nBut I saw little of her as she stayed up on the balcony with the celebrity couples for most of the live show.\nThis year has been a tough one for the show, with various scandals being widely reported.\nI hope it isn’t the end for Strictly, but it’s hard to imagine who would be able to fill Tess and Claudia's huge shoes.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nI watched the last episode of Strictly being recorded before hosts Tess and Claudia quit - Tess wasn't herself at all - and now I know why\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The pair, who are both married, denied the report. \n\nKarl reports that Noem was not on the presidential transition team's list following Trump's victory in November, but to the surprise of his inner circle, Trump selected her anyway.\n\nThe book states 'When a surprised Trump adviser asked the president-elect why he had decided to nominate Noem to be secretary of Homeland Security, he had a simple answer.'\n\n'I did it for Corey,' Trump allegedly said. 'It's the only thing Corey asked me for.' \n\n'President Trump selected the best and most qualified individuals to serve in his cabinet and work on behalf of the American people,' White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \n\n'The tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security – a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens – at President Trump’s direction and under Secretary Noem’s leadership, speak for themselves.'\n\nOther parts of Trump's world such as Steve Bannon flamed Noem's nomination, claiming she was a national security risk.\n\n'We still got the global war on terror. She runs the whole thing? She runs the f*cking Secret Service? It's all of it. It's the global war on terror.'\n\n'It's all that. What are you talking about? She's never been in law enforcement!' Bannon said to Karl in the book.\n\nThe former Trump strategist goes on to blame Lewandowski for pressuring Trump to choose Noem.\n\n'This motherf**ker asked for somebody who's obviously unqualified – and it's dangerous. This is dangerous. What are you doing?'\n\nLewandowski serves as an adviser to DHS as a special government employee; however, insiders have claimed he actually acts as Noem's unofficial chief of staff.\n\nIn 2023, DailyMail.com reported that married South Dakota governor Noem, 51 – who stresses adherence to 'family values' – and Trump advisor Lewandowski, who is also married, began carrying on an affair in 2019 or earlier. \n\nNoem has previously denied the relationship to DailyMail.com. Lewandowski has refused to comment. Both remain married to their respective partners.\n\nA reunion was rumored between Trump and Lewandowski during the campaign last year but now it appears the former campaign manager has found a convenient role.\n\n'Like Elon Musk and so many other patriots, Mr. Lewandowski volunteers his time as a special government employee (SGE) to help President Trump Make America Great Again,' a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. \n\nLewandowski directed reporters to the department.\n\nIn Alex Isenstadt's book Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump's Return to Power, the Politico journalist wrote that Noem's trysts with Lewandowski may have kept her from being Trump's running mate. \n\nThe Daily Mail reported in September that DHS Chief Security Officer Richard McComb raised concerns about providing Top-Secret clearance to Lewandowski due to his financial ties to foreign nations, such as China and Israel.\n\nHe authored a memo detailing over a dozen concerns with Lewandowski, including the fact he was referenced in an active criminal investigation. \n\nMcComb was later pushed out of Homeland Security after nearly a decade of service.\n\nLewandowski did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Trump decided Noem should run DHS not because of her competency, but rather as a favor to his longtime unofficial adviser Corey Lewandowski.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15221751/Trump-rewarded-Kristi-Noem-alleged-lover-book.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/24/00/103270183-0-image-a-8_1761261500335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:54:54","author":"Editor,Phillip Nieto","authors":["Editor","Phillip Nieto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.207},{"id":372025568,"title":"Democrats in Virginia legislature poised to try redrawing congressional map","text":"Virginia will be the latest state to enter the redistricting battles, as Democrats announced plans Thursday to convene in the statehouse where they are expected to plan redrawing its congressional map. \n\nA Virginia General Assembly special session will reconvene Monday, according to a letter obtained by ABC News. \n\nThis marks Democrats' second formal attempt to counter the wave of Republican redistricting efforts encouraged by President Donald Trump, following in the footsteps of California's Prop. 50 election, which could net Democrats up to five seats if Californians approve a new congressional map. \n\nDemocrats currently hold six of Virginia's U.S. House districts.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, which was first to report the news, Democrats are not calling a new special session but can reconvene an existing one.\n\nDemocrats will also need to do more than just pass a map. The Washington Post reported that Democrats will need to get the plan moving before Election Day on Nov. 4 and then hold onto the House of Delegates; Virginians will also eventually need to vote on a referendum.\n\nHeather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, told ABC News in a statement, \"Redistricting decisions move through state legislatures and so it's never been more important for us to protect and expand the Democratic majority in Virginia.\"\n\nVirginia's House of Delegates -- currently 51 Democrats, 48 Republicans and one vacancy, is also up for election on Nov. 4.\n\nVirginia Senate Republican Leader Ryan McDougle and Sen. Mark Obenshain slammed the effort in a joint statement and argued that the state should defer to its redistricting commission. \n\n\"Democrats see the political tide turning against them and now they're trying to rewrite the rules before voters even finish casting their ballots,\" McDougle said. \"Calling a special session to undo Virginia's bipartisan redistricting Constitutional amendment is not about fairness or good government, it's about power.\"\n\nIn 2020, a constitutional amendment granted the Virginia Redistricting Commission control of drawing congressional maps for the General Assembly to approve. \n\nABC News has reached out to Virginia House Speaker Don Scott and Senate Leader Scott Surovell for comment but did not immediately hear back. \n\nVirginia's redistricting plans also come just two weeks before Election Day, when the state will vote in a high-stakes gubernatorial race. \n\nThe campaign of Republican governor candidate Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears accused her Democratic rival and former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, without providing evidence, of pushing for redistricting in order to help her in the race and to subvert the will of voters. \n\n\"This is what panic looks like. With just 12 days until Election Day, Abigail Spanberger and her Democrat allies have given up on talking to voters about real ideas and solutions. Instead, she's leading the charge on cheap political stunts to slow down Winsome Earle-Sears' momentum,\" Earle-Sears campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nIn another statement, Vogel alleged that Spanberger \"wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab.\" \n\nSpanberger has previously said she would not try to redraw Virginia's congressional lines if elected governor. ABC News has reached out to her campaign for comment on whether she supports the redistricting push.\n\nRedistricting is normally done after the Census each decade, but Texas lawmakers in August at Trump's urging redrew the state's congressional districts in an effort to win five more seats in next year's midterm elections. In response, California redrew its map to potentially pick up five seats, although that redrawn map will go before voters on Election Day.\n\nDemocrat-controlled Maryland, New York and Illinois have indicated they're considering mid-decade redistricting.\n\nIn September, GOP-leaning Missouri adopted a new map that could help Republicans gain one seat while North Carolina this week passed a new map that could help the GOP pick up another seat there.\n\nKansas and Florida, which have Republican-controlled legislatures, are also considering redrawing their maps before the midterms.","summary":"It will be the latest to take up mid-decade redistricting before the midterms.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-virginia-legislature-poised-redrawing-congressional-map/story?id=126815635","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c1472a45-f19d-4bb4-8bc1-d6cb5b673964/virginia-state-capitol-gty-jt-251023_1761259303496_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:53:28","author":"Emily Chang,Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Emily Chang","Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":372018976,"title":"Kim Kardashian stuns in ANOTHER racy look while promoting her series All's Fair as she slips into a latex mini dress on The Graham Norton Show","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Oct 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Reeves 'is considering breaking Labour's manifesto pledge with income tax rise to fill £30billion gap'\n\nTrump threatens to cut all support for Israel in extraordinary escalation after JD Vance 'personal insult'\n\nNHS doctor accused of praising Hamas's October 7 attack wears 'celebratory' number 7 necklace at fitness to practice hearing\n\nThe 'hush-hush' REAL reason Claudia quit Strictly which BBC is trying to keep 'very quiet': TV insiders tell every detail of shock Strictly exit to KATIE HIND and ALISON BOSHOFF\n\nRICHARD EDEN: Dark suspicions about Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Earlier this week, Children’s Minister Karen Chhour was publicly celebrating what she depicted as the first ever reduction in reported harm at Youth Justice and Care and Prevention residences, heralded by her, a 14% drop in such harms last year. Chhour put that down to (among other things) “improved training recruitment and leadership\" at Oranga Tamariki, and better induction schemes for staff.\n\nHold the self-congratulation. It now transpires that this was a cherry picked improvement involving only three children. There were 115 reported cases of harm in these OT managed facilities last year, down from 118 the year before - and since only 503 children were in managed facilities in the period in question, that 115 figure still amounted to a disturbing 22.8% of the total population of the children living in such residences. Keep in mind that there had been only 22 cases of reported harm in these facilities in 2021.\n\nIt is striking to see just how selectively Chhour had constructed an alleged” good news” story for the government from such a bleak situation. As Children’s Commissioner Claire Achmad told RNZ, the incidence of overall harm to those in state care had increased, with 530 incidences of harm to children reported over the past 12 months.\n\n\"...Actually there has been a higher number of findings of harm in care as well, 896 ... what that tells us is that for some of these children, in fact around 21 percent, they have actually experienced multiple incidences of harm.\n\n\"We are talking about really serious harm, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect.\"\n\nFor the record, as cited in Oranga Tamariki’s annual report for 2024/2025 : New Zealand has 3336 children or young people living in non-family care, of whom 5% ( i.e. 178) suffered reported harm. Of the 2,225 in the care of the wider family, 6% (i.e. 140) suffered reported harm. Among the 1,019 children returned to or remaining in home care with parents, 13% (i.e. 134) suffered reported harm. As RNZ pointed out, this is the highest proportion on record, and accounts for nearly 24% of all harm findings this year.\n\nOn that last statistic in particular, it would be more accurate to say that more of this country’s most vulnerable children are being exposed to harm (a) from the pressures arising from the cost of living crisis, and (b) from the underfunding and lack of sufficient supports to those people who are serving as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff.\n\nFor Karen Chhour to try (initially) to selectively paint this situation as a good news story is obscene.\n\nLabours Investment Fund\n\nSince Labour has been MIA for the past two years on saying what it would do differently, the recent announcement that (if elected next year) it would create an $200 million investment fund independent of government is notable, if not very laudable. Basically, a number of commercial Crown state-owned assets would be transferred into the “Future Fund” and this would serve as an investment vehicle that -unlike the Super Fund – would invest its capital only in New Zealand businesses and infrastructure.\n\nThe Future Fund would not be permitted to sell any existing state assets, and it would need explicit approval to sell any new ones that it helping bring into being. Is this really such a bold and desirable new alternative? For one thing nearly 20% of the Super Fund portfolio is already comprised of investments in local enterprises and infrastructure.\n\nMore to the point – and as this column has repeatedly argued - why is the party of Bob Semple and Michael Joseph Savage now relying on and replicating the centre-right’s aversion to the government doing the job of wealth creation, and the building of essential infrastructure?\n\nBernard Hickey made that point recently with his usual blunt eloquence :\n\nMy concern is that Labour remains embedded in the view it and National have shared for 40 years: that the size of Government and the size of Government debt should not be larger than 30% of GDP. With both the size of Government and its debt currently above those self-imposed, unnecessary, unjustified and failed limits, both National and Labour are still contorting themselves into states of magical thinking that private investment in infrastructure and the private provision of housing, health, education and transport would be both better for the economy than the Government doing it.\n\nAs things currently stand, Hickey concluded. “ ..This Future Fund appears to be another performative, mostly ineffective and expensive distraction from the fundamental failings of the 30/30 rule to invest in the infrastructure to support our still-fast-growth and still-ageing population, let alone catch up on decades under-investment and under-maintenance and under-replacement of both new and existing infrastructure.”\n\nIn Opposition, Labour is supposed to be offering an alternative to the current centre-right ideologies and practices. Instead, Labour appears to be more interested in devising “credible” (as in, “acceptable -to business”) simulations of the neo-liberal orthodoxy.\n\nProtest and rebellion\n\nFor those seeking the closest thing to a good news story, the current US legal system might seem like the very last place anyone should be looking. The US Supreme Court, after all, has trampled all over a century or more of precedent in order to bestow unfettered powers on Donald Trump, to an extent the nation’s Founding Fathers had worked extremely hard to prevent. No kings, indeed.\n\nThankfully, not all parts of the US legal system have been so criminally supine. It is hard not to feel inspired after reading these clear and cutting words from a recent judgement issued by a three judge panel of the US 7th Circuit Appeal Court. One of these judges had been appointed by Trump, and another by George W. Bush. Yet their judgement halted Trump’s deployment by the National Guard in Chicago, and only hours ago, that block was extended.\n\nHere’s a key passage from the initial 7th Circuit ruling:\n\n...Political opposition is not rebellion. A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protesters advocate for myriad legal and policy changes, are well organised, call for significant changes to the structure of the US government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry arms, as the law currently allows. Nor does a protest become a rebellion merely because of sporadic and isolated incidents of unlawful activity or even violence, committed by rogue participants in the protest. Such conduct exceeds the scope of the First Amendment [protections of free speech] of course, and law enforcement has apprehended the perpetrators accordingly. But because rebellions at least use deliberate organised violence to resist governmental authority, the problematic incidents in this record clearly fall within the considerable day-light between protected speech and rebellion.”\n\nAt a time when Trump is using the National Guard as his own private army, and is treating any opposition to his whims and wishes as being tantamount to treason...those arguments need to be made, and defended.\n\nSounds plus vision\n\nSince Anna Calvi’s breakthrough single “ Don’t Beat The Girl Out of the Boy” she has expanded into television work, including writing the score for two seasons of Peaky Blinders. On this revival of Will Oldham’s classic “ I See a Darkness” she joins forces with Perfume Genius.\n\nThe extraordinary video for the song – directed by Alexander Brown - conveys both the joyous bond between the women, and the ever present threat of random violence faced by people who do not conform to hetero-normative expectations:\n\nTalking of extraordinary videos, here’s another one, for a track from an upcoming album featuring rapper Armand Hammer and producer the Alchemist.\n\nVia what looks like found footage, the video conveys memories of spiritual cleansing (“That old-old foot-stompin', hand clap/That dip m in the water “) and childhood prepping for church (“Run between from corner to sink/Every wrinkle seamed, rinsed and steamed/Starched and pressed crease, cut clean..”) and grounds those streams of memory in tradition.\n\nFor example: the line “I stride like Moko Jumblie” refers to the stilt walkers present in carnivals across the Caribbean region, and who are believed to function as spiritual guardians. Good track, perfectly realised:\n\n© Scoop Media","summary":"At what point does a Cabinet minister distorting the statistics on issues in their portfolio amount to a sackable offence?","url":"https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL2510/S00058/on-the-coalitions-peddling-of-bad-news-as-good-news.htm","image":"http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:47:00","author":"Friday, 24 October 2025, 12:47 Pm Article: Gordon Campbell","authors":["Friday, 24 October 2025, 12:47 Pm Article: Gordon Campbell"],"language":"en","source_country":"nz","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":372029654,"title":"What lawmakers are saying about Trump’s demolition of the East Wing","text":"By KEVIN FREKING\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — They’re divided along party lines on policy.

The meeting in South Korea — the host of this year's APEC summit — will mark the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since Trump returned to office in January. They have spoken three times this year, most recently in September. Their last in-person meeting took place in 2019 during Trump's first term. The US president has repeatedly argued that direct engagement with Xi is the best way to address a range of disputes, including tariffs, export controls, agricultural trade, fentanyl trafficking and tensions over Taiwan. Trump has described his relationship with Xi as \"great\", but that rapport faces a new test amid escalating economic and geopolitical friction. Earlier this month, Trump briefly threatened to cancel the meeting following China's decision to tighten export controls on rare earth minerals. What is the Importance of the Meet? The talks will take place days before a temporary trade truce between Washington and Beijing is set to expire on November 10, unless both sides agree to extend it. The pause in tariff increases — renewed several times this year — helped cool the trade war but has come under strain as both countries introduce new measures. Also Read: America's 'Hidden' Move That Sparked China’s Fierce Trade Retaliation Against US The US has expanded technology restrictions on Chinese firms, proposed levies on Chinese vessels docking at US ports, and is weighing further export limits on key software. In response, Beijing has outlined tighter curbs on rare earth exports, vital for industries such as technology, energy and transportation. Trump has threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese goods from November 1 if Beijing does not ease its restrictions, although he has also acknowledged that such high tariffs are \"not sustainable.\" The Chinese curbs have drawn international criticism and prompted some countries to seek alternative supply chains. In recent days, Trump has predicted that his meeting with Xi will result in a \"good deal\" on \"everything\" related to trade. The Trump-Xi meeting will conclude the US president's upcoming trip to Asia, which includes stops in Malaysia and Japan. According to Leavitt, Trump will depart Washington on Friday evening and arrive in Malaysia early Sunday for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit. He is expected to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and attend an ASEAN leaders' dinner. On Monday, Trump will travel to Tokyo to meet Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, before flying to South Korea on Wednesday. There, he will meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, deliver a keynote address at the APEC CEO luncheon, and join a working dinner with other summit participants.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JACQUELINE LINDENBERG \n Published:23:36 BST, 23 October 2025 |Updated:00:33 BST, 24 October 2025 \n\nBen Stiller has addressed parenting backlash after his nepo baby children slammed him for 'never being around' while growing up. \nThe 59-year-old actor - whose documentary about his late famous parents Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara was released last week - opened up about the topic during an appearance on The View on Thursday. \nThe star shares daughter Ella, 23, and son Quinn, 20, with wife Christine Taylor - whom he tied the knot with in 2000. \n'Having kids who are now actors also, and experiencing that, that became part of the movie too in terms of talking to them about how cyclically, generationally these things get handed down,' he said, referencing to the Apple TV+ documentary. \nStiller added, 'You want to do better than your parents but then in some places you do better - sometimes you do worse. It's that struggle we all go through.' \nHis comments come not long after both his kids reflected on how the Zoolander star had been absent during their childhood. \n\nBen Stiller, 59, has addressed parenting backlash after his nepo baby children slammed him for 'never being around' while growing up\n\nThe star shares daughter Ella, 23, and son Quinn, 20, with wife Christine Taylor - whom he tied the knot with in 2000; seen in 2016 in NYC \nAt one point in the documentary titled Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, the star also got candid about what his daughter Ella previously told him which had been: 'I literally can't ever remember you being around when I was growing up.' \nAnd his son also stated that he felt he 'came last' while the actor was pursuing a successful Hollywood career. \n\n Ben Stiller admits he 'f**ked up' while raising children Ella and Quinn with wife Christine Taylor \nStiller said, 'After a tough day, or if something was going wrong, you can kind of get into your own head and when you get into that place, it's hard to get you out of it. So that would kind of put a damper on the fun part of being on vacation. \n'You have all these hats that you're trying to balance, you know? Being a director, an actor, a producer, a writer.'\nHe continued, 'But also just, like, a father. And sometimes, I felt that would come last to these other things.' \nThe Something About Mary star also admitted what he regretted most when it came to his daughter Ella - who has followed in her father's acting footsteps. \nShe had been set to star in the 2013 project Secret Life of Walter Mitty alongside her father, but he chose to cut a scene which included Ella. \nIn the Apple TV+ documentary, Stiller - who also directed the movie - told his daughter, 'I cut you out of Secret Life Of Walter Mitty. It's probably the worst decision I ever made in my life,' per Entertainment Weekly.\n\nStiller added, 'You want to do better than your parents but then in some places you do better - sometimes you do worse. It's that struggle we all go through'\n\nAnd his son also stated that he felt he 'came last' while the actor was pursuing a successful Hollywood career; Stiller seen with son Quinn (far left) and wife Christine Taylor earlier this month in NYC \n\nThe Something About Mary star also admitted what he regretted most when it came to his daughter Ella - who has followed in her father's acting footsteps; the pair seen earlier this month in L.A. \nHowever, the actress defended her father's decision and explained the scene 'didn't make sense in the movie.' \nStiller added, 'For me it kind of goes deeper. What it relates to is my own issues with my own obsession with my work, or \"perfectionism.\"' \nIn 2014, she received an uncredited role in the film Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb - after voicing the character of a schoolchild in Megamind (2010). \nMost recently, Ella - who graduated from The Juilliard School last year - appeared in two episodes of the Sex And The City spinoff And Just Like That earlier this year as well as Happy Gilmore 2 (2025). \nHer younger brother Quinn is also no stranger when it comes to acting and additionally starred in Happy Gilmore 2 as well as Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb (2014). \nStiller is the son of Jerry Stiller - who was known for his roles in shows such as The King Of Queens and Seinfeld. \nThe actor's mother Anne Meara also had a successful career in entertainment and starred in ALF, Sex And The City as well as Night At The Museum. \nStiller married Christine Taylor during a romantic ceremony in Hawaii in 2000 - after the pair first met in 1999. \n\nThe actor is the son of late stars Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara - who also had successful careers in the entertainment industry; Stiller seen above with his late parents and wife in 2008 in NYC\nHowever, the couple initially separated in 2017 but chose to live with each other during the COVID-19 pandemic along with their children - where they soon reconciled. \n'I didn't expect we were going to get back together,' Stiller recently admitted to The Hollywood Reporter. \n'But when we broke up, there was a part of me that wasn't ready to just give up on it. Probably a certain amount of that is having watched my parents.'\nThe star added, 'And I love Christine, I love my family, and I was not ready to just go, \"Okay, enough of this.\"' \nBut in regards to his work in the industry, Stiller admitted, 'Sometimes I have to be pulled from it.\n'I also really love hanging out with my family and Christine and having fun together. So I'm happy that I didn't totally miss the boat on that.' \nIn the Apple TV+ documentary - which was released on October 17 - Stiller claimed that he 'f***ed up' as a father when it came to raising his two children. \nIn regards to his separation from Taylor, the Meet The Parents actor expressed, 'It totally affected us.\n\n'I didn't expect we were going to get back together,' Stiller recently admitted to The Hollywood Reporter; the couple seen in September in L.A. \n\nIn the Apple TV+ documentary, Stiller claimed that he 'f***ed up' as a father when it came to raising his two children; seen earlier this month in NYC \n'I just remember missing them terribly,' he said of his children. 'And when they would come back, my sister and I would act out Jesus Christ Superstar or something in the lounge.'\nHe continued, 'But, then, I probably f***ed up more with my kids than my parents did with us... my son tells me that being a dad might not have been at the top of my list.' \nStiller's children have recently joined him at red carpet events, such as Quinn making an appearance alongside his father at the premiere of Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost earlier this month. \nAnd over the past weekend, Ella glammed up with her dapper father as they both attended the star-studded Academy Museum Gala in Los Angeles. \nBen StillerApple\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBen Stiller responds to parenting backlash after his nepo baby kids slammed him for 'never being around'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 76\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The full impact will be reflected in Ford’s fourth-quarter results. The automaker expects to mitigate at least $1 billion of this adjusted EBIT hit in 2026.Ford Lowers Full-Year GuidanceAs a result, Ford lowered its full-year guidance, projecting adjusted EBIT of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, down from a previous range of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Adjusted free cash flow is now expected at $2 billion to $3 billion, down from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, as per the report. Ford said capital expenditures of around $9 billion remain unchanged.CFO Sherry House said the company would have easily surpassed its full-year guidance if not for the Novelis fire, tracking at more than $8 billion in adjusted EBIT. COO Kumar Galhotra added that F-150 production would see disruptions in the coming weeks, reported Yahoo Finance.ALSO READ: Coca-Cola recall hits Texas: FDA issues warning on these products due to contamination - check if your soda can is affectedLive EventsNovelis Restart Expected This YearInvestors were reassured by reports that Novelis plans to restart the plant later this year, rather than in 2026, which helped push Ford’s stock back up after an earlier 3% drop, as per the report.Ford's Plans to Boost Truck Production in 2026Ford also announced plans to increase F-150 and F-Series Super Duty production by more than 50,000 trucks in 2026 to recover lost production, as per the report. Production of the F-150 Lightning EV will remain paused for now, as the company prioritizes gas and hybrid truck output, as per the Yahoo Finance report.ALSO READ: Target layoffs 2025 explained: Why is the retailer cutting 1,800 corporate jobs & which roles are impactedFord Q3 Results Beat ExpectationsThe company’s Q3 results exceeded expectations, with automotive revenue of $47.185 billion versus the $43.7 billion consensus estimate and adjusted EPS of $0.45, beating the expected $0.36, as per the report. Adjusted EBIT came in at $2.6 billion, above the $2.02 billion forecast, as per the Yahoo Finance report.As per Bloomberg, Q3 estimates include $28 billion in revenue and $1.54 billion EBIT for Ford Blue, $1.8 billion in revenue and -$1.41 billion EBIT for Model e, and $17.4 billion in revenue with $1.985 billion EBIT for Ford Pro, as reported by Yahoo Finance.Impact of Auto TariffsFord is also contending with $700 million in costs from US president Donald Trump’s auto tariffs for Q3, bringing the full-year net impact to $1 billion. Offsets introduced by the White House are expected to reduce some of that burden for domestic automakers, including Ford, which produces 80% of its vehicles in the US, as per the Yahoo Finance report.Ford+ Business StructureUnder the Ford+ plan, the company divides its business into three units: Ford Blue for traditional gas-powered vehicles, Model e for electric vehicles, and Ford Pro for commercial and super-duty trucks, as per the report. Ford's Strong Q3 Sales Driven by TrucksOverall sales in Q3 totaled 545,522 units, up 8.2% from a year ago. Truck and van sales, including F-Series, Ranger, and Maverick models, jumped 7.4% to 313,654 units, with F-Series trucks alone up nearly 13% year-to-date, as per the report.FAQsWhy did Ford stock jump today after hours?Ford beat Wall Street’s Q3 revenue and earnings expectations, boosting investor confidence.How did the Novelis aluminum plant fire affect Ford?It disrupted F-150 and SUV production, creating a $1.5B–$2B hit to adjusted EBIT in 2025.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onFord stock today latest newsFord stock priceFord Q3 earningsFord production disruptionF stockFord guidance cutFord stockFord Q3 revenue and EPSFord stock surge after earnings\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Currently, such gatherings are accommodated in temporary setups, so this addition represents a cost-effective solution that doesn’t burden taxpayers. Instead of appreciating this initiative, Democrats seem fixated on criticism. \n\nSubsequently, as reported by our affiliate Townhall, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer launched into a series of misleading statements, referencing that report and exclaiming, “Honestly, you can’t make this s**t up.”\nHowever, Chuck, you’re precisely engaging in the fabrication of narratives designed to mislead the public. \n\nThe Trump Rapid Response 47 account promptly countered Schumer’s claims, holding him accountable for his distortions. \n\nHonestly, you can’t make this shit up. https://t.co/GYjl09qeGT\n— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 23, 2025\n\nAnd yet, that’s exactly what you’re doing, Chuck, creating made-up spin to deceive the American people. \n\nThe Trump Rapid Response 47 account wasn’t letting Schumer get away with that and nailed him. \n\nYou’re a scumbag and a liar, Chuck — but everyone already knows that.

But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the President’s main priority.”\n\nAt this point, how can anyone trust anything he has to say? And he’s assuming that people wouldn’t even listen to the video that has the context, so not only is he being deceitful, he’s dumb about it too. Oh, and no, Chuck, you do not make yourself sound more on top of things by cursing.\n\n All he seems to care about is holding onto his seat and fending off Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). He’s holding the government hostage to appeal to the far left base in the process. \n\nEditor’s Note: The Schumer Shutdown is here.

As Rep.

Many of these kids come from families who rely on CalFresh to put food on their table. And even then, rising grocery prices make it hard for parents to afford nutritious meals.\n\nNow, some of California’s members of Congress have voted to cut $186 billion from the program that funds CalFresh, threatening to take food out of the mouths of 5 million Californians. I know how devastating this will be for some of the kids I care for. For some of them, the food I provide is the only full meal they get all day.\n\nThat’s why I’m voting yes on Proposition 50 — to hold politicians accountable for these cruel cuts and to elect leaders who stand with working families — not billionaires.\n\nYolanda Thomas\n\nNobel Peace Prize was\nout of Trump’s grasp\n\nDonald Trump as a Nobel Peace Prize winner?

Would that be Hamas operatives intimidating Gazans by riding around Gaza in pickup trucks, brandishing rifles? The implied threat became actualized by Hamas’ public executions of those who oppose it.\n\nHamas will continue violating the ceasefire and pushing the bounds of the peace treaty until it falls apart, because Hamas lives by a code few in the West understand or are willing to acknowledge. Hamas official Ghazi Hamad stated the Oct. 7 attack was “just the beginning” and Hamas intends to repeat such attacks until Israel is annihilated.\n\nChange could take generations in the absence of strong U.S. leadership. Failure of the United States to insist its Arab and Muslim partners apply the strongest possible pressure against Hamas will likely result in the humanitarian catastrophe about which Fusilero is concerned, as are we all.\n\nJulia Lutch","summary":"Also: Older fight &#124; Prop. 50 &#124; Out of grasp &#124; Nixon-era policy &#124; U.S. leadership.

Republicans, who offered the bill in part to bolster their argument that Democrats are to blame for any pain that results from the shutdown, contended they were merely catering to their restive progressive base.\n\nOn a vote of 54-45, the measure fell short of the 60 votes it needed to advance.

John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both of Georgia.\n\nSenate Republicans also blocked two alternatives that Democrats attempted to pass by unanimous consent, in which all senators agree to quickly take up and approve a bill. One of them would pay both essential workers and the roughly 700,000 workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began. A second would pay both categories of workers, and bar Trump from laying off any additional federal employees.\n\nIn a speech before the test vote on his party’s bill, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., the majority leader, rhetorically rolled his eyes at Democrats’ opposition. He accused them of blocking the legislation, sponsored by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., because they were “beholden to the Democratic base.”\n\n“We heard they would object to Senator Johnson’s bill because they want everybody to get paid,” an uncharacteristically angry Thune said. “I have great news: The clean continuing resolution sitting at the desk would pay everybody — everybody!”\n\nDuring government shutdowns, many workers are furloughed, or required to stop working, because funds are no longer appropriated to pay them. But those who are deemed to provide essential services — including at the Postal Service and the Social Security Administration, as well as law enforcement officers and air traffic controllers — are required to continue working as usual, but without pay.\n\nSenate Democrats argued that paying only essential workers and not those furloughed and forced to stay home without pay would incentivize Trump to declare employees at agencies he supports as essential, while neglecting those at agencies he views as undermining his political agenda.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, said the Republican bill would “hand Donald Trump and his right-hand man, Russell Vought, even more power to decide who gets paid and who gets punished.”\n\nTrump has made good on his repeated threats to use the shutdown to strip funding from Democratic priorities. Since the government shuttered, his administration has laid off thousands of federal workers and canceled billions of dollars in grants for projects in Democratic-led districts and states. At the same time, he has moved to ensure that military personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents continue to get paid.\n\nAnd since the shutdown began, Trump has signaled that he may try to deny furloughed employees automatic back pay, even though the president signed a law during his first term that provided it.\n\n“It gives the president the ability to decide who’s essential and who’s not, and what we see is, he is using this in a political way,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. “He would use this discretionary power to punish some and reward others.”\n\nDemocrats have withheld their votes for funding the government, demanding that Republicans negotiate an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies that they pushed through during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans have said they will not negotiate on the matter until the government reopens.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Senate Democrats today blocked legislation to pay federal employees who have been working without compensation during the government shutdown, thwarting Republicans&#8217; latest effort to weaken their hand in the federal spending fight.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/23/breaking-news/democrats-block-federal-worker-pay-bill-as-shutdown-drags-on/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/web1_20251023_WEB_GOVT-SHUTDOWN-13.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:28:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.525},{"id":372029658,"title":"Watch those texts!

What is this? What exactly is that? What is the satire? I’m just curious. Oh, it’s diarrhea from a plane. I get it now. A good one, sir.”\n\nStewart than pivoted to talk about the Pentagon pushing out journalists who did not agree to sign Pete Hegseth’s restrictive policies that limit what reporters can say. The host joked that maybe Trump’s diarrhea plane was a classified thing that snuck through the bars.\n\n“Why would you need information from the Pentagon,” Stewart asked. “I know they have a diarrhea plane. I don’t even know if that was classified — that could have been classified information that somehow got out. Someone’s going to pay the price for that. That’s way worse than the Signal chat.”\n\nThe video was set to the song “Danger Zone” by Kenny Loggins and also features political commentator Harry Sisson at a protest in New York. Trump offered the video without any other commentary. Millions of Americans turned out for the latest round of No Kings protests this weekend, with politicians, media figures and other speakers all in attendance. \n\nYou can watch the full “The Weekly Show” episode in the video above.","summary":"\"What is the satire?

We want to celebrate students coming together in a time of tragedy. We don't want to celebrate, frankly, a very racist, bigoted man.' \n\nHe added that fellow liberals at the school wanted the memorial to celebrate how the student body came together after the shooting rather than Kirk himself. \n\n'The worry with this memorial that they're planning on putting up, or creating a planning committee, at least, to potentially put up, is that it's celebrating Charlie Kirk and not celebrating unity,' said Colby. \n\nOn Tuesday, a smattering students gathered with signs that claimed there should be a 'memorial for unity, not for hate' and one writing that the school stands for 'diversity, inclusion and unity.'\n\nAt least one student argued that the campus should be 'for learning, not for tourists' who would come to see the memorial.\n\nAbagael Woods, who also participated, made arguments against the statue that could appeal to both sides. \n\n'For one thing, it’s going to get vandalized - there’s no way it’s not.

Beijing has defended its drug control record and accused Washington of using fentanyl to “blackmail” China.\n\nThe White House used the flow of the chemicals from China as one justification for increasing tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n“The first question I’m going to be asking him about is fentanyl,” Mr Trump said.\n\n“I’m putting it right at the front of the list.”","summary":"The bilateral meeting between US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping has been confirmed, despite recent tensions over tariffs.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/donald-trump-to-face-off-with-xi-jinping-amid-escalating-us-china-trade-war-c-20452314","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20452314/c2a771bcfcc0d1560af350e0629eac15a373e4e6-16x9-x242y0w2729h1535.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:15:49","author":"Gram Slattery,Michael Martina,Steve Holland and David Brunnstrom","authors":["Gram Slattery","Michael Martina","Steve Holland and David Brunnstrom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.251},{"id":372018980,"title":"Jeremy Allen White has the last laugh as acting school hands him high school diploma at age 34… despite his chronic truancy","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Oct 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Reeves 'is considering breaking Labour's manifesto pledge with income tax rise to fill £30billion gap'\n\nTrump threatens to cut all support for Israel in extraordinary escalation after JD Vance 'personal insult'\n\nNHS doctor accused of praising Hamas's October 7 attack wears 'celebratory' number 7 necklace at fitness to practice hearing\n\nThe 'hush-hush' REAL reason Claudia quit Strictly which BBC is trying to keep 'very quiet': TV insiders tell every detail of shock Strictly exit to KATIE HIND and ALISON BOSHOFF\n\nRICHARD EDEN: Dark suspicions about Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:23:21 BST, 23 October 2025 |Updated:00:08 BST, 24 October 2025 \n\nThe BBC are said to be ‘sticking with all female Strictly hosting duo’ after it was revealed Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman decided to leave ‘last year.’\nThe current hosts, who have fronted the show together since 2014, announced their departure in an emotional social media video to fans on Thursday.\nSome of the top names in telly have already had their hat thrown into the ring for the primetime gig, which will begin at the start of the next series in 2026. \nSources are saying the broadcaster could 'opt for two more women' but should also consider what the series 'should look and feel like' in the future. \nTess and Claudia are thought to have told bosses about their decision to leave last November, which has been kept firmly under-wraps until now. \nA source told The Sun: 'What is more certain is the fact that execs are expected to opt for two more women, because the Beeb value the symbolism of an all-female presenting team on their biggest Saturday night show.'\n\nThe BBC are said to be ‘sticking with all female Strictly hosting duo’ after it was revealed Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman decided to leave ‘last year’\n\nThe current hosts, who have fronted the show together since 2014, announced their departure in an emotional social media video to fans on Thursday\nIn a separate update, the insider added: 'They discussed this privately and agreed they would walk away together, but kept it firmly under wraps. \n'It’s incredible they’ve managed to keep it a secret for so long. Only the top brass at the BBC knew, along with their immediate family.' \nDaily Mail has contacted the BBC for comment. \nBut names to replace the hosting duo are already being suggested, with Zoe Ball, Holly Willoughby, Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton among the front runners.\nOther names who have been mentioned so far include Roman Kemp, former Strictly pro Janette Manara and former contestant Alex Scott.\nTV and radio veteran Zoe one of the biggest names to be tipped as the new host of the BBC dancing competition.\nThe mother of two would make a natural fit for the gig as she is well acquainted with the show thanks to her old presenting role on its spin-off, It Takes Two. \nShe is currently the 2-1 favourite to take on the role after Tess and Claudia leave the show, according to Coral Bookmakers.\n\nSources are saying the broadcaster could 'opt for two more women' but should also consider what the series 'should look and feel like' in the future\n\nNames to replace the hosting duo are already being suggested, with Zoe Ball, Holly Willoughby, Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton among the front runners\n\nFollowing the shock announcement, Holly (2-1) and Roman Kemp (3-1) also emerged as early favourites to take over presenting duties, according to Casino Beats\n\nElsewhere, Megaways Slots provider Spin Genie, Celebrity PR Specialist Kayley Corneliu, says Stacey and Kevin are most likely to get the job \nCoral's John Hill, said: 'Zoe Ball is no stranger to the Strictly family, and we make the former It Takes Two host the favourite to replace Tess Daly next year.'\nFollowing the shock announcement, Holly (2-1) is another household name who has been mentioned as a presenter who would be a good fit for the role.\nShe is no stranger to hosting a big competition-style show, after previously hosting Dancing On Ice alongside Phillip Schofield.\nHolly left This Morning in 2023 after 14 years in the role due to personal reasons and has only appeared on Netflix's Bear Hunt and Dancing On Ice since.\nSince Dancing On Ice has now been axed it would be a good opportunity for Holly to step into a new role.\nAccording to Casino Bets, Holly is currently one of the joint favourites to host the show. \nElsewhere, Megaways Slots provider Spin Genie, Celebrity PR Specialist Kayley Corneliu, says Stacey and Kevin are most likely to get the job.\nShe said: 'Current odds suggest that power couple and former Strictly Come Dancing champions Stacey Dooley and Kevin Clifton lead the market to take over hosting duties, both priced at 2/1.\n'Since their memorable win in 2018, the pair have remained closely connected to the show, and with their weekly rundowns of this year's series on their Substack, they strike the perfect balance between being qualified, passionate and in tune with the Strictly audience.'\nBBCTess DalyZoe BallKevin Clifton\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBBC 'to stick with all female Strictly hosting duo' as it's revealed Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman decided to leave 'last year'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 52\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

India participated in the Summit and we welcomed the signing of the landmark Peace Agreement.”\n“Peace and calm on the Palestinian front have implications for the wider region. India stands for lasting peace in the entire Middle East. It is important for the Agreement to hold and the ceasefire to sustain and for the parties to honour their respective commitments. Talks must continue, and there must be abiding faith in the efficacy of dialogue and diplomacy…,” he said.\nHe lauded Trump for playing an “instrumental role in forging the Agreement”. “India also commends the role of Egypt and Qatar towards achieving this end. India remains firm in its view that dialogue and diplomacy and the two-state solution are the means to achieve peace. The landmark initiative of the United States has generated diplomatic momentum towards peace and all parties must adhere to their obligations. We also remain firmly opposed to any unilateral moves by parties concerned.”\n\n#WATCH | Permanent Representative of India to the UN, Parvathaneni Harish’s complete address at the UNSC Open Debate on Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question\n(Source: India at UN, NY/X) pic.twitter.com/6tALQ0MSJ5\n— ANI (@ANI) October 23, 2025\n\nPointing out India is committed to its stance on developments since October 7, 2023, the Indian envoy said: “India has condemned terrorism; stressed there must be an end to destruction, despair and suffering of civilians and sought the immediate release of all hostages; held that humanitarian assistance must flow into Gaza in an unimpeded manner; and emphasised the need for a ceasefire. India envisions the Peace Agreement as an enabler and a catalyst in this regard.”\nHe emphasised that India underscores its “unwavering support to the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination, national independence, and sovereignty”.\n“Since India’s recognition of the State of Palestine in 1988, India has consistently advocated certain critical parameters – a sovereign, independent, viable State of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with Israel, within secure and recognised borders… Aid is essential for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Palestinian people cannot rebuild their lives without the support of the international community… The total support by India to the Palestinian people is over USD 170 million, which includes projects worth USD 40 million in various stages of implementation,” Harish said.\nHe further said: “… We have implemented human-centric projects bilaterally and also partnered with the UN and the Palestinian Authority in this regard. Over the last two years, India has provided relief assistance of nearly 135 metric tons of medicines and supplies. These initiatives must be coupled with the creation of economic frameworks and mechanisms that are conducive for social development, investment and employment.”\nSpeaking on the Middle East situation, the envoy said that the humanitarian challenges are an important dimension and it is important to address these on priority.\n“India’s commitment in this regard is also manifested in its supply of 5 metric tons of essential medicines to the friendly people of Syria as recently as July 2025. India continues to stress a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process. While taking positive note of progressive normalisation of Syria’s relations with its Arab neighbours, India also pledges its support to the regional efforts towards finding a long-term solution in Syria,” he said.\nHe added: “Indian troops in UNDOF remained steadfast in executing their mandate even during extreme challenges experienced during the recent conflict, including supreme sacrifice by Acting Force Commander Brigadier General Amitabh Jha in December 2024. India is the third largest contributor to this Mission.”\nThe Permanent Representative of India to the UN pointed out the importance of safety and security of peacekeepers at the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).\n“At a broader level, the peacekeepers serve a very critical function of the UN, and they cannot become casualties of conflicts and escalations. India remains hopeful that the Lebanese Armed Forces will be equipped to discharge the entire spectrum of its responsibilities once the UNIFIL sunset clause becomes operational towards the end of 2026” he said.\nSpeaking on India’s role in peacekeeping in Yemen, he said: “The humanitarian situation in Yemen is an area of concern. Humanitarian assistance must be above politics. It must reach all civilians, irrespective of their affiliations and power structures. Immediate cessation of hostilities would catalyse these efforts. The safety and security of Indian nationals in Yemen are a priority for us. It is India’s earnest desire to realise the vision of a stable and peaceful Middle East.”\n“Our views are guided by certain basic principles – all human beings have the right to lead normal lives; deprivation and indignity cannot be part of daily life; and civilians must not die due to conflict. India stands fully ready to contribute to this endeavour,” he added.","summary":"India at UN lauds Trump’s Gaza ceasefire deal, urges sustained talks, supports Palestinian rights, highlights aid to Gaza, Syria, Yemen, and peacekeeping roles in UNDOF and UNIFIL","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/talks-must-continue-india-envoy-to-un-lauds-trumps-role-in-gaza-ceasefire-deal-ws-l-9655070.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/10/Untitled-design-2025-10-24T043558.796-2025-10-3b0cc7bde6a1a9534fb364a9013cd201.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:07:33","author":"News18,Ranu Joardar","authors":["News18","Ranu Joardar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.541},{"id":372027390,"title":"Trump administration finalizes plan to open pristine Alaska wildlife refuge to oil and gas drilling","text":"The Trump administration on Thursday finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to potential oil and gas drilling, renewing a long-simmering debate over whether to drill in one of the nation’s environmental jewels.\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision Thursday that paves the way for future lease sales within the refuge’s 1.5 million-acre ( 631,309 hectare) coastal plain, an area that's considered sacred by the Indigenous Gwich’in. The plan fulfills pledges made by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to reopen this portion of the refuge to possible development. Trump's bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, passed during the summer, called for at least four lease sales within the refuge over a 10-year period.\n\nBurgum was joined in Washington, D.C., by Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state’s congressional delegation for this and other lands-related announcements, including the department’s decision to restore oil and gas leases in the refuge that had been canceled by the prior administration.\n\nA federal judge in March said the Biden administration lacked authority to cancel the leases, which were held by a state corporation that was the major bidder in the first-ever lease sale for the refuge held at the end of Trump’s first term.\n\nLeaders in Indigenous Gwich’in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and they oppose drilling there. Leaders of Kaktovik, an Iñupiaq community within the refuge, support drilling and consider responsible oil development to be key to their region’s economic well-being.\n\n“It is encouraging to see decisionmakers in Washington advancing policies that respect our voice and support Kaktovik’s long term success,\" Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. President Charles “CC” Lampe said in a statement.\n\nA second lease sale in the refuge, held near the end of President Joe Biden's term, yielded no bidders but critics of the sale argued it was too restrictive in scope.\n\nMeda DeWitt, Alaska senior manager with The Wilderness Society, said that with Thursday's announcement the administration \"is placing corporate interests above the lives, cultures and spiritual responsibilities of the people whose survival depends on the Porcupine caribou herd, the freedom to live from this land and the health of the Arctic Refuge.”\n\nThe actions detailed Thursday are consistent with those laid out by Trump on his return to office in January, which also included calls to speed the building of a road to connect the communities of King Cove and Cold Bay.\n\nBurgum on Thursday announced completion of a land exchange deal aimed at building the road that would run through Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. King Cove residents have long sought a land connection through the refuge to the all-weather airport at Cold Bay, seeing it as vital to accessing emergency medical care. Dunleavy and the congressional delegation have supported the effort, calling it a life and safety issue.\n\nConservationists vowed a legal challenge to the agreement, with some tribal leaders worried a road will drive away migratory birds they rely on. The refuge, near the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, contains internationally recognized habitat for migrating waterfowl. Past land exchange proposals have been met with controversy and litigation.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said the latest land agreement would exchange about 500 acres (202 hectares) of “ecologically irreplaceable wilderness lands” within the refuge for up to 1,739 acres (703.7 hectares) of King Cove Corp. lands outside the refuge. Tribal leaders in some communities further north, in Yup’ik communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, have expressed concerns that development of a road would harm the migratory birds important to their subsistence ways of life.\n\n“Along with the Native villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, we absolutely plan to challenge this decision in court,” said Cooper Freeman, the center’s Alaska director.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, told reporters she has been fighting for the land access for King Cove throughout her tenure and has been to both the community and the refuge. She called the refuge a “literal bread basket” for many waterfowl and said it was in everyone’s interest to ensure that a road is built with minimal disturbance.\n\n“I think it’s important to remember that nobody’s talking about a multi-lane paved road moving lots of big trucks back and forth,” she said. “It is still an 11-mile, one-lane, gravel, noncommercial-use road.”","summary":"The Trump administration on Thursday finalized plans to open the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to potential oil and gas drilling, renewing a long-simmering debate over whether to drill in one of the nation's environmental jewels.\n\nU.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ann...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/579768/Trump-administration-finalizes-plan-to-open-pristine-Alaska-wildlife-refuge-to-oil-and-gas-drilling","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/10/867c0a8060a39abda24658c2df7b5700be8fc89602949de4f8a38599c32652ca.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:06:00","author":"President Donald Trump,The Canadian Press","authors":["President Donald Trump","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":372015816,"title":"Dirty secret of Trump's Prodigal Son as disturbing online history is revealed","text":"A Donald Trump staffer embroiled in scandal after allegedly leaking racist texts sent by his colleagues previously backed Ron DeSantis for the White House, it emerged today.\n\nGavin Wax, who works at the State Department, remains in his job despite the scandal, with sources revealing he enjoys a close relationship with Trump, seeing him as 'father figure'.\n\nBut his loyalty to the commander-in-chief has not always been so sure.\n\nA source who has followed Wax's career closely told the Daily Mail that 'Gavin was all in for DeSantis before he realized he could make more money from Trump.'\n\n'He even wrote op-eds on the subject,' the source noted that he 'has largely scrubbed them from the internet.'\n\nOne article written by Wax for American Greatness in March of 2021 criticized Trump's elevation of his son-in-law Jared Kushner to positions of power within his first administration.\n\nAt the time, Wax noted that 'if the president cannot learn from his most glaring mistake, Jared Kushner, it is time for the Republican Party to move on and find a worthy successor for the MAGA revolution he started.'\n\nOn January 23rd of 2021, Wax also tweeted 'DeSantis 2024', just three days after Joe Biden was sworn in as America's 46th President.\n\n'He was so quick to flip on Trump in January 2021 after he lost,' a senior Republican official from New York told Daily Mail.\n\nThe same official added that Wax's change of heart was driven by money.\n\nHe's friends with Alex [Bruesewitz], who does Trump's social media. Alex partnered with him. He made so much money from the campaign,' the source added.\n\n'He's not loyal, it's money, he was the first one to turn on Trump after the 2020 election,' the individual said.\n\nWax declined to comment to the Daily Mail about the accusations.\n\nBy 2023, Wax was all aboard the Trump Train. \n\nA then 28-year-old Gavin Wax, a middle-class kid from Queens, sent a cold note to President Trump inviting him to the New York Young Republicans Gala at Cipriani on Wall Street, not expecting anything in return.\n\nTrump accepted — launching Wax into the presidential orbit.\n\n'He came to speak to us, not the party,' a source close to Wax told the Daily Mail. 'He sat there at dinner with him, eating steak.'\n\nThe two developed what sources describe as a 'pen-pal' relationship.\n\nWax's New York Young Republican Club was the first organization in the country to endorse Trump for re-election.\n\n'He took a bet on himself.

While we can’t reveal all the details just yet, the new show will be bold, entertaining and fast-moving with a renewed focus on energy and music.”\n\nJoyce added the new program would be announced at the ARN Upfronts next week. For weeks there have been whispers ARN’s planned national rollout of the Kyle and Jackie O program was under review due to the program’s failed launch in Melbourne where it has recorded mediocre ratings since its 2024 launch.\n\nThe rollout in Brisbane in 2026 was expected to be a fait accompli given the city is Sandilands’ home town.\n\nIt now appears ARN, having blown millions on marketing the show during the past two years, is set to put the national rollout on hold and will instead launch a stopgap “local” program to fill the void while executives get to work persuading the defiant Sandilands to rework his breakfast show.\n\nTHE GYNGELLS SET TO BREAK BREAD\n\nFormer Nine Network CEO turned investor David Gyngell and wife Leila McKinnon are understood to be UK-bound to visit Gyngell’s sister, acclaimed chef Skye.\n\nDavid and Skye and sister Briony Fitzgerald, the Sydney interior designer, are the children of Australian television pioneer Bruce Gyngell and his first wife Ann.\n\nHaving left Australia at 18 and moved to Paris to study cookery before travelling next to London to apprentice in city’s top kitchens, Gyngell found fame running the Michelin-starred Petersham Nurseries Café in Richmond, Surrey, before moving on, to great success, to serve as culinary director of Heckfield Place in Hampshire.\n\nIn 2015 she opened her own restaurant, Spring.\n\nAlong the way Gyngell welcomed two daughters – LA-based freelance producer Holly Gore and shopping website creator Evie Henderson – with two husbands.\n\nThen in May the 62-year-old, who has spoken openly about her past heroin and alcohol addictions, opened up about her battle with cancer.\n\nAs far back as 2011 Gyngell, who owes her fair and freckled complexion to her TV executive father, confirmed she’d had a skin cancer removed from her face.\n\nSadly in 2024 a lump on her neck was diagnosed as Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.\n\nBy the time it was picked up the cancer had already spread to her salivary glands.\n\nA nine-hour surgery followed during which the chef had her salivary glands, 40 other glands and part of one shoulder removed. Weeks of radiotherapy treatment followed.\n\nThough work has been “everything” to her, after 40 years in the kitchen the accomplished cookbook author decided to retreat from the kitchen as she felt it was “a younger person’s game.”\n\nIn one recent interview Gyngell confessed to having dreams of returning to Australia and retiring on the north coast of NSW, not far from her brother’s Byron Bay hinterland property.\n\n“I think I’m scared to be old and cold,” she said, “so I think maybe I could move to a small country town and have a vegetable garden, walk the beach in the morning and tend to the vegetables.”\n\nSEVEN’S DANCING TO BE RESTED IN 2026\n\nFour months after this column reported Channel 7 was set to axe Dancing with the Stars at the end of the program’s 2025 season, a report that met with a vigorous denial from Seven, the network this week unveiled the highlights of its 2026 programming schedule minus the reality show.\n\nIndustry sources informed us at the time the program, which costs around $1m an episode to produce, was too expensive for the cash-strapped network to proceed with. Admittedly our timing wasn’t great for Seven with the 22nd season of the program set to launch the following week.\n\nWhen we queried the program’s absence from Seven’s 2026 showcase this week we were assured talks were underway with format owner BBC for another season.\n\nNews the show is not on the slate will be a blow to network star Sonia Kruger who we’re happy to report (despite her receiving little lip service in retrospective publicity statements) co-hosted Seven’s advertising Upfronts showcase at Royal Randwick on Wednesday.\n\nAt her side was Seven favourite, Chris Brown.\n\nVeterinarian Brown fares well in Seven’s programming line-up for 2026 after picking up the hosting gig for the network’s new renovation show, My Reno Rules, as well as a role on Once In A Lifetime, a global wildlife show that sees a group of celebrities go on the road to far flung locations.\n\nAlso set to star are comedian Mick Molloy, Amanda Keller, Kate Ritchie and Matt Preston.\n\nMolloy spearheads Seven’s push to recruit more comedians – exclusively males – as program hosts.\n\nWith Hamish Blake and Andy Lee off the table, Seven has opted for Molloy (forementioned show, also The Front Bar and another currently untitled program from Molloy’s production shop), Glenn Robbins (also in the unnamed Molloy production) and actor Shane Jacobson who will host quiz show Caught in the Middle.\n\nSam Pang is also expected to return in The Front Bar.\n\nWomen are a little thin on the ground in hosting roles at Seven next year although Kruger is expected to return for The Voice.\n\nNot returning to Seven and a new series of SAS is former British sniper Ant Middleton whose on-screen persona and off-screen antics have been raising eyebrows in the industry for years, as this writer has faithfully reported.\n\nMiddleton and his brother Dan were booted from Ten’s Amazing Race last month after a “conduct breach” described by one insider as a “homophobic slur”\n\nTRUMP’S AUSSIE CALL\n\nMore than a decade before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese enjoyed his much-anticipated meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House, the reality show host and aspirant world leader picked up the phone to this columnist to express his admiration for model Jennifer Hawkins.\n\nIt was September 2011 and Trump had just addressed a crowd of fans at a Sydney talkfest dubbed the National Achiever’s Congress.\n\nThe then host of the American version of The Apprentice kicked off his speech by snidely taking a shot at the manager of model Jennifer Hawkins, one-time winner of Trump’s Miss Universe pageant and an old friend who had introduced the businessman at the Sydney Entertainment Centre event on the day.\n\n“I heard a horrible story today,” Trump told an audience that had forked out $10,000-a-head to hear the businessman spruik his own success.\n\n“Her manager (Sydney agent Sean Anderson) said ‘Oh she shouldn’t speak. You should get a lot of money if you’re going to speak in front of Mr Trump’. So I’m very happy she showed up. I was honoured.”\n\nThe following day Trump sought to explain the dig so picked up the phone to this columnist.\n\nHe proceeded to explain that Hawkins had been “gracious” and that “as soon as she found out there was an opportunity to appear (on the bill) … she reached out to me.”\n\nAt the time Hawkins was receiving flack for cutting back on her public appearances for department store Myer which had her on a $1.3-million-a-year contract to grace their catalogues, runways and do media interviews.\n\nTrump wanted his mate Jen cast in the best possible light though.\n\n“She couldn’t have been more pleasant,” Trump told us of their encounter.\n\nHer manager went even further saying there was no bad blood between Jen’s team and Trump. \n\n“He had a dig at me and that’s fine. Jen introduced Mr Trump last night. Their relationship is stronger than ever,” Anderson said.\n\nGOLDEN BACHELOR’S RATINGS SLIDE\n\nDespite Nine’s best marketing efforts, after just two episodes The Golden Bachelor’s audience is switching off.\n\nThe program’s total national audience dropped from 749,000 to 700,000 between Monday and Tuesday nights last week.\n\nIn five capital cities the figure was more dire with The Golden Bachelor attracting just 385,000 viewers on its second night out compared to 476,000 for its hyped premiere.\n\nThe figure is 42 per cent and 48 per cent down on audiences who watched Nine’s The Block in the same timeslot the previous week – a result that could irk Nine’s advertisers who are accustomed to The Block’s rusted-on larger audiences.","summary":"It has been quite the month for The Wiggles with a major development in a legal case just a week after they took to the stage with US singer Teddy Swims.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/wiggles-reach-secret-legal-deal-with-ex-ceo-luke-oneill/news-story/77564e1f99952bd7803d4669e0a377f0?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b9e629ef9837d4ee721afeadb447d125","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:02:30","author":"Annette Sharp","authors":["Annette Sharp"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.182},{"id":372009530,"title":"'They were easily viewable': CNN reporter catches Trump in lie","text":"President Donald Trump recently denied reports that he deployed B1 bombers to Venezuela amid escalating tensions with the South American country.

Your analysis brings much-needed clarity to voters.\n\nI especially appreciate your courage in revealing that county leaders had been planning this sales tax increase for two years — long before the so-called “Trump Medicaid cuts.” As you reported, state Sen. Dave Cortese pushed through special legislation in 2023 allowing Santa Clara County to raise its tax beyond the state cap, and County Executive James Williams even said he would have sought a higher rate if he could.\n\nYour editorial’s data and context cut through the political messaging and remind us that fiscal discipline, not another tax, is what our county needs most. Thank you for informing voters with facts, not spin.\n\nEditorial fails in\nbid to convince\n\nRe: “Vote no on Measure A sales tax hike” (Page A12, Oct. 19).\n\nI already sent my mail-in ballot, and I voted yes on A.\n\nAt first, and for a couple of weeks before voting, I was leaning toward a “no” until two points became clear to me. Point one, I have confidence in my county administrators that they work very hard to save and efficiently manage the taxes I pay. Point two, helping my neighbors, my community, is worth any increase in my tax burden.\n\nYour editorial against Measure A did not convince me that I voted wrong.\n\nTransform ‘No Kings’\nenthusiasm into action\n\nRe: “‘No Kings’ rallies galvanize region” (Page A1, Oct. 19).\n\nTo everyone who was there on No Kings Day, Oct. 18, indivisible and visible, you voiced your concerns, you found others and learned a lot, and laughed a bunch.\n\nNow it’s time to make your voice heard with impact for the sake of our democracy. Pick two of the Trump attacks on our democracy — there’s plenty to choose from — and pelt your local, state and federal representatives with emails, cards and letters that share the anger and offer changes.\n\nWe have made our voices heard — now it’s time to turn up the heat or start running people who will do the job right for us. \n\nWalter Hudson\n\nSafety measures will\nhelp stop battery fires\n\nRe: “California made it through summer without a flex alert. Batteries saved the day, experts say.” (Page B9, Oct. 19).\n\nThe article mentioned the January fire that destroyed a large battery storage facility in Moss Landing, but failed to mention two key points about safety.\n\nFirst, the batteries in that facility were nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC). But the industry is moving from NMC to safer lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. LFP batteries have a significantly lower fire risk because they are less likely to overheat.\n\nSecond, the batteries in the Moss Landing facility were housed together as a unit, allowing the fire to spread easily to adjacent batteries. Today, best practices for battery storage design include grouping smaller numbers of batteries in isolated units. Each unit is designed to prevent a fire from spreading to another unit.\n\nFire code updates will help prevent battery fires like the one in Moss Landing.\n\nSanta Clara\n\nWhen will Republicans\nadmit their mistake?\n\nDuring my long life, I have always been so proud to be American. I am so sad that I am now ashamed, embarrassed and angry.\n\nI am a lifelong Democrat, but I have had many friends and family who are Republicans. Over the past months, several have called and emailed me, apologizing and saying how sorry they are for having voted for Donald Trump.\n\nI don’t understand why all the well-educated, intelligent citizens who voted for this poor excuse for a human being don’t feel the same.\n\nChristine Khoury","summary":"Also: Saving lives &#124; Long-planned tax &#124; Unconvinced &#124; Time for action &#124; Safe batteries &#124; Republican mistakes.

Among them was Muhmmned NDiaye of Senegal, who has a rap sheet that reportedly includes robbery, domestic violence, drugs and forgery.\n\nGood riddance, right? \n\nBut this being New York City in 2025, our activist politicians ran like firefighters to protest the enforcement of our laws — and, ultimately, protect illegal migrants with criminal records.\n\nThey mobilized swiftly to tangle with ICE, marched to Federal Plaza and gave their thumbs a workout by blasting federal law enforcement on social media.\n\nState Senator Julia Salazar wrote that “ICE terrorized and abducted our neighbors in Chinatown.” \n\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander thanked “the New Yorkers who mobilized quickly” to protest. Sandra Nurse, a City Councilwoman from Brooklyn, posted that “Trump is waging war on American cities. We will defend ourselves.”\n\nCity Councilman Shekar Krishnan of Queens boasted on X that he had just came back from protesting at Federal Plaza and urged support for his bill to decriminalize street vending.\n\nBeleaguered Attorney General Letitia James put out an open call asking for photos and videos of ICE officers to upload into a new “portal to review federal immigration enforcement in New York after yesterday’s ICE raid on Canal Street.”\n\nYes, our state’s top law enforcement official set up a snitch line to go after Federal law enforcement. To, essentially, aid and abet criminal behavior.\n\nAnd, no surprise, mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani jumped in to tweet: “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop.”\n\nWhere was all this energy a couple of weeks ago when an innocent man had his head stomped in by a psychotic, violent recidivist after he politely opened a subway station door for him? How about when cops have been assaulted by illegal migrants or when a homeless woman sleeping on an F train was incinerated by an illegal migrant?\n\nThese tragic cases show major fissures in our system but, alas, they don’t score any political points for the resistance.\n\nManhattan Borough President Mark Levine called the Chinatown raid “indefensible and reprehensible.” How about: helpful to his constituents?\n\nAnd has he been to the gauntlet of filth that is Canal Street now?\n\nFor decades, it’s been a stretch where tourists buy Louis Vuitton and Rolex knockoffs. But conditions have devolved in recent years. Navigating Canal Street is like walking through a weed-scented third-world bazaar with aggressive vendors sprawled across the sidewalks.\n\nIt’s become increasingly hostile for residents and small business owners.\n\nJust a month ago, NY1 reported that more than 800 people had signed a petition urging the NYPD to establish a more permanent enforcement to battle the spiraling chaos of Canal Street, including brazen drug deals caught on video.\n\n“Drug use, muggings, people defecating on the street — it’s filth, and it’s crime that spans way beyond just the illegal vending of handbags in the neighborhood,” Mark Elman, who manages a building in the neighborhood, told the outlet. “The number one concern is safety.”\n\nHowever, at every turn, our leaders show us that New Yorkers are an afterthought. Their primary concern is performative advocacy for illegal migrants, criminals and disorder.\n\nOur city splashed out billions of dollars to house and feed illegal migrants over the last few years. And Mamdani has pledged to spend $100 million hiring lawyers to help those facing deportation.\n\nMeanwhile, where does that leave the rest of us suckers?\n\nPoliticians should be embarrassed that we let illegals flout our laws — but they are shameless and only care about sticking it to Donald Trump.\n\nIn reality, they are sticking it to law-abiding New Yorkers.","summary":"NYC's activist politicians ran to protest the enforcement of our laws — and, ultimately, protect illegal migrants with criminal records.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/23/opinion/political-response-to-canal-street-raid-devalues-law-abiders/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/newspress-collage-ydajewur1-1761260193314.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1761245914&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DfmoN8mN-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-23 23:00:13","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.078}]}
