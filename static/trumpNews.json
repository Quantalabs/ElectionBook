OpenAI has said it’s buying Ive’s nascent devices startup io in what is by far the largest acquisition in the artificial intelligence company’s 10-year history. It’s a decidedly big bet on a secretive hardware company co-founded by Ive, who famously designed Apple’siPhone, iPod and iPad. In a post on X alongside a nine-minute video with Ive, Mr Altman called his new colleague “the greatest designer in the world.” The all-stock deal represents a staggering sum, particularly at a time when venture firms have been thirsty for exits due to a yearslong dearth of IPOs and big acquisitions. For OpenAI, the purchase represents just over 2pc of its paper worth after the company was valued at $300 billion in a SoftBank-led round in March. \n\n(Adapted from “Sam Altman’s $6.4 billion bet on Jony Ive has Zuckerberg-like qualities,” by Ashley Capoot, published on May 22, 2025, by CNBC)\n\nTariffs and weddings\n\nBrides in the US are buckling under the uncertainty over tariffs, which are threatening to push costs to new heights as wedding season kicks off. They are panic-buying candles and speed-ordering wedding dresses. They are downgrading from roses to carnations, cutting back on party favors and ditching the professional videographer for a guy with a smartphone. Though a 90-day pause on many of the planned tariffs has blunted the impact, brides say vendors have raised prices on everything from linens to dresses in response to new and anticipated levies. Brides are taking to social media to share tales of woe. For example, in one Reddit wedding forum, a woman shared that the custom-made gown she ordered over a year ago was suddenly $1,500 more expensive, after her designer cited tariff-related production charges. \n\n(Adapted from “Brides Settle For Costco Flowers And American Wine As Tariffs Rain On Wedding Season,” by Chavie Lieber, published on May 5, 2025, by the Wall Street Journal) \n\nChina’s chip leap\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said that US chip export controls are a “failure” and warned that the restrictions are doing more damage to American business than to China.

The visit resulted in commitments of more than $2 trillion of investment from the oil-rich Gulf Arab states. Yet a question is making the rounds: Would all those commitments materialise, especially in the backdrop of a subdued oil market and growing budgetary pressures on oil-exporting Arab governments? \n\nRather than striving for broader geopolitical goals, the trip revolved around business deals. The trader in Trump seemed to be in play.\n\nConspicuously, the trip itinerary did not include Tel Aviv, which was a major deviation from the past. Further, not much pressure, at least in front of the public, was exerted upon Riyadh to join the Abrahamic Accords and recognise Israel. From that perspective, Pakistan was also spared of any additional ‘public’ pressure to recognise Israel.\n\nRiyadh was Trump’s first stopover. Results were substantial. As per a White House announcement, Saudi Arabia agreed to invest $600 billion in the United States over the next four years.\n\n Doubts cast on Saudi Arabia’s ‘unrealistic’ $600bn investment promises to the US amid falling oil prices \n\nAnalysts, though, are pointing out that some of the projects listed were already in the works, and an additional 145 deals worth more than $300bn were reportedly signed at an adjacent investor conference attended by several US billionaires and prominent business executives.\n\nThe US, in the meantime, also agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142bn — the largest “defence cooperation agreement” Washington has ever made.\n\nThe agreement between the two countries included deals with more than a dozen US companies involved in air and missile defence, air force and space, maritime security and communications sectors.\n\nThe next day, Trump was in Doha, Qatar, overseeing agreements between the two countries worth more than $243.5bn and outlining plans to increase the Qatari investment in the US to $1.2tr, a White House announcement said.\n\nLater, during a speech at a US military air base in Qatar, Trump said Doha has agreed to invest $10bn in a US military facility and purchase $42bn in weapons from the US.\n\nBesides, Qatar Airways agreed to buy 210 Boeing jets worth $96bn. The New York Times called it the largest deal facilitated by Trump during his Middle East trip. \n\nThe next day, Trump was in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), announcing more than $200bn in commercial deals between the two countries. \n\nA deal to construct the largest artificial intelligence data centre outside of the US in Abu Dhabi was also announced during the Trump stopover in the UAE. The Emirati firm G42 is to build the facility covering 10 square miles and have a five-gigawatt capacity, the US Department of Commerce said.\n\nBut, despite the flurry of business deals, many stay sceptic. After all, last time Trump was in office, Gulf states made similar, big spending promises. Most didn’t come to fruition. Some say the new pledges must also be seen in a similar context. Michael Hanna, the International Crisis Group’s US programme director, told ABC News, “One of the things that has been a huge problem for Trump, traditionally, is implementation and follow-through.”\n\nCathrin Schaer, writing for Deutsche Welle, points out a problem with what is being described as a kind of grand “investment diplomacy” of the Gulf states: Falling oil prices. These countries mostly depend on oil for their national income, and that income is currently under pressure.\n\nTo balance its 2025 budget, Saudi Arabia needs oil prices on or above $91 a barrel, the International Monetary Fund estimated. That is not the case now. Oil prices are hovering around $65 a barrel, with projections that they may even fall further.\n\nThe question then is: how could these oil-exporting countries meet the investment targets they have signed with the United States? As per Ms Schaer, the Gulf states are simultaneously also being asked to commit to regional projects, such as rebuilding in Lebanon, supporting Egypt through its economic crisis and — the most expensive project, such as the reconstruction of Gaza, should the conflict end there.\n\nIn the meantime, most Gulf Arab states are also committed to a major domestic investment push. Saudi Arabia, for instance, is focused on its capital-intensive Vision 2030. All this needs considerable cash flow which is currently missing.\n\nTim Callen, a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told Ms Schaer that when oil prices went down, the Saudis tended to cut back on spending.\n\n“Without the current account surplus, there are no new funds to invest unless you borrow,” Mr Callen said. “If the Saudis want to invest in new ventures, they’re either going to have to borrow in global capital markets or they’ll have to reallocate existing investments.” \n\nWith oil prices dropping, “it’s even less likely that these promises can be met”, he argued. If Saudi Arabia spends or invests $600bn in the US over the next four years, that equals $150bn a year, or 12pc of its own annual gross domestic product. “That’s just unrealistically huge”, Mr Callen concluded.\n\nFor the UAE, investing $140bn a year in the US over the next decade means the Emiratis would be spending more than a quarter of their annual national income on the US. That’s “not viable”, Neil Quilliam, a fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at London-based think tank Chatham House, told Arabian Gulf Business Insight.\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 26th, 2025","summary":"US President Donald Trump is back from his Middle East trip; his first major overseas visit after assuming office in his second tenure.

The high-level talks, which began in April, mark the most substantial engagement between Washington and Tehran since the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) during Trump's first term. That landmark deal had sought to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, offering sanctions relief in return for strict limits on its nuclear program. While Trump struck a positive note, describing the diplomatic channel as \"very, very good,\" Iranian officials were more cautious in their assessment. Iran's foreign minister and lead negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, called the negotiations \"too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.\" Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi, whose country is serving as a key mediator, offered a measured view of the outcome. Posting on X, he said the fifth round had concluded \"with some but not conclusive progress,\" and expressed hope that \"the remaining issues\" would be clarified in the coming days. The latest talks come ahead of a critical June meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, where Iran's nuclear activities will be reviewed. The diplomatic effort also precedes the October expiry of key provisions from the 2015 deal, raising urgency on both sides to find a resolution. Since returning to office, Trump has revived his \"maximum pressure\" policy toward Iran, tightening sanctions while keeping military options on the table if diplomacy stalls. Still, Sunday's comments suggest a potentially softer stance, at least temporarily, as both sides weigh the cost of continued escalation.","summary":"President Trump expressed optimism regarding nuclear negotiations with Iran, hinting at a potential breakthrough soon.

Now her family say it's 'torture' in case that's divided the world","text":"In the intensive care unit of a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, lies a patient whose fate has set millions of her fellow Americans at each other’s throats.\n\nThey’re not fighting, however, over 30-year-old Adriana Smith’s right to live – but her right to die.\n\nAdriana, a local nurse, was nine weeks pregnant when she went to a hospital back in February seeking treatment for intense headaches. Doctors sent her home with some medication but they didn’t conduct a CT scan. The next morning she woke up struggling to breathe and making terrifying gargling sounds.\n\nThe hospital discovered she had blood clots in her brain and, after an unsuccessful surgery to relieve the pressure, she was declared brain-dead.\n\nGiven she already has a seven-year-old son who will now be left without a mother, the situation for Adriana and her loved ones was already terrible.\n\nHowever, critics say the situation has turned from tragedy into ‘an absolute horror show’ after Emory University Hospital – where the nurse previously worked – informed Adriana’s family that, although she was legally dead, she was not allowed to die.\n\nThe apparent reason, according to the hospital’s spokesman, is that it’s acting ‘in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws’.\n\nAs such, the hospital has reportedly demanded Adriana be kept alive on breathing and feeding tubes until specialists have determined the male foetus is sufficiently developed to be delivered – by caesarean section – as a baby boy. That is scheduled to occur in early August.\n\nRemoving her from life support until that time, health officials reportedly believe, would violate Georgia’s strict anti-abortion laws – which prohibit termination once a foetal heartbeat is detected, typically at around six weeks.\n\nThe state’s controversial law, the Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act, which was dubbed the ‘heartbeat Bill’ does contain an exception to save the life of the mother. But that doesn’t apply to Adriana Smith, as her life is beyond saving.\n\nHer family say they hadn’t made up their minds whether to switch off her life support systems but, at this nightmarish moment, are deeply upset that the decision has been taken out of their hands by faceless bureaucrats.\n\n‘This is torture for me,’ her distraught mother April Newkirk told local TV station 11Alive. ‘I see my daughter breathing by the ventilator but she’s not there.’\n\nWhat’s more, she revealed that the baby – who the family have named ‘Chance’ – has hydrocephalus, or fluid on the brain. Even if he survives the pregnancy (which is increasingly uncertain), he could be born with severe disabilities. ‘He may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,’ Ms Newkirk said.\n\n‘Right now, the journey is for baby Chance to survive. Whatever condition God allows him to come here in, we’re going to love him just the same.’\n\nWhile Georgia’s heartbeat law was narrowly passed in 2019, it did not come into effect until three years later after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that established a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThree other states have similar abortion bans that come into force around the six-week mark and 12 states bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy.\n\nLegal experts are in little doubt what is worrying Adriana’s healthcare provider – a part of the Georgia law that gives foetuses legal rights as ‘members of the species Homo sapiens’.\n\nIf Adriana and the foetus are two patients with separate legal rights, even if the mother dies, the hospital might have a legal obligation to keep the foetus alive.\n\nBut doctors anticipate there will be more problems for the child, pointing out life-support systems are not designed for long-term treatment of brain-dead patients. With blood no longer running to the mother’s brain, the organ is starting to decompose.\n\n‘The chance of there being a healthy newborn at the end of this is very, very small,’ said Steven Ralston, the director of the maternal foetal medicine division at George Washington University in Washington DC.\n\nThe gruesome medical situation and apparent helplessness of Adriana’s family has sparked the ire of the ‘pro-choice’, pro-abortion lobby, with critics saying the case demonstrates a ‘pro-life’ philosophy that ends up being anything but humane.\n\nPredictably, some opponents have likened Georgia to Gilead, the fictional America in Margaret Atwood’s chilling novel The Handmaid’s Tale. \n\nIn this dystopian world, much of the US is ruled by a brutal Christian fundamentalist government which – to tackle a severe infertility crisis – forces the few women who can conceive to devote their lives to producing offspring for ruling men.\n\nWhile drawing an analogy with the book – a popular Democrat pastime in MAGA America – is once again a fairly extreme view, critics are correct in saying the state’s leaders should have seen this coming.\n\nLegal experts say the vague way anti-abortion laws are written will naturally make doctors and hospitals worried about facing criminal charges.\n\nAnd they should have foreseen, too, how the movement (currently gaining ground in the US) to establish so-called ‘foetal personhood’ – whereby a foetus should have legal rights, including the right to life – would inevitably end up pitting the rights of the mother against those of their unborn child.\n\nNow, keen to avert a public relations crisis that could lose them votes in a key swing state, even some of Georgia’s conservatives are fighting back by claiming that Georgia’s LIFE law is being misinterpreted.\n\nThe state’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, last week released a statement declaring the law does not require doctors to keep brain-dead patients alive, because turning off the life support ‘is not an action with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.\n\nOthers disagree, however, and say the hospital has taken the correct – and humane – course.\n\n‘While Adriana can no longer speak for herself, her son’s life still matters. Her doctors are doing the right thing by treating him as a unique patient,’ said Students for Life of America, a national anti-abortion group which has even launched a campaign to raise money to help Adriana’s family.\n\nGeorgia state Senator Ed Setzler, who sponsored the state’s abortion crackdown, has agreed, saying: ‘I think there’s a valuable human life that we have an opportunity to save, and I think it’s the right thing to save it. To suggest otherwise is to declare the child as being other than human.\n\n‘This is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life.’\n\nIt’s certainly an ‘unusual circumstance’ but it’s actually not the first time an American woman has been kept on life support because of a pregnancy. In 2014, Texan Marlise Munoz collapsed on her kitchen floor when she was 14 weeks pregnant.\n\nThe hospital informed her husband and parents that she was brain-dead because of a pulmonary embolism. However, medical staff refused to honour Marlise’s previously stated wish not to be kept alive by machines, citing a state law that stopped hospitals from withdrawing or withholding ‘life-sustaining treatment from a pregnant patient’.\n\nMarlise’s husband launched a legal battle to get her taken off life support, during which the family revealed the foetus was severely deformed due to oxygen deprivation and the fact it was developing in a brain-dead body. A judge ruled in the husband’s favour and Marlise was removed from organ support before the baby was born.\n\nBut 2014 was a very different America – less riven by culture wars and a triumphalist Donald Trump who was voted in as President on a wave of anti-abortion sentiment driven by supporters in the so-called ‘Bible Belt’ states of the South and Midwest.\n\nThere’s no indication Adriana Smith’s ghastly limbo state – neither alive nor entirely dead – is due to end any time soon.","summary":"In the intensive care unit of a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, lies a patient whose fate has set millions of her fellow Americans at each other's throats.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14748291/corpse-expecting-baby-Adrianas-braindead-decomposing-doctors-wont-turn-life-support-family-say-torture-case-thats-divided-world.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/25/21/98741079-0-image-m-61_1748205793190.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-26 00:43:09","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.51},{"id":324833788,"title":"Nippon Steel shares climb 5% after Trump offers support for U.S. Steel deal - TradingView","text":"Nippon Steel 5401 shares rallied at the start of Monday trade in Tokyo after U.S. President Donald Trump expressed support for the company's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel X.\n\nShares of Nippon, the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, gained 5% to 3,025 yen early morning in Tokyo after being untraded with a glut of buy orders earlier in the day.

While there are still tariffs in the mix, it certainly does seem that common sense (no doubt with a few stern words from some wealthy US companies) has prevailed and the “going to implode the global economy and drive everyone into recession with skyrocketing inflation” rhetoric has subsided. \n\nHere at home, funnily enough, all this palaver seems to have only strengthened the demand for New Zealand exports on the global stage with the FX risk the only foreseeable roadblock.\n\nOn the ranch, grass levels have certainly bounced back after what has been considered regionally to be one of the worst droughts in recent memory. While the feed bills may still be lingering, the brown tinge to the hills is all but a distant memory. \n\nOn the machinery front, the market has softened slightly as a general overall trend. The most recent monthly data has charted sales down 11% across the board over this time last year. This is somewhat of a surprise to many and is not welcome news for the dealerships. It certainly felt like they had got to the start line, the starter had enthusiastically clapped the two pieces of four by two together and they were off racing. Now it feels like they are traipsing back to the start line for a false start.\n\nOverall both North and South Island appear to be down around the same amount as a percentage, but if you actually look at the data a little more closely, some of the traditional dairying regions such as Waikato, Taranaki, Manawatū, Mid Canterbury and the mighty West Coast (with a 300% increase) are certainly well above where they were last year; a sign that increased farm gate incomes are flowing back through the economy. \n\nConversely, grain farmers have had a tough and frustrating year with the weather just simply not playing ball at times when they really needed it to. The net result of this is that they have slumped into the same situation as dairy farmers were last year: high on farm inflation and flat revenue. \n\nThe silver lining for them will be that higher stock prices may mean they can make a little bit more on their way through, from winter grazing and fattening store cattle. Although like all red meat farmers at the moment, the store market remains red hot, as does the schedule, which is giving people the jitters as to where the schedule will track in the medium term (with having to pay so much in the current store and weaner market). \n\nThat said, if we go back to the very start, the tariffs and global uncertainty have by default only really ended up being a positive for the New Zealand industry. With exported goods remaining in high demand, it hasn’t even put a chink in the exporters armour, if anything it’s added a Kevlar vest to it, and the future certainly in the midterm looks bright for the sector. As for the speed bump in machinery sales, luckily most of them have suspension nowadays and like all resilient rural folk, the rural businesses which support them are equally as battle hardened.","summary":"As we head towards the midpoint of the year with Gypsy Day just around the corner, there is plenty to reflect on, writes Jaiden Drought.\n\n\nThe post Ag machinery sales a game of two halves appeared first on Farmers Weekly.","url":"https://www.farmersweekly.co.nz/opinion/ag-machinery-sales-a-game-of-two-halves/","image":"https://www.farmersweekly.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/harvester-e1748217197880.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:53:40","author":"Guest writer,Jaiden Drought","authors":["Guest writer","Jaiden Drought"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"nz","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":324826926,"title":"Why King Charles III's trip to Canada is more than just a royal visit","text":"BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph assesses the significance and symbolism of King Charles' trip to Canada where he will open the parliament in Ottawa - following in the footsteps of his mother Queen Elizabeth who carried out the same duty in 1957.\n\nIt's also an important trip for Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, who has dealt with tariff whiplash and talks of annexation from US President Donald Trump. \n\nCarney will be hoping the King's visit strengthens ties with the UK and shows off his country's sovereignty.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx2exnnvm1jo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7309/live/74b74950-380b-11f0-8947-7d6241f9fce9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:53:15","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.671},{"id":324826918,"title":"Winemakers finding Trump's tariffs hard to swallow","text":"Perhaps their representatives will be more forthcoming?

Definitely,\" he tells me. \"They are the biggest in volume and the biggest in value.\"\n\nAnd, until Donald Trump's re-election, the US market was booming. While French wines and spirits global exports fell 4% last year overall, sales of Burgundy wines to the US rose sharply.\n\nIn volume terms, there were up 16% from 2024, to 20.9 million bottles. This was worth €370m ($415m; £312m) in revenues, 26.2% higher than in 2023.\n\nMr Labet says the US accounted for about a quarter of Burgundy's wine exports last year.\n\nBurgundy's reputation abroad is mainly for its red wines, which are made from the celebrated pinot noir grape. Indeed, in the English-speaking world, burgundy is not so much a wine as a colour.\n\nThe French word for the same colour is bordeaux; showing they know more about their wine, because while Bordeaux wines are mostly red, two-thirds of Burgundy is actually white.\n\nThese are predominantly made from the chardonnay grape. Chablis, one of the best-known examples, is extremely popular in the US.\n\nBurgundy also produces an increasingly successful sparkling wine, called Crémant de Bourgogne, and a small amount of rosé.\n\nAll of which is good for Burgundy because while general red wine consumption just keeps going down, white is holding firm, and sparkling is going up.\n\nAlso, the reds that come out of Burgundy are, according to Mr Labet, the kind consumers increasingly want, as they are typically lighter than New World reds.\n\n\"What is interesting to see is that there is a strong de-consumption of what we call the big reds, made in the US. Wines with a lot of alcohol, aged in new wood.\"\n\nLess sun and lower temperatures in Burgundy, even with climate change, means less sugar in the grapes and lower alcohol content.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgr5kgxr8eo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/438d/live/a6fcbd00-3581-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:53:15","author":"John Laurenson","authors":["John Laurenson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.231},{"id":324827390,"title":"Trump delays 50 percent tariff threat to European Union until July 9","text":"President Donald Trump has delayed imposing 50 percent tariffs on the European Union, pushing the deadline from June 1 to July 9. \n\nOn Friday, Trump said he was recommending a “straight 50% tariff” on the EU starting June 1.

It occurred two days after the US president announced his intention to impose 50 percent tariffs on EU imports starting June 1, citing unsatisfactory negotiations with Brussels as the reason.\n\nThat represented a big escalation in the simmering transatlantic trade war, and startled European negotiators. Trump had paused his initial imposition of 20 per cent tariffs against the EU in April to begin a 90-day negotiation that was set to end on July 9.\n\n“Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively. To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9,” von der Leyen said in a post on social media, after what she described as a “good call” with Trump. Her office confirmed she had initiated the contact.\n\nThe statement suggested a possible shift in the commission’s stance towards finding a compromise. On Friday, von der Leyen’s chief trade negotiator Maroš Šefčovič called for “mutual respect, not threats” and said Brussels would “defend our interests” in response to Trump’s escalation.\n\nAfter Trump had threatened to impose the 50 per cent tariffs, later on Friday Treasury secretary Scott Bessent had said on Fox News: “I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU.”\n\nA White House official said they were frustrated the EU had not engaged like other countries. “We just haven’t seen anything material come out of the EU,” said a White House official.\n\nStephen Moore, an outside economic adviser to Trump, said that von der Leyen’s statement is “a promising sign” that the EU is “ready to negotiate”.\n\n“It may not be as rapidly as Trump would like to see, but I think this is a peace offering,” Moore told the FT.\n\nOfficials on both sides have acknowledged the lack of progress in the EU-US talks, as negotiators stick to long-held positions. Trump has attacked the EU for what he alleges are unfair trade practices, while EU officials say the US refuses to take into account its huge services surplus with the bloc.\n\n“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Friday. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50 per cent.”\n\nIn case Trump follows through on his threat, the EU has prepared a €21bn package of tariffs on US items such as maize, wheat, motorcycles and clothing, and is also discussing an additional list worth €95bn of other targets including Boeing aircraft, cars and bourbon whiskey.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the White House Watch newsletter for free Donald Trump has consented&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Postpones 50% EU Tariff Decision to July 9 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/donald-trump-postpones-50-eu-tariff-decision-to-july-9/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-delays-imposing-50-tariffs-on-EU-until-July.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:48:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":324826596,"title":"Spain hosts European and Arab nations to discuss Israel-Palestine two-state solution","text":"Spain hosted European and Arab countries for high-level talks in Madrid on Sunday, in an effort to pressure Israel to stop its military offensive in Gaza and move forward with a two-state solution.“The only interest that all of us who are gathered here today... is to stop this unjust, cruel, inhumane war by Israel in Gaza, to break the blockade of humanitarian aid and to move definitively towards a two-state solution,\" Spain's Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, told media ahead of the meeting of 20 countries.

A report from Golf Support in 2018 found that golf leads to more recreational injuries than sports like rugby or hockey.\n\nThe report uses data from a 2016 paper published by the National Health Statistics Report that analyzed over eight million injuries suffered in sports.\n\nIt was found that golf - along with tennis, badminton, and bowling, had a rate of 1.8 injuries sustained per every 1,000 people.\n\nWhile it was behind general exercise (5.3 per 1,000), basketball (3.3), and American football (3.1), golf was ahead of baseball (1.6), rugby and hockey (1.5) and even combat sports (1.2).\n\nMoreover, the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that up to 40.9 percent of amateur golfers suffer from an injury on an annual basis. The most commonly occurring injuries were lower back ailments.\n\nIt's not clear how many of those injuries were caused by wildlife. However, some pro golfers have had notable examples of injuries caused by critters in the past.\n\nIn 2013, Swedish women's golfer Daniela Holmqvist was bitten by a redback spider while competing in Australia. She was bit on the ankle and used a golf tee to puncture the swelling in order to squeeze the venom out.\n\nA year prior in China, English golfer Melissa Reid was bitten by a venomous snake and needed to take a course of 20 different pills and received an injection to lessen the venom's impact. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump reminds followers of the dangers of golf with hilarious Truth Social post\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Donald Trump reminded everyone that golf can be a dangerous game with a recent image shared to social media showing a man being attacked by wildlife on the course.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-14748759/donald-trump-truth-social-golf.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/26/00/98744275-0-image-a-12_1748216223964.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:43:10","author":"Editor,Jake Fenner","authors":["Editor","Jake Fenner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.099},{"id":324832638,"title":"Trump says he'll delay 50% tariff on the EU","text":"President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he agreed to extend the deadline for a 50% tariff on the EU from June 1 until July 9.\"I received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union,\" he said on his Truth Social platform. \"I agreed to the extension — July 9, 2025 — It was my privilege to do so.\"\"The Commission President said that talks will begin rapidly,\" he added.Earlier on Sunday, Von der Leyen said on X that she had a \"good call\" with Trump.\"The EU and US share the world's most consequential and close trade relationship.

It also launched an asset-purchase program that involved buying trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, intended to keep longer-term interest rates low.\n\n\"With little warning, economies around the world came to a hard stop,\" Powell said, referring to the pandemic. “The possibility of a long, severe, global depression was staring us in the face. Everyone turned to the government, and to the Federal Reserve in particular as a key first responder.\"\n\nPowell also singled out longtime government employees for praise: “Career civil servants at the Fed who are veterans of previous crises stepped forward and said, ‘We got this,’” he said.\n\nTrump has subjected Powell to a stream of attacks for several months because the Fed has kept its key rate unchanged this year, after cutting it three times at the end of 2024. Trump has said there is “no inflation” so the Fed should reduce borrowing costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Powell a “fool” for not cutting rates and last week called the Fed chair “Too Late Powell.”\n\nPowell has not responded to Trump's attacks, which has previously won him support among Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn his Sunday speech, he defended American universities, which have come under sharp attacks from the Trump administration as research grants and other funding have been cut for several Ivy League universities, including Princeton.\n\n“Our great universities are the envy of the world and a crucial national asset,\" Powell said. \"Look around you. I urge you to take none of this for granted.”\n\nLate last month, Warsh, who served as one of the Fed's governors from 2006 to 2011, slammed the central bank for letting inflation spike to its highest level in four decades in 2022. Warsh is considered a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May 2026.\n\n“Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope,” Warsh said in a speech on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund's spring meetings. “More debt is accumulated ... more institutional lines are crossed and the Fed is compelled to act even more aggressively the next time.\"\n\nThe Fed does not issue debt, but Warsh and other Fed critics argue that its purchase of Treasury bonds enabled to federal government to borrow and spend more.\n\nPowell has acknowledged that the Fed could have moved quicker to raise interest rates once inflation began to rise in 2021. Still, on Sunday, he defended the Fed's pandemic record.\n\n“Through the joint efforts of many, we avoided the worst outcomes,” Powell said. “It is hard to imagine the pressure people face at a time like that.

Pengenaan tarif sebagai alat tekanan ekonomi dilihat sebagai bentuk paksaan menjejaskan banyak negara sama, termasuk Malaysia dan rantau ASEAN.\n\n Justeru, Malaysia dan ASEAN sebagai negara perdagangan terbuka, tidak boleh berdiam diri terhadap perkembangan ini. Ini kerana pendekatan unilateral seperti pengenaan tarif tanpa rundingan atau persetujuan bersama, amat bertentangan dengan semangat kerjasama antarabangsa yang menjadi asas kepada sistem perdagangan global hari ini. Ia mencetuskan ketidaktentuan, menyekat aliran dagangan bebas dan akhirnya melemahkan ekonomi negara yang bergantung kepada eksport serta pelaburan asing.\n\n Dalam konteks ini, ASEAN mesti segera memperkukuh suara kolektifnya dan menolak segala bentuk dominasi perdagangan berasaskan tekanan atau tindakan sebelah pihak yang cenderung kepada satu bentuk penindasan.\n\n Ketika ini berlangsung Sidang Kemuncak ASEAN, maka inilah peluang strategik untuk Malaysia, di bawah pimpinan Perdana Menteri, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim memacu pendirian serantau tegas dan berprinsip. Pendirian Malaysia seperti ditegaskan Anwar betapa negara ini berpegang kepada prinsip keterangkuman ekonomi, keadilan global dan solidariti serantau, selari dengan aspirasi ASEAN sebagai satu komuniti yang mendukung prinsip perdagangan terbuka, telus dan saling menyokong, bukan saling menindas.\n\n Maka, Malaysia sebagai Pengerusi ASEAN 2025 dan tuan rumah sidang kemuncak kali ini, perlu tampil sebagai pemimpin menyatukan pendirian ASEAN. ASEAN harus bersuara lantang menolak tindakan pemaksaan tarif timbal balas sepihak ini dan pada masa sama memperjuangkan reformasi sistem perdagangan dunia lebih adil kepada negara membangun.\n\n Zaman kini bukan lagi era perlindungan ekonomi yang membelenggu, tetapi era saling kebergantungan. Rangkaian bekalan global menjadi teras kepada pertumbuhan ekonomi banyak negara, termasuk negara ASEAN. Pengenaan tarif secara unilateral bukan sahaja tidak produktif, tetapi turut membahayakan integrasi ekonomi yang dibina selama beberapa dekad.\n\n Sidang Kemuncak ASEAN kali ini perlu menzahirkan pendirian bahawa rantau ini mesti memainkan peranan sebagai 'blok ketiga' dalam ekosistem perdagangan global, menjadi jambatan antara kuasa besar, sambil mempertahankan hak dan kepentingan negara kecil ekonomi.\n\n Hari ini, dunia memerlukan lebih banyak ruang untuk rundingan, persefahaman dan perkongsian pintar sebagai negara bersaudara, bukan dominasi kuasa besar dengan menggunakan tarif sebagai senjata ekonomi. Dalam dunia semakin kompleks, keupayaan negara seperti Malaysia mempertahankan kedaulatan ekonominya bergantung kepada keberanian untuk bersuara dan kebijaksanaan membina pakatan dengan negara lain.\n\n Maka, wadah ASEAN harus dimanfaatkan sebaiknya untuk menolak sebarang tindakan unilateral yang bersifat memaksa dan menindas negara lain.","summary":"PERANG tarif dicetuskan Presiden Donald Trump bertujuan mengimbangi defisit perdagangan besar antara Amerika Syarikat (AS) dengan negara lain, khasnya China ternyata ‘memporak-peranda’ ekonomi global.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2025/05/1400453/malaysia-asean-ada-peranan-penting-tentang-tindakan-unilateral","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/perangta_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1748215775.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:29:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.166},{"id":324828022,"title":"Trump Plans to Postpone a 50% European Union Tariff Threat Until July","text":"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the U.S. will postpone the implementation of a 50% tariff on European Union goods from June 1 to July 9.

This is the biggest spending cut ... in more than 30 years. We’re going to cut over $1.5 trillion in spending, and it’s a big leap forward.”\n\nCentral to the package is the GOP’s commitment to extend some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks implemented during Trump’s first term in 2017, while temporarily adding new ones that he campaigned on during his 2024 campaign, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car loan interest, and others.\n\nTrump has urged action, visiting House Republicans at a conference meeting last week and hosting GOP leaders and the holdouts for a lengthy session on May 21 at the White House. Before the vote, the administration warned in a pointed statement that failure to pass it “would be the ultimate betrayal.”\n\nAfter the legislation’s passage, Trump posted on social media: “Thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now, it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work.”\n\nJohnson noted on May 25 that some of the cuts may not be as deep as some had wanted.\n\n“Now, is it enough? Of course, not,” he told Fox News. “But we have a very delicate balance, and we have to start the process. I liken this to an aircraft carrier. You don’t turn an aircraft carrier on a dime.

They came a day after one of the heaviest assaults on the capital Kyiv in months.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reacted late on Sunday by telling reporters: “I’m not happy with what Putin is doing. He’s killing a lot of people.”\n\nUkraine’s Air Force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 298 drones and 69 cruise and ballistic missiles.\n\nThe air force said it had shot down 45 cruise missiles and destroyed 266 UAVs, with most regions in Ukraine affected and hits recorded in 22 locations. Rescuers were working in more than 30 cities and villages,Zelensky said.\n\nDespite mounting international calls, Russia has continued to intensify its aerial campaign, showing no sign of halting its offensive and ignoring calls for a ceasefire.\n\nIn a pointed message to Trump – who has previously claimed that Putin is interested in ending the war – Zelensky said: “The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays.\n\n“This cannot be ignored. America’s silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin.”\n\nZelensky warned that Russia’s “brutality cannot be stopped” without “strong pressure on the Russian leadership.”\n\nTrump’s first comments on the latest strikes came hours later at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey, as he was preparing to return to Washington.\n\n“I’m not happy with Putin. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?” Trump said.\n\nHe declined to give any details about what his response would be.\n\nUntil then, the only reaction to the Russian barrage from senior US officials came from Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on X, he published a photo purportedly showing smoke billowing in the night sky over the Ukrainian capital after the Russian attacks.\n\n“This is Kyiv. The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now,” Kellogg wrote.\n\nThe 1977 protocols are amendments to the Geneva Convention, which sets out internationally agreed rules of conduct in war.\n\nOf the people killed, three in the Zhytomyr region to the west of Kyiv were children – all siblings, according to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa. In a statement on X, she identified them as eight-year-old Stanislav, Tamara, 12, and Roman, 17.\n\nWhen Zelensky refers to “American silence”, he likely means the further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow for its continued invasion.\n\nHis argument is that Russia’s war machine is not being starved sufficiently, and that the Kremlin is not being incentivised enough to meaningfully engage in ceasefire talks.\n\nTrump has said he wants to use more of a carrot than stick when it comes to convincing Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, but, aside from direct Ukraine-Russia talks and further prisoner of war exchanges, there has been little to no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer, despite the US president’s growing impatience.\n\nDespite Kyiv’s European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or “walk away” if progress does not follow.\n\nWith Moscow’s continued, maximalist demands for peace, Putin deciding not to show up at recent ceasefire negotiations in Turkey, and 48 hours of heavy aerial bombardments for Ukraine, it is hard to see what the Kremlin would have to do in order for the White House to adopt a tougher stance.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said it had inflicted damage on targets including military airfields, ammunition depots and electric warfare stations, claiming damage across 142 areas.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, 13 regions were attacked, with more than 60 people injured, 80 residential buildings damaged, and 27 fires recorded.\n\nKlymenko called it a “combined, ruthless strike aimed at civilians”.\n\nTwo women, aged 85 and 56, were killed after a house in Kupiansk was hit, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region.\n\nIn the Kyiv region, four people were killed and 16 injured, including three children, DSNS said.\n\nPutin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThis includes Crimea – Ukraine’s southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nRussia’s previous largest drone attack came just a week ago when 273 drones were launched on the central Kyiv region and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east, according to Ukraine’s air force.\n\nRussia is able not only to just manufacture drones at a faster rate, but they are also evolving. Shahed drones are now being packed with more explosives and improved technology to evade detection.\n\nUkraine said the 13 regions hit by strikes on Sunday were Kyiv and the capital’s wider region, as well as the regions of Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy and Poltava.\n\nIn Kyiv, local officials reported 11 injuries, multiple fires and damage to residential buildings, including a dormitory.\n\nA BBC colleague messaged to say a block of flats was destroyed, just a five minute drive from where she lived.\n\nThe strikes came as the capital marked its annual Kyiv Day holiday.\n\nIn Russia, the defence ministry said 110 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and intercepted over 12 Russian regions and the Crimea peninsula between midnight and 07:00 local time (05:00 BST).\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that 12 drones heading towards the capital were shot down.\n\nHe added that emergency services crews were deployed to assess damage caused by falling drone debris.\n\nIn the Tula region, just south of Moscow, drone wreckage crashed in the courtyard of a residential building, smashing windows in a number of apartments, local governor Dmitriy Milyaev said.\n\nNo-one was injured, he added.\n\nSunday was also the third and final day of a major prisoner of war exchange between the two sides. After this weekend, there is even less hope it will lead to further co-operation.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.\n\nOn Saturday, Zelensky announced that another 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia each confirmed 303 of their soldiers had returned home – bringing the total over the three days to 1,000 prisoners each.\n\nThe swap followed the first face-to-face talks between the two sides in three years, which took place in Turkey.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump said he believed the call had gone “very well”, and added that Russia and Ukraine will “immediately start” negotiations toward a ceasefire and “an end to the war”.\n\nHowever, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a “memorandum” on a “possible future peace”, and has not accepted a 30-day ceasefire.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"Ukraine&#8217;s President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the US&#8217;s &#8220;silence&#8221; after recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow&#8217;s largest aerial attack yet.

country.\n\nThe broadband program itself was a key component of the $US1 trillion infrastructure law pushed through by the administration of former Democratic president Joe Biden.\n\nThe Digital Equity Act was intended to fill gaps and cover unmet needs that surfaced during the massive broadband rollout.\n\nIt also gave states and tribes flexibility to deliver high-speed internet access to families that could not afford it, computers to kids who did not have them, telehealth access to older adults in rural areas, and training and job skills to veterans.\n\nWhether Mr Trump has the legal authority to end the program remains unknown, but for now the Republican administration can simply stop spending the money.\n\n\"I just felt my heart break for what we were finally, finally in this country, going to address, the digital divide,\" said Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.\n\nThat alliance is a non-profit that was awarded — but has not received — a $US25.7 million grant to work with groups across the country to help provide access to technology. \n\n\"The digital divide is not just physical access to the internet, it is being able to use that to do what you need to do,\" Ms Siefer said.\n\nDigital act falls victim to Trump's war on diversity and equity\n\nWhile the name of the program likely got it targeted amid the Trump administration's aggressive scrubbing of government programs that promote diversity, equity or inclusion, the Digital Equity Act was supposed to be broader in scope.\n\nThough Mr Trump called it racist, the words \"race\" or \"racial\" appear just twice in the law's text: once, alongside \"color, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or disability\", in a passage stating that no groups should be excluded from funding, and later, in a list of covered populations, along with older adults, veterans, people with disabilities, English learners, people with low literacy levels and rural Americans.\n\n\"Digital Equity passed with overwhelming bipartisan support,\" Democratic senator Patty Murray of Washington — the act's chief proponent — said in a statement. \n\n\"That's because my Republican colleagues have heard the same stories as I have — like kids in rural communities forced to drive to McDonalds parking lots for wi-fi to do their homework.\n\nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which administers the program, declined to comment. \n\nIt is not entirely clear how much of the $US2.75 billion has been awarded, though last March the NTIA announced the allocation of $US811 million to states, territories and tribes.\n\nFears Trump didn't look at program's scope before planning funding cut\n\nMore than one-fifth of Americans do not have broadband internet access at home, according to the Pew Research Center. \n\nIn rural communities, the number jumps to 27 per cent.\n\nBeyond giving people access to technology and fast internet, many programs funded by the Digital Equity Act sought to provide \"digital navigators\" — human helpers to guide people new to the online world.\n\n\"In the United States we do not have a consistent source of funding to help individuals get online, understand how to be safe online and how to use that technology to accomplish all the things that are required now as part of life that are online,\" Ms Siefer said.\n\nThis includes everything from providing families with internet hotspots so they can get online at home to helping seniors avoid online scams.\n\n\"Health, workforce, education, jobs, everything, right?\" Ms Siefer said. \n\n\"This law was going to be the start for the US to figure out this issue. It's a new issue in the big scheme of things, because now technology is no longer a nice-to-have. \n\nMs Siefer said the word \"equity\" in the name probably prompted Mr Trump to target the program for elimination.\n\n\"It means that he didn't actually look at what this program does,\" she said. \n\n\"Because who doesn't want grandma to be safe online? Who doesn't want a veteran to be able to talk to their doctor rather than get in a car and drive two hours? Who doesn't want students to be able to do their homework?\"","summary":"Donald Trump reveals plans to end the United States's Digital Equity Act, which provides funding to programs that assist people to live in an increasingly online world.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-26/donald-trump-calls-us-digital-equity-act-racist-and-illegal/105335780","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/386c2894ba4e6f5eff5641aebd585577?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:12:09","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":324827810,"title":"Trump says he is ‘very surprised’ Putin has ramped up attacks on Ukraine","text":"Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that was “very surprised” that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, has intensified the bombardment of Ukrainian cities despite the US president’s efforts to broker a ceasefire.\n\n“I’m not happy with what Putin is doing.

They came a day after one of the heaviest assaults on the capital Kyiv in months.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reacted late on Sunday by telling reporters: \"I'm not happy with what Putin is doing. He's killing a lot of people.\"\n\nUkraine's Air Force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 298 drones and 69 cruise and ballistic missiles.\n\nThe air force said it had shot down 45 cruise missiles and destroyed 266 UAVs, with most regions in Ukraine affected and hits recorded in 22 locations. Rescuers were working in more than 30 cities and villages,Zelensky said.\n\nDespite mounting international calls, Russia has continued to intensify its aerial campaign, showing no sign of halting its offensive and ignoring calls for a ceasefire.\n\nIn a pointed message to Trump - who has previously claimed that Putin is interested in ending the war - Zelensky said: \"The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays.\n\n\"This cannot be ignored. America's silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin.\"\n\nZelensky warned that Russia's \"brutality cannot be stopped\" without \"strong pressure on the Russian leadership.\"\n\nTrump's first comments on the latest strikes came hours later at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey, as he was preparing to return to Washington.\n\n\"I'm not happy with Putin. I don't know what's wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?\" Trump said.\n\nHe declined to give any details about what his response would be.\n\nUntil then, the only reaction to the Russian barrage from senior US officials came from Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on X, he published a photo purportedly showing smoke billowing in the night sky over the Ukrainian capital after the Russian attacks.\n\n\"This is Kyiv. The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now,\" Kellogg wrote.\n\nThe 1977 protocols are amendments to the Geneva Convention, which sets out internationally agreed rules of conduct in war.\n\nOf the people killed, three in the Zhytomyr region to the west of Kyiv were children - all siblings, according to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa. In a statement on X, she identified them as eight-year-old Stanislav, Tamara, 12, and Roman, 17.\n\nWhen Zelensky refers to \"American silence\", he likely means the further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow for its continued invasion.\n\nHis argument is that Russia's war machine is not being starved sufficiently, and that the Kremlin is not being incentivised enough to meaningfully engage in ceasefire talks.\n\nTrump has said he wants to use more of a carrot than stick when it comes to convincing Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, but, aside from direct Ukraine-Russia talks and further prisoner of war exchanges, there has been little to no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer, despite the US president's growing impatience.\n\nDespite Kyiv's European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or \"walk away\" if progress does not follow.\n\nWith Moscow's continued, maximalist demands for peace, Putin deciding not to show up at recent ceasefire negotiations in Turkey, and 48 hours of heavy aerial bombardments for Ukraine, it is hard to see what the Kremlin would have to do in order for the White House to adopt a tougher stance.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said it had inflicted damage on targets including military airfields, ammunition depots and electric warfare stations, claiming damage across 142 areas.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, 13 regions were attacked, with more than 60 people injured, 80 residential buildings damaged, and 27 fires recorded.\n\nKlymenko called it a \"combined, ruthless strike aimed at civilians\".\n\nTwo women, aged 85 and 56, were killed after a house in Kupiansk was hit, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region.\n\nIn the Kyiv region, four people were killed and 16 injured, including three children, DSNS said.\n\nPutin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThis includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.\n\nRussia's previous largest drone attack came just a week ago when 273 drones were launched on the central Kyiv region and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east, according to Ukraine's air force.\n\nRussia is able not only to just manufacture drones at a faster rate, but they are also evolving. Shahed drones are now being packed with more explosives and improved technology to evade detection.\n\nUkraine said the 13 regions hit by strikes on Sunday were Kyiv and the capital's wider region, as well as the regions of Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy and Poltava.\n\nIn Kyiv, local officials reported 11 injuries, multiple fires and damage to residential buildings, including a dormitory.\n\nA BBC colleague messaged to say a block of flats was destroyed, just a five minute drive from where she lived.\n\nThe strikes came as the capital marked its annual Kyiv Day holiday.\n\nIn Russia, the defence ministry said 110 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and intercepted over 12 Russian regions and the Crimea peninsula between midnight and 07:00 local time (05:00 BST).\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that 12 drones heading towards the capital were shot down.\n\nHe added that emergency services crews were deployed to assess damage caused by falling drone debris.\n\nIn the Tula region, just south of Moscow, drone wreckage crashed in the courtyard of a residential building, smashing windows in a number of apartments, local governor Dmitriy Milyaev said.\n\nNo-one was injured, he added.\n\nSunday was also the third and final day of a major prisoner of war exchange between the two sides. After this weekend, there is even less hope it will lead to further co-operation.\n\nOn Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.\n\nOn Saturday, Zelensky announced that another 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia each confirmed 303 of their soldiers had returned home - bringing the total over the three days to 1,000 prisoners each.\n\nThe swap followed the first face-to-face talks between the two sides in three years, which took place in Turkey.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal.\n\nTrump said he believed the call had gone \"very well\", and added that Russia and Ukraine will \"immediately start\" negotiations toward a ceasefire and \"an end to the war\".\n\nHowever, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a \"memorandum\" on a \"possible future peace\", and has not accepted a 30-day ceasefire.","summary":"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the US's \"silence\" after recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial attack yet.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/zelensky-says-us-silence-over-russian-attacks-encourages-putin/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1246.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-25 23:07:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 07pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 07pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.641}]}
