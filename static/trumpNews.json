{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":18454,"news":[{"id":310282720,"title":"‘Yoon Again’: calls for ousted South Korean president’s return as political rift deepens","text":"Hundreds of supporters lined the streets near South Korea’s presidential residence on Friday evening, chanting “Yoon Again” and waving South Korean and American flags as former president Yoon Suk-yeol and first lady Kim Keon-hee departed following his impeachment a week earlier.\n“Fraudulent impeachment! Null and void!” the crowd shouted, as Yoon hugged younger supporters, shook hands and exited the grounds shortly after 5pm local time. He waved to the crowd and raised a clenched fist before leaving.\nThe couple returned to their private home in southern Seoul, exactly one week after the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld Yoon’s impeachment over his attempt to impose martial law in December – a move it ruled unconstitutional and based on unsubstantiated claims of election interference by China and North Korea.\nYet for Yoon’s core supporters – many of them older, deeply conservative and staunchly anti-communist – the ruling only deepened mistrust towards the judiciary, the opposition and even members of his own People Power Party.\n\nSeventy-year-old retiree Moon Keun-chan echoed a common refrain: that Yoon’s downfall was not just a political misstep, but also a setback in the country’s battle against communism.\n“The court and the opposition have been bought out by the Chinese and North Koreans,” Moon said.\n“I’m so sad the era of Yoon has ended. But I hope he keeps fighting from outside the government, so our country doesn’t fall into the hands of the communists.”\nSuch views have taken hold among Yoon’s base, even after the court dismissed his claims as legally baseless and unsupported by evidence.\nMany protesters wore caps bearing the slogan “Stop the Steal”, echoing rhetoric popularised by supporters of US President Donald Trump. One man accused opposition leader Lee Jae-myung of being a “communist spy”, while others alleged the 2024 legislative elections were rigged to favour the Democratic Party.\n“These conspiracy theories are all over YouTube, and they give people something simple to hold onto,” said Lee Sang-kyung, assistant professor of sociology at Sogang University. “Confirmation bias is at play here. As people watch videos that reinforce their views, it strengthens undemocratic and authoritarian thinking.”\nThe academic noted that much of Yoon’s continued support was driven less by belief in specific conspiracies and more by entrenched partisanship.\n“Actually, most of Yoon’s supporters probably don’t believe the theories literally,” he said. “But South Korean society is so polarised that people will back any claim that furthers their political bloc.”\n\nA recent Korea Gallup poll showed that while more than 60 per cent of South Koreans supported the impeachment, 74 per cent of conservative voters opposed it – a sharper partisan divide than during the 2017 impeachment of then president Park Geun-hye. Back then, only about 50 per cent of conservatives objected to her removal.\n“Despite the martial law crisis being a much larger violation of the constitution, more people are divided along party lines today,” said Lee of Sogang University. “That shows how much more polarised Korean society has become in the past decade.”\nBehind the scenes, far-right religious groups have played an outsize role in organising pro-Yoon rallies. The Sarang Jeil Church – a fundamentalist Christian congregation led by controversial pastor Jun Kwang-hoon – and its affiliate Liberal Unification Party have been key drivers of past demonstrations. Loudspeakers blasted slogans, hymns and denunciations of judges and opposition figures alike, while the events were broadcast live on YouTube.\n“These far-right churches have always existed on the fringes of South Korean politics, but they’ve never been this close to the mainstream,” Lee said. “They were brought into the limelight by some conservative politicians for their own political gains.”\nAccording to Lee, this alliance between mainstream politicians and extremist religious groups has dangerously blurred the lines between politics and radicalism.\n“When elites give these movements legitimacy, they gain real power. There were even claims that Yoon himself watched some of these far-right YouTube channels,” he said.\n\nStill, Lee cautioned against drawing direct parallels with far-right movements in the West.\n“The far-right in South Korea isn’t built on race or immigration like in the US or Europe,” he said. “Because of that, I think Korea’s polarisation is less dangerous – and may be easier to resolve in the long term. The cultural divides are less entrenched.”\nBut for now, with the presidential election looming and emotions still raw, the country remains politically fragile.\n“The divide could get worse in the future,” Lee said. “In order to resolve this crisis, the liberals and moderate conservatives need to come together to sanction and shame the far-right – ultimately eliminating them and bridging the gap.”\nMeanwhile, Yoon and his wife received flowers from supporters as they arrived at their personal home.\nYoon thanked his supporters in a statement released shortly after leaving the presidential residence.\n“In the past winter, many of our citizens and our youth protected the residence with the single thought of safeguarding our sovereignty and freedom. I keep that burning passion that melted the winter’s cold deep in my heart,” the ousted president said.\n“I will return to being a regular citizen of South Korea and search for a new road to work for our country and its people.”","summary":"Yoon Suk-yeol’s downfall seen among his supporters as not just a political misstep, but also a setback in country’s battle against communism.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3306236/yoon-again-calls-ousted-south-korean-presidents-return-political-rift-deepens","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/11/4d83aa79-b7f5-4274-8291-e3c5ba04f536_9ac9b0fa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 01:00:19","author":"Lee Seung-ku","authors":["Lee Seung-ku"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":310284210,"title":"Celebrity Big Brother star Angellica Bell breaks down in tears as she marks incredible career milestone away from loved ones","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Apr 12th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSleeping on the job: New NHS boss Sir Jim Mackey tells MPs at 11.53am he'll 'pick up the pace' of reform - then at 3.23pm falls asleep watching Netflix hit The Diplomat in a first-class train carriage to his home 300 miles away\n\nRevealed: Disputes that came before mother was arrested for theft after she confiscated her children's OWN iPads\n\nPrince Harry claims his police protection was taken away to 'trap' him and Meghan Markle in the Royal Family as he says his 'worst fears have been confirmed' by secret evidence from court case\n\nInside the new WAR between Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman: Player's camp hit back over her money-spinning project that will tell most salacious secrets of their affair, writes KATIE HIND\n\nWhen I saw the school loner on the news after my sister vanished, I gasped.

Are you slipping into Islamophobia? Because you're going to have trouble. It's getting dangerous.'\n\nCelebrity Big Brother found itself engulfed in a race row after Trisha Goddard accused fellow housemate Michael Fabricant of 'Islamaphobia' during Friday's show\n\nThe TV host, 67, was quick to slam the former Tory PM, 47, after he was made to give a political speech as part of the show's first shopping task\nHowever Michael hit back saying: 'I'm trying to explain this country has benefited from wave upon wave of immigration'.\nThe tense exchange left viewers divided while some agreed with Trisha, others were quick to call her out and branded her words 'uncalled for'.\nTaking to X they wrote: 'Trisha wasn't wrong for that it's very obvious he was using Islamaphobic talking points': 'Michael was absolutely alluding to Islam. Glad Trisha clocked him': 'I normally respect Trisha but there was no need for the Islam comment. It wasn't needed, he mentioned immigrants in general not one specific group of people. Over the top': \n'What was Trisha saying there? He wasn't talking about Islam. First time I've not liked her this season'.\n'The very fact that Trisha assumed Michael was talking about Islam when he said you should assimilate unto your host country shows her own prejudice, not his': '100% agree he never mention Islam. Don't understand how Trisha jumped to that conclusion': 'F****** Hell Trisha …. It wasn’t even remotely Islamophobic'.\nLater in the show viewers were left fuming after Michael became the first star of the series to be evicted from the house.\nThe politician had been forced to face the public vote alongside Mickey Rourke, 72, and Jack P. Shepherd, 37, after receiving the most nominations from fellow housemates.\nAfter the result was announced the politician said his farewells before exiting along with his beloved teddy bear to a mix of boos and cheers and was met by hosts AJ Odudu, 37, and Will Best, 40.\n\nWhen Chesney Hawkes, 53, asked his opinion on the tense topic of immigration Michael said: 'Do not come to this country if your aim is to change everybody to your way of thinking'\n\nTrisha exclaimed: 'Hang on! Are you slipping into Islamophobia? Because you're going to have trouble. It's getting dangerous'\n\nThe tense exchange left viewers divided while some agreed with Trisha, others were quick to call her out and branded her words 'uncalled for'\nHowever those watching slammed the result, branding the controversial Mickey a 'homophobe' after he left lesbian dancer JoJo, 21, in tears after he insinuated he would be able to 'make her straight' during their time in the house and branded her a 'f*g'. \nThey also concluded Corrie actor Jack was 'boring' and said Michael had been evicted way too soon from the house. \nTaking to X fans fumed: 'So they kept a homophone... nice great': 'NOOO NOT MICHAEL': 'I have never sided with a tory in my life but... if we're talking purely about providing entertainment - it should have been Jack that was evicted': 'Would rather a Tory than a homophobic in the house'.\n'Aww poor Michael sad to see him go actually': 'I guess being a Tory is worse than being homophobic': 'Michael was hilarious, now Jack will continue to never speak and Mickey will continue to insult everyone'.\nEarlier in the show fans have hit out at Mickey after his blunt comment left EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer in tears.\nThe housemates were gathered around the kitchen table enjoying lunch prepared by the actress, 52, when the actor criticised her cooking.\n\nLater in the show viewers were left fuming after Michael became the first star of the series to be evicted from the house \n\nHe had been forced to face the public vote alongside Mickey Rourke (L) and Jack P. Shepherd (R) after receiving the most nominations from fellow housemates.\n\nHowever those watching slammed the result, branding the controversial Mickey a 'homophobe' and claiming Corrie star Jack was 'boring'\nHe swiped: 'What do you know, you can't cook.'\nWhile she initially laughed it off, Patsy soon headed to the diary room to let off some steam to Big Brother.\n\n Celebrity Big Brother fans slam Mickey Rourke for harsh comment as Patsy Palmer breaks down into tears \n'Sorry,' she said before breaking down into tears. 'I tried to talk that one out but it didn't really work. I feel like I let myself down there and I don't want my reactions to be like that.\n'I always want my kids to always stand up for themselves. Maybe it was just a joke - maybe I need to look at it like that.' \n'I need to try to rise above it. It doesn't mean I have to like him,' she added.\nFans have taken to X, formerly Twitter, and slammed Mickey for his harsh words. \nThey said: 'Mickey picking on yet another woman, patsy is an icon, he needs booted out #CBBUK; 'How dare Mickey Rourke make our British Institution and icon Patsy Palmer cry; 'Feel sorry for Patsy criticising someone's cooking that you barely know is cruel. #CBBUK; 'Mickey did not need to make a horrible comment about Patsy's cooking infront of everyone! #CBBUK;\n'How dare you hurt our Patsy Mickey.

Ukraine could be divided up 'almost like Berlin after World War Two' under terms of peace deal","text":"Ukraine could be divided 'almost like Berlin after World War Two' as part of a peace deal, President Trump's envoy to the country has said.\n\nGeneral Keith Kellogg suggested Western troops could adopt zones of control as part of a 'reassurance force', while the Russians would occupy the east.\n\nUkrainian forces would then hold an 18-mile wide demilitarised zone between them.\n\nGeneral Kellogg, the key US figure in ending the three-year conflict, confirmed there would be no American forces on the ground, unlike the formation of Germany after 1945.\n\nHe told The Times that British and French-led troops occupying west of the Dnipro river – which cuts Ukraine in half north to south and could act as a demarcation line – would 'not be provocative at all' to the Kremlin.\n\n'You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone and a British zone,' he added.\n\nHis comments came as the Kremlin last night dismissed a key meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's peace envoy – in an apparent sign Russia is not interested in a Ukraine ceasefire.\n\nPutin's spokesman said the talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff, which lasted more than four hours, were 'not momentous' and there would be no concessions.\n\nRussia's hardball stance appeared to infuriate the US President who subsequently posted on the Truth Social platform a demand that Putin 'gets moving' over a peace deal to prevent further deaths.\n\nRussia has already rejected an American-backed proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.\n\nIt comes as Ukraine's allies pledged a record 21 billion euros (£18.2 billion) of military aid for the country, with the UK Defence Secretary warning that 2025 was 'the critical year' for the war.\n\nThe support announced on Friday includes a £450 million package from Britain and Norway to fund radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs and hundreds of thousands of drones for Kyiv.\n\nWitkoff travelled to Russia again on Friday to press the Kremlin to accept a truce but in Brussels there appeared to be little confidence that a pause in hostilities would come.\n\nGerman defence minister Boris Pistorius said 'ongoing aggression' from Russia meant 'we must concede that peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future'.","summary":"General Keith Kellogg suggested Western troops could adopt zones of control as part of a 'reassurance force', while

All!'","text":"When it comes to live television, you must be ready for anything, including having a pigeon land on your head.\n\n That was the task Fox News' Peter Doocy faced live on air on Friday, April 11. The network's White House correspondent was reporting the latest on President Donald Trump's tariff plans for Fox and Friends.\n\n As Doocy finished his report and his feed was made smaller on screen so Fox and Friends hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Lawrence Jones and Brian Kilmeade could wrap up the segment, a pigeon landed on Doocy's head.\n\n After quickly ducking his head, the pigeon flew away and out of the camera's sight as Doocy exclaimed, \"A bird just landed on my head!” \n\n Soon after, however, the pigeon came back and flew in a circle around a startled Doocy, causing him to duck his head once more.\n\n His fellow correspondents appeared to smile and laugh as Doocy finally came up to face the camera again.\n\n Holding a pen with one hand and using the other to shoo off the bird, Doocy smiled and said, \"I did not like that at all.\"\n\n \"Your head is standing up now. What’s going on?\" said Kilmeade before Jones jokingly chimed in, saying, \"I mean, you got good hair.\"\n\n “That’s probably so... dirty,” said Doocy. \"That had to be scary,\" said Earhardt as Jones agreed, \"that is probably so dirty.\"\n\n \"Did he say dirty or scary?\" asked Earhardt, causing Doocy to say, \"Hey! President Trump, if you're watching upstairs, we've got to do something about these birds. Where's the [National] Park Service? They are always out here sweeping the street and blowing [the leaves] except when the birds are landing on my head.\"\n\n The segment ended with Kilmeade telling Doocy he hoped the bird didn't have the flu.\n\n \"Can we get the shampoo guy down here?\" Doocy jokingly said in response.\n\n The incident occurred the same day press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that a mouse had been spotted in the briefing room, per the New York Post. Her briefing ended in roughly 21 minutes afterwards.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n “There was a mouse in the briefing room earlier today, so I’m hoping someone checked in on [it] so it doesn’t run out here and distract me! That would be a good way for all of you to distract me, actually,\" Leavitt said per the outlet.","summary":"The incident occured as the White House correspondent was wrapping up his live report on Friday, April 11","url":"https://people.com/pigeon-attacks-fox-news-correspondent-pete-doocy-during-white-house-live-report-11714001","image":"https://people.com/thmb/tWTtPRChbdhydEtoeAeOVhC-KxQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(744x430:746x432)/Pigeon-Attacks-Peter-Doocy-Fox-News-Correspondent-041125-tout-27861c932ebe4379bfd33a5b7583ecef.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 00:40:58","author":"Ingrid Vasquez","authors":["Ingrid Vasquez"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":310283118,"title":"US says we can stop Iran’s oil exports","text":"ABU DHABI: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Friday that the United States could stop Iran’s oil exports as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to pressure Tehran over its nuclear programme.\n\nThe January return to the White House of Trump, who in his first term withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran and clamped down on its oil exports, has again brought a tougher approach to the Middle Eastern power over its nuclear work.\n\nWright, speaking to Reuters on a visit to Abu Dhabi, said he thought the Gulf allies of the United States were extremely concerned about a nuclear-powered Iran and shared the US resolve that this is an outcome that is in no one’s best interest.\n\nIranian oil exports recovered under Joe Biden, who became president after Trump’s first term, and so far in 2025 have yet to show a decline, according to industry data.\n\nChina, which opposes unilateral sanctions, buys the bulk of Iran’s shipments. “That’s actually very doable. President Trump actually did it in the first term,” Wright said when asked how the United States can enforce its maximum pressure policy on Tehran.\n\n“We can follow the ships leaving Iran. We know where they go. We can stop Iran’s export of oil.” Asked if the US would directly stop Iranian ships at sea, he said, “I’m not going to talk about the specific methodology of how that’s going to happen. But can we turn the screws on Iran? 100%.”\n\nIran said on Friday that it was giving high-level nuclear talks with the United States on Saturday “a genuine chance” after Trump threatened bombing if discussions failed.\n\nAsked if military action against Iran would lead to regime change, he said he would not talk specifics but “everything is on the table.” “In the short run, because of the strength of American energy production and our relations with our allies, we’re going to tighten the sanctions and tighten the ability for Iran to export oil. You start economic, you start with negotiations, we hope that’s enough.\n\nBut the end of the day is, no nuclear armed Iran.“ OIL PRICES Wright also predicted that there would be a positive outlook for oil demand and supply in the next few years under Trump’s policies, and the concern of markets about economic growth will be proven wrong. Comfortable oil price levels are “not meaningfully different from where we are today,” he said.","summary":"ABU DHABI: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Friday that the United States could stop Iran’s oil exports as part of President Donald Trump’s plan to pressure Tehran over its nuclear programme.\n\n\nThe January return to the White House of Trump, who in his first term withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran and clamped down on its oil exports, has again brought a tougher approach to the Middle Eastern power over its nuclear work.\n\n\nWright, speaking to Reuters on a visit to Abu Dhabi, said he thought the Gulf allies of the United States were extremely concerned about a nuclear-powered Iran and shared the US resolve that this is an outcome that is in no one’s best interest.\n\n\nIranian oil exports recovered under Joe Biden, who became president after Trump’s first term, and so far in 2025 have yet to show a decline, according to industry data.\n\n\nChina, which opposes unilateral sanctions, buys the bulk of Iran’s shipments. “That’s actually very doable.

Seemed credible because Jo Ellis wrote an article calling out Trump’s trans military ban only a few days ago. I disagree with Jo’s views but glad he is still alive.' \n\n'My life was turned upside-down at that point. Forever on, I'm known as 'that trans terrorist,'' Ellis told The New York Times. \n\n'I believe in free speech, but I also believe in consequences to free speech. If you can stir up a mob because you say something that's not true, that's your right. But once the mob comes after someone, you've got to have some consequences.' \n\nEllis - who is being represented by the pro-LGBTQ Equality Legal Action Fund - promised to donate any money she receives should she win to the families of the victims of the crash. \n\nShe said that she faced death threats and harassment and was forced to publicly post a 'proof of life' video on Facebook.\n\nThe rumors a transgender woman had been part of the crash also allegedly influenced Donald Trump when he signed an executive order banning trans people from the military. \n\nEllis, who previously worked for CNN star Michael Smerconish, told DailyMail.com at the time of the crash the slurs are 'disrespectful to the families' of the 67 people killed in Wednesday night's disaster.\n\nPresident Trump suggested diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies were to blame, with some online 'sleuths' subsequently singling out Jo Ellis.\n\nA blog written by Ellis said she had spent her childhood homeschooled for most of her education, and had struggled with gender dysmorphia since the age of five.\n\nShe joined the military in 2009 as a 15G helicopter mechanic in the Virginia National Guard, and went on to deploy to Iraq with Operation New Dawn two years later.\n\nAfter earning the Air Medal for her valor in the Middle East, she also served in Guatemala and Kuwait in subsequent years.\n\nWhile saying she worked through gender dysmorphia by trying to become ‘more successful and more manly’, she got married, adopted a dog and raised a stepdaughter, as ‘all the things I thought a good man should do.’\n\nEllis wrote that in 2020, she was ‘accepted into the Army’s Warrant Officer Flight Training program. I completed Warrant Officer Candidate School, SERE School (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape), and the UH60 Black Hawk helicopter course.’\n\nShe said that the pandemic and the rigors of flight school led her to confront her gender dysphoria and decide, with the support of her spouse, to transition.\n\nShe said when she told her military commanders in 2023, she was met with immediate support. \n\nThe day before the tragic collision over Reagan International Airport, Ellis had given an interview with Sirius XM DJ and CNN host Michael Smerconish, whose Smerconish.com website she once managed.\n\nEllis spoke of her pride in serving 15 years in the military and struggle with gender dysmorphia before coming out.\n\nShe said in the interview she currently serves in the National Guard as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot, as well as working a private sector IT job. \n\nThe helicopter is said to have flown at a higher than normal altitude when it collided with American Eagle flight 5342 as it came into land at Reagan National Airport in Washington DC shortly before 9pm ET Wednesday night. \n\nHorrifying video footage showed the two aircraft collide in a fireball before plunging into the icy Potomac River just east of Reagan's runways. \n\nThe three soldiers aboard the Black Hawk were all killed, as were the 60 passengers and four crew aboard the Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft.\n\nFootage of the Black Hawk crashing into the side of the plane has also sparked speculation the chopper was to blame.\n\nRobert Isoms, CEO of American Eagle's parent company American Airlines, questioned why the chopper had crossed the path of the airliner.","summary":"A transgender Black Hawk pilot wrongly named as one of the three US Army personnel flying the helicopter that collided with a plane in Washington DC is suing a right-wing commentator.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14601097/transgender-military-pilot-dc-plane-crash-jo-ellis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/12/00/97156543-0-image-a-11_1744415765744.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 00:39:16","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

It was the imperial couple's first-ever journey to the island, which is located 1,250 kilometers south of Tokyo.\n\nTOKYO - The number of holidaymakers traveling domestically in Japan and abroad in the upcoming Golden Week holiday period starting late April is expected to drop 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 23.45 million due largely to rising living costs, according to a major travel agency.\n\nAlthough traveler numbers increased in recent years after the coronavirus pandemic, there is also a growing trend of holidaymakers opting to avoid crowds and taking their vacations outside Golden Week, which falls between April 26 and May 6 this year, JTB Corp. said.\n\nOSAKA - Seven-Eleven Japan Co. will open two convenience stores at the World Exposition in Osaka starting Sunday to showcase what it expects its outlets to look like in 2030, featuring service by remotely controlled avatar robots and floors that generate power when stepped on.\n\nThe stores at the expo venue on the artificial island of Yumeshima will sell made-to-order Japanese confectionaries such as fish-shaped \"taiyaki\" waffles and sweet \"dango\" rice cakes in addition to the usual items including drinks and rice balls.\n\nJapan PM Ishiba to talk with labor union chief Monday over wages\n\nTOKYO - Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is scheduled to hold talks with the head of Japan's biggest labor union umbrella group on Monday, as he has pledged to take measures to achieve wage hikes at smaller companies and in regional areas.\n\nThe planned face-to-face meeting, announced by the government on Friday, would be the first between a prime minister and a leader of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation in 16 years, with the last held under then Prime Minister Taro Aso, a year after the global financial crisis.\n\nJapan PM to meet stateless Japanese descendants in Philippine visit\n\nTOKYO - Japan is arranging a meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and descendants of Japanese nationals left behind in the Philippines after World War II during a planned visit to the Southeast Asian country, government sources said Friday, in a show of support for such stateless people.\n\nIshiba is expected to meet several of the Japanese descendants in Manila to advance support for those seeking Japanese nationality during the 80th anniversary year of the war's end.\n\n96% of people say prices up from year ago, record high in BOJ survey\n\nTOKYO - A record high 96.1 percent of respondents in a Bank of Japan survey released Friday answered that current prices have risen compared with a year ago, as inflation has prompted households to tighten their purse strings.\n\nThe highest figure since comparable data became available in September 2006 comes as inflation has been accelerating for years due largely to a spike in energy and raw material costs with the yen's depreciation driving up import prices.\n\nVideo: The 2025 World Exposition's Grand Ring in Osaka is lit up on the eve of the event's opening day","summary":"TOKYO - \n Photo taken from a Kyodo News helicopter shows the 2025 World Exposition's Grand Ring in Osaka on ...","url":"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/04/5f9eebf74963-kyodo-news-digest-april-12-2025--1-.html","image":"https://img.kyodonews.net/english/public/images/posts/b98181b5e10ba43089dacdb3d2eb165a/cropped_image_l.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 00:36:32","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":310284336,"title":"How Bryson DeChambeau's YouTube channel has benefitted him at the Masters","text":"Bryson DeChambeau was a little skeptical when he first agreed to his own YouTube golf channel. Too intrusive? Too much work, he wondered? He didn't realize at the time it would help him rediscover his love for the game — and help his mental toughness, too. In his series of unscripted videos, the two-time U.S Open winner tries to break 50 playing with different celebrities like Tom Brady, John Daly and Tony Romo on the channel. He attempts to do the same with some cheaper versions of golf clubs purchased on discount websites likes Amazon and Temu. He's even attempted to break course records at places around the country he has never played before. \"YouTube golf has made me feel like a kid again,\" DeChambeau said Friday at Augusta National. DeChambeau seems to be more relaxed these days, and enters the weekend in the hunt for his first Masters title at 7-under 137 after 36 holes. He has gone to great lengths to change his image and brand, and the channel has helped boost his fanbase amid his move to Saudi-backed LIV golf. \"When I started out, I was like, man, this is going to be a lot of work,\" DeChambeau said. \"And once we started putting in challenges that were fun and interesting and different, it kind of made me feel like I was that, you know, 11-, 12-year-old going out with your friends and just trying to play as good as you can and do something crazy and different.\" DeChambeau's channel is a little crazy and different — and well-received. It has more than 1.82 million subscribers. While DeChambeau is shown laughing and hamming it up with friends like Matthew Stafford and even President Donald Trump, he also believes the inherent challenge of trying to break a certain score or course record has strengthened his mindset in competitive events. The mindset is simple: There is a goal out there and he has to hit it. \"As a kid, you get another club if your hand, OK, maybe it's not perfect but you have to figure out a way to get it done,\" DeChambeau said. The 31-year-old DeChambeau got it done Friday. [RELATED: LIV Golf at The Masters 2025: Bryson DeChambeau shines in second round] After his tee shot on the par-3 fourth hole landed in the bunker on the left side of green — causing him to let out an \"oh golly\" on the tee box — he regathered himself and holed a difficult chip from the sand. That birdie led to another on the difficult fifth hole, where he striped his drive 369 yards down the middle of the fairway. He added another birdie on the eighth and made the turn at 4-under 32. His only bogey came on the par-3 16th hole, but he bounced back with a birdie on 17 and finished with back-to-back rounds in the 60s (69-68) at the Masters for the first time in nine years. A year ago, DeChambeau opened the Masters with a 65 to take the 18-hole lead. He failed to break par the rest of the week, shooting 73-75-73 and finished tied for sixth place. This year, he has spent more time working on putts longer than 50 and 60 feet and practiced well into the night Thursday at Augusta National on his iron game. He's plenty confident his win last year at the U.S. Open at Pinehurst will help prepare him for the challenges that remain ahead this weekend. He said the experiences gained from his golf channel won't hurt, either. \"When I am doing the course record series, it's focusing my brain up to the maximum extent,\" DeChambeau said. \"So it's not like it's costing me a lot of energy and I'm not gaining much out of it. I'm actually focusing myself and saying, hey, you're on camera, you have to execute. There's nothing else you can do besides play your absolute best.\" Reporting by The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, the tax on Chinese imports to the United States was raised to over 125 per cent – adding to the earlier US tariffs that were already in place.\nFor Southeast Asia, the temporary pause on Washington’s “reciprocal” levies offers some limited breathing room, but the threat of economic upheaval still looms over the region. Observers expect a frantic scramble to secure US trade negotiations in the coming weeks and months.\nWhile markets across Asia rallied in response to Wednesday’s brief tariff reprieve, analysts warned that the storm was far from over. For members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the choice appears stark: negotiate with Washington individually, or diversify their economies – a strategy that could push them further into China’s economic orbit.\n\nMalaysia, as Asean chair, called last weekend for “a united regional front” against Trump’s tariff onslaught – but this collective response is unlikely to go much beyond a joint statement, according to Alexander Vuving, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies in Hawaii.\n“Asean doesn’t have enough purchasing power to offer what Trump wants,” he told This Week in Asia, namely “a trade balance or even a trade surplus for the US”.\nVuving said that Trump’s threatened tariffs, starting at the baseline rate of 10 per cent for nations such as Singapore and climbing to as high as 49 per cent for Cambodia, were designed to pit countries against one another and “discriminate”.\nFollowing a meeting of Asean economic ministers in Malaysia on Thursday, the bloc said in a joint statement that it would not retaliate against US tariffs and was committed to “frank and constructive dialogue” with Washington over trade concerns.\nThe three-month tariff pause “will allow countries to plan better, to find new markets for their products”, said economist Jayant Menon, a visiting senior fellow with the regional economic studies programme at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\nThe biggest loser out of this whole saga will be US consumers\nJayant Menon, economist\nStill, “the biggest loser out of this whole saga will be US consumers”, he said.\nIf fully imposed, Trump’s tariff regime promises to “dramatically change the playing field” for trade in Southeast Asia, according to Vuving.\nSingapore, the Philippines and Malaysia stood to gain a “huge competitive edge”, he said, at the expense of Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.\n“Vietnam is clearly one of the biggest losers now,” Vuving said. “While Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia have a significant chance to emerge as some of the biggest winners in the region.”\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pledged in a video address late last Sunday to lead a region-wide response to US tariffs that would “maintain open and resilient supply chains, and ensure Asean’s collective voice is heard clearly and firmly on the international stage”.\n\nBut the bloc’s ability to present a united front remains open to debate. “Asean’s response as a whole may be moot from the outset,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science and international relations at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University.\nAsean member states are largely export-dependent, with some heavily reliant on the US market while others like Brunei, Laos and Myanmar are “rather insignificant to Trump’s trade posture” due to the small size of their economies, according to Pongsudhirak.\nLast year, the bloc exported goods worth US$227.7 billion more to the US than it imported, an 11.6 per cent year-on-year increase in its trade surplus, according to data from the US Trade Representative.\nEven Singapore, which has a free-trade agreement in place and runs a trade deficit with the US – meaning it imports more than it exports – was not spared the baseline tariff of 10 per cent. Vietnam, meanwhile, has sought to take matters into its own hands, opening direct negotiations with Washington.\nTrump hinted at a preliminary agreement with Vietnam to remove its 46 per cent tariff – conditional on it slashing levies on US goods to zero – following a call with Vietnamese Communist Party chief To Lam earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc then rushed to Washington this week for further high-level talks on a deal.\n“It’s every Asean economy on its own dealing with the Trump tariff fury,” Pongsudhirak said.\nA catalyst for change?\nSince the US dropped its tariff bombshell, as many as 70 countries worldwide have reached out to negotiate, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n“The fact that countries are eager to strike a deal and give concessions to Trump has, in many ways, given Trump what he and his administration wanted,” Dylan Loh, assistant professor of foreign policy at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, told This Week in Asia.\nAsean could, in theory, be a stronger actor if it was united, but a “strong, coherent, and collective response” was unlikely, Loh said – and further undermined by countries trying to quickly strike individual deals with the US.\nAs it stands, each of the bloc’s economies has a different degree of exposure to the threatened tariffs. Indonesia, for instance, exports more commodities to the US, while the Philippines’ service-oriented economy faces different vulnerabilities.\nMalaysia, meanwhile, said it planned to send a delegation to the US by the end of the month to negotiate. But Anwar, in remarks on Tuesday, acknowledged the uphill battle ahead. “There may be limited room to revisit the underlying intent,” he said at an investment conference in Kuala Lumpur. “But there is still scope for adjusting the policy’s implementation.”\n\nSome observers see the “external shock” of tariffs as a potential catalyst for deeper economic integration within Asean. Indeed, Anwar has already held discussions with various other Asean leaders on tariffs, including Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\nPongsudhirak argued that now would be an ideal time for the Asean Economic Community – a decades-old initiative to create a single market and strengthen economic development – to be revitalised and for the bloc to “double down” on agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).\n“Those not in the CPTPP should also try to join,” he added, referring to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes several Asean member states.\nBut Prem Singh Gill, a visiting scholar at the Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta’s faculty of law, warned that Asean’s attempts to cobble together a response might be little more than “an illusion of solidarity that history suggests will crumble at the first serious pressure point”.\n\nAny “choreographed display of regional coordination” risked repeating Asean’s “ineffectual posturing during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when lofty rhetoric about regional solutions quickly gave way to every-nation-for-itself pragmatism and humiliating IMF interventions”, he said.\nThe 1997 crisis exposed structural vulnerabilities – rooted in growth policies that encouraged investment but created high levels of debt – forcing a US$40 billion intervention by the International Monetary Fund to stabilise the currencies of hard-hit regional economies.\nNearly three decades later, those vulnerabilities “remain fundamentally unchanged”, Gill said.\nSatisfying US demands\nSome developing Southeast Asian nations are reluctant to relinquish protective measures designed to shield their local industries, according to Oh Ei Sun, principal adviser of the Pacific Research Centre think tank in Malaysia.\nThis had created a stumbling block when trying to satisfy Washington’s “exacting demands” for reducing not just tariffs on American goods but also non-tariff barriers, he said. Non-tariff barriers – ranging from import bans to quotas – restrict trade without the use of levies and are a particular sticking point for the US.\nCrafting an Asean-wide response would require “acrobatic wisdom”, Oh said, as it would need to simultaneously address the expectations of the Trump administration and the domestic priorities of individual member states.\nHowever, even a “largely symbolic” collective response from Asean could hold value, said Joanne Lin Weiling, a senior fellow and co-coordinator at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s Asean Studies Centre. Such a gesture would demonstrate the bloc’s “solidarity and shared concern over growing protectionism and economic nationalism”, she told This Week in Asia.\n\n“Asean’s approach isn’t about negotiating tariff levels collectively, but about reaffirming shared principles such as support for free and open trade, multilateralism and regional integration,” Lin said.\n“A joint Asean statement would serve more as a signal of unity and values, rather than a vehicle for hard bargaining,” she said, adding that without a region-wide free trade agreement with the US, Asean lacked the institutional framework to negotiate as a unified bloc.\nThe Trump administration’s preference for bilateral agreements over multilateral ones further complicates the situation. The US president’s “transactional diplomacy” leaves individual Asean members to strike their own deals with Washington, according to Lin.\nVietnam, Thailand and Cambodia have already begun engaging directly with the US to negotiate sector-specific concessions. Yet this outreach by Vietnam, in particular, was flatly rejected on Tuesday by Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro.\nNavarro criticised Vietnam’s trade practices, claiming that the country’s deficit with the US had “gotten out of control”. He accused Vietnam of “cheating” by relabelling Chinese goods as its own and engaging in other unfair trade practices.\n\nEven if Vietnam’s offer of zero tariffs was ultimately accepted, Pongsudhirak argued it might not be enough to satisfy Washington. The US was more interested in reducing trade deficits than in lowering tariff rates, he said, pointing to the broader demands of Trump’s trade agenda.\n“To appease the US, partner countries will have to look at a package of concessions,” he said. This could include tariff reductions, increased imports of American goods under “buy-American” campaigns and commitments to invest more in the US – a strategy that has already been embraced by some nations such as Japan.\nLin stressed that the responsibility for responding to US demands lay with individual states. Each country had the flexibility to “calibrate its own strategy” in line with its national interests, economic sectors and trade profiles, she said.\n“Asean can provide a common platform for expressing shared concerns and coordination, but how each member responds, whether through negotiation, adjustment or diversification, is a sovereign choice,” Lin said.\n\n‘China’s waiting embrace’\nIf imposed in full, Trump’s tariffs are expected to hasten Southeast Asia’s long-term drift towards China. For nations like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, whose trade with the US is minimal anyway, deepening economic ties with China seems like a natural pivot, analysts say.\n“For more trade-diversified economies like Vietnam and Malaysia, the need to hedge against US unpredictability could accelerate their alignment with China or Asean-led platforms like RCEP,” Lin said.\nHowever, she said the potential benefits these countries could gain from closer trade with China would largely depend on how well their export products align with Chinese market demand.\nFor five consecutive years, China and Asean have been each other’s largest trading partners, with bilateral trade reaching US$953 billion last year.\n\nChina’s expansive investments under the Belt and Road Initiative, massive consumer market and predictable trade policies offered an attractive alternative to the “conditional and punitive” terms being imposed on US market access, Gill said.\n“The painstakingly constructed RCEP agreement provides a ready-made alternative to American market dependence, offering Asean a face-saving retreat from Washington’s trade bullying,” he said. If imposed, “Trump’s tariffs [would] have collectively delivered the entire region into China’s waiting embrace.”\nFor most Southeast Asian nations, hedging between the US and China was already commonplace, Vuving said, under the guiding principle of moving “closer to the one that is nicer to me or gives me more benefits”.\n“If China takes advantage of this situation, which is highly likely, several Southeast Asian countries will move closer to China,” he said.\n\nBy deliberately excluding China from Wednesday’s tariff pause, Washington was trying to isolate Beijing and diminish its appeal in mounting a coordinated regional or global response to the tariffs, Loh said.\nVuving described Trump’s tariff threats as merely the “first moves in a long game” aimed at disrupting “China-centric global supply chains”.\nHe added that no country in Asia had been able to become an “Asian tiger” – a term for economies that have successfully industrialised and escaped the middle-income trap – while under the influence of “China-centric supply chains, except China itself.”\nChina serves as both the world’s manufacturing hub and a key link in international trade. It also dominates supplies of several critical raw minerals, either at the extraction or processing stage, that are essential for industries including clean energy and advanced electronics.\nBut Vuving saw an opportunity in the current upheaval for Southeast Asian nations to reshape global supply chains away from China’s dominance.\n“Now is the time for other countries to shape the new configuration of global supply chains,” he said.","summary":"While Malaysia calls for a united front, the reality is a race for bilateral deals, with Vietnam leading the charge – as China watches on.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3306228/aseans-illusion-solidarity-splinters-amid-trumps-tariff-threats","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/11/b378b54c-43d4-4870-9617-221bf3dacb88_c074fe24.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 00:00:14","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":310282722,"title":"Will Trump’s tariffs lead to an emboldened Beijing in the Taiwan Strait?","text":"The record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could serve as a stress test for its ability to withstand Western economic pressure in the event of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait such as armed conflict, analysts have said.\nBut they also cautioned that any final call to action relating to Taiwan remained a complicated political and military decision for Beijing, which regards the island as part of China, to be reunited by force if necessary.\n“If the current tariff is sustained, and China is able to weather this difficult period, it will definitely boost Beijing’s confidence in facing potential Western sanctions in a future cross-strait war,” said international relations professor Zhiqun Zhu, from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania.\n“Regardless, Beijing has already taken US involvement and sanctions into account when preparing for the Taiwan scenario. The significance of any additional tariffs will be marginal,” he added.\nWashington has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent – close to the punitive amount President Donald Trump previously threatened if Beijing were to attack Taiwan.\nLike most countries, the United States does not regard self-governed Taiwan as an independent state. However, Washington is opposed to any unilateral change to the status quo and is committed to supplying arms for the island’s defence.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal during the election campaign in October, Trump said he would hit Chinese goods with “150 per cent to 200 per cent” tariffs if Beijing chose to attack Taiwan.\n“Anyone in Beijing keen on an attack or blockade of Taiwan in the coming few years may see the trade war as a test to understand what economic hardship the Chinese population is willing to accept,” said Luke Patey from the Danish Institute for International Studies.\n“Less interdependence between the US and China may incentivise Beijing to consider military options more fully against Taiwan,” according to the senior researcher who specialises in economic security and US-China relations.\n\nBeijing has doubled down on its hard line on Taiwan since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party took over the island’s leadership and increased arms purchases from the US.\nWashington has long viewed economic sanctions as a means of deterrence, with the US-led G7 imposing them on Moscow – along with bans on military-related entities and the leadership – as part of its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe Group of Seven would be likely to consider trade and investment restrictions in the context of a major Taiwan crisis, especially on industries linked to mainland China’s defence sectors, according to a joint report by Rhodium Group and the Atlantic Council in 2023.\nAccording to Patey, “it will take some time after the freshly imposed tariffs take effect before trade links fully unravel”. He also said that a deal was likely to be struck between Washington and Beijing.\n“And at the end of the day, rather than economic calculations alone, it is first and foremost a military decision for Beijing to take. Attempting to forcefully control Taiwan is still a huge risk … and Chinese leaders need to carefully assess the consequences,” he said.\n“Any military attack on Taiwan, whether a full scale invasion or a blockade, would severely upset the global economy and particularly undermine China and East Asia’s economic growth.”\n\nSung Wen-ti, a political scientist with the Australian National University (ANU), said the tariffs were “a bigger fish for Beijing to fry at the moment”.\n“Tariffs are existential threats to China’s vitality and will relegate the Taiwan issue to the important but not urgent basket on China’s to-do list,” he said, adding that global economic instability would be disadvantageous to any actions over the island.\nIn a report last year, Bloomberg Economics estimated the cost of a war in the Taiwan Strait at around US$10 trillion – equal to about 10 per cent of global GDP.\nThe model assumed a complete cut in Taiwanese trade, an almost total end to US-China trade, and an 80 per cent fall in commerce for Japan, South Korea and the Asean states, in the event of a Chinese military action that drew US forces into a local conflict.\nAccording to Bucknell University’s Zhu, the status of US-China trade would not be a deciding factor in whether and when Beijing would take action against Taiwan.\nBeijing’s Anti-Secession Law, enacted in 2005, lists three conditions that would justify the use of non-peaceful means against the island, including the Taiwanese authorities formally pursuing secession.\nThe other scenarios which could prompt the use of force under the legislation include “incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China”, or a situation in which “possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted”.\n\nZhou Bo, a senior fellow of the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, was also of the view that the tit-for-tat trade war would have no effect on Beijing’s decision on Taiwan.\nAccording to Zhou, it was “too early” to say whether the tariffs would actually undermine the interdependence of trade between mainland China and the US, while Beijing had “never mentioned a timetable” for reunification with Taiwan.\n“Beijing has never said it must take Taiwan by force. It’s still talking about peaceful reunification at the moment,” he said.\nAccording to the observers, Beijing will continue to watch the interactions between Washington and Taipei, which have included some mixed signals from the Trump administration.\nA leaked recent Pentagon memo placed the security of Taiwan as a priority, while Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has promised “robust, ready and credible deterrence” across the Taiwan Strait.\nBut the relationship between Washington and Taipei has also appeared to be more transactional, with Trump repeatedly calling for Taiwan to pay “protection fees”. He has also threatened Taiwanese chipmaking giant TSMC with taxes of up to 100 per cent if it does not manufacture in the US.\n“The more transactional US support becomes for Taiwan and others, the more opportunity for Beijing to outbid Taiwan for US support or acquiescence,” said Sung from the ANU.","summary":"US involvement and sanctions will already be part of planning for any actions towards Taipei by mainland China, observers say.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3306156/will-trumps-tariffs-lead-emboldened-beijing-taiwan-strait","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/11/cd30c28f-6236-4bc4-923b-0872bd16a3c3_ca8f77c0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-12 00:00:08","author":"Hayley Wong","authors":["Hayley Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.01},{"id":310281424,"title":"Hadapi Tarif Trump di Industri Otomotif, Pemerintah Perlu Tambah Insentif?","text":"GOOTO.COM, Jakarta - Gedung Putih mengeluarkan pengumuman bahwa Donald Trump telah meneken kebijakan tarif timbal balik demi memperkuat posisi ekonomi internasional dan melindungi pekerja domestik di Amerika Serikat.

Tahap pertama, tarif 10 persen untuk semua negara berlaku mulai Sabtu, 5 April 2025 pukul 00.01 waktu AS atau eastern daylight. Sementara itu, tahap kedua, tarif khusus yang diperuntukkan bagi sejumlah negara, termasuk Indonesia, berlaku pada Rabu, 9 April 2025 pukul 11.01 WIB.\n\nDalam menghadapi dampak dari tarif baru ini terhadap industri otomotif, pengamat otomotif dari Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) Yannes Martinus Pasaribu mengatakan pemerintah perlu memberikan insentif tambahan guna memperkuat daya saing industri otomotif nasional.\n\n\"Segera memfokuskan diri pada penguatan daya saing industri otomotif nasional melalui berbagai insentif bagi para pelaku usaha yang mau berkontribusi dalam peningkatan kekuatan R&D yang berdampak pada peningkatan kandungan lokal yang riil, termasuk kompetensi SDM yang lebih kompetitif lagi menuju ke padat teknologi, bukan lagi padat karya seperti sekarang,\" kata Yannes kepada Gooto.\n\nYannes menuturkan pemberian insentif oleh pemerintah juga bisa membantu mengompensasi kenaikkan biaya ekspor akibat tarif, mendorong investasi dalam peningkatan efisiensi produksi dan inovasi teknologi, serta mempercepat pengembangan kendaraan listrik yang memiliki potensi yang besar di pasar regional dan global.\n\n\"Bentuk insentif tentunya beragam, mulai dari keringanan pajak, subsidi untuk riset dan pengembangan, meng-on-kan segera program super tax deduction, hingga dukungan untuk pelatihan tenaga kerja,\" ucap Yannes.\n\nLangkah pemberian insentif tambahan untuk menghadapi tarif Trump sebelumnya sudah direncanakan oleh Pemerintah Korea Selatan. Pemerintah Korsel mengumumkan langkah-langkah dukungan darurat untuk sektor otomotifnya yang bertujuan mengurangi dampak dari pemberlakuan tarif Trump, mengingat Korsel mengalami peningkatan ekspor ke AS selama bertahun-tahun.\n\nLangkah darurat tersebut meliputi dukungan keuangan untuk industri otomotif serta pemotongan pajak dan subsidi untuk meningkatkan permintaan di dalam negeri. Sementara itu, pemerintah juga berjanji berupaya bernegosiasi dengan AS dan membantu memperluas pasar.\n\nSeperti diketahui, Trump mengumumkan tarif sebesar 25 persen untuk mobil dan truk ringan impor. Produsen diperkirakan akan menanggung sebagian biaya tarif pada tahun pertama, tetapi pada akhirnya akan mengubah produksi dan mungkin berhenti mengimpor model bervolume rendah tertentu ke pasar AS.\n\n\"Mengingat proporsi produksi lokal produsen mobil Korea Selatan di Amerika Serikat (yang lebih rendah), industri kami relatif kurang beruntung,\" kata Pemerintah Korsel dalam sebuah pernyataan.\n\nTarif Trump ini diperkirakan akan menyebabkan kerugian yang signifikan bagi produsen mobil dan suku cadang mobil Korea Selatan, meskipun sulit untuk memperkirakan angka saat ini.\n\nDemi mengatasi masalah likuiditas, pemerintah akan meningkatkan dukungan pembiayaan kebijakan untuk industri otomotif menjadi 15 triliun won pada tahun 2025, dari 13 triliun won yang direncanakan sebelumnya.\n\nPemerintah Korsel juga akan menurunkan pajak pembelian mobil menjadi 3,5 persen dari saat ini 5 persen hingga Juni 2025.

The new painting of Trump, 78, shows him raising his fist after a bullet grazed his ear at a rally in Butler, Pa., in July 2024, in an apparent assassination attempt. The swap was announced via the White House's official social media account.\n\n The replacement breaks the White House tradition. It is customary to include portraits of the two most recent presidents that preceded the sitting president in the Grand Foyer in the East Wing, near the entrance of the executive mansion, so state guests and visitors can view them in a prominent location. As former President Joe Biden's portrait is not complete, the two most recent presidential portraits on display were that of Obama, 63, and Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush.\n\n Obama's portrait is now hung across the Grand Foyer, where it had been since 2022. Bush's portrait was prematurely removed and moved to a different location next to the portrait of his late father, former President George H.W. Bush, at a nearby staircase in the mansion, per CNN.\n\n PEOPLE has reached out to a rep for Obama, the White House, and the White House Historical Association for comment. WHHA said that it is a question for the White House, and the White House has not responded. A representative for Obama declined to comment.\n\n The move is reminiscent of Trump's actions in his previous term when he similarly replaced portraits of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Bush in the Grand Foyer. Instead, he opted to showcase former Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama's portraits were painted by Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung, respectively.\n\n The artist behind the painting of Trump has yet to be confirmed. However, the painting is based on photographs of the assassination attempt by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci and New York Times photographer Doug Mills.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n The tradition of the presidential portrait is privately funded by the nonprofit White House Historical Association. The portrait became an organized custom in the 1960s under former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Prior to the 1960s, portraits were either commissioned by Congress or personal friends of the president.","summary":"Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024 during the presidential campaign","url":"https://people.com/white-house-swaps-barack-obama-official-portrait-with-photo-trump-11714138","image":"https://people.com/thmb/PyASBDrFXfsrTlhmfJIxhQ8YSeA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x190:766x192)/Barack-Obama-Portrait-White-House-Donald-Trump-Portrait-White-House-041125-ab75f292d33c4f4f98a3b4105ea2bcf7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:56:46","author":"Madison E.

A large amount of battery materials used for the cars are supplied by Chinese firms. \n\nMr Musk has admitted his company faces a 'significant' impact from the levies and says there should be 'zero tariffs' between the EU and America despite being a US government adviser.\n\nThe company is already struggling to compete with Chinese rivals, including BYD, and there are suggestions that Mr Musk's association with the Trump regime has tarnished the brand.\n\nMr Trump is also facing accusations of insider trading after saying it was a 'great time to buy' shares four hours before the stock market surged when he paused tariffs on Wednesday. \n\nStock markets around the world plunged dramatically on Monday following his imposition of tariffs on worldwide imports. There was further meltdown when he paused nearly all of them except for China for 90 days.\n\nThe S&P 500 stock market index, which tracks the largest companies in the US, soared by more than 9 per cent following the decision by Mr Trump.\n\nIn a video posted on X, Mr Trump said that Charles Schwab, the founder of a multinational financial services firm, had made $2.5billion from the sudden surge in the stock market. He later said: 'That's not bad is it.'\n\nUS Democrats have called for an investigation after claiming he had tipped off his 'billionaire' allies before reversing the policy.\n\nThey say his intervention raised 'grave ethics concerns' and they want an urgent inquiry into whether any of Mr Trump's family or officials benefited.\n\nBut Jordan Belfort, who wrote the memoir The Wolf Of Wall Street which inspired the film of the same name, told Sky News there was 'no way' Mr Trump had manipulated the market.\n\nYesterday White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that more than 75 countries had made contact with the US administration to talk about tariffs and the 'phones have been ringing off the hook to make deals'.\n\nShe added: 'If China continues to retaliate, it's not good for China'.\n\nAsked whether China had backed down by saying it would ignore any further tariff escalations, she said: 'The President made it very clear when the United States is punched, he will punch back harder.'\n\nTesla stunt hammers home the point\n\nHe's a divisive character.

The proportion who think their situation will remain the same is also down, from 34 per cent to 28 per cent.\n\nThe trade war launched by Mr Trump is expected to dampen business activity over coming months, as will Ms Reeves's £25billion National Insurance raid, which came into force at the start of April.\n\nThe Chancellor said the GDP data was 'an encouraging sign' but acknowledged that 'the world has changed' as families and businesses worry about how tariff chaos will affect them.\n\nTory business spokesman Andrew Griffith said: 'Growth figures for February are likely to be a false dawn of business activity before the tsunami of higher employment taxes and costs from the start of April.'\n\nYesterday's figures also revised up GDP for January, but only from minus 0.1 per cent to zero. This was partly driven by a sharp rise in manufacturing. \n\nSeparate ONS figures revealed a £500million increase in goods exports to the US to the highest level since November, 2022.\n\nThe surge in February came before Mr Trump's announcement of huge new tariffs last month. \n\nBut the President had already announced 25 per cent duties on steel and aluminium, and firms would have been anticipating further action.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs.'\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the GDP figures 'appear to have been flattered by a boost from tariff-front running'.\n\nIt comes as fears grow that the global turbulence sparked by Mr Trump will drag the world into recession and damage Britain's already meagre growth prospects.\n\nEarlier this week, Bank of England deputy governor Sarah Breeden warned that tariffs would have a 'chilling effect' on the economy.\n\nYesterday, Goldman Sachs cut its UK growth forecast for this year by 0.3 percentage points to 0.95 per cent.

The city is now staring down a $1.1 billion budget shortfall — and city leaders are scrambling for solutions.\nDespite President Donald Trump’s direct push for Republicans to resolve the issue, lawmakers walked away without passing the critical funding measure.\nCity Leaders Warn of Immediate Consequences\nMayor Muriel Bowser and members of the D.C. Council had been sounding alarms throughout the week, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. “We need that to happen this week,” Bowser said earlier, warning of fast-approaching cuts and layoffs.\nBy Friday, however, the mayor had gone quiet, declining to speak about the next steps for the city.\nJust before Congress recessed, Bowser made a final push online, tagging Speaker Mike Johnson and Trump on social media. She warned that without a solution, D.C. would see cuts to “police overtime, firefighters, and programs for our kids ... The House should not recess until this bill is passed.”\nBowser also reshared Trump’s post from late March in which he told House Republicans to pass the measure and “get it done IMMEDIATELY.”\nFunding Dispute Triggers Budget Shortfall\nThis budget battle dates back to March, when Congress passed a federal funding bill requiring D.C. to revert to its 2024 budget framework — slicing $1.1 billion from a budget that had already been approved.\nBowser launched an aggressive lobbying effort in Congress to stop the rollback. She warned that the loss of funds would lead to widespread cuts, impacting essential services and possibly triggering layoffs of teachers and police officers.\nWhile the Senate passed the bill that included the cuts, it quickly followed with a separate proposal to restore the lost funds. That fix now sits stalled in the House. Even with public backing from both police and firefighter unions — and Trump’s urging — the House failed to even debate the measure.\nUncertainty Looms Over City Services and Staffing\nNo one knows exactly what’s coming next, but city leaders are bracing for serious consequences. Bowser has openly discussed the possibility of staff reductions in the police department and education system.\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said last week there isn’t “a hard and fast deadline” yet, but warned that the budget pressure is intensifying. “A vice that’s closing ... At some point, the dollars are not going to be there and we will have to act.”\nAmong the areas facing immediate risk is overtime spending for public safety.

The investigation followed a public disagreement between Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump at a February meeting of governors.\n\nThe US Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning on March 31 telling the state it needed to comply with the law in 10 business days or face enforcement from the US Justice Department. That deadline arrived Friday, and the Education Department said it referred its investigation to the Justice Department for further enforcement.\n\nMaine and the federal government are at impasse, as the state will not sign a resolution proposed by the Trump administration to resolve the disagreement by banning the transgender athletes, said Maine assistant attorney general Sarah Forster in a letter to the Education Department.\n\n“Nothing in Title IX or its implementing regulations prohibits schools from allowing transgender girls and women to participate on girls’ and women’s sports teams,” Forster’s letter stated. “Your letters to date do not cite a single case that so holds.”\n\nTrump has said the state risks losing federal funding if it does not come into compliance. Friday, the Education Department said it was also taking steps toward the termination of Maine’s education funding.\n\n“The Department has given Maine every opportunity to come into compliance with Title IX, but the state’s leaders have stubbornly refused to do so, choosing instead to prioritize an extremist ideological agenda over their students’ safety, privacy, and dignity,” said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights. “The Maine Department of Education will now have to defend its discriminatory practices before a Department administrative law judge and in a federal court against the Justice Department.”\n\nFederal funding is critical to Maine schools. Maine got $358 million in federal funding for K-12 schools in 2021-22, or 10% of its budget, according to data from the Census. About 13% of that money went to Title I, 14% to special education and 20% to child nutrition programs such as school lunches. Title I provides supplemental financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families.\n\nAlmost half of federal funds were simply marked as “other,” which likely points to the substantial COVID-19 relief funds schools got that year. Prior to the pandemic, Maine got 6% of its funding from federal sources, almost $185 million in 2018-19.\n\nThe issue of school funding and transgender participation in sports in Maine began to bubble up when Mills and Trump sparred over the subject during the February meeting at the White House. During the meeting, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports.\n\nMills responded: “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nSoon after, the Education Department and the US Department of Health and Human Services launched investigations into the state.\n\nHealth and Human Services officials said in March that the Maine Department of Education, Maine Principals’ Association and a high school are each in violation of Title IX because of the participation of transgender athletes. The Health Department has already referred the issue to the Justice Department for enforcement in court.\n\nThe principals’ association and school district both said they would not comply with a proposed agreement to ban the athletes.\n\nMaine Republicans, who are in the minority in both houses of the Legislature, have put pressure on state Democrats to resolve the investigations. House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, speaking during a news conference, said Mills has created a “hostage situation” that jeopardizes federal funding.\n\n“The governor, and her administration, is holding Maine schools and Maine education under hostage,” Faulkingham said. “This standoff is not going to end well for the state of Maine and its education funding.”\n\nLGBTQ+ rights groups in Maine have defended the state’s approach. “We’re not giving in, and we’re not giving up on our trans community,” EqualityMaine said in a social media post.\n\nFederal authorities have also said they are investigating Maine due to claims school districts in the state violate federal law by withholding information about students’ gender transitioning from parents.","summary":"Maine officials said Friday the state will not comply with a ban on transgender athletes in high school sports in the wake of a Trump administration finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing the students to participate.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/us-news/justice-department-tasked-with-enforcing-trumps-transgender-sports-ban-in-maine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-06ew7u3m4-1744413531952.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744399163&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/f3BzgUws-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:47:18","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":310283614,"title":"Years of distrust hang over U.S. and Iran as negotiators head to Oman","text":"Officials from the U.S. and Iran were set to meet Saturday in Oman for the highest-level talks on the Islamic Republic’s advancing nuclear program since 2022, a sign of Tehran’s eagerness for sanctions relief and to avoid the crippling military attack that President Donald Trump has threatened.Each side’s distrust of the other runs deep, even complicating the path to having their emissaries sit down together.

Last year, it delivered about 850 Passover meals. FREE Chicago normally delivers 600 Kosher meals each week to Jewish and non-Jewish people in need.\n\nNotik did not specify how much Passover expenses have risen since last year. But in general, the costs of food, supplies and labor “have gone up tremendously,” because of high inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough egg prices spiked in March, each of FREE Chicago’s Passover meals will feature a hard-boiled egg — part of the traditional Passover ritual feast. Eggs symbolize the beginning of life and sacrifice, according to Chabad.\n\nEgg prices in the U.S. jumped to a record-high of $6.23 per dozen last month, up from $5.90 in February, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. In February, consumers in some places in the country were paying more than $12 a dozen at stores. \n\nThe holiday meals made at FREE Chicago’s kitchens in Rogers Park will also feature other traditional Passover foods such as matzoh, gefilte fish and horseradish.\n\n“We don’t want anyone to feel like they are missing anything because of external factors,” Notik said.\n\nPlanning for the Passover Seders began months ago and so were not directly affected by President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. FREE Chicago ordered matzoh from Ukraine, Israel and New York City. Wine, grape juice and gefilte fish comes from Brooklyn. FREE Chicago makes its own horseradish.\n\nBut recent U.S. policies have sparked extreme volatility in financial markets that have hurt donations to FREE Chicago. Friday capped a chaotic and historic week in global stock markets.\n\nLess funding adds to the financial pressure of serving FREE Chicago’s communal and delivered Passover meals that together cost about $35,000 this year. Notik could not compare costs of last year’s Passover dinners because the number of recipients varied.\n\nDonors and foundations are driven by financial markets, he said. “We’re taking a big hit,” Notik said.\n\nBut in spite of general anxiety and financial turmoil, FREE Chicago wants everyone to “feel the royalty of Passover,” Notik said. “We’re trying hard not to cut back. We’re trying not to tell anyone no.”\n\nPassover guests and food bank beneficiaries “need hope and encouragement. Being optimistic and upbeat is a game-changer for them.” Notik added, “We trust and pray to God.”\n\nFREE Chicago ramped up its food bank meals in 2020, during the pandemic. Since then, it has served thousands through its free weekly meal deliveries in Chicago and the suburbs. The majority of recipients are Jewish, but all are in need. “If anyone is calling the food bank, they’re really stuck,” Notik said.\n\nPeople might be having difficulty finding jobs, struggling with the cost of making their own Passover Seders or face other factors, he said. Uncertainty related to tariffs might add to their anxiety.\n\n“I don’t know if it’s hitting their bank already, but it’s just a feeling. Uncertainty is never good for anybody,” Notik said.\n\nContributing: AP","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/04/11/rogers-park-synagogue-free-passover-seder-meals","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09c06d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x4000+0+227/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2Fa2%2Fb2069d1c48bea760e34821e3443e%2Fpass","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:43:12","author":"Amy Yee","authors":["Amy Yee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":310280666,"title":"Trump defends policy after China hits US with 125% tariffs","text":"President Donald Trump insisted Friday that his tariff policy was \"doing really well\" despite China hiking levies on US goods to 125 percent in the spiraling trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nInvestors dumped US government bonds, the dollar tumbled and stocks seesawed after Beijing's retaliation against Trump deepened concerns on already traumatized global markets.\n\nTrump sent financial markets into a tailspin by announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of trade partners last week, only to abruptly roll them back to 10 percent on Wednesday for 90 days -- while raising levies on goods from China.\n\n\"We are doing really well on our tariff policy,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network after China announced its latest hike.\n\n\"Very exciting for America, and the World!!!

(AP) — A ruling in Louisiana determined that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University grad student, could face expulsion from the U.S. as a national security threat. This decision emerged from a hearing regarding the possible deportation of Khalil, noted for his role in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nImmigration Judge Jamee E. Comans concluded that the government’s argument of Khalil’s presence potentially leading to “serious foreign policy consequences” fulfilled the conditions necessary for his removal.\n\nComans said the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.”\n\nLawyers for Khalil said they plan to keep fighting. The judge gave them until April 23 to seek a waiver.\n\nThe defense’s next steps\n\nFollowing the hearing, Khalil’s lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, informed a federal court in New Jersey about plans to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals once the final written decision is made by the immigration judge. Additionally, pursuing an asylum claim on Khalil’s behalf is also an option for the legal team.\n\n“So nothing is going to happen quickly in the immigration proceeding even though she’s found him removable on the foreign policy grounds,” he said.\n\ndressing the judge at the end of the immigration hearing, Khalil mentioned that she said at a hearing earlier in the week that “there’s nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.”\n\n“Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” he added.\n\nVan Der Hout, also criticized the hearing’s fairness.\n\n“Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,” Van Der Hout said in a statement.\n\nLawyers challenge Khalil’s detention and potential deportation\n\nKhalil, a legal U.S. resident, was detained by federal immigration agents March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment, the first arrest under President Donald Trump’s promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza.\n\nWithin a day, he was flown across the country and taken to an immigration detention center in Jena, thousands of miles from his attorneys and wife, a U.S. citizen who is due to give birth soon.\n\nKhalil’s lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to crack down on free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify Khalil’s deportation, which gives him power to deport those who pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”\n\nAt Friday’s hearing, Van Der Hout told the judge that the government’s submissions to the court prove the attempt to deport his client “has nothing to do with foreign policy” and said the government is trying to deport him for activity that is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nThey said an immigration judge could determine if Khalil is subject to deportation and then conduct a bail hearing afterward if it is found that he is not.\n\nThe protests that led to Khalil’s arrest\n\nKhalil isn’t accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. The government, however, has said noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled from the country for expressing views that the administration considers to be antisemitic and “pro-Hamas,” referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nKhalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring to protest Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe university brought police in to dismantle the encampment after a small group of protesters seized an administration building. Khalil is not accused of participating in the building occupation and wasn’t among the people arrested in connection with the demonstrations.\n\nBut images of his maskless face at protests, along with his willingness to share his name with reporters, have made him an object of scorn among those who saw the protesters and their demands as antisemitic.

The decision was delivered during a hearing in Jena, Louisiana, where the government argued that Khalil's presence in the country could lead to “potentially serious foreign policy consequences.”\nImmigration Judge Jamee E. Comans sided with the government, stating it had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.” The ruling comes in response to Khalil’s participation in pro-Palestinian protests on his university campus.\nKhalil’s Legal Team Pushes Back\nDespite the judge’s ruling, Khalil’s lawyers say they are not giving up. They have until April 23 to request a waiver and plan to appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. In a separate court session in New Jersey, attorney Marc Van Der Hout informed a federal judge of their intent to pursue an asylum case as well.\n“So nothing is going to happen quickly in the immigration proceeding even though she’s found him removable on the foreign policy grounds,” Van Der Hout said.\nAt the close of the immigration hearing, Khalil pointed to earlier remarks by the judge about the importance of fairness and due process.\n“There’s nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness,” she had said earlier in the week. In response, Khalil remarked, “Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process.”\nVan Der Hout echoed his client’s concerns, calling the proceeding a “charade of due process” and accusing the government of “a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent.”\nA Controversial Arrest Sparks Legal Firestorm\nKhalil, who holds legal residency in the U.S., was arrested by federal agents on March 8. He was taken from the lobby of his university-owned apartment and quickly transported to an immigration detention center in Jena, far from his legal counsel and pregnant wife, a U.S. citizen.\nThe arrest marked the first of its kind under President Donald Trump’s promise to crack down on students involved in anti-war campus protests.\nHis attorneys argue that Khalil’s detention is an attack on constitutionally protected speech. They believe his deportation is being driven not by actual national security concerns but by political motives.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used legal authority to justify Khalil’s removal, citing the potential for “serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”\nVan Der Hout countered this at the hearing, claiming the case “has nothing to do with foreign policy” and that Khalil is being targeted for engaging in free speech protected under the First Amendment.\nCampus Protests and Government Response\nThough Khalil is not accused of committing any crimes during the Columbia University protests, his involvement has attracted scrutiny. He acted as a spokesperson and negotiator for student demonstrators who protested Israel’s military actions in Gaza by occupying a university lawn last spring.\nThe university eventually called in police after a separate group of protesters seized an administration building. Khalil was not involved in that occupation and was not arrested during the protests.\nStill, his visible role and unmasked participation made him a lightning rod for criticism. His willingness to speak publicly drew backlash from those who saw the protests as antisemitic. The White House accused him of “siding with terrorists,” although no evidence has been presented to back that claim.\nMultiple federal judges in New York and New Jersey have blocked the government from deporting Khalil while legal proceedings continue.\nThe Trump administration has also taken punitive action against Columbia University itself, withholding at least $400 million in federal research funds due to what it described as the university’s failure to combat antisemitism.\nSome Jewish students and faculty have said they felt harassed or excluded during the protests, based on either their faith or their support for Israel.\nALSO READ: US Space Force Commander Removed After JD Vance Trip To Greenland","summary":"The decision was delivered during a hearing in Jena, Louisiana, where the government argued that Khalil&#8217;s presence in the country could lead to “potentially serious foreign policy consequences.”","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/us-immigration-judge-rules-columbia-activist-mahmoud-khalil-can-be-deported-on-national-security-grounds/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Khalid.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:34:32","author":"Ashish Rana","authors":["Ashish Rana"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":310273146,"title":"Embattled Jagmeet Singh makes case for NDP to hold next government accountable","text":"Other than Singh’s recent shift to cast the NDP as a power broker, his talking points have remained largely the same throughout the election — reminding Canadians about the NDP’s push for pharmacare and dental care and the introduction of anti-scab legislation. \n\n“One of the reasons I think that he's not really inspiring much support, is that it's kind of like a broken record,” Sanjay Jeram, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University, said in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer.\n\n“There's not much really new to the talking points, not much new to the way he's trying to sell his party.”\n\nAfter Singh’s address, he sat down for a brief “fireside chat” with Joanna Johnson, a teacher and social media influencer.\n\nJohnson wanted to know, after pharmacare and dental care, what the next big movement will be. \n\nOne spectator shouted “the climate crisis,” a topic that did not come up in Singh’s nearly 40 minutes on stage. \n\nSingh answered that the next federal budget will be a “really important” moment for New Democrats to protect healthcare, old age security and pensions from Liberal and Conservative cuts, and a push for measures like national rent control. \n\nThere are currently 24 NDP MPs.

Now Arron Banks is standing to be a Farage mayor...","text":"Arron Banks was watching a cricket match in South Africa with a glass of white wine in hand when Nigel Farage called to ask him if he would be prepared to stand as Reform's candidate for mayor of the West of England.\n\nThe proposal made sense on a number of grounds. Bristol is the city where Banks made his fortune as an insurance magnate and he and Farage had a relationship that went back to the heady days of the Brexit campaign when he had bankrolled Farage's then party, Ukip, to the tune of £1 million.\n\nBanks didn't hesitate: 'When the boss phones you and says \"You've got to do it\", you've got to do it, right?'\n\nBut Farage may have cause to rue the day he recruited the author of The Bad Boys Of Brexit, Tales Of Mischief, Mayhem & Guerrilla Warfare In The EU Referendum Campaign, a scurrilous memoir of Banks's role in the Leave movement.\n\nIn a little-noticed interview in South Africa, where Banks has business interests, the maverick businessman said: 'We have had a few issues [in the] last couple of weeks with big political egos getting in the way of each other, but that is politics.'\n\nIt was a reference to the incendiary row sparked last month when the Mail published an interview I conducted with Reform MP Rupert Lowe, the multimillionaire former chairman of Southampton FC, in which he described Farage as the 'messianic' leader of a protest party.\n\nBanks moved on to comment on Donald Trump and the global trade war caused by his tariffs. And what he said will surely alarm the Reform leadership.\n\nChallenged about the chaos in the international markets, Banks said: 'Who gives a rat's arse about the stock market? I don't. It's just a weighing system for sentiment. Most asset prices in the world are over-priced.\n\n'If you are a kid in London, you can't possibly buy a house because it's ridiculously over-priced. Maybe we need a bit of harsh realignment. Generally, you have got older people, they have got way too much money and younger people have got absolutely nothing.\n\n'Maybe it needs a damn good shake-up. Every so often the world needs to be taken by the scruff and given a bloody good shake. I think that is what Trump is doing.'\n\nThe assertion by Banks that older people have 'way too much money' will dismay Reform strategists. \n\nAn analysis of voting at the last election showed that 58 per cent of Reform voters are over the age of 50, while 30 per cent are over 60 – exactly the demographic that is likely to be most disturbed by Banks's words.\n\nThe interview couldn't surface at a worse time for Reform, coming as it does after the weeks of turmoil that followed Farage's decision to suspend Rupert Lowe, one of Reform's roster of five MPs.\n\nWith Reform set to fight the first parliamentary by-election since Labour's landslide victory last July in the Cheshire constituency of Runcorn on May 1, the last thing the party needs is a big beast like Banks going off-message – after all, he's not so much a loose cannon as a loose howitzer.\n\nThe contest was triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Mike Amesbury, who pleaded guilty to assault following a late-night drinking session.\n\nAt the General Election, Reform came second in Runcorn, which is why Farage has high hopes of capturing the seat.\n\nReform are also frontrunners in the battle for the West of England mayoralty, the post to be contested by Banks. \n\nThe race was dramatically thrown wide open last week when outgoing mayor Dan Norris, a Labour MP, was arrested over allegations of rape and child sex offences.\n\nThe crucial question is whether Banks's electoral performance will be damaged by the controversy that has enveloped the party since Lowe was ejected.\n\nThere had been simmering tensions between Farage and Lowe even before my bombshell interview brought things to a head.\n\nThe Great Yarmouth MP's hardline demands for the deportation of all illegal migrants alarmed the high command, and relations deteriorated further when Elon Musk, Trump's notorious 'First Buddy', declared that Farage 'doesn't have what it takes' to be Reform leader and floated Lowe as an alternative.\n\nThe row reached new heights when Reform chairman Zia Yusuf triggered what his colleagues have described as 'a nuclear solution' by calling in the police over his allegation that he had been threatened with physical violence by Lowe last December.\n\nI'm told that Farage and his allies were appalled by Yusuf's decision to involve the police, not least because it triggered hundreds, if not thousands, of resignations of party members.\n\nYusuf is now expected to pay a heavy price for the chaos which has engulfed the party since the interview. Some say he could be out of a job after the May elections.\n\nYusuf, a businessman who gave £200,000 to Reform last year, was handpicked by Farage to be the party's chairman, with a brief to professionalise the party. \n\nWhether his attempts to do so have worked, we will see on May 1, which is a doubly significant date as it is also the day county council elections will be held across the country.\n\nAt the General Election, Farage admitted Reform had problems with some 'bad apple' candidates over racist and homophobic comments. \n\nLast month, however, he claimed Reform had turned a corner: 'We've been vetting, I bet, to a standard that no other party has ever done before for local council elections.'\n\nBut has anything changed? Last week, the party suspended Buckinghamshire candidate Miriam Thomas after offensive social media posts came to light.\n\nA day earlier, it had emerged that Stephen Hartley, who was standing as a Reform candidate in the Oxfordshire County Council election, had defended serial paedophile Jimmy Savile. \n\nIn a social media post in 2022 Hartley said Savile was 'an innocent man and a working-class hero' and even suggested the paedophile was his role model.\n\nSo what of the Reform candidate in the Runcorn parliamentary by-election? The party's hopes rest on former Tory councillor Sarah Pochin. Yet, bizarrely, within hours of being selected, Pochin mysteriously deleted her X/Twitter account.\n\nUnfortunately for her, I've seen some of the tweets she erased. These include photos of her posing with drag queens who had participated in 'Drag Queen Story Hour', book-readings for children in primary schools, that are bound to incense many Reform members.\n\nAnother tweet, dating back to her days as Tory Mayor of Cheshire East in May 2022, referred to her 'pleasure' in supporting an event for Afghan and Syrian refugees who have settled in the county. \n\nSuch a view is unlikely to chime with members of a party which sees immigration control as a key element of its political strategy.\n\nLast year Pochin, who has served as a magistrate for two decades, was even criticised by Labour for her leniency towards a single mother who was more than twice the drink-drive limit at Christmas when her car collided with a fence.\n\nThe defendant, who appeared at Crewe Magistrates Court last December, escaped with a fine after Pochin told her: 'No one was hurt. Do not be too hard on yourself. It is what it is.'\n\nA Reform spokesman said of the case: 'Having been a magistrate for 20 years, Sarah believes in the power of second chances.'\n\nThere's no doubt many members of Reform object to the way Lowe was treated. The newly formed campaign group Independent Britain, which is made up of around 200 former Reform members and candidates who quit in protest over Yusuf and Farage's leadership style, is campaigning in the Runcorn by-election for the Tory candidate Sean Houlston.\n\nMeanwhile Yusuf's allegedly heavy-handed management of the party is estranging many grassroots members. At least a dozen local chairmen have quit over the conduct of the party's leadership in recent weeks.\n\nA Reform UK spokesman said the resignations amounted to 2 per cent of its branch chairmen. 'Our understanding is that the other parties have much higher churn than that.'\n\nThe spokesman also claimed that Yusuf's decision to report Lowe to the police on the very same day that my interview with him appeared in the Mail was 'coincidental'.\n\nHowever, only yesterday, Yusuf's problems continued to mount. Reform's former London Mayoral candidate Howard Cox told the Guido Fawkes political news website: 'My inboxes are now flooded with grassroots Reformers who are incredibly upset and feel that their political optimism for our country has been betrayed.'\n\nThe elections on May 1 represent a golden opportunity for Reform to establish itself as a serious alternative to the Tories.\n\nLabour has lost 37 councillors in by-elections since the General Election. The Conservatives have gained 23 and Reform 13.\n\nIf Nigel Farage's candidates don't do considerably better next month, he may rue the day his chairman set the rozzers on Rupert Lowe.","summary":"Arron Banks was watching a cricket match in South Africa when Nigel Farage called to ask if he would be prepared to stand as Reform's candidate for mayor of the West of England.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14600771/Brexit-Reform-Nigel-Farage-Rupert-Lowe-mayor.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/21/97188451-0-image-a-35_1744404387630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:28:23","author":"Andrew Pierce,Editor","authors":["Andrew Pierce","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":310274088,"title":"Ecuador Presidential Hopefuls Make Last Pitch To Voters","text":"Ecuador's incumbent president and his leftist challenger have made their final pitch to voters ahead of Sunday's razor-tight election, with jobs, crime and an appeal to women voters dominating campaign-closing arguments.The too-close-to-call runoff vote features 37-year-old Daniel Noboa and 47-year-old rival Luisa Gonzalez, who is bidding to become the country's first woman president. On Friday, the campaigns entered a period of silence, a strict booze ban was in force and the government limited the number of foreigners coming into the country -- ostensibly to prevent disruptions.Close to 14 million Ecuadorans must decide who will run their violence-plagued nation for the next four years. \"There is no work and insecurity is on the rise\" said 29-year-old mum Adela, who did not want to give her full name. \"They always make promises, but when they are elected, they never fulfil them.\" A Noboa win would likely spell more \"iron fist\" policies that have had mixed success in quelling violence turbocharged by the ultra-lucrative drug trade. Ecuador suffered one murder an hour in January and February, the bloodiest start to a year on record. Noboa wants to see US troops deploy to Ecuador to tackle a plethora of cartels wrestling to control the flow of cocaine from Colombia and Peru, through Ecuadoran ports to Asia, America and Europe. If Gonzalez wins it would signal a sharp shift to the left and a likely cooling of Ecuador's relations with the United States and its president, Donald Trump. Gonzalez is closely allied with ex-president Rafael Correa, who delighted in lobbing barbs at Washington during his decade in office.He now lives in exile in Belgium, avoiding a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated. He remains a deeply polarizing figure in his homeland. Ecuadorans appear equally divided over which political path they now want to choose. In February's first round of voting less than a percentage point, or 17,000 votes, separated Noboa and Gonzalez. On Sunday, with more than a dozen also-ran candidates shorn from the ballot, hundreds of thousands of votes are up for grabs. Gonzalez has won the backing of powerful indigenous leader Leonidas Iza, who won half a million votes in the first round. But it is unclear if his voters will remain united. Ecuadoran polls, which have proved less than reliable in the past, show the second round as a virtual tie. Both candidates on Thursday held final campaign events in Guayaquil, the country's largest city, economic capital and the epicenter of drug violence. Gonzalez made a late play for women voters, proposing low-interest loans of up to $40,000 for single mothers like herself. During Noboa's time in power, she said, \"violence, poverty and unemployment has hit us women hardest.\"Despite holding the presidency and coming from one of the country's richest families, Noboa presented himself as an outsider and the candidate of change. \"The country does not deserve to be mistreated by the same old politicians,\" he said, targeting his rival's ties with former president Correa. Some analysts fear a tight result could spark claims of fraud and lead to a government with a weak mandate. \"If the difference is very small, the government will be born with a problem: It has almost half the country against it, and that weighs heavily, making it more difficult to govern,\" said Simon Pachano of UN-backed social sciences institute FLASCO.","summary":"Ecuador's incumbent president and his leftist challenger have made their final pitch to voters ahead of Sunday's razor-tight election, with jobs, crime and an appeal to women voters dominating campaign-closing arguments.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/ecuador-presidential-hopefuls-make-last-pitch-voters-3769794","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4593339/car-drives-past-giant-image-ecuadors-president-daniel-noboa-roundabout-quito.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:27:13","author":"Estelle Peard","authors":["Estelle Peard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":310274876,"title":"Federal judge rules Trump administration must 'unfreeze' funds to Maine as trans battle lingers","text":"A federal judge said the Trump administration must lift their freeze on federal funding to Maine.

The state accused the USDA of \"withholding funding used to feed children in schools, childcare centers, and after-school programming as well as disabled adults in congregate settings,\" an argument the judge agreed with.

On January 20, following his inauguration, Trump signed multiple executive orders aimed at curtailing illegal entry and ending the previous administration's policies.While the directive does not alter existing legal rights, it marks an escalation in federal border enforcement strategy, emphasizing military control and use of public lands.What to KnowThe memorandum builds upon executive orders that declared a national emergency at the southern border.​It authorizes the use of certain federal lands—including the Roosevelt Reservation—for military operations such as building barriers and installing surveillance equipment.The directive would primarily involve the four U.S. states that share a border with Mexico: California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The Roosevelt Reservation is a 60-foot-wide strip of federal land running along the U.S. side of the border in parts of these states.The memo allows for these lands to be designated as \"National Defense Areas\" and provides legal mechanisms for jurisdictional transfer to the Department of Defense.What People Are SayingDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has underscored the importance of border security in relation to national security, asserting: \"Border security is national security.\"He has expressed pride in the military's role in supporting the Department of Homeland Security to secure the southern border, stating, \"The DOD is not only willing to—it's proud to—partner with DHS to defend the sovereignty of our southern border and advance that mission.\"Trump's memo says, \"Our southern border is under attack from a variety of threats. The complexity of the current situation requires that our military take a more direct role in securing our southern border than in the recent past.\"What Happens NextAccording to the memorandum, the implementation will begin in a limited sector along the border, with a 45-day assessment period, and can be expanded at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.The memo ensures military personnel will operate under established rules of force and reaffirms Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's authority to involve the National Guard if necessary.Update: 4/11/25, 7:34 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.Update: 4/11/25, 7:42 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.Update: 4/11/25, 7:54 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and remarks.","summary":"This directive involves the use of federal lands for military activities, such as constructing barriers and deploying equipment.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-expands-us-military-role-southern-border-protection-2058915","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2626091/border-security.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:21:45","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":310280734,"title":"Ecuador presidential hopefuls make last pitch to voters","text":"Ecuador's incumbent president and his leftist challenger have made their final pitch to voters ahead of Sunday's razor-tight election, with jobs, crime and an appeal to women voters dominating campaign-closing arguments.\n\nThe too-close-to-call runoff vote features 37-year-old Daniel Noboa and 47-year-old rival Luisa Gonzalez, who is bidding to become the country's first woman president. \n\nOn Friday, the campaigns entered a period of silence, a strict booze ban was in force and the government limited the number of foreigners coming into the country -- ostensibly to prevent disruptions.\n\nClose to 14 million Ecuadorans must decide who will run their violence-plagued nation for the next four years. \n\n\"There is no work and insecurity is on the rise\" said 29-year-old mum Adela, who did not want to give her full name. \n\n\"They always make promises, but when they are elected, they never fulfil them.\" \n\nA Noboa win would likely spell more \"iron fist\" policies that have had mixed success in quelling violence turbocharged by the ultra-lucrative drug trade. \n\nEcuador suffered one murder an hour in January and February, the bloodiest start to a year on record. \n\nNoboa wants to see US troops deploy to Ecuador to tackle a plethora of cartels wrestling to control the flow of cocaine from Colombia and Peru, through Ecuadoran ports to Asia, America and Europe. \n\nIf Gonzalez wins it would signal a sharp shift to the left and a likely cooling of Ecuador's relations with the United States and its president, Donald Trump. \n\nGonzalez is closely allied with ex-president Rafael Correa, who delighted in lobbing barbs at Washington during his decade in office.\n\nHe now lives in exile in Belgium, avoiding a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated.

So, here's both barrels.\n\nFirst up, Jake 'The Snake' Tapper, who is hawking a book titled 'Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.'\n\nIronically, it was Tapper who committed a transgression that would make Adam blush.\n\nBack in 2020, he suplexed Lara Trump in a contentious interview after she dared question Stammering Joe's aging melon.\n\n'I think you're mocking his stutter,' he spat at her. 'I think that you have no standing to diagnose someone's cognitive decline.'\n\nThat's rich, Tapper. Maybe you have no standing to write a supposedly objective book about a 'cover-up' in which you took part!\n\nNext, George 'Stepstool' Stephanopoulos.\n\nThis diminutive media powerhouse was launched into overdrive after that June 27 presidential debate between Orange Don and Deathly-White Joe. The Showdown in the Sanitarium revealed Biden to be little more than a talking tuber.\n\nLooking for safe harbor, the White House hurriedly cobbled together a July 5 interview with Georgie Porgie – a reliable water-carrier for the Democrats. But even that failed, after the ex-president whiffed on George's softballs.\n\nToo bad, Stephanopoulos wasn't hefty enough to say that himself, except in some off-hand, hastily walked-back remarks to a random TMZ reporter.\n\nNow, author Chris Whipple has revealed in his new Biden breakdown book 'Uncharted,' that George had much more to say than that. 'Stephanopoulos questioned the president gently, like a grandson,' Whipple wrote. 'Afterward, when I asked the ABC anchor by email for his impressions, he replied: 'Heartbreaking up close.'\n\n'Heartbreaking' indeed, George… for everyone who thought you had more tenacity.\n\nFinally, there's Bill Maher, who said this in March 2024: 'Stop acting like life in America in 2024 is unbearable. Biden's ratings are in the toilet not because he's doing such a bad job because a lot of Americans like to live with their head in the toilet.'\n\nLook out, Bill… It's a floater!\n\nNow Maher's positioning himself as incredibly brave and virtuous for going with his friend Kid Rock to meet Trump in the Oval Office. (He probably only went to pull a Willie Nelson on the White House roof.)\n\nThe visit was well-received by conservatives who'd like to see more skeptics take the high road instead of fire-bombing Teslas. But I question Maher's sincerity are having known him for over 30 years.\n\nI was lucky enough to appear on one of the earliest episodes of 'Politically Incorrect' in 1993, and followed him as a pundit to ABC and eventually to Real Time.\n\nBut after I had the audacity to sacrifice one of Bill's sacred cows and challenge him over his atheism in 2012, I was told in 2013 that Bill would never have me on his show again.\n\nShove it, Maher.\n\nI watched for years as he chucked hunks of red meat to his progressive live audience, and now that socialism has fallen out of favor, he wants to blaze another trail.\n\nAfraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\n\nPrivate company Colossal Biosciences used preserved DNA from a common gray wolf and some good old-fashioned genome sequencing to re-animate 10,000-year-extinct dire wolves.\n\nNext up for Colossal: the wooly mammoth, the dodo and the Tasmanian tiger.\n\nAsked if they could resuscitate Joe Biden, a company spokesperson said, 'Oh hell no, technology that advanced doesn't exist!'\n\nSpace racy \n\nLauren Sanchez and a posse of gal pals are set to leave the planet Monday aboard one of fiancé Jeff Bezos' rockets on a suborbital flight to nowhere.\n\nThe Blue Origin New Shepard flight will last 11 minutes and cost $40 million, which is more money and less time than Sanchez spent on her lips.\n\nIf the capsule encounters any trouble upon landing, Captain Lauren's luscious lady lumps can be repurposed into flotation devices.\n\nMade in Montecito\n\nWe can all breathe a sigh of relief after Meghan Markle assured the world that her recently launched 'As Ever' line won't be touched by Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\n'I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy,' she squeaked.\n\nRight, Meg.

I will continue fighting until my husband is home,\" she said.\n\nMr Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador because of persecution by local gangs, according to his immigration court records.\n\nHe lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years, during which he worked in construction, married a US citizen and was raising three children with disabilities.\n\nIn 2019, he was accused by local police of being in the MS-13 gang, court records stated. He denied the allegation and was never charged with a crime.\n\nA US immigration judge subsequently shielded him from deportation to El Salvador because of likely gang persecution in his native country, according to records. He had a federal permit to work in the US and was a sheet metal apprentice, his attorney said.\n\nThe Trump administration deported Mr Abrego Garcia to an El Salvador prison anyway, later describing the mistake as \"an administrative error\" but insisting that he was in MS-13. The administration also argued that the US lacked the power to retrieve the Salvadoran national because he was no longer in the US.\n\nHowever, Judge Xinis ordered the US to return him, writing that his deportation appeared to be \"wholly lawless\".\n\n\"There is little to no evidence to support a 'vague, uncorroborated' allegation that Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang,\" Judge Xinis wrote.\n\nTrump's administration ordered to bring Abrego Garcia home\n\nIn its ruling on Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's emergency appeal of Judge Xinis's order.\n\nThe court said: \"The order properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Mr Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"\n\nThe court's liberal justices said the administration should have hastened to correct \"its egregious error\" and was \"plainly wrong\" to suggest it could not bring him home.\n\nThe Supreme Court has issued a string of rulings on its emergency docket, where the conservative majority has at least partially sided with Mr Trump amid a wave of lower court orders slowing the president's sweeping agenda.\n\nIn Thursday's case, the court said Judge Xinis's order must be clarified to ensure it did not intrude into executive branch power over foreign affairs since Mr Abrego Garcia was being held abroad.","summary":"A US federal judge has rebuked a government lawyer who has been unable explain what the Trump administration had done to arrange for the return of a father who has been mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-12/us-judge-rebukes-white-house/105169128","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ce7cbb1610ce6f98823f8f20335cb4cb?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=722&cropW=1284&xPos=0&yPos=120&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 23:18:10","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.481}]}
