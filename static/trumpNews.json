These allegations come on the heels of a highly publicized “emotional and digital affair” between Kennedy and New York Magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi, who is nearly 40 years younger than the former presidential candidate.The revelation of these new allegations adds another layer to an already turbulent narrative surrounding Kennedy’s personal life. His camp has vehemently denied the claims, issuing a statement to Mediaite that characterized the reports as “untrue.” The details of relationship with Kennedy were disclosed through a series of text messages from the women, sparked by news of his relationship with Nuzzi.The Daily Mail reported that the friends of Kennedy’s wife, actress Cheryl Hines, suggest that she may soon file for divorce, potentially prompted by the public scrutiny surrounding her husband’s romantic entanglements. However, Page Six reported that if Hines decides to end her marriage to Kennedy, it may stem more from his connections with figures like Donald Trump than his relationship with Nuzzi.In a bid to quell the controversy, Kennedy’s spokesperson asserted, “Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage.” Interestingly, Kennedy has been on leave from his role as chairman and chief legal counsel of Children’s Health Defense since April 2023, as noted on the organization’s website. The implications of these allegations extend far beyond Kennedy's personal life. They could create significant challenges for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which Kennedy endorsed after withdrawing from his own bid for the White House. While Trump has attempted to distance himself from the controversy, the growing scandal surrounding Kennedy may become an unwanted distraction from Trump.","summary":"Three women have alleged romantic relationships with Robert F Kennedy Jr, connected through Children’s Health Defense.

Richard Rogers, 45, of Billings, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the Republican speaker’s office in just 75 minutes on Feb. 3, 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic Coast. The 12-person federal jury also found Rogers guilty on two counts of making harassing telephone calls: the ones to McCarthy’s office plus 150 calls he made to an FBI tip line in 2021 and 2022. Rogers routinely made vulgar and obscene comments in those calls. Sentencing was set for January 31. He faces up to six years in prison and a $250,000 fine for threatening to harm a member of Congress, and a maximum penalty of two years and a $250,000 fine on the harassment counts. U.S. District Judge Susan Watters allowed Rogers to remain free of custody pending sentencing. Threats against public officials in the U.S. have risen sharply in recent years, including against members of Congress and their spouses, election workers and local elected officials. Rogers’ case was among more than 8,000 threats to lawmakers investigated by the U.S. Capitol Police in 2023, and officials expect another surge with the 2024 election. During a three day trial, Rogers testified that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy’s office were a form of “civil disobedience.” He and his attorneys argued that using obscenities with FBI operators and Congressional staff was protected as free speech under the First Amendment, which establishes the right “to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” But prosecutors said Rogers crossed the line with a threat on McCarthy’s life and by hurling abusive and sexual verbal tirades against the lawmaker’s staffers and FBI operators. In the dozens of calls that were played for jurors, Rogers was heard asking for investigations of various alleged conspiracies involving the FBI and the administration of President Joe Biden. He was polite at times, but would quickly become angry and shout obscenities until the calls were disconnected. “You can’t talk to people that way. It’s common sense,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Godfrey said. “He’s calling not out of political protest; he’s calling because he gets enjoyment out of it.” The prosecutor told the jury there was no exception in federal law that says government employees can be subjected to harassment. “’Petitioning the government’ — baloney,” Godfrey said. “Kevin McCarthy was the Speaker of the House. It’s not his job to shoot down spy balloons.” Rogers, a former telephone customer service representative, testified that he took to care to “edit” his comments on the phone to avoid any threats because he didn’t want to go to prison. He added that he never tried hide his actions and frequently offered his name and phone number when calling the FBI. “They were disrespectful to me, so I was disrespectful to them,” Rogers said. Defense attorney Ed Werner said Rogers “just wanted to be heard.” Following the guilty verdict, Rogers repeated his contention that he never threatened anyone. He also said he was dissatisfied with his defense attorneys for not adequately presenting his case. Rogers wore shirts depicting Captain America and other superheroes throughout the trial, including one Wednesday with the letters “MAGA” on the front, a reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. A supporter of the former president, he said he was in Washington during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Godfrey said the case was not about politics but rather illegal harassment. Earlier this year, a 30-year-old Billings man was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in federal prison after leaving voicemail messages threatening to kill Montana Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester and his family. Another Montana man, from Kalispell, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison last year, also for making threats against Tester.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. – A Montana man was convicted Wednesday of threatening to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Man convicted of threatening former Speaker McCarthy after being upset about Chinese spy balloon first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/man-convicted-of-threatening-former-speaker-mccarthy-after-being-upset-about-chinese-spy-balloon/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/5M4UCLOM2JFZRPEBDLMUZRML6Y.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:19:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":258271488,"title":"Suspended!!!","text":"We value your privacy We and our partners store and/or access information on a device, such as cookies and process personal data, such as unique identifiers and standard information sent by a device for personalised advertising and content, advertising and content measurement, audience research and services development.With your permission we and our partners may use precise geolocation data and identification through device scanning.

The poll was conducted between September 18 to 26, and is based on the responses of 882 registered voters.It's a good sign for Harris, who held the same lead--52 percent to 48 percent--over Trump in a Marquette University Law School poll released on September 11. But the poll director, Charles Franklin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the \"results could change\" between now and Election Day on November 5, noting that the pollster was off by several percentage points in the 2020 election.\"Remember--not that I really want to remind you--but we were off by four points last time in 2020,\" Franklin told the paper in a report published Wednesday. \"We were off by over six in 2016.\"\"So fair warning, these results could change,\" he added. \"We could be wrong, on the other hand, we could be right.\"Pollsters had adapted their methodologies since the 2016 and 2020 elections, where Trump underperformed in surveys nationwide. For example, while Trump was found trailing President Joe Biden by 8.4 percentage points on average in the final days of the 2020 election, the former president lost the race by a much slimmer overall margin (4.4 percent).Similarly, in 2016, Trump was found behind then-Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, by 3.9 percentage points on average on Election Day, per FiveThirtyEight's tracking. Trump, however, went on to defeat Clinton despite losing the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points.Marquette Law School's last poll before election day in 2020 found Biden ahead by 5 percentage points on Trump (48 percent to 43 percent). But the president went on to win the state by roughly 20,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the total votes cast.Many pollsters have been proactive about adapting their polling methods to better capture Trump's support since. Ipsos President Cliff Young previously told Newsweek that his poll has adjusted its sample collection by drawing from voter registration databased instead of using randomized lists of telephone numbers, making it easier to ensure that rural voters are counted in the survey.Today, Harris is up by 1.8 percentage points on average above Trump in Wisconsin, according to FiveThirtyEight. Experts have said that the former president's better polling may not be a sign he is actually building momentum in the state, however, instead a reflection of pollsters utilizing better methods.Franklin told Newsweek in an email Tuesday afternoon that the full scope of Wisconsin's race will likely not take shape until November 5, given that the state also has same-day voter registration.\"It then takes several months before election clerks 'purge' the rolls of people who moved or reregistered in new places or become inactive due to failure to vote in several elections,\" he added. \"As a result, the number of registrants drops in the winter after the election. Registered voters will certainly rise by November. But how much? We don't know.\"Newsweek reached out to Franklin over email for additional comment on Wednesday.","summary":"Have pollsters learned from their mistakes in the last two presidential elections?","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/poll-director-caution-swing-state-wisnconsin-1963012","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2486245/poll-director-urges-caution-his-own-survey.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:11:54","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":258270202,"title":"How a Judge Will Weigh Immunity in Trump’s Jan. 6 Case","text":"In the next few months, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan will face what she herself recently called “a uniquely challenging” task. She will go line by line through the evidence the special counsel, Jack Smith, wants to present to a jury in support of his federal indictment charging former President Donald J. Trump on four criminal charges related to his plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Her job is to determine which of myriad specific allegations about Mr. Trump’s actions can survive the Supreme Court’s recent ruling granting presidents a broad form of immunity from criminal prosecution for most of their official actions. Here is a look at the types of decisions Judge Chutkan will have to make, many times over. If Mr. Trump undertook a specific action in his private capacity as a candidate for office, rather than in his role as the president, that act is deemed unofficial, according to the Supreme Court ruling. Such acts are not subject to immunity, so evidence about them can be cited in court to support the charges that Mr. Trump illegally tried to overturn the election, or even introduced as context to help a jury understand the case. By contrast, if the action fell within what the Supreme Court referred to as the outer perimeter of presidential duties, it counts as official. In that case, it is entitled to, at a minimum, presumptive immunity, and the court must perform some additional analysis to decide whether it is off limits for any trial. On matters like Mr. Trump’s attempts to strong-arm state officials into changing election results and his public lies that the election was stolen, prosecutors and defense attorneys are likely to disagree sharply about whether Mr. Trump was acting as a candidate who was seeking a new term in office, or as a president who was constitutionally charged with overseeing the enforcement of federal election laws. Under the Supreme Court’s new doctrine, “official” actions by Mr. Trump would fall into one of two categories. Some official acts are core to the president’s exercise of executive power, in which case they are absolutely immune and no information about them can be used in his prosecution. Other official acts are more peripheral, in which case prosecutors might still be able to use information about them in court, depending on the circumstances. The Supreme Court has already declared that Mr. Trump’s interactions with Justice Department officials count as core executive actions because the Constitution charges the president with overseeing federal law enforcement. Mr. Smith has removed discussion of his purported actions that fall into that category from the indictment. A president’s peripheral official acts, the Supreme Court has said, are presumptively immune, too. But depending on the circumstances, exceptions can be made that would allow the information to still be part of a prosecution of that president. The test is whether prosecuting a former president for such an action would pose a danger of intruding on the authority and functions of the executive branch, and therefore chilling future presidents from robustly carrying out their responsibilities. If not, then the act is not immune and evidence about it can be used in court. The Supreme Court has said that Mr. Trump’s pressuring of then-Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as Senate president, to block the congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory was an official act but that it might fall into the exception, since the Constitution assigns no role to the president or executive branch in such proceedings. Judge Chutkan won’t make any decisions on immunity until at least the end of October, when the defense and prosecution have finished submitting their own written assessments of the case. At that point, she could ask the two sides to flesh out their arguments further at a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington. Any determinations she makes on the question of immunity will almost certainly be appealed, likely eventually to the Supreme Court, which will have the final say of which parts of Mr. Trump’s indictment will have to be thrown out and which can survive and go to trial.","summary":"In the next few months, Judge Tanya S.

About 50 container ships are sitting idle offshore, less than 48 hours into the strike, and both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have expressed support for the striking workers. “It’s only fair that workers who put themselves at risk during the pandemic to keep ports open see a meaningful increase in their wages as well,” Mr Biden said this week. Australian beef imports to the US had jumped 70 per cent this year as cattle numbers across the United States dwindled because of drought and high grain prices. Now frozen Australian beef trimmings, ready to be made into hamburgers, are indefinitely waiting to be unloaded. The majority of Australia’s higher quality beef is shipped to the US west coast, which is unaffected by the strikes. NewsWire understands Australian farming groups have not raised the issue of US strikes with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In preparation for the strike, suppliers to US grocers and fast-food businesses increased imports of frozen lean beef – which is mixed with domestic supplies to make hamburger meat – from Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, Reuters reports. Los Angeles-based Australian man James Blok, who works for NZ-listed Mainfreight, told a beef industry publication that some suppliers were considering getting meat from the west coast to the east by road and rail, adding about $US8000 ($A11,550) per container. No one on east coast wharves would be checking power supply to the refrigerated containers during the strikes as well, he said. “But what we do know is that for every one day that product is held up, it creates five days of backlog,” Mr Blok told Beef Central. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the federal Trade Minister have been approached for comment. The strike began at 12.01am local time on Tuesday, affecting 36 ports all the way from the northeast of the US to Texas, hampering supplies of essentially everything, though most industries brought in as much stock as they could before the industrial action. But perishables like bananas and cherries are expected to soon be scant on store shelves. About 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen’s Association have walked off the job. They are demanding contractual protections against automation and a 50 per cent pay rise over six years.

Trump intentionally lied to the public, election officials and his vice-president in his failed bid to cling to power, while privately describing election fraud claims as \"crazy\", prosecutors allege in the 165-page filing. The filing from special counsel Jack Smith's team offers the most comprehensive view to date of what prosecutors intend to prove if the case charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the election reaches trial. While Trump's efforts to undo the election have been chronicled in stark detail through a months-long congressional investigation, this filing cites previously unknown accounts by Trump's closest aides. \"The details don't matter,\" Trump said, when told by an adviser that a lawyer mounting his legal challenges wouldn't be able to prove the false allegations in court, the filing states. The brief has been made public despite objections by Trump's legal team. It comes in the final month of a closely contested presidential race. Democrats have argued Trump is unfit for office, using his refusal to accept the election results four years ago to support their claim. The topic surfaced as recently as this week's vice-presidential debate. Tim Walz and JD Vance engaged in a minutes-long squabble over violence at the Capitol on January 6. Mr Vance refused to directly answer when asked whether his running mate had lost the 2020 race. The filing was initially submitted under seal in response to a Supreme Court opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents for official acts they take while in office. The immunity decision narrowed the scope of the prosecution and eliminated the possibility of a trial before next month's election. Prosecutors hope to persuade District Judge Tanya Chutkan that Trump's actions were undertaken in a private capacity, rather than under his role as president. If they are successful, that would allow the charges to remain part of the case as it moves forward. Judge Chutkan permitted a redacted version to be made public, despite Trump's lawyers arguing it was unfair to unseal it so close to the election on November 5. It's uncertain whether the case will go to trial, particularly if Trump is elected president. \"Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,\" Mr Smith's team wrote. \"When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office.\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung argued the brief was \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional\". He repeated claims that Mr Smith and Democrats were \"hell-bent on weaponising the Department of Justice in an attempt to cling to power\". In a post to Truth Social, Trump said the case would end with his \"complete victory\". The filing alleges Trump \"laid the groundwork\" for rejecting the election results before the contest was over. He allegedly told advisers in the event he held an early lead, he would \"declare victory before the ballots were counted and any winner was projected\". Prosecutors say immediately after the election, his advisers sought to sow chaos in the counting of votes. In one instance, a campaign employee, who is also described as a Trump co-conspirator, was told results favouring Joe Biden at a Michigan polling centre appeared accurate. The person is alleged to have replied, \"find a reason it isn't\" and \"give me options to file litigation\". Prosecutors also allege Trump advanced claims of fraud despite knowing they were false. They describe how he told others that allegations of election irregularity made by lawyer Sidney Powell were \"crazy\". Even so, days later, he promoted a lawsuit she was about to file on Twitter. Prosecutors also cite an account of a White House staffer who, after the election, overheard Trump telling his wife, daughter and son-in-law, \"It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell\". They say by December 5, 2020, the defendant was starting to think about Congress's role in the process. \"For the first time, he mentioned to Pence the possibility of challenging the election results in the House of Representatives\", it says, citing a phone call. Prosecutors also argue Trump used his Twitter account to further his illegal scheme by spreading false claims of election fraud and exhorting his supporters to travel to Washington for the January 6, 2021 certification. They intend to use \"forensic evidence\" from Trump's iPhone to provide insight into the former president's actions after the attack at the Capitol.

For Republican JD Vance, it’s an issue on which compromise is possible; for Democrat Tim Walz — like his running mate Kamala Harris — accepting any state and regional differences will violate women’s rights. Walz’s view is in keeping with Harris’ pledge to jettison the Senate filibuster in order to enact a national right to abortion — even as Americans themselves have at long last been moving toward compromise, based on the safety valve provided by federalism. As Democrats like to say about Donald Trump and border control, it’s Harris and Walz who “want the issue,” not a compromise. If they were truly committed to reducing the divisiveness of which they accuse Trump, they’d look instead to an example set by Democratic icon Franklin Roosevelt on the issue that was, in its day, as emotional and wrenching as abortion: Prohibition. It was Roosevelt who resolved it — by returning the question to the states. National alcohol policy may seem to have little in common with abortion, but in the late 19th and early 20th century Prohibition was the overriding domestic political issue. Like abortion, it pitted the religious versus the secular, Catholics versus Protestants, and urban “wet states” like New York versus rural “dry” ones such as Indiana. Banning alcohol divided the country in ways comparable to abortion — even to the point of inspiring violence. Carrie Nation, the most famous temperance crusader, boasted about her methods: “I ran behind the bar, smashed the mirror and all the bottles under it . . . opened the door and cut the rubber tubes . . . the beer flew in every direction.” The “Anti-Saloon League” asserted that “a new nation will be born” the moment Prohibition took effect. At the same time, the anti-Prohibition New York World lamented that with its enactment, “the Government of the United States as established by the Constitution . . . will cease to exist.” Before Prohibition, alcohol regulation was a state matter — much like abortion was pre-Roe, when states like New York and California allowed it and others did not. But just as Roe v. Wade set a single policy of legalized abortion for the entire nation, the 18th Amendment did the same as it banned alcohol sales across the country. The result of that Roe-like one-size-fits-all policy was not to settle the issue, but to enflame it. Roosevelt put an end to that culture war when he pledged in his 1932 campaign to repeal Prohibition. But here’s what he didn’t do: Propose a federal law to make the entire country “wet,” ignoring regional and cultural differences. Instead, he let the states decide — and, like ice melting in bourbon, temperance soon faded as a force in national politics. In 1904, the Prohibition Party candidate for president received nearly 260,000 votes, 2% of the total; after repeal, it received a grand total of 52,000. The issue disappeared. Democrats, their “unity” rhetoric aside, don’t want to see that happen with abortion. Referendum votes at the state level are finding middle ground — as voters in such red states as Ohio and Kansas have voted against outright bans. At the same time, states like Alabama continue severe restrictions. In November, voters in Arizona and Florida will have their own say on it. The reliable YouGov survey from July showed only 8% percent of voters ranked abortion as their most important issue, trailing inflation, immigration, health care and jobs and the economy. Harris has made clear that she aims to fan the flames — both by endorsing one expansive abortion policy for the whole country, and by perpetuating the canard that Trump will seek a national ban. Indeed, abortion is the only issue being raised by former Rep. Mondaire Jones in his Hudson Valley race against moderate Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, despite Lawler’s opposition to an abortion ban. New Jersey Democrat Sue Altman is making a similar play against incumbent Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Just as Democrats accuse Trump of scuttling border legislation to keep the immigration issue alive during the campaign, so Harris is doing with abortion: resisting the kind of state-by-state compromises that settled Prohibition. Even today, about 10% of Americans live in a dry county. But there’s zero debate about that local choice. In a post-Roe America, we may well be seeing a similar trajectory of federalist compromise on abortion. Democrats are hoping otherwise. November will tell us if they’re right to do so.

Another 10 migrants were injured in the incident on Tuesday evening, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The group included people of Egyptian, Nepalese, Cuban, Indian and Pakistani nationality, though the statement did not specify the nationalities of the deceased. The ministry said the incident took place just before 9pm local time while the patrol travelled on a highway near the town of Huixtla, some 40km from Tapachula by the Guatemalan border. The pick-up truck was followed by two vehicles similar to those used by criminal groups in the area, it said, and soldiers reported hearing explosions after which two officers opened fire. Four migrants were killed at the scene while two others died later in hospital. The deaths shine a renewed spotlight on Mexico's policy towards migrants as well as the growing role of the military in the country's security. Mexico has been under pressure from the US to reduce the number of migrants arriving at their shared border, where record numbers have tried to cross in recent years, fleeing economic hardship and violence. In recent months illegal border crossings have fallen, as the Biden administration has toughened its approach to border security in the run-up to November 5 elections, where Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if re-elected. Tapachula, in southern Chiapas state, is an entry point into Mexico for many migrants making the arduous journey towards the US. Chiapas has also seen clashes this year between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel. In July, the turf wars sent some 600 people fleeing across the border into Guatemala. Mexico's defence ministry said the two soldiers who fired on the migrants were removed from their posts and federal prosecutors had been informed. A military tribunal will also carry out its own investigation. It said it reaffirmed \"its commitment to act in strict accordance with the rule of law, under a policy of zero-impunity, and is ready to help the civil authorities to shed light on the facts\". The ministry added it was coordinating with Mexico's foreign ministry to contact corresponding embassies.","summary":"Deaths after soldiers opened fire on a pick-up truck in Mexico have shone a renewed light on the nation's policy towards migrants.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/immigration/migrants-dead-after-mexican-soldiers-fire-on-truck-c-16263132","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16263132/b64cd034fb61e216fc71000e4c0a47b69b40259f-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:03:26","author":"Staff Writers","authors":["Staff Writers"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.065},{"id":258269866,"title":"Prosecutors Are Overwhelmed With Evidence on Trump Suspect","text":"Federal authorities prosecuting would-be presidential assassin Ryan Routh, who they allege tried to shoot Donald Trump on a golf course last month, have asked for more time to analyze the mountains of evidence they’ve gathered in the case.

Investigators also need time to conduct forensic testing, prosecutors argued, including “ballistics testing, and fingerprint and DNA comparisons,” as well as coordinate expert witness testimonies.

After Vance lied, again, about Haitian immigrants, moderator Margaret Brennan said: “Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status.\" Vance replied: \"The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check.” Vance was referring to the debate rules. These rules were agreed to in advance by Vance, Walz and CBS News, the debate host. There would be no live fact-checking for the duration of the event. There would be online fact-checking, but not from the moderators. So Vance expected to lie without interference. When Brennan spoke truthfully, saying that Haitians who live and work in Springfield are there with the blessing of federal law, he looked almost shocked. This morning, liberals and Democrats are saying his reaction is so typical. Vance wants rules that allow him, Donald Trump and the Republicans to lie and lie and lie, regardless of the consequences. But that’s only half right. Perfect distillationVance wants rules and laws that protect him and his friends. But he wants the same rules and laws to punish his enemies. He wants the law to explicitly recognize in-groups and out-groups. And he wants those in authority to recognize the difference when applying the law. Most of us believe the law should be applied without fear or favor. Everyone is subject to the law. Everyone should be treated equally under it. When the law isn’t applied equally, we call that an injustice. But most of us don’t understand how equality is seen by Vance, Trump and the rest of their maga movement. Equality is no virtue. It’s a vice. The in-group should never, ever, be treated the same way as the out-group. When the law is applied equally, they call that an injustice. This debate moment is the perfect distillation of composer Frank Wilhoit’s old saying. “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.” The importance of impunityLiberals and Democrats often call this hypocrisy, but we’re not talking about saying one thing while doing another. MAGA does not pay lip service to equality. It opposes it. Vance was outraged by Brennan fact-checking him, but he would have no problem with her fact-checking Tim Walz. It’s better to call it impunity – for the rule of law and the other small-r republican principles that are enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. Everything about MAGA politics depends on everyone else honoring those values while MAGA subverts or violates them. This impunity is central to their idea of freedom. If they are not free to break the rules, they are not free. More than a “damning non-answer”This was again perfectly distilled during another debate moment. Walz asked Vance directly if Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. He paused before saying, “I’m focused on the future.” “That’s a damning non-answer,” Walz said. It was more than that. Vance immediately asked Walz if “Kamala Harris censored Americans from speaking their minds in the wake of the covid situation?” He was referring to Trump and the Republicans who were spreading lies about the disease and to the vice president’s role in combating those lies. Walz ignored him, but the answer, for Vance, is yes. Maga wants to lie and lie and lie, not only about the covid but about the election, and anyone like Harris who stands up for the truth violates their “freedom.” Unfairness is the pointThe conventions of decency ask us to at least try to be honest. That’s why Brennan, even though she wasn’t supposed to fact-check Vance, felt compelled to. His lies about Haitians were too ugly to overlook. But asking MAGA to be honest violates their First Amendment rights, and holding them morally accountable for what they say is censorship. “F you, CBS - how DARE YOU,” wrote Megyn Kelly last night. The rules bind you, but protect me. If they don’t, I’m free to break them.

Because “the Biden administration views its support for Israel in purely defensive terms, and feels a duty to restrain Israel’s offense. The American hug comes with handcuffs.” The result: “Further Iranian escalation,” likely because “the mullahs believed that America would continue to restrain Israel.” “So why not give Israel the green light and help it defang the chief cause of regional instability, the Iranian regime?” “Israel has vast capabilities — as it has shown in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Iran over the last year. But it’s even more capable when its chief ally supports its mission.” So: “The win is there if the president takes it.” Conservative: Kam’s ‘Going To Do’ Problem If Kamala “Harris wants to help struggling Americans, why hasn’t she? She does hold the second-highest office in the land, after all,” roars the Federalist’s Kylee Griswold. With all the problems Americans now face, “it’s pretty rich to hear the current vice president and her running mate talk about all the things she’s ‘going to do’ if” elected. Harris “is exceedingly culpable for the sorry state of our once-great nation — especially since she lied about [Joe Biden’s] health and vigor for years.” She “doesn’t get a free pass, no matter how hard she and her new running mate try to clean her slate with joy and vibes.” Fact is, “when politicians like Harris and Walz drone on about what they’re going to do in the future, you really only need to look at what they’ve done in the past.” Crime blotter: Deceptive FBI Crime Stats “It’s easy to see why some are a little cynical when the FBI reports, only five weeks before the presidential election, that violent crime declined in 2023,” snarks Merrill Matthews at The Hill. Be skeptical of the FBI’s data: “It relies on ‘participating law enforcement agencies’ ” when many have stopped participating. Meanwhile, the National Crime Victimization Survey “relies on responses from some 230,000 households” and shows “violent crime rose by 19 percent between 2019 and 2023,” with urban violent crime up 54%. Meanwhile, “exploding retail theft has led many companies to close stores in several urban areas, both because of unsustainable losses and concern for employee safety.” Fact is, it seems “urban crime is increasing while suburban and rural crime is decreasing or stable,” thanks to “progressive policies like ‘defund the police’” along with significant increases in the amount thieves are allowed to steal (e.g., $950) before it’s considered a felony.” Libertarian: A Sad ‘Cancel Culture’ Win The American Federation for Children fired Corey DeAngelis after revelations that the education researcher once appeared in a gay porn film — a “classic example of cancel culture,” thunders Reason’s Robby Soave. DeAngelis “is being punished for a regretted incident from his distant past that has nothing to do with his current job.” And: “Left-leaning gay media outlets,” outrageously, “are reveling.” But there is nothing inherently “anti-gay” about advocating for “school choice,” just like “there is no tension between DeAngelis’s decision, a decade ago, to appear in a gay pornographic film, and his current work calling for more freedom in education.” Labor beat: Harris’ Union Giveaway Kamala Harris has “called for ‘additional paths’ to good-paying jobs, ‘such as apprenticeships and technical programs,’ ” notes The Wall Street Journal’s Jason L. Riley, and vowed to “encourage the private sector to work with unions, school districts, community colleges, governors, and mayors on Registered Apprenticeships.” Yet “Harris isn’t in favor of expanding all apprenticeships, only the ones controlled by the building trades.” Hmm: Donald Trump in 2017 “signed an executive order that allowed not only unions but also colleges, corporations and business organizations to manage training programs, which are concentrated in a handful of industries, mainly construction.” But unions “opposed the effort” and “the Biden-Harris administration rescinded the executive order.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"How did we come “to the precipice of a full-scale war between Israel and Iran?” asks The Free Press’ Eli Lake.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/opinion/let-israel-fight-kamalas-going-to-do-problem-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-8ckj8ypde-1727910599605.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727896314&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:49:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":258270220,"title":"Words the VP candidates used most often during the debate","text":"The most frequently mentioned word by the vice presidential candidates during Tuesday's debate, excluding routine and common words, was \"Trump.\"Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said former President Donald Trump's name 66 times in a rigorous defense of his running mate's record, more than the 44 times he mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was heavier on critiques of Trump, naming him 44 times and saying Harris' name 28 times. Walz took one of his first opportunities on a national stage to talk about his experience governing Minnesota, mentioning the state's name 26 times. Vance said \"Ohio\" five times. To take a closer look at the vice presidential candidates' rhetoric, CBS News analyzed the words they used in their only scheduled debate, and compared it to the words the presidential candidates used in the Sept. 10 debate. Here's what we found.Breaking down the words by topicLike Trump did during the presidential debate, Vance emphasized the issue of immigration, saying the word \"border\" 20 times, which was more than Trump's 12 mentions. Seven times, Vance said \"millions\" of people were entering the U.S. illegally. He also echoed Trump's false claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is over 20 million. The actual number is closer to 11 million.Vance described undocumented immigrants as \"aliens\" seven times, a term Trump only used once in his debate against Harris. Walz did not use the words \"illegal\" or \"alien\" at all, nor did Harris. Walz responded to questions on immigration by emphasizing Trump's efforts to prevent the bipartisan border bill from passing Congress, saying \"bill\" in reference to it eight times. The vice presidential candidates mirrored their running mates' approaches when it came to language around abortion. Vance said he wanted the U.S. to be more \"pro-family\" and \"pro-baby,\" and his rhetoric reflected that. He said \"baby\" or \"family\" 10 times in the context of abortion.Like Harris, Walz discussed abortion in terms of women's rights, saying the word \"women\" or \"woman\" nine times. He also described abortion as \"health care\" four times, something neither Vance or Trump did.When talking about the economy, Vance focused on high prices, mentioning \"price\" 10 times and \"afford\" or \"unaffordable\" 19 times, echoing common criticisms of rising prices during the Biden-Harris administration. While inflation spiked during the first two years of Biden's presidency, it is now at its lowest point since March 2021. Walz's rebuttals mentioned the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to negotiate drug prices, referencing prescription \"drugs\" or \"insulin\" six times. He also repeatedly emphasized job growth during the administration throughout the debate, using the word \"jobs\" seven times.The vice presidential candidates also discussed housing, more so than their running mates. Walz said \"house\" or \"home\" 28 times in the context of housing; Vance used those words 26 times. More time was dedicated to climate change than in either of the presidential debates this year. Vance focused on \"energy,\" using the word 12 times. He also used the word \"clean\" eight times when talking about climate. Both candidates said the word \"climate\" four times, a word Trump did not mention in either of his debates this year. How the candidates referred to each other and their running matesIn total, Walz and Vance mentioned Trump 110 times; more than double the number of times Harris and Trump said the former president's name in their debate. Harris was mentioned by name 72 times, almost always by her full name. Vance sometimes referred to the Biden administration as the Harris administration, while President Biden only got seven mentions total from the vice presidential candidates. Vance also frequently addressed the moderators by name, saying \"Margaret\" 21 times and \"Norah\" eight times.When it came to addressing each other, Vance referred to Walz by his first name, Tim, 17 times, and by his full name or as \"Governor Walz\" 20 times. Walz referred to his opponent only as \"Senator Vance\" 15 times.","summary":"CBS News analyzed the words Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen.

October traditionally brings scary stuff to screens big and small, and 2024 is no exception. That’s evident in both sequels like Smile 2 and via returning series like American Horror Stories, which returns for another season on Hulu. There’s even the final season of the hilarious What We Do in the Shadows (which isn’t really scary but does have vampires). Popular returning favorites, meantime, include a new season of Apple TV+‘s Shrinking and a last go-around for Star Trek: Lower Decks on Paramount+. Here’s a few of October’s most promising offerings, scary and otherwise. And yes, there’s even a Bruce Springsteen documentary. What to Watch: October 2024 Movies and Shows From Joker: Folie à Deux to Saturday Night, these are the must-see movies, docs, and series that should be on your radar this month. Joker: Folie à Deux (Theaters, Oct. 4) Todd Phillips’ 2019 film Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix reimagined the Batman villain through the filter of a couple of Martin Scorsese movies. So what do you pay homage to in a sequel? Classic musicals, apparently. Lady Gaga joins the cast as Harleen Quinzel (hence the “à deux” of the title) in a film that picks up the action a few years after the events of the original. Get Tickets on Fandango The Franchise (HBO / Max, Oct. 6) What goes on behind the scenes of a big-budget superhero movie? Chaos, if this show is to be believed. With a creative team that includes Sam Mendes, Armando Iannucci, and Jon Brown and a cast that includes Himesh Patel, Aya Cash, and Jessica Hynes, the series follows the troubled production of a franchise entry that seems like it may never reach the screen. Watch on Max Teacup (Peacock, Oct. 10) “Teacup” doesn’t sound like the name of a scary show, but don’t be fooled. James Wan serves as executive producer of a series set in rural Georgia where a cast that includes Yvonne Strahovski and Scott Speedman have to face off against, well, something. The details of exactly what the threat they’re up against remains unclear. Maybe it’s just a scary teacup? (Probably not.) Watch on Peacock Piece by Piece (Theaters, Oct. 11) Morgan Neville has a filmography filled with documentaries about famous subjects, including Anthony Bourdain, Mister Rogers, and Steve Martin. Neville’s latest focuses on Pharrell Williams and uses a novel device to recount the musician’s life: Lego. It’s unexpected but, given the subject, kind of makes sense. Get Tickets on Fandango Saturday Night (Theaters, Oct. 11) SNL has been an institution for so long now that many of its viewers can’t remember a world in which it didn’t exist. The latest from Jason Reitman dramatizes the staging of the show’s very first episode, when it sometimes seemed like the show might not last to a second episode, much less five decades. Get Tickets on Fandango Disclaimer (Apple TV+, Oct. 11) Alfonso Cuarón often goes years between projects, making it that much more of an event when the Gravity and Roma director takes one on. Cuarón hasn’t worked in television for over a decade, and never as extensively as on this miniseries adaptation of Renée Knight’s 2015 novel of the same name, Disclaimer. Cate Blanchett stars as a journalist with a secret alongside Kevin Kline and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cuarón writes and directs all seven episodes. Watch on Apple TV+ The Apprentice (Theaters, Oct. 11) Who taught Donald Trump how to be the man he became? By most accounts, Trump’s father Fred had a lot to do with it, but so did Roy Cohn, the New York lawyer who first rose to fame by assisting the infamous Joseph McCarthy. A kind of origin story, Ali Abbasi’s film The Apprentice depicts the relationship between the two men during Trump’s early years, with Sebastian Stan starring as Trump alongside Jeremy Strong as Cohn. Get Tickets on Fandango Anora (Theaters, Oct. 18) The subject matter of The Apprentice helped make it one of the most talked-about films to play Cannes, but Palme D’Or went to a different sort of New York story, Anora. In the latest from Sean Baker (Red Rocket), Mikey Madison plays an exotic dancer whose life takes an unexpected turn (then another and another) after she meets Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), the young son of a Russian oligarch. Get Tickets on Fandango Goodrich (Theaters, Oct. 18) It’s been a big year for Michael Keaton so far, thanks to the success of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Where that film was an obvious throwback, Keaton’s other 2024 effort sounds a bit like a return to one of his earliest hits, Mr. Mom. In the second film from writer/director Hallie Meyers-Shyer (Home Again), Keaton plays an art dealer who has to figure out how to be a parent when his younger wife enters rehab. Advising him: his daughter, played by Mila Kunis. Get Tickets on Fandango Hysteria! (Peacock, Oct. 18) When a football player disappears under mysterious, possibly occult-related, circumstances, a local band decides to cash in by going full evil. Unfortunately, their choice might have unleashed forces beyond their control, including the paranoia of those around them. Co-starring Julie Bowen and Bruce Campbell, the new series’ story unfolds against the backdrop of the Eighties Satanic Panic, when many thought Satan might be lurking around every corner. Watch on Peacock Conclave (Theaters, Oct. 25) Adapting a novel by Robert Harris, the latest from All Quiet on the Western Front director Edward Berger stars Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tapped to facilitate the process of electing a new pope.

Get Tickets on Fandango Venom: The Last Dance (Theaters Oct. 25) One of the few bright spots in Sony’s attempts to create superhero movies featuring Spider-man’s supporting cast, the Venom films have wisely let star Tom Hardy lean into the absurdity of the body-sharing premise. Billed as the last in the series (we’ll see), the third entry is written and directed by Kelly Marcel, who’s served as screenwriter of the previous Venom films. Get Tickets on Fandango Nickel Boys (Theaters, Oct. 25) Inspired by an infuriating true story, Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-winning novel focuses on the friendship between two boys sentenced to an abusive Florida reform school in the Sixties.

The filing contains a litany of new, never-before-revealed information about the behavior of the 45th president – and those in his orbit – in the days, weeks, and months following his 2020 election loss. While the government alleges Trump and several co-conspirators spread “knowingly false claims of election fraud,” there were apparently some claims about the integrity of the election so outlandish that even Trump himself privately expressed doubts. In one instance, those rebuffed-by-Trump claims were made during a press conference by pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell, according to the brief. Later, when speaking with others about the allegations Powell released into the public sphere, Trump ridiculed them. On Nov. 19, 2020, Powell, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others presented a “Legal Challenges Update” during a flag-draped press conference in Washington, D.C., outlining several purported “paths to victory.” Those paths were premised on various kinds of litigation aimed at overturning the results in several swing states where President Joe Biden narrowly, but decisively, defeated Trump. Giuliani was first at the dais – where he largely spread false claims about election-rigging efforts in Philadelphia and Wisconsin. Then it was Powell’s turn. “What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China, and the interference with our elections here in the United States,” she said. “The Dominion voting systems, the Smartmatic technology software, and the software that goes into other computerized voting systems here, as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chavez to make sure he never lost an election after one constitutional referendum came out the way he did not want it to come out.” Later that same night, Trump watched then-Fox News personality Tucker Carlson criticize Powell, who likened her legal arguments to an unleashed Kraken, for her unwillingness to back up those claims, the brief alleges. After her widely-pilloried comments about the late Venezuelan president’s alleged connection to voting machine manufacturers, Carlson’s team invited her to appear on the show. “We would have given her the whole hour,” the then-host said. “We would have given her the entire week, actually, and listened quietly the whole time at rapt attention. But she never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of polite requests. When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her. When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they also told us Powell had never given them any evidence to prove anything she claimed at the press conference.” Later on, Trump and another person were discussing Powell’s performance during the press conference – and Carlson’s understanding of how Powell’s allegations fared. “He acknowledged to [redacted] that [Powell] had appeared ‘unhinged’ in the press conference,” the brief reads. The insults continued. “On November 20, the day after the press conference, the defendant made a similar comment to [redacted] and [redacted] two White House staffers who also volunteered for his Campaign,” the brief goes on. “In casual conversation after another meeting had ended, the defendant told [the first staffer] and [the second staffer] that [Carlson] had ‘eviscerated’ or ‘destroyed’ [Powell].” “While [Powell] responded, the defendant placed the call on mute and to [the first staffer] and [the second staffer] mocked and laughed at [Powell], called her claims ‘crazy,’ and made a reference to the science fiction series Star Trek when describing her allegations,” the brief says. But it was not just Trump and Carlson who made their issues with Powell’s unsupported theories known. Smith alleges that during “the same time period,” yet another trusted person “told” Trump that Powell’s “claims were unreliable and should not be included in lawsuits,” In response, Trump allegedly “agreed that he had not seen anything to substantiate [Powell’s] allegations.” On Nov. 22, 2020, Giuliani issued a statement distancing the Trump campaign from Powell – insisting she was “practicing law on her own.” Still, Powell managed to obtain the Trump imprimatur. “Nonetheless, the defendant continued to support and publicize [Powell’s] knowingly false claims,” the brief goes on. In the days that followed, Trump personally sent two tweets promoting Powell’s failed lawsuit alleging electoral fraud in Georgia. And that, Smith says, is of a piece with the fundamental artifice of the alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. “The throughline of these efforts was deceit,” Smith’s brief reads. And those efforts – derided by Smith as “lies” – were known to be lies by Trump and his co-conspirators, the brief alleges. “At its core, the defendant’s scheme was a private criminal effort,” Smith’s brief goes on. “In his capacity as a candidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis content consists of one paragraph.

Richard Rogers, 45, of Billings, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the speaker's office in just 75 minutes on Feb. 3, 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic Coast. The 12-person federal jury also found Rogers guilty on two counts of making harassing telephone calls: the ones to McCarthy's office plus 150 calls he made to an FBI tip line in 2021 and 2022. Rogers routinely made vulgar and obscene comments in those calls. Sentencing was set for January 31. He faces up to six years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the conviction for threatening to harm a member of Congress, and the other two counts each carry a maximum penalty of two years and a $250,000 fine. Threats against public officials in the U.S. have risen sharply in recent years, including against members of Congress and their spouses, election workers and local elected officials. Rogers' case was among more than 8,000 threats to lawmakers investigated by the U.S. Capitol Police in 2023, and officials expect another surge with the 2024 election. During a three day trial, Rogers testified that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy's office were a form of “civil disobedience.\" He and his attorneys argued that using obscenities with FBI operators and Congressional staff was protected as free speech under the First Amendment, which establishes the right “to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” But prosecutors said Rogers crossed the line with a threat on McCarthy’s life and by hurling abusive and sexual verbal tirades against the lawmaker's staffers and FBI operators. In the dozens of calls that were played for jurors, Rogers was heard asking for investigations of various alleged conspiracies involving the FBI and the administration of President Joe Biden. He was polite at times, but would quickly become angry and shout obscenities until the calls were disconnected. “You can’t talk to people that way. It’s common sense,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Godfrey said. “He’s calling not out of political protest; he’s calling because he gets enjoyment out of it.” The prosecutor told the jury there was no exception in federal law that says government employees can be subjected to harassment. “'Petitioning the government' — baloney,” Godfrey said. “Kevin McCarthy was the Speaker of the House. It’s not his job to shoot down spy balloons.” Rogers, a former telephone customer service representative, testified that he took to care to “edit” his comments on the phone to avoid any threats because he didn’t want to go to prison. He added that he never tried hide his actions and frequently offered his name and phone number when calling the FBI. “They were disrespectful to me, so I was disrespectful to them,” Rogers said. Defense attorney Ed Werner said Rogers “just wanted to be heard.” Rogers wore shirts depicting Captain America and other superheroes throughout the trial, including one Wednesday with the letters “MAGA” on the front, a reference to Donald Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan. A supporter of the former president, he said he was in Washington during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Godfrey said the case was not about politics but rather illegal harassment. Earlier this year, a 30-year-old Billings man was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in federal prison after leaving voicemail messages threatening to kill Montana Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester and his family. Another Montana man, from Kalispell, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison last year, also for making threats against Tester.","summary":"A Montana man has been convicted of threatening to assault former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/richard-rogers-ap-kevin-mccarthy-speaker-fbi-b2622993.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/00/US-McCarthy-Threatened_81670.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:45:53","author":"Matthew Brown","authors":["Matthew Brown"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":258269264,"title":"Biden, Harris Make First Visit to States Hit by Hurricane Helene","text":"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris made their first visit to areas impacted by Hurricane Helene on Oct. 2, after the devastating storm wreaked havoc on six states throughout the southeast. Biden visited South Carolina and North Carolina to tour the areas damaged. The White House stated that Biden will continue his tour with stops in Georgia and Florida on Oct. 3. Meanwhile, Harris traveled to Augusta, Georgia, to survey impacted areas and provide updates on the federal government’s response. More than 50 counties across Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, including the land owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, have been designated as major disaster areas by Biden. The president took off from Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, after speaking with several of South Carolina’s leaders, such as Gov. Henry McMaster, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Mayor Knox White of Greenville, South Carolina. His aerial tour aboard Marine One flew over devastated areas of both Carolinas, including Biltmore Village, Swannanoa, Asheville, Black Mountain, Chimney Rock, and Lake Lure. Among the visible debris were flattened buildings, homes still partially underwater, and fallen trees. The president was joined by North Carolina’s Gov. Roy Cooper, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Speaking to reporters during a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden announced he approved Cooper’s request for 100 percent federal reimbursement of all costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months. He also said that supplemental funding would be needed. “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected, and Congress has an obligation to ensure the states have resources they need,” he said. Biden’s and Harris’s visit to some impacted areas comes after former President Donald Trump arrived on the ground in Valdosta, Georgia, on Sept. 30. Trump criticized Biden for the federal government’s inadequate response to the situation. The president also faced scrutiny for spending the weekend at his beach house in Delaware. “I was commanding it,” Biden told reporters on Sept. 30 after delivering remarks at the White House about the federal government’s response. “I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I commanded it. It’s called a telephone.” Speaking to reporters on the way to South Carolina on Air Force One, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas defended Biden’s delayed visit to the area, stating that the president waited to avoid impeding the rescue efforts. At least 180 storm-related deaths have been reported, and hundreds are still missing. Recovery efforts at the federal, state, and local levels have been underway for nearly one week. More than $10 million has been provided directly to those affected by Hurricane Helene, according to the White House. “We have towns that disappeared, literally,” Mayorkas said, emphasizing the severity of the storm. He stressed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will run out of money in the event of another storm. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,” he said. “We are expecting another hurricane hitting. We do not have the funds. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), however, said Congress had already authorized the disaster relief funds needed for the immediate response. In comments made before prepared remarks at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 1, Johnson said FEMA’s relief fund was replenished with the three-month stopgap spending bill that Biden signed into law this past week. “Congress has previously provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,” Johnson said. The vice president visited Augusta’s emergency operations center where, along with the briefing, met with impacted families and business owners and visited a volunteer-run food distribution center. “I’ve been reading and hearing about the work you’ve been doing over the last few days, and I think it really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard,” she said to emergency operations officials. Harris described the devastation she saw in Georgia as “extraordinary.” “It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced, the loss of normalcy and the loss of critical resources,” she said, recalling a conversation she had with a woman who lost her husband. She praised federal, state, and local responders for the work done so far, and promised residents that the federal government was “here for the long haul.” “More than 4,800 personnel from across the Federal workforce are deployed and supporting state-led response efforts across the region,” Frank Matranga, director of FEMA’s individual assistance program, said during a media call on Oct. 1. In addition, more than 6,000 National Guard soldiers from 12 states have been activated, including nearly 4,000 in Florida and 700 in North Carolina. FEMA has shipped more than 8.8 million meals, over 7.4 million liters of water, more than 220,000 tarps, and 150 generators. The American Red Cross said it was housing more than 2,400 hurricane survivors in 75 shelters from Florida to North Carolina as of Sept. 30. While the overall number has decreased, North Carolina’s shelter population continues to increase. Officials in North Carolina confirmed that the state had more than 1,200 occupants in 29 shelters as of Oct. 2. The Red Cross also has provided nearly 5,000 personnel and 90 emergency response vehicles.","summary":"The president said, 'It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected.'","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-harris-make-first-visit-to-states-hit-by-hurricane-helene-5734270","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/02/id5734224-GettyImages-2175443146-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:40:07","author":"Emel Akan,T.j.

Even with that painfully low bar, I’d say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, “childless cat ladies” and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife. During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance’s dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally. “The rules that you were not going to fact-check,” Vance quipped, referring to CBS’ statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. “And since you’re fact checking me, I think it’s important to say what’s actually going on.” Vance talked over and interrupted both O’Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate. “Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,” Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance’s mic. “The audience can’t hear you because your mics are cut,” Brennan said. “We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,” she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones. Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious — one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies. One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan — a woman he does not personally know — by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance’s attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude. Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women’s trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy — yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem. “We’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said, before claiming that is “one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.” To demonstrate his party’s commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota’s PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says “trust me, I know what’s best for you” like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting. While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance’s faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny. “I speak from this very personally because I’m married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I’m so proud of her,” Vance began. “But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.” It’s telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn’t seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support — the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed. For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a “family care model that makes choice possible.” “The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,” Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a “family model” in the first place. Overall, it’s true that during Tuesday’s debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of “ordinary” is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it’s what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November.","summary":"JD Vance's performance during the vice presidential debate with Minnesota Gov.

The former president is currently seeking a second term in a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. \"At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one,\" prosecutors allege in the motion, unsealed Wednesday. \"He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.\" Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. Smith responded by filing another indictment in August, narrowing the allegations against Trump and claiming the former president was acting as a private candidate when he questioned his 2020 election loss. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers opposed the filing, which they described as \"tantamount to a premature and improper special counsel report,\" arguing that the public release of Smith's case violates Department of Justice policies and could influence the election. Trump also blasted the timing of the document's unsealing, calling it \"election interference\" following Tuesday night's debate and with less than five weeks before the election. \"Democrats are weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am winning, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris,\" Trump wrote Wednesday in a post on Truth Social. \"The DOJ pushed out this latest 'hit job' today because JD Vance humiliated Tim Walz last night in the debate,\" Trump added. \"The Democrat party is turning America into a Third World country that tries to censor, harass and intimidate their political opponents.\" In Wednesday's filing, prosecutors identified witnesses they would call at a trial to testify against Trump, including election officials in battleground states and his White House deputy chief of staff. \"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. \"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Mike Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on Jan. 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the U.S. Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification,\" prosecutors alleged in the filing. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called the filing \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional.\" \"Deranged Jack Smith and Washington D.C., radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,\" Cheung claimed Wednesday. \"President Trump is dominating, and the radical Democrats throughout the deep state are freaking out.

But new voter data shows that Democrats may make the Lone State State more competitive in 2024 than it's been in decades. According to the San Antonio Express-News, Texas has seen a surge of both new residents and new voters since 2018, with the state adding more than 2.5 million new registered voters to its rolls in the past six years. The last time that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was up for reelection six years ago, he narrowly defeated then-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) by just roughly 215,000 votes statewide. New voters don't necessarily mean more favorable territory for Democrats. Republicans prevailed in both the 2020 presidential and 2022 gubernatorial elections, for example. But the Express-News reported that many of the new voters added have been in some of Texas' bluest areas, including the I-35 corridor from Laredo to the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area, the Houston metro area and in Austin and the surrounding counties. READ MORE: Republicans admit Texas is 'too close for comfort' as Ted Cruz's Senate race narrows In Harris County alone (which houses Houston), more than 670,000 new voters have been added to the rolls. Harris County went from being one of the reddest metropolitan areas in the United States to eventually voting for Barack Obama by just a few thousand ballots in 2008. However, in 2020, President Joe Biden carried the county with 56% of the vote, earning 217,000 more votes than former President Donald Trump. \"They’re terrified,\" Harris County commissioner Rodney Ellis, who is a Democrat, said of Republicans in an interview with the Express-News. Ellis pointed out that in response to the growing number of Democrats registering to vote in Harris County — where 16% of Texas' population lives — Texas' Republican-dominated legislature has taken several steps to weaken their opponents' influence in the Democratic stronghold. In 2021, this meant gerrymandering Harris County's three congressional districts in order to protect Republican members of the House of Representatives from losing their reelection bids. Texas Republicans have also curbed Harris County's efforts to make voting easier and more accessible, ranging from decreasing the number of ballot drop boxes to just one per county in 2020 to restricting drive-by and all-night voting. The Lone Star State's largest county has also been subjected to numerous lawsuits from Republicans over how it conducted its 2022 election.

Travis County, Texas Republican Party chairman Matt Mackowiak recently said in a memo that Texas was \"too close for comfort\" and that his party should treat Texas like a battleground state. \"We are in a competitive state and we are not going to win just sitting on our laurels,\" Texas Republican strategist Dave Carney, who has advised the campaigns of both Governors Greg Abbott and Rick Perry, told the Express-News.

Biden flew into the Carolinas and his deputy headed to Georgia after Harris’s election rival Donald Trump sought to turn their handling of the disaster into campaign fodder. Biden arrived in South Carolina and greeted officials who briefed him on the sprawling rescue and recovery effort – an operation featuring more than 10,000 federal officials, emergency responders and National Guard across the US southeast after the enormous storm left at least 159 people dead in six states. He then flew by helicopter over the flood-hit city of Asheville, North Carolina, where staggering destruction was visible below including collapsed bridges, lakes filled with debris, buildings demolished and roads washed away. US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, travelling with the president, described Helene as a storm of “historic strength” that brought calamitous flooding to cities and remote mountain communities. “We have towns that have disappeared, literally,” he said. “This is a multibillion-dollar, multi-year recovery.” Biden announced the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to North Carolina to boost emergency response efforts including the “fight to save lives” in devastated communities. “These soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food, water, and medicine to isolated communities in North Carolina,” the president said in a statement. “We are here for you – and we will stay here for as long as it takes.” Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee for the November 5 election, flew separately to the southern state of Georgia, which has also been badly hit. She visited an operations centre in Augusta where she praised emergency workers and the ongoing response. “It really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard,” Harris said. Afterward she met residents in a storm-ravaged Augusta neighbourhood. Debris was scattered across the road and toppled trees were visible, including one that fell on a house. North Carolina and Georgia are two of the seven crucial swing states likely to decide the result of the US election. Early voting has already begun in several states. The White House announced Biden will also travel on Thursday to Florida, where Helene roared ashore last week as a Category 4 hurricane, and Georgia. Deluges triggered by Helene have caused huge damage in the Appalachian Mountains, with towns and villages cut off. In Tennessee, a massive search operation was under way near the Nolichucky River, where the water flow had reached record levels. “There are people still missing,” Governor Bill Lee told a press conference. “We’re in the middle of what is a remarkably difficult and tragic unfolding in east Tennessee.” The Biden and Harris visits come a day after the vice presidential candidates, Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Walz, faced off in television debate – the last scheduled onstage showdown before election day. The pair acknowledged common ground about the storm response, with Vance saying: “We want as robust and aggressive a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible.” But Republican former US president Trump earlier sought to make political capital out of the disaster, accusing the Biden administration, without evidence, of ignoring the crisis and denying help to his supporters. Responding to the accusations, Biden told reporters Monday that Trump was “lying” and termed his attacks “irresponsible”. The political storm over Helene comes as Biden and Harris endure a series of crises with barely a month until the knife-edge election. As they coordinate the hurricane response, Biden and Harris are also contending with escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and a strike by dockworkers that threatens the country’s economy, a major issue ahead of the November 5 poll.","summary":"Trump has been seeking to turn the administration’s handling of the disaster into campaign fodder.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3280866/joe-biden-and-kamala-harris-visit-areas-devastated-hurricane-helene","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/03/fcd0d8a2-be8a-41ba-b386-0f6794fd166e_f1b324df.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:28:22","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":258269100,"title":"Republican senator plans to combine healthcare reform and extension of Trump-era tax cuts into a comprehensive bill for 2025.","text":"As Donald Trump calls for overhauling the Affordable Care Act with a new health care system, one Republican senator running for an influential leadership position says the party should combine that pursuit with a major tax bill in the new year. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told NBC News after the vice presidential debate in New York Tuesday night that if voters elect Trump and GOP-controlled Congress, Republicans will be able to “make health care more affordable, more tailored and more personalized than the one size fits all option,” referring to the ACA, or Obamacare. “We’ll have an opportunity next year, when it comes time to extend the Trump tax cuts, to adopt new policies that again will make health care more affordable and more personalized,” Cotton said. “Because a lot of health care in this country does go through our tax code. So I think that’ll be a very good opportunity next year.” Republicans are widely eyeing an extension of the Trump tax law as major portions of the 2017 measure expire at the end of next year, calling it necessary to prevent a tax hike on Americans. Cotton, who is running to the be No. 3 Republican senator next as part of a leadership shuffle, said the GOP can attach health care changes to an extension of the Trump tax cuts through the filibuster-proof “reconciliation” process on spending and taxes; that would allow them to pass both major policy bills at once with only Republican votes if they secure majorities in Congress. “Because the Democrats have become so obstructionist on President Trump, the opportunity to pass major legislation next year will probably be centered on the extension of the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in addition to other measures,” Cotton said. Trump has called Obamacare “lousy” and said he wants to replace it, but has not offered an alternative plan, saying during the Sept. 10 presidential debate he has “concepts of a plan” to remake the health care system without getting specific. The Trump campaign has not provided a timeline for when he will release a plan. Kamala Harris is running TV ads attacking Trump’s push to reopen the ACA debate, saying he would seek to repeal the ACA, which would rescind subsidies that help Americans buy coverage and undo regulations that prevent insurers from charging people with preexisting conditions higher prices. Even if they sweep the election, it’s far from clear Republicans would find enough support to revive their fight against the ACA, now that the law has grown popular. Many GOP lawmakers prefer to close that chapter after exit polls indicated that they paid a price in the 2018 and 2020 elections for trying to repeal it. But Trump’s influence over the party will likely grow if he wins this fall. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee that oversees tax and health care policy, said Congress will scrutinize Trump’s litany of expensive proposals in a tax bill. They include extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and on Social Security income, among others projected to cost trillions of dollars. “Great to have a discussion, but at the end of the day, we’re going to have to either get 51 or 60 votes — 51 through reconciliation or 60 votes to change these things,” Tillis said. “That’s when the pay-fors and the impacts have to be taken into account.” Tillis was referring to the fact that Senate rules impose budgetary constraints on what can pass through the 51-vote reconciliation process, which Republicans will have to contend with. “So we’ll take all these in but we can’t be everything to everybody all at once,” he said. “We’ve got to pass something, likely through reconciliation, and we’ll just have to see how those priorities play out — and how we pay for it.” In 2017, Trump and Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the ACA but failed. Months later, Cotton successfully persuaded the party to use the separate tax law to zero out the ACA’s individual mandate (which required people to pay a penalty if they did not get insurance), a policy that went through the tax code. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who’s running to be the next Senate GOP leader, said the scope of reconciliation has expanded “significantly” and that it gives Republicans “an opportunity to address hopefully tax policy as well as perhaps some other achievable things.” He didn’t suggest a health care overhaul would be one of them, but he made clear that a tax bill is inevitable to prevent a tax hike. “Clearly, we’ve got to do something,” Thune said.

She devoted substantial space in her book to voice seemingly unconditional support for abortion access, saying there was “no room for negotiation” on the matter. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” the former first lady wrote. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,” she added, a position in opposition to her husband. “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,” she continued. The former first lady wrote that support for abortion access was “a very straightforward concept” and inseparable from human rights. She went a step further and said that any cultural stigma around abortion should be removed. “When confronted with an unexpected pregnancy, young women frequently experience feelings of isolation and significant stress. I, like most Americans, am in favor of the requirement that juveniles obtain parental consent before undergoing an abortion,” she wrote. “I realize this may not always be possible. Our next generation must be provided with knowledge, security, safety, and solace, and the cultural stigma associated with abortion must be lifted.” Trump then expressed support for abortion access activists and protesters. “The slogan ‘My Body, My Choice’ is typically associated with women activists and those who align with the pro-choice side of the debate,” the outlet cited her as writing. “But if you really think about it, ‘My Body, My Choice’ applies to both sides — a woman’s right to make an independent decision involving her own body, including the right to choose life. Personal freedom.” The former first lady’s comments are sure to draw ire from many within the Republican Party, which has largely maintained its opposition to abortion though has put the issue on the back burner in most elections.

Meanwhile, President Biden spent about an hour flying over Asheville, N.C., by helicopter. “You can see homes that are moved, clearly, from one side of the river, down the river to another side,” he said. “Communities like Chimney Rock are reduced to piles of wood and debris.” Biden and Harris are trying to reassure residents hurt by the massive storm that the federal government will help the region recover. Making good on that promise is a critical test for the administration in this election year, particularly in the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia, where Biden and Harris visited. But Biden said it wasn't about politics. “At a moment like this, we put politics aside — at least, we should put it all aside, and we have, here,” Biden said at a briefing at an emergency operations center in Raleigh, N.C. “There are no Democrats, Republicans — only Americans — and our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can,” he said. Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months for North Carolina, as requested by its Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. He also directed up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to be deployed to help the North Carolina National Guard deliver food, water and medicine. In Georgia, Harris said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for the state, as requested by its Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp was not with her for the tour. The White House also announced that Biden had authorized 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for Florida — a state he plans to visit on Thursday. Biden will also make a stop on Thursday in Valdosta, Ga. That's where former President Donald Trump was on Monday, where he, too, said that disasters transcend politics. “As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,\" Trump said. But during his stop, Trump falsely said Gov. Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. “He’s been calling the president, hasn’t been able to get him. But they’ll come through, I’m sure,” Trump said. Biden later that day angrily criticized Trump. “He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,” Biden said, noting he had spoken with Kemp. “I don't know why he [Trump] does this. And the reason I get so angry about it — I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are,” Biden said.","summary":"President Biden and Vice President Harris traveled to Georgia and North Carolina to reassure people that help is on the way.

Wade, Melania Trump has proudly professed her support for abortion and a woman’s right to choose in her forthcoming memoir, The Guardian is reporting. The former first lady made the extraordinary declaration in her memoir, “Melania,” which is to be published next Tuesday. Portions of the memoir were obtained by The Guardian. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” the wife of the Republican nominee wrote, amid a presidential campaign in which her husband’s threats to women’s reproductive rights have played a central role. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?” Melania Trump also wrote. “A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.” “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,” Melania Trump continued. “I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Melania Trump has not been much of a presence during her husband’s presidential campaign, and she has rarely expressed her political views in public, which makes her pro-choice statements so remarkable, The Guardian reported. Her views put her out of step with the anti-abortion platform of her husband’s Republican party and show her opposition to the deterioration of women’s reproductive rights under him and his MAGA movement. Trump has tried to take credit for the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and upheld a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, The Guardian said. But he’s also tried to avoid the political backlash the ruling has stoked by saying abortion rights should be decided by the states. At the presidential debate last month, Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, said, “Understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.” At the debate, Trump tried to sidestep the issue by denying the claims of his running mate, J.D. Vance, who said that former president would veto a federal ban. Trump said it was a “lie” that he would sign such a veto, explaining there was no reason to sign a ban “because we’ve gotten what everybody wanted.” But on Tuesday night, Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban. While Vance was debating Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, Trump wrote in an all-caps post on social media, “Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!)” But it’s hard to know whether to take Trump at his word on the matter of a national abortion ban, HuffPost reported. In addition to boasting about his role in reversing federal abortion protections, after nominating three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, he also once endorsed punishing women who get abortions with jail time. Moreover, he has surrounded himself with some of the most extreme anti-abortion advocates in politics, HuffPost said. That includes Vance, who has called for federal restrictions on traveling for abortion care and advocated for the surveillance of women’s menstrual cycles to prevent them from getting abortions.","summary":"'Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?' the former first lady writes, as her husband campaigns for president on an anti-abortion platform.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/02/melania-trump-declares-pro-choice-views-in-new-memoir-report/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2161997579.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:21:23","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":258271598,"title":"How Jack Smith’s giant motion tries to pass John Roberts’ vague test on Trump immunity","text":"Special counsel Jack Smith’s big immunity brief is here. The 165-page (somewhat redacted) motion lays out why, in the government’s view, the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling doesn’t stop Donald Trump from standing trial in his federal election interference case. As an example of what the motion seeks to accomplish, consider the discussion of the alleged evidence related to former Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump pressured to subvert the 2020 presidential election. To understand the Pence analysis, recall that Chief Justice John Roberts’ July 1 ruling in Trump v. United States granted absolute immunity for “core” presidential acts, presumptive immunity for all other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial acts. While the high court’s Republican-appointed majority said that it’s up to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to perform the immunity analysis in the first instance, the justices gave the Washington judge a head start in some parts, including with Pence. They said that whenever Trump and Pence discussed “their official responsibilities” — namely regarding Pence’s certification of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021 — they had engaged in “official conduct.” That means Trump would have presumptive immunity for those alleged actions, which Smith would need to rebut. Roberts’ opinion (rather vaguely) said that can be done by showing that the prosecution wouldn’t “pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” So that’s why Smith wrote in the motion that because that branch “has no role in the certification proceeding — and indeed, the President was purposely excluded from it by design — prosecuting the defendant for his corrupt efforts regarding Pence poses no danger to the Executive Branch’s authority or functioning.” (The vice president is involved in certification via the office’s role as president of the Senate.) The special counsel further wrote that Trump “sought to encroach on powers specifically assigned by the Constitution to other branches, to advance his own self-interest and perpetuate himself in power, contrary to the will of the people.” Therefore, Smith wrote, prosecuting Trump wouldn’t “pose any danger of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch; rather, it would advance the Constitution’s structural design to prevent one Branch from usurping or impairing the performance of the constitutional responsibilities of another Branch.” Smith’s team also made clear in the filing that prosecutors intend to introduce more evidence at trial related to Pence, who is not accused of any wrongdoing. For instance, they want to introduce evidence of what they call unofficial communications that Trump had with Pence in their capacity as candidates (not as president and vice president), including when Pence “tried to encourage” Trump “as a friend” when news networks began to call the 2020 race for Joe Biden, and later when Pence suggested that Trump should recognize the process was over and run again in 2024. Even if those communications were deemed “official,” Smith wrote, the immunity presumption would be rebutted there too, he argued. To be sure, the Pence evidence is only part of the case that Smith wants to bring against Trump, who has pleaded not guilty. And if the former president wins next month’s presidential election, he’ll be empowered to dismiss the case entirely. But if Trump loses, then Chutkan would have a heavy task ahead in weighing the voluminous allegations and evidence Smith presents in the monster filing and deciding whether it passes the high court’s (again, rather vague) immunity test. Ultimately, whatever the judge rules will be subject to review again by the justices before any trial can go forward. That won’t happen before the election. The case will either be killed soon by way of a Trump victory or will linger on for months, if not years, to first determine whether the Supreme Court will even let Trump stand trial over any of these allegations.

The 165-page filing on Wednesday is likely the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the November 5 election given there will not be a trial before Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The filing lays out a sweeping account of Trump’s conduct following the 2020 election, much of which has already been made public through news reports, findings from the House committee that investigated the Capitol riot or the indictment obtained by Smith in the case. It includes an allegation that a White House staffer heard Trump tell family members that “it doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell”. It also alleges that on January 1, 2021, Trump told his vice president, Mike Pence, that people “are gonna hate your guts” and “think you’re stupid” if he didn’t use his role presiding over the January 6 congressional certification of the election result to benefit Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election, defraud the US out of accurate results and interfere with Americans’ voting rights. Prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith divulged their evidence to make the case that the remaining allegations against Trump survive the US Supreme Court’s ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken as president. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the disclosures, saying, “This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.” Trump has dismissed this case and multiple other criminal prosecutions he faced this year as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power. The filing provides details of conversations with senior officials in Trump’s administration including Pence and White House chief-of-staff Mark Meadows, who appeared before the grand jury during the investigation. Prosecutors submitted the court filing on Thursday, but US District Judge Tanya Chutkan had to approve proposed redactions before it was made public. Trump’s lawyers opposed allowing Smith to issue a sweeping court filing laying out their evidence, arguing it would be inappropriate to do so weeks before the election. They have argued the entire case should be tossed out based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. If Trump wins the election, he is likely to direct the Justice Department to drop the charges.","summary":"A US judge has made public a court filing in which federal prosecutors laid out their evidence accusing former US president Donald Trump of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat.

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told NBC News after the vice presidential debate in New York Tuesday night that if voters elect Trump and GOP-controlled Congress, Republicans will be able to “make health care more affordable, more tailored and more personalized than the one size fits all option,” referring to the ACA, or Obamacare. “We’ll have an opportunity next year, when it comes time to extend the Trump tax cuts, to adopt new policies that again will make health care more affordable and more personalized,” Cotton said. “Because a lot of health care in this country does go through our tax code. So I think that’ll be a very good opportunity next year.” Republicans are widely eyeing an extension of the Trump tax law as major portions of the 2017 measure expire at the end of next year, calling it necessary to prevent a tax hike on Americans. Cotton, who is running to the be No. 3 Republican senator next as part of a leadership shuffle, said the GOP can attach health care changes to an extension of the Trump tax cuts through the filibuster-proof “reconciliation” process on spending and taxes; that would allow them to pass both major policy bills at once with only Republican votes if they secure majorities in Congress. “Because the Democrats have become so obstructionist on President Trump, the opportunity to pass major legislation next year will probably be centered on the extension of the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in addition to other measures,” Cotton said. Trump has called Obamacare \"lousy\" and said he wants to replace it, but has not offered an alternative plan, saying during the Sept. 10 presidential debate he has “concepts of a plan” to remake the health care system without getting specific. The Trump campaign has not provided a timeline for when he will release a plan. Kamala Harris is running TV ads attacking Trump’s push to reopen the ACA debate, saying he would seek to repeal the ACA, which would rescind subsidies that help Americans buy coverage and undo regulations that prevent insurers from charging people with preexisting conditions higher prices. Even if they sweep the election, it’s far from clear Republicans would find enough support to revive their fight against the ACA, now that the law has grown popular. Many GOP lawmakers prefer to close that chapter after exit polls indicated that they paid a price in the 2018 and 2020 elections for trying to repeal it. But Trump’s influence over the party will likely grow if he wins this fall. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee that oversees tax and health care policy, said Congress will scrutinize Trump’s litany of expensive proposals in a tax bill. They include extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and on Social Security income, among others projected to cost trillions of dollars. “Great to have a discussion, but at the end of the day, we’re going to have to either get 51 or 60 votes — 51 through reconciliation or 60 votes to change these things,” Tillis said. “That’s when the pay-fors and the impacts have to be taken into account.” Tillis was referring to the fact that Senate rules impose budgetary constraints on what can pass through the 51-vote reconciliation process, which Republicans will have to contend with. “So we’ll take all these in but we can’t be everything to everybody all at once,” he said. “We’ve got to pass something, likely through reconciliation, and we’ll just have to see how those priorities play out — and how we pay for it.” In 2017, Trump and Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the ACA but failed. Months later, Cotton successfully persuaded the party to use the separate tax law to zero out the ACA’s individual mandate (which required people to pay a penalty if they did not get insurance), a policy that went through the tax code. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who’s running to be the next Senate GOP leader, said the scope of reconciliation has expanded “significantly” and that it gives Republicans “an opportunity to address hopefully tax policy as well as perhaps some other achievable things.” He didn’t suggest a health care overhaul would be one of them, but he made clear that a tax bill is inevitable to prevent a tax hike. “Clearly, we’ve got to do something,” Thune said.

First charter flight carrying Britons out of Lebanon touches down in Birmingham as blasts continue ringing out in Beirut and death toll skyrockets Do YOU know anyone on the flight? Email lettice.bromovsky@mailonline.co.uk By Lettice Bromovsky Published:23:45 BST, 2 October 2024 |Updated:00:15 BST, 3 October 2024 e-mail View comments The first charter flight carrying Britons out of Lebanon has touched down in the UK. The Dan Air plane landed at Birmingham International Airport shortly before 8.40pm, having departed from Beirut and stopped off in Bucharest, Romania, on its journey. David Lammy confirmed the flight on Monday just hours before Israel announced the start of a 'localised and targeted' ground operation in southern Lebanon. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependents in Lebanon. Further flights are planned for Thursday and over the coming days. While a separate scheduled Middle East Airlines service also already brought Britons back to the UK. The Dan Air plane touched down at Birmingham International Airport shortly before 8.40pm Smoke rises following an Israeli military strike, in Kafr Kila village, southern Lebanon The foreign secretary said: 'The first charter flight taking British nationals out of Lebanon has now departed. We have arranged another flight for tomorrow, and further flights over the coming days for as long as there is demand and it is safe to do so.' He also previously added: 'The situation in Lebanon is volatile and has potential to deteriorate quickly. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon continues to be our utmost priority.

It is vital that you leave now as further evacuation may not be guaranteed.' Defence Secretary John Healey met military personnel preparing for a potential evacuation of Britons from Lebanon. He also thanked RAF personnel involved in the operation to protect Israel as it came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles. Two Typhoon fighter jets, supported by a tanker aircraft, were involved in the operation although the Ministry of Defence said that because of the nature of the attack, which involved ballistic missiles, 'they did not engage any targets'. The MoD said the aircraft 'played an important part in wider deterrence and efforts to prevent further escalation'. There are concerns in Whitehall that further military activity by Israel could result in the closure of the airport, cutting off the most straightforward exit route for the estimated 4-6,000 British nationals in Lebanon.

I have every confidence in our ability to do the job if required. 'But for now our government advice to all Brits in Lebanon is get out now.' He added that the importance of being able to get Britons out of Lebanon had been made clear to the Israeli government. 'It's vital that we as nations, if we have to, are able to get our nationals out of Lebanon safely,' he said. 'Israel understand that, they understand that well, and we will continue to make that case.' The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate around 50 villages and towns across southern Lebanon as its activities continue. Flames rise from an apartment which caught fire after an Israeli airstrike in Dahieh, Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2024 Israeli soldiers march along a road in southern Lebanon after crossing from northern Israel Wednesday Aug. 9, 2006 Israel has also promised to retaliate for the Iranian missile attack, something which could trigger a wider war in the region. Mr Healey said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Galant, to assure him the UK offered 'steadfast' support but to say that 'our big concern is to avoid this conflict spiralling into a wider regional war'. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, in Brussels for talks with European Union chiefs, said: 'We do need to pull back from the brink and to encourage all parties to find a way to de-escalate and for a political solution to the very many fronts of the crisis in the Middle East.' Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles fired by Iran on Tuesday while Tehran claimed most had hit their targets.

The former first lady shockingly writes that she’s ‘carried this belief’ for her ‘entire adult life’. The Guardian has obtained a copy of her book ‘Melania’, which will be released Tuesday and tells how she holds starkly different views on abortion than her husband, former President Donald Trump, and the current Republican nominee. ‘It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,’ the former first lady writes. ‘Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,’ she continues. ‘Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,’ she says. ‘I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.’ This eyebrow-raising admission comes as just one month before her husband battles it out in the presidential election with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, with abortion rights set to be one of the most decisive issues among voters. Harris has framed herself as the ‘pro-choice’ candidate, while Trump has struggled to find a clear position on abortion. As president, he was widely credited for helping to pave the way for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that federally gave women a right to an abortion. Trump appointed three of the conservative justices who voted in 2022 overturn Roe. While that decision has been cheered by the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party, the former president has realized that the GOP has found itself imperiled over that stance. Since the 2022 ruling, Democrats have had a succession of election wins by campaigning on the issue. It is thought that Republicans underperformed during the 2022 midterms becuase of abortion. In August, Trump exclusively told DailyMail.com that he might vote to end Florida’s draconian six-week abortion ban when it comes up in a referendum later this year. However, he has avoid committing to using the presidential veto if a nationwide federal ban were to arrive on his desk as president, saying instead that it will be up to states to decide their own laws. In her memoir, Melania writes that ‘occasional political disagreements between me and my husband’ are ‘part of our relationship,’ adding that she believes in ‘addressing them privately rather than publicly challenging him.’ Later in the book, she explains why she’s supportive of abortion rights. ‘I have always believed it is critical for people to take care of themselves first,’ she said. ‘It’s a very straightforward concept; in fact, we are all born with a set of fundamental rights, including the right to enjoy our lives.’ ‘We are all entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence,’ she continued. ‘This common-sense approach applies to a woman’s natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.’ Floridians are being asked to vote ‘yes’ to overturn the six-week limit. ‘I want more than six weeks,’ he said at Mar-a-Lago. I think six weeks is a mistake.’ Days later he said he would vote ‘no’ on the referendum instead, after his comments irritated anti-abortion activists in his party. More recently, Trump finally said he would veto a federal abortion ban. He did so in the middle of Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, after refusing to clarify his position during last month’s presidential debate. His rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have pushed that if Trump is allowed back in office abortion rights could be gone nationwide.

Tim Walz as her running mate at the top of her list of mistakes. Much of America got to know Walz for the first time during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. Unlike his appearance at the Democratic National Convention, the Walz we saw on the debate stage didn’t have his words written for him in a teleprompter. And the unfiltered version underscored a very obvious fact about the governor: He is patently fake. For starters, how about this “Coach Walz” nonsense, which he broached yet again on Tuesday. Let’s be real, being an assistant volunteer coach isn’t exactly something to brag about. Walz always leaves out the “assistant volunteer” part of the title, to make himself out to be the second coming of Vince Lombardi. Then there was Walz’s goofy ’80s-sitcom-dad shtick that’s meant to be endearing and relatable but is as cringe as one of Kamala’s fraudulent accents. Just check out his answer to the question about why he’s claimed to be in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests when he was actually in Nebraska. “I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I’ve tried to do the best I can, but I’ve not been perfect,” he said. “And I’m a knucklehead at times, but it’s always been about that.” How comforting to know a self-described knucklehead could be one heartbeat away from controlling the nuclear codes. This filibuster of an answer went on for a full two minutes without addressing why he had lied about being in China at that critical moment, prompting co-moderator Margaret Brennan to press him for an actual response. “Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?” she asked. “No,” he said. “All I said on this was . . . I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that’s what I’ve said.” Ah, he misspoke. Who among us hasn’t made such a flub, stating we were in Asia when we were actually on the other side of the world? The phony lied — just like he lied about serving in war zones when in reality he ditched his National Guard unit when it was about to be deployed to Iraq. Walz’s closing statement was a doozy that underscored his fundamental fakery. “Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She’s bringing us a politics of joy,” he said with a straight face. “She’s bringing real solutions for the middle class.” It was truly stunning to hear this lame used-car-salesman patter as Walz tried to convince us that the sitting vice president, whose administration is responsible for this disastrous economy, is the change candidate “bringing us a new way forward” while we all bask in her “politics of joy.” Kamala has been in office for more than 1,350 days, yet we’re supposed to pretend the Biden-Harris administration never happened. Walz was chosen primarily for his Midwestern, regular-guy appeal, which the Democratic brain trust was sure would win the loyalty of blue-collar men in key swing states. Harris can’t win without the Rust Belt, hence Walz’s berth on the ticket — even though she had the option of popular Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. But a pre-debate New York Times/Siena poll deflated that expectation: Walz, it turns out, is struggling in the heartland. He’s seen favorably by just 44% of voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, for example; in Ohio, that number drops to 41%. And men haven’t flocked to his side: A CBS poll taken before the debate found that Walz is seen favorably by 58% percent of women, but only 48% of men. Acting silly and effeminate will do that. After hiding from the press for weeks, Tim Walz had an awful night on Tuesday — so it may be the last most voters see of him before Election Day. That’s what happens when you get exposed as being as phony as a $3 bill.

The memoir will cover aspects of Melania's personal life, the 2020 election and the assassination ... [+] attempt against her husband, Donald Trump. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts Melania Trump writes in the memoir that women must be guaranteed “autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” The Guardian reported. The former first lady writes that a woman’s individual liberty gives her the “authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,” adding restrictions on a woman’s right to choose “is the same as denying her control over her own body.” The memoir, scheduled for release next Tuesday, says Melania has held the belief throughout her “entire adult life.” Melania’s stance clashes with that of her husband’s, who supports states enforcing their own abortion policies, though he recently said he would veto a national abortion ban if the legislation reached him during a second term.

Key Background Donald Trump, who made conservative appointments to the Supreme Court resulting in the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has supported states determining their own abortion policies. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, 20 states have banned or restricted abortion earlier in the stages of pregnancy than what was established by Roe v. Wade, according to The New York Times. However, the former president stopped short of supporting a national ban on abortion after being coy about the matter, saying in a Truth Social post this week he “would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances.” Melania Trump’s stance on abortion was largely unclear prior to her memoir. The memoir will dive into details about the former first lady’s private life, which she said in a video last month “has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation.” The book will also cover the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and his loss in the 2020 election.

Although the surveys show former President Donald Trump trailing by less than the margin of error, Cook Political Reporter now lists Harris as ahead in a multi-candidate field in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump still maintains a slight — within the margin of error — lead in Georgia. Overall, Cook says Harris leads Trump 49% to 48% in a head-to-head matchup, and by 49% to 47% in a field that includes third-party options. “Underneath the topline numbers, though, there have been some significant shifts, most notably Trump’s slipping advantage on his two strongest issues — inflation and immigration,” Cook wrote of their poll. The Vice President, according to the pollsters, hasn’t escaped her own downward trends in support. Cook found Independents now lean left by just a two-point margin, down from an eight point split found in August. Despite the shift among Independents, for the first time this election cycle most voters think the Democratic party will retain the White House, according to Cook. “A plurality of swing state voters now think that a Democrat will win the presidential election. This month, 46% of voters think Harris will win, compared to 39% who think it will be Trump. That represents an 11-point swing in Harris’ favor since August, and suggests that Harris has been successful in presenting herself as a serious candidate, while Trump’s attempts to portray her as unable to do the job have not been effective,” they wrote. If Cook’s polling proves accurate — and Trump doesn’t slip in any other battleground jurisdictions — Harris could take the electoral college 303 to 235. A candidate needs 270 electors to win the White House. An Economist/YouGov national poll of more than 1,200 likely voters also released on Wednesday found Harris up by three points in a multi-candidate field, within the 3.1-point margin of error. A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey of 1,001 likely voters shows the Vice President ahead by five points, just outside that poll’s 3.2% margin. Morning Consult’s massive weekly national survey of more than 11,000 likely voters showed the same rightward shift among Independents found by Cook, but it also found that isn’t enough to put Trump ahead. “Harris leads Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, 51% to 46%, matching her advantage last week. Trump has seen a bit of an improvement in his numbers among independent likely voters, while Harris’ position is bolstered by some of her best numbers to date among those who voted for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election,” they wrote.","summary":"Cook Political Reporter now shows the Vice President ahead of the 45th President in six of seven swing states.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/02/polls-show-tight-presidential-race-even-as-harris-takes-slight-swing-state-lead/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_77988_4774cd.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:10:12","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":258267676,"title":"Jack Smith Has 77 Potential Witnesses in Donald Trump Election Case","text":"Special counsel Jack Smith lists 77 potential witnesses in an unsealed court filing that details election subversion evidence against former President Donald Trump.U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan on Wednesday released Smith's 165-page redacted document outlining the government's evidence against the Republican presidential nominee, who has pleaded not guilty to four federal felony charges related to attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss and to the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack that followed.Smith's document includes references to six unnamed co-conspirators who were previously referenced in Trump's indictment. It also mentions 77 possible witnesses identified by numbers following the letter \"P.\"While all of the names listed in Smith's filing have been redacted, some are easily identified by context clues like job titles and references to publicly available social media posts.Legal analyst Lisa Rubin said during an MSNBC appearance on Wednesday that she was surprised at the number of potential witnesses in Smith's filling, which contains evidence that will be used by Chutkan to determine whether the charges against Trump clash with his claim of presidential immunity.\"One of the things that pops out at me immediately is how many people here are identified just by 'P' numbers, meaning they're not people alleged to be co-conspirators, but they are people who are alleged witnesses or participants in the event,\" Rubin said. \"There are so many of them that even on Page 13, which is as far as I've gotten, there is a reference to P76.\"\"Many of these people are people who came from the campaign world,\" she continued. \"Anyone who worked for the [Trump] campaign alone and never was a member of executive branch staff, those contacts between them are, according to the government, fair game.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to Trump's office via email on Wednesday night.Smith filed an updated indictment of Trump in late August, retooling the case to comply with the Supreme Court's summer ruling that granted immunity to sitting presidents when conducting certain \"official\" acts.The new indictment removes all accusations leveled against Trump regarding attempts to pressure the Department of Justice to falsely declare that President Joe Biden's 2020 election win was the result of massive fraud.The 60-plus lawsuits filed by Trump and his associates alleging 2020 voter fraud were all rejected by courts across the country.Earlier this week, Trump's legal team filed a memo that attempted to persuade Chutkan to keep \"sensitive\" information under seal, while accusing Smith of wanting to release a \"politically motivated manifesto\" shortly before the November presidential election.Smith quickly filed a reply to the Trump team's memo, denying that he had any political motivations for prosecuting Trump and insisting that his plan to release the evidence was \"rooted in a faithful application of binding D.C. Circuit case law.\"\"The defendant's opposition includes his standard and unsupported refrain that the Government's position is motivated by improper political considerations,\" Smith wrote. \"That allegation is false—just as it was false when the Court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case on grounds of selective and vindictive prosecution.\"In her ruling authorizing the unsealing of Smith's document on Wednesday, Chutkan denounced Trump's team for accusing Smith of having a \"bad-faith partisan bias.\"\"These accusations, for which Defendant provides no support, continue a pattern of defense filings focusing on political rhetoric rather than addressing the legal issues at hand,\" Chutkan wrote.\"Not only is that focus unresponsive and unhelpful to the court, but it is also unbefitting of experienced defense counsel and undermining of the judicial proceedings in this case,\" she added.The judge also wrote that a request by Trump lawyers to redact the job titles and other context clues of potential witnesses would not be granted because the jobs of the people named were \"central\" to the evidence against the ex-president and would be needed for \"the public to understand the court's eventual decision on immunity.\"","summary":"A court document containing Smith's evidence against Trump in the federal election subversion case has been unsealed.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-has-77-potential-witnesses-donald-trump-election-case-1962946","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2486224/jack-smith-donald-trump-77-potential-witnesses.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:07:44","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":258269826,"title":"R.

Case in point: Former first lady Melania Trump shilled gold necklaces on X Wednesday, joining her husband Donald in exploiting their Trump brand to sell products and make a quick buck. The baubles are sold by USA Memorabilia, which also sells Trump-themed collectibles, coins Christmas ornaments, NFT trading cards, and, curiously, Melania’s new memoir. “Embrace boldness in your style this season with the ‘Vote Freedom’ necklace, which features the iconic Lady Liberty,” she wrote. “A tribute to America's enduring commitment to freedom, this piece is a statement of pride and empowerment.” On Sept. 21, the Republican presidential nominee released a social media ad in a bid to sell $100 coins with his face emblazoned on them. And on Thursday, a “limited edition” batch of Trump watches went on sale for up to $100,000. The rest of the models, some with bright MAGA-red faces and others red, white, and blue-themed, have a price range between $499 to $799. “This isn’t just any watch, it's one of the best watches made,” Trump said in the ad. “I love gold. I love diamonds. We all do. Only 147 of these extraordinary watches will ever exist in the world. And owning one puts you in a very exclusive club.” The coins, watches, gaudy gold sneakers, and new necklaces have all been introduced during an election year—when Trump happens to be a candidate vying for the highest office in the land. As the GOP nominee, Trump is an old hand when it comes to manipulating the media. He knows he’s getting publicity, and he’s using it as free advertising to sell his products. As Daily Kos reported in August, Trump had to submit his financial disclosures to the Office of Government Ethics. The documents showed that not only is Trump not as wealthy as he claims, but he makes the bulk of his money from various business ventures. He’s spent his lifetime profiting off his world-renowned name and political power. Since he was elected president in 2016, he’s made $300,000 selling Bibles, invested millions into cryptocurrency, and purchased as much as $250,000 worth of gold bars, according to his most recent financial disclosures. And together with his sons, Trump recently launched his own fishy cryptocurrency platform, called World Liberty Financial. The majority of his income, however, comes from his golf clubs and resorts. That includes the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, which generated $56.9 million, and the Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami, which generated $160.7 million. His Washington, D.C., hotel was a bust, but a House Oversight Committee investigation found he did manage to fleece foreign governments to the tune of $3.7 million. While he was leader of the free world, he collected a cool $160 million profit from foreign business ventures, according to his tax returns. Trump appointed his son-in-law Jared Kushner as a senior White House adviser and tasked him with leading multiple delegations representing the U.S. overseas. Kushner was later investigated by the House Oversight Committee for a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia in his private equity firm. Journalist David Cay Johnston described Trump’s shady dealings In his 2018 book “It’s Even Worse Than You Think.” “When it came to enriching himself and his family through his official position, Trump applied subtle techniques, like frequently visiting Mar-a-Lago and his golf courses, where the Secret Service paid full price for everything, including the golf carts to follow the president,” he wrote. Johnston reported that after becoming president, Trump doubled the resort’s membership fee to $200,000. Profiting off of your status as an elected official has long been frowned upon—if not outright illegal. There is a clear conflict of interest when a public servant uses their political power to ask domestic or foreign officials for favors, and it creates national security issues. Trump changed that when he seemed to have no problem ignoring those ethical boundaries—and his Republican minions in Congress gladly looked the other way.. As a businessman who has filed for bankruptcy six times, Trump found a way to use his political brand to make money off the backs of his MAGA faithful. And what good is a brand for if you don’t use it to make a sale? He’s been called a “con man” by members of his own party and those who knew him when he went into politics. He developed a reputation for stiffing contractors and laborers. The most recent lament over his moral failings came from former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani’s daughter Caroline Rose Giuliani, who wrote a sobering essay for Vanity Fair on how she lost her father to Trump. “The pit I felt in my stomach then was a warning, but I had no idea how much destruction my father would come to face due to his one-sided fealty to a con-man,” Caroline wrote. Just as Trump was impeached in 2019 when he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to dig up damaging information on his political rival Joe Biden, he knows no bounds when it comes to groveling and lying, if only to make a buck. He even ousted the head of the Republican National Committee and installed his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, who declared that the committee would spend “every single penny” on Trump and said GOP voters would “absolutely” like to see the RNC pay his legal bills. The concept of integrity and the notion that you should recuse yourself from any conflicts of interest while in public office don’t seem to faze the Trump family at all. Oh, but those watches sure do sparkle, don’t they?","summary":"The Trump family is the grift that keeps on grifting.\n\n\n\nCase in point: Former first lady Melania Trump shilled gold necklaces on X Wednesday, joining her husband Donald in exploiting their Trump brand to sell products and make a quick buck.

For the survey, 2,941 voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were polled by BSG and GS Strategy Group between September 19 and 25. In a head-to-head contest, the study found Harris has a wafer-thin 1-point lead over Trump, with 49 percent of the vote against the Republican candidate's 48 percent.\"Harris has a lead within the margin of error in Arizona (+2), Michigan (+3), Nevada (+1), Pennsylvania (+1), and Wisconsin (+2). Trump is ahead 49% to 47% in Georgia, and the two candidates are tied at 49% in North Carolina,\" the poll said.Trump received a major boost this week when a series of polls released on Tuesday suggested he is on course for victory in the key swing states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, though one did put him behind in Michigan. On Wednesday, Trump became the favorite to win November's election, according to Betfair, a leading bookmaker, following the vice-presidential debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz the previous evening.According to the latest Cook Political Report survey, Trump has a 5-point lead in the swing states over which candidate would be best to deal with the economy, with 50 percent support versus 45 percent for Harris. This is the same figure as in the last Cook Political Report Swing State poll conducted in August.However, Trump's lead on which candidate would be best at dealing with inflation evaporated over the same period, with the two rivals tied at 47 percent each, according to the latest poll. By contrast, in August, Trump lead on the issue by 6 points with 48 percent support against 42 percent for Harris. Some 60 percent of swing state voters said inflation is the part of the economy that \"concerns them the most,\" demonstrating the significance of this shift.In further bad news for Trump, who has made combatting inflation one of his key campaign priorities, the proportion of swing state voters who think the economy is \"getting worse\" has fallen since May.In the September survey, 46 percent of those polled said the economy is either getting better or staying the same, against 54 percent who said it is getting worse. By contrast, Cook Political Report surveys of swing states in August and May found 57 percent and 62 percent of voters respectively thought inflation was getting worse.The latest Cook Political Report said: \"Today, the gap between those who think inflation is getting better or staying the same and those who think it's getting worse is eight points — a 17-point decrease in economic pessimism over the last four months.\"And, while Trump is winning the 35% of voters who think the economy is getting 'a lot worse' by more than 50 points, Harris is holding her own with those who think inflation is 'getting a little worse' (42% to 55% for Trump), and leads Trump among the 46% of voters who think inflation is getting better or staying the same.\"Newsweek contacted representatives of the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris presidential election campaigns for comment via email.A recent study by polling guru Nate Silver found 12 states have shifted more towards Harris over the past month, against seven that have moved more in Donald Trump's direction.","summary":"Swing voters no longer think Donald Trump is the best candidate to tackle inflation according to a new survey.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-loses-advantage-top-economic-issue-new-poll-shows-1962987","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2486213/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:01:39","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":258269330,"title":"Rep.

In the poll she cited on X, 14% of voters picked her among a field of 13 candidates. Republican state Sen. Brian Dahle, who ran for governor against incumbent Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) in 2022, finished second with 5.3% of the vote. Among those who have declared, Antonio Villaraigosa, a former state Assembly speaker, led with 7.6% of the vote in front of a host of declared Democrats. Democratic California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis has also declared and received 4.5% support in the poll. Porter ran for Senate in the state this year but failed to advance to the general election, finishing third in the nonpartisan primary. She later claimed the primary was “rigged by billionaires.” Democrats criticized Porter heavily for her remarks, which sounded similar to past rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump. The former president used the word “rigged” to describe the 2020 presidential election. “It’s not rigged,” Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) told Politico. “As the former secretary of state of California, I can assure you of the integrity of the elections and the results.” Porter first rose to national prominence for her questioning of Wells Fargo executive Tim Sloan on various problems that had plagued the bank in 2019. Armed with a poster with a quote from the bank’s response to a federal lawsuit, Porter’s questioning went viral on social media. The then-freshman was reelected twice in an Orange County swing district in 2020 and 2022. Now, having declined to run for reelection in her district because of her failed Senate run, Porter is politically homeless. But her interest lately has pointed toward the top office in the state: governor.","summary":"Rep.

Smith seeks the green light to proceed with the case before Trump can dismiss it if he wins, based on the Supreme Court's July ruling on presidential immunity.Smith's election conspiracy case points to Trump's \"private criminal conduct\" in orchestrating the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump mobs stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the election's certification. President Joe Biden was certified as the winner but Trump has maintained his unfounded claims that the election was \"rigged.\"\"When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,\" according to the court filing, which redacted the names of others facing charges. \"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost.\"The motion claims that one \"co-conspirator\" called on operatives to \"create chaos\" and told Trump to \"make them riot\" in response to Biden's election win.

Trump instead took the advice of the unnamed co-conspirators in attempting to overturning the outcome, the motion said.\"When the defendant's White House staff participated in political activity on his behalf as a candidate, they were not exercising their official authority or carrying out official responsibilities,\" the motion said. \"And when the President, acting as a candidate, engaged in Campaign-related activities with these officials or in their presence, he too was not engaging in official presidential conduct.\"Smith is arguing that Trump's actions were not part of his official duties and therefore not immune from prosecution.

Debate experts widely gave Vance higher marks for his smooth delivery and ease during the debate, whereas Walz stumbled out of the gate and didn’t make the case against former President Donald Trump until the end of the first and only showdown between the vice presidential candidates. But Wednesday, as part of a broader media blitz, Walz didn’t hesitate to go on the offense against Vance, accusing Trump’s running mate of trying to mislead voters on the former president’s record. “You can’t rewrite history,” Walz told a crowd at the York Exposition Center’s UPMC Arena. “Trying to mislead us about Donald Trump’s record, that’s gaslighting. That’s gaslighting.” “‘Donald Trump tried to save Obamacare.’ Are you kidding me? He spent his entire presidency trying to eliminate it,” he said. After his arrival in nearby Middletown earlier Wednesday, Walz spoke with reporters at Harrisburg International Airport about his past misstatements regarding being in China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre when he was in Nebraska. In one of the most viral moments of his debate with Vance, Walz admitted to being a “knucklehead” who sometimes misspeaks. “Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong,” he said, saying he “was in Hong Kong in China” in August of 1989. “It was profound for me — that was the summer of democracy,” he said. Walz also addressed his other mistake from the debate, in which he said he had “become friends with school shooters” in an answer about gun control instead of the loved ones of school shooters’ victims. “I need to be more specific on that, but I am, I am passionate about this,” he said on the matter of gun violence. “I speak like everybody else speaks.” In Michigan, another blue-wall state, Vance also took a more aggressive approach and dinged his opponent for the school shooter gaffe. “That was probably only the third- or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night,” Vance said Wednesday, telling a crowd in Michigan he did not notice the remark in real-time. The Harris campaign has been spinning Walz’s performance as a win, contending the audience saw the governor’s authenticity compared to Vance’s slickness. The campaign has already clipped the election question moment for an ad called Vance’s “damning non-answer.” As part of his post-debate Pennsylvania bus tour, Walz underscored pressing Vance on whether Trump won the 2020 election, to which the senator replied he was looking to the future not the past. “I was speaking to the American people last night,” he said. “It felt especially in that moment for me that Sen. Vance was speaking to an audience of one.” In contrast to Tuesday, Walz criticized Vance’s gun policy positions and the senator’s scrutiny of the moderators for fact-checking him. Walz, who entered the arena on his bus, started by acknowledging the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Vice President Kamala Harris was also scheduled to be in York on Tuesday but ended up traveling to Georgia to assess the storm damage and the federal government’s response. Walz’s bus tour, which features Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a former President Joe Biden supporter, as a special guest, will also stop in Reading. Walz’s more aggressive post-debate travel will include rallies, smaller events, fundraisers, and targeted interviews in Arizona, California, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. His media engagements will range from two national TV interviews, a late-night appearance, and sit-downs with sports content creators and podcast hosts.","summary":"YORK, Pennsylvania — Gov.

Biden landed in Greer, South Carolina, where he was met by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, among others, before boarding Marine One for an aerial tour of the region. From the helicopter, Biden could see the grim devastation brought to parts of North Carolina, including Asheville and Chimney Rock. Over the Asheville metropolitan area, homes were smashed to bits, with the damage greatest near rivers, reporters in a trailing helicopter observed. Many of the people living in the area remained cut off from contact with the outside world, even as the U.S. president passed overhead. In Asheville’s River Arts District, set alongside the French Broad River, the receding floodwaters left behind chaos. Rescuers continue to scour the state’s mountains for survivors. “You can see homes that have moved clearly from one side of the river down the river to another side,” Biden said in Raleigh, North Carolina, before an operational briefing. “And I can only imagine what it’s like to have been in one of those homes.” “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected,” Biden said. Harris, meanwhile, was briefed in Augusta, Georgia, alongside Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff and Representative Rick Allen. She joined Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson to survey the city’s Meadowbrook neighborhood. “There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane and what has happened in terms of the aftermath of it,” Harris said, adding that she had spoken with a community member whose daughter lost her husband. “We are here for the long haul,” Harris said. “There’s a lot of work that’s going to happen.” Rebuilding will be extremely costly and take years, U.S. officials say. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican running against Harris in this year’s presidential election, has falsely claimed that Biden, a Democrat, has been unresponsive to the hurricane’s destruction, an allegation local officials deny. “In a moment like this, we put politics aside,” Biden said in Raleigh. “There are no Democrats, Republicans, there are only Americans. And our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can.” Before leaving Washington, Biden directed up to 1,000 active-duty troops to help with response and recovery efforts. Almost 6,000 members of the National Guard are deployed across the six states affected by the storm, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. Search-and-rescue teams have conducted nearly 1,500 structural evaluations and hundreds of rescues and evacuations, Mayorkas said. Biden also approved on Wednesday requests from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and North Carolina’s Cooper for federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months and six months, respectively. Biden will head to Georgia and Florida on Thursday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. Harris will travel to North Carolina in the coming days. More than $10 million has been provided directly to those affected by the storm, Jean-Pierre said. Over 4,800 personnel from across the federal workforce have been deployed to help in recovery efforts, along with 8.8 million meals, more than 7.4 million liters of water and 150 emergency power generators, said Mayorkas. Still, the Homeland Security secretary said federal funding may not be enough should another hurricane hit. “We are meeting the moment, but that doesn’t speak about the future,” Mayorkas said. “We are expecting another hurricane hitting. … FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” North Carolina and Georgia are among seven key battleground states in the Nov. 5 election, which is expected to be won by thin margins. Harris now leads Trump by 2.6 percentage points in national opinion polls, according to aggregator FiveThirtyEight. North Carolina election officials are scrambling to make sure the state’s over 7 million registered voters can cast a ballot in federal, state and local elections. Earlier this week, Trump visited Georgia. Presidents and presidential candidates usually do not visit a storm-hit region immediately because of fears they will distract from rescue efforts and divert resources from local law enforcement officials and emergency responders. Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida on Thursday as a powerful Category 4 hurricane before tearing a destructive path through Southeastern states for several days.","summary":"Biden toured parts of North and South Carolina while Harris visited Georgia, as the administration responds to a storm that has killed over 160 people.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10791422/hurricane-helene-biden-harris-visits/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CP173255955-e1727909394375.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:55:42","author":"Globalnews Digital,Reuters","authors":["Globalnews Digital","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":258269838,"title":"Former Trump national security aides endorse him amid turmoil overseas","text":"WASHINGTON — A group of national security experts led by Cabinet members from the Trump administration endorsed former President Donald Trump on Wednesday, citing his foreign policy record and calling him \"a peacemaker.\" The group, organized by former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien and former National Security Council chief of staff Alex Gray, wrote in a letter that \"securing peace\" is \"the legacy of Trump.\" The signers, numbering more than 300, include former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in this year's Republican primaries, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe. The letter comes amid an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Iran and Israel, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump recently compared the Middle East conflict to a \"schoolyard fight\" and said he would negotiate a deal \"that's good for both sides\" in the Russia-Ukraine war. Shortly before the letter was released, federal prosecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith argued in a 165-page filing that many of Trump’s actions in the wake of his loss are not subject to a recent Supreme Court decision granting broad immunity to presidents for official acts. Prosecutors say Trump and co-conspirators, working in their private and campaign capacities rather than in service of official duties, illegally tried to block Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election. One of the signers of Wednesday's letter was former Attorney General William Barr, who last year called the Jan. 6 prosecution a \"legitimate case.\" \"There was very grave wrongdoing here,\" Barr told PBS at the time. \"And I think it’s reasonable to say that it falls within the obstruction of a proceeding.\" The former national security officials did not mention the Jan. 6 case in their letter, but it offers a counterpoint to critics who contend that Trump's behavior put the nation at risk. They wrote that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have failed to keep the country safe. \"The policies of the Biden-Harris Administration have invited conflict, diminished America’s standing around the globe, and imperiled our national security,\" the letter says. \"Over the last four years, peace throughout the world has been upended by America’s emboldened adversaries.\" A person familiar with the effort to collect signatures and write the letter, which refers to the Sermon on the Mount and “the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,” said it proves Trump would be able to fill a new administration with top-quality aides. \"This letter shows the establishment and the left are woefully inaccurate in saying the president would not attract top talent in term two,\" the person said. The signers do not include Trump's first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, or his secretaries of defense, James Mattis and Mark Esper.","summary":"The group, organized by former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien and former National Security Council chief of staff Alex Gray, wrote in a letter that \"securing peace\" is \"the legacy of Trump.\"","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/former-trump-national-security-aides-endorse-turmoil-overseas-rcna173741","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241002-donald-trump-ew-537p-41b7a8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:53:20","author":"Jonathan Allen","authors":["Jonathan Allen"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":258267046,"title":"Melania Trump defends reproductive rights in new memoir: reports","text":"Melania Trump reveals in her new memoir — set to his shelves this week — that she is pro-choice, The Guardian reports.

JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states. As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Walz pointed toward his debate hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, \"New York City was a little crazy last night.\" Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious. An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had \"become friends with school shooters.\" 2024 CASH DASH: TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE AS HE TRIES TO CLOSE GAP WITH HARRIS The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports. \"I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I’ve become friends with school shooters. I’ve seen it,\" Walz said. Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, \"I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement. \"David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.\" VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN Walz acknowledged \"I need to be more specific on that. But I am passionate about this.\" Vance, speaking at a rally in Auburn Hills, Michigan, said he didn't hear Walz's comment until he was told about it during a conversation with his running mate, former President Trump, after the debate. \"He said that Tim Walz said that he was friends with school shooters twice,\" Vance said, referencing his conversation with Trump. \"And that's something I actually didn't notice that Tim Walz had said that on the debate stage. \"I said, ‘Did he really say that, sir?’ And he [Trump] said, 'I'm telling you, man, go and watch the clips.' HARRIS, BIDEN, HEAD TO STORM-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP TRIP \"And I said that was probably only the third or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.\" The debate moderators also confronted Walz on his claim to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, China. Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre, adding he can be \"a knucklehead at times.\" The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his \"dates wrong.\" Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance \"fantastic\" and that it had \"reconfirmed my choice.\" The former president also argued that Walz had \"embarrassed himself\" during the debate. Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud. Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that \"it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.\" An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that \"you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.\" Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that \"the simple reason\" is that \"the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.\" Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus. But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.

Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate 2½ months ago. Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills, at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier. Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago. Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.

Daggett and the union are drawing attention in the lead-up to the election as the port strike continues, with the ILA's political action committee predominantly donating to Democratic candidates, and Daggett having only donated to one Democratic candidate.Nearly 50,000 port workers agreed to strike on Monday night after a collective bargaining agreement for a new six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance employer group wasn't reached. The strike has the potential to halt imports to the United States, and Daggett previously warned that it would \"crush\" the United States economy. The strike comes nearly one month ahead of the extremely tight presidential election.Daggett, the strike's leader, has been thrust into the spotlight overnight. His relationships and salary are under scrutiny, including social media users sharing a photo of him and former President Donald Trump from a November meeting at Mar-a-Lago, which some claim suggests he is supporting the GOP nominee in next month's election.Neither Daggett nor the ILA have endorsed either presidential candidate this year. In 2020, both Daggett and ILA supported President Joe Biden. Unions are no longer defaulting to supporting the Democratic candidate as was predominantly the case in previous years.Earlier this month, the Teamsters union, representing more than 1.3 million workers, said it would not endorse any presidential candidate in the 2024 election. This is the first time since 1996 that the union has opted not to back a candidate.Daggett hasn't donated to any political race since 2013, when he gave $1,500 to New Jersey state Senator Barbara Buona's unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial run against Republican Chris Christie, according to FollowTheMoney.com.The ILA PAC typically donates to Democratic candidates but also supports Republicans. In the 2024 election cycle, the PAC has given $115,000 to Democrats and $5,000 to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets. None of the funds are designated for presidential candidates, focusing mainly on U.S. House campaigns.Newsweek reached out to Daggett and the ILA for comment via email on Wednesday evening.In 2022, the PAC contributed nearly double, with $220,000 to Democratic candidates and $13,500 to Republicans. In the last 10 years, most annual contributions have averaged under $200,000—significantly less than in previous decades. In 2000, the PAC gave $562,300 to Democrats and $41,750 to Republicans, a total of $607,050.

Each was civil and repeatedly sought areas of common ground. But the collegiality evaporated on Wednesday as Vance opened a rally in Auburn Hills, Michigan, recounting how Walz mistakenly said he had “become friends with school shooters” in an answer about gun control. “That was probably only the third- or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night,” Vance said on Wednesday, telling the audience he and former President Donald Trump joked about the remark in a phone call after the debate. Walz later explained that he meant to refer to those affected by gun violence, not the gunmen. Vance kept returning to his debate against Walz as he delivered his remarks, relitigating everything from their answers on the economy to what Vance called government “censorship.” He again defended Trump’s economic agenda as based on “common sense” after Walz appealed to the economists suggesting his plans would cause inflation. “I don’t think those economists know what the hell they’re talking about,” Vance told rallygoers, saying the topic “really annoyed the hell out of him” on Tuesday night. Wednesday’s event marked a return to the rhetorical sniping that had become commonplace on the campaign trail. Vance spent most of his attention on Vice President Kamala Harris, but he used the debate to take fresh digs at Walz, who he has previously accused of distorting his military record. “I gotta be honest. I feel a little bad for Gov. Walz, and the reason I feel bad for him is he has to defend the indefensible,” Vance said of Harris’s record as vice president. The lion’s share of Vance’s remarks were on the car industry, claiming Harris wants to “impoverish a generation of Michigan auto workers” with the transition to electric vehicles. But the Q&A portion of the event was preoccupied with Vance’s own debate performance. One reporter asked why he declined to answer whether the 2020 election was stolen on Tuesday night as Trump regularly claims. “The media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I’m focused on the election of 33 days from now,” Vance responded. Walz made his own return to the campaign trail on Wednesday in York, Pennsylvania, where he appeared alongside Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA). Walz acknowledged his bumpy debate performance, quipping, “Look, not bad for a football coach, huh?” But he, too, attempted to seize on his opponent’s comments, calling Vance’s “damning nonanswer” on the 2020 election “disqualifying.” “There’s a reason why Mike Pence was not on that stage with me,” Walz told the crowd. “Because Pence honored his oath and chose the Constitution over Donald Trump.”","summary":"AUBURN HILLS, Michigan — Sen.
