While Harris' strategy has been focused on establishing her presence and redefining herself for voters, she now plans to prioritize attacking Trump's record and getting under his skin during the debate. Harris told Smiley that she \"intend[s] to point out\" that Trump \"tends to fight for himself, not for the American people.\" The Harris campaign has also noted that this is new territory for Harris as it marks her very first presidential debate, compared to what will be Trump's seventh. This is the first time the pair have ever faced off against each other. Harris continues to hunker down in Pittsburgh, engaging in mock debates on a stage with full lighting that has been established in her hotel to help stimulate Tuesday's environment.

US Presidential Democratic nominee's biographer CHARLIE SPIERING says she is terrifyingly ill-equipped for power and an incompetent lightweight","text":"John Nance Garner didn't think much of the job he held under Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. 'The vice presidency isn't worth a bucket of warm spit,' he once declared. But he was wrong. Over the years, the role has regularly been a platform for the Oval Office. Some 15 vice presidents have gone on to take the top job, including Joe Biden, who served eight years as Barack Obama's deputy. As America prepares to go to the polls this autumn, there is a strong chance that Biden's own controversial sidekick, Kamala Harris, could follow him into the White House. Tonight, Harris takes part in her first -televised debate against Donald Trump. It will be a vital test, particularly because – owing to the unorthodox nature of her selection after Biden's sudden announcement in July that he would not stand against Trump – she has not endured anything like the usual media examination that a presidential -candidate has to suffer. As a seasoned political journalist and author of Amateur Hour: Kamala Harris In The White House – a comprehensive investigation into how this eccentric San -Francisco attorney was fast-tracked to becoming potentially the next leader of the free world – I find the lack of scrutiny applied to this -shallow and desperate political -figure to be maddening. Since winning the nomination, 'Calamity Kamala' has given just two short, lacklustre media interviews that did nothing to enhance her authority. Senior Democrats in Washington tell me that her -campaign is increasingly riven and dysfunctional. She calls herself 'a joyful -warrior' with an upbeat message – yet I hear of repeated power struggles with the Biden team. Three generations – Biden's -doddery cronies, her own -experienced coterie and legions of Gen Z and millennial activists – are all pulling in different directions. One former official told me that Harris is reluctant to take drastic action against Biden's crew in particular: 'She won't get rid of them because that would create too much of a distraction.' Her aides have been trying to shield her from Press scrutiny over this and much else by running out the clock towards election day. But one well-connected Democrat tells me that many fear this approach is backfiring: 'It's not a great long-term play for her. She needs to prove she can be unscripted.' The trouble for Harris is that, without an autocue, she flounders. She could easily perform badly in tonight's debate, given her limited grasp of policy and her notorious habit of descending into meaningless verbiage and gaffes under pressure. She might, however, land some blows if she lives up to her carefully crafted image as a tough prosecutor: a skill she claims to have honed as district attorney and attorney general in California, with a highly aggressive and interruptive style of questioning. But if she does emerge victorious, the presidency will be within her grasp – a scenario unthinkable until recently. So how on earth did we get here? Branded the most unpopular vice president in modern history, Harris has for years been viewed by some around Washington as an incompetent lightweight, whose trademark unhinged cackle could not conceal her inability to communicate effectively, and whose obsession with identity politics failed to hide her lack of convictions on policy. Even some in America's liberal Press regarded her as a national joke who stumbled from one embarrassment to another. Many of her most incomprehensible pronouncements went viral on social media: take her 2022 assertion that 'it is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day'. Her record may be devoid of real achievement, but her greatest -political talent has always been her gift for self-advancement. In my opinion she combines naked political ambition with an instinctive cunning, a lack of scruples and a willingness to jump on every fashionable bandwagon. Hailed as America's 'diverse' political saviour after the division of the Trump years and Biden's flailing tenure, with spectacular cynicism Harris has recently been presented by the party machine as a bold new voice for the country – even though she was integral to Biden's -administration for four long years. At the Democrats' recent convention in Chicago, she officially accepted the presidential nomination amid scenes of hysterical -adulation. Praise was lavished on her by Biden, Barack and Michelle Obama, and Bill and Hillary -Clinton, while Harris basked in the personal endorsement of billionaire megastar Oprah Winfrey. The Chicago convention -succeeded in generating a feelgood factor around Harris, but this is beginning to dim. Already, polls show that her early 'bounce' is slowing – a New York Times survey at the weekend showed Donald Trump overtaking her by 48 per cent to 47 per cent, marking the end of what the liberal paper called her 'euphoric August'. Harris may have hoped that -enveloping herself in lavish tributes from celebrity Democrats would help to dodge troubling questions about her candidacy. More fool her. The 59-year-old has one of the thinnest CVs of any -modern presidential contender – and people have noticed that. It is genuinely alarming that with the world in turmoil, from war in Ukraine to escalating conflict in the Middle East, this comparative -novice could soon be in power. When she ran to be California -senator in 2017, it looked at one stage that she might secure the Democratic nomination for that role without a fight, even though she had no experience of Washington. Long-serving Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez believed that such a coronation would be a democratic outrage, so she decided to stand against Harris. 'This is too important a state and too important a position for someone to get on-the-job training,' said Sanchez. Those same words could be applied far more accurately to the presidency of the United States. The West is confronted by an array of tyrants and terrorists, but our destiny could be imminently in the hands of an amateur. Unlike Roosevelt's vice president John Nance Garner, Harris has conducted no major negotiations or presided over the passage of any significant legislation. Even among Democrats in the Senate, she was unpopular because of her hectoring, partisan style and her obsessive focus on her own career. Other vice presidents, such as Richard Nixon under Dwight Eisenhower, Walter Mondale under Jimmy Carter or Dick Cheney under George W. Bush, had an important influence on US foreign policy, but Biden never respected Harris enough to give her such a role. Like so much else she does, her fleeting forays into foreign affairs have been cringeworthy: among many of her gaffes, I might cite the moment that she referred to North Korea – one of the West's most implacable foes – and its 'alliance' with the US. Her explanations of the Ukraine war and the role of Nato in the world smacked of childish -simplicity, while her behaviour during the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan similarly -commanded little confidence. She claimed that she was the last person in the Oval Office when Biden made his decision to pull out, but then she went -missing for days as the operation unfolded. Her handling of one of the few major tasks she was given as 'Veep' – dealing with the immigration crisis on America's southern border – was equally maladroit. Handed the grandiose title of 'border czar' in 2021, she -celebrated by offering journalists biscuits, baked with her image, on a flight to Guatemala, her first big trip outside Washington. On landing, she pointedly told migrants 'do not come' to the US. It may have been an indicator of her irrelevance that the huddled masses ignored her and instead streamed across the border in ever greater numbers – allegedly almost ten million since Biden came to power. As the crisis worsened, her -political stature was further diminished when she was interviewed by the liberal network NBC and asked why, given the scale of the problems at the -border, she had not visited the region herself as 'czar'. 'And I -haven't been to Europe!' she replied, laughing awkwardly. Two other issues as vice president suggest to me her comprehensive unsuitability for high office. One is her historically -dismal relations with some of her own staff – allegedly because of a mix of impatience and insecurity. Throughout her time as VP, there was a steady exodus of talented people who could not put up with her -management style. One staffer told the Washington Post that Harris would refuse to analyse briefing materials, then scold her team if she appeared unprepared. 'You're not working with somebody who is willing to do the prep and the work,' they added. Shocked Washington insiders have told further tales of dysfunction and even abuse. She berated staff who failed to fulfil her erratic demands, or handed her the wrong type of pen. 'With Kamala, you have to put up with a -constant amount of soul-destroying -criticism and also her own lack of confidence,' said one of her former aides. Another told Politico -magazine that her office was 'not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated'. Her team have denied these reports. After her shambolic primary bid in 2019 one campaign manager said: 'I have never seen an -organisation that treated its staff so poorly.' Her eccentric use of English has often featured politically correct jargon mixed with cloying -platitudes and repetitions. One of her most infamous -comments came at a White House reception in March 2023 to mark Women's -History Month, just the sort of woke event in which she delights. 'So, during Women's History Month, we celebrate and we -honour the women who made -history throughout history, who saw what could be unburdened by what had been,' she told her -puzzled audience. It is, all told, a worrying CV for the highest office. So it is perhaps ironic that, even though she does not come across as a serious operator, she takes herself and her image very seriously. One of her first and most telling acts as vice president was to complain about a photo of herself on the cover of Vogue magazine, claiming that she should not have been depicted wearing trainers. Her defenders have claimed that she is cleverer than she likes to appear, and certainly it is true that her language was sharper and more concise when she was a young prosecutor. She climbed the political ladder in California, demanding that Democrats give her positions of power while coolly dismissing her political rivals. But when she first got to Washington, experienced political figures described her to me as a 'show horse' in obvious pursuit of the presidency, not a 'work horse' trying to prove her abilities as a senator. Harris's parents divorced when she was seven and she was largely raised by her Hindu mother, with her Jamaican-born father -working as a senior professor at Stanford University. This mixed-race upbringing has been useful for her career amid the American Left's fanatical embrace of identity politics, -particularly after the unrest that followed the death of George Floyd in 2020 and the -resulting Black Lives Matter movement. Always looking for applause from the Left, Harris has accused the immigration authorities of acting like the Ku Klux Klan, and ludicrously compared the pro-Trump protests in Washington on January 6, 2021 to the -Japanese bombing of Pearl -Harbour and the 9/11 atrocities. Throughout her career, Harris has repeated her motto that she 'eats 'no' for breakfast' when she is told by others that she is not ready for higher office. Tonight, in the presidential debate, viewers will see the real Kamala Harris: a politician of loquacious mediocrity. Does that mean she will lose the election in November? By rights, the presidency should be a step too far for a candidate of her -calibre. But there is no predicting the American electorate – and I fear the prospect of this individual becoming president is all too likely – and all too terrifying.

Clearly there was an overreaction to economic data last week. It raised overblown fears of a potential recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “A pause gives you the opportunity to be more rational.” Analysts at major banks variously put the odds of a U.S. recession at 20 percent (Goldman Sachs), 25 percent (UBS Global Wealth Management), and 35 percent (JP Morgan Chase), while Morgan Stanley on Monday cut its oil forecast, saying traders are pricing in a demand slowdown on par with a mild recession. Some market strategists said that Monday’s buying spree in stocks was classic dip-buying behavior as investors went shopping for bargains. Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic Wealth in New York, said investors were looking at “high quality stocks that are cheaper.” As an example, Blancato pointed to shares of chipmaker Nvidia, which closed up 3.5 percent on Monday after falling 15.3 percent last week. Wednesday’s CPI inflation report is expected to show slight drop in the headline pace of inflation in August to 2.6 percent year-over-year, while on a monthly basis it is expected to remain unchanged at 0.2 percent. Another event of possible consequence for investors is the Sept. 10 presidential candidate debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. ABC will host the 90-minute debate in Philadelphia. The Harris campaign introduced a new webpage titled “A New Way Forward” over the weekend that details her policy positions on key issues, such as border policies and the economy.","summary":"The rebound came after the Dow shed over 1,200 points last week, while the Nasdaq notched its biggest weekly loss since January 2022.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/dow-closes-nearly-500-points-higher-as-wall-street-rebounds-from-last-weeks-rout-5721030","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/01/id5641417-NYSE-GettyImages-1917730773-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:20:38","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":256029306,"title":"Giovanni Pernice will star in the Italian version of Strictly alongside axed co-star Graziano Di Prima's wife","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Sep 10th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Actress Alice Evans is kicked out of court after risking contempt charges by confronting ex-husband Ioan Gruffudd during child support hearing in LA and taking photos of the Fantastic Four star on her phone Unions pile pressure on Starmer over 'cruel' winter fuel payment axing for 10 million people TODAY - as poll shows half of elderly Brits will now heat their home less... but Rachel Reeves insists pensioners will be £1,700 better off Rachel Reeves tells struggling pensioners losing £300 winter fuel cash to blame the Tories and warns Labour MPs there are 'more difficult decisions to come' Racing commentator John Hunt returns to work 60 days after his wife and two of his daughters were killed in crossbow attack - and issues heartbreaking statement Emily Maitlis reveals request from Prince Andrew after notorious Newsnight interview had finished - and how it haunted her career ahead of A Very Royal Scandal's launch The truth about what happens if you drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week - and how much it shortens your life by (and it's shorter than you think) Revealed: The universities that give you the highest graduate salary... and the lowest.

The Mail on Sunday revealed on Saturday that the Italian heart-throb, 34, will join Ballando con le Stelle. But it has now been revealed that the dancer, who is at the heart of a BBC investigation into claims he bullied his former partner Amanda Abbington, will star alongside Giada Linni, the wife of another disgraced Strictly dancer. Graziano's wife, 29, announced on social media on Monday that her contract for the Italian dancing competition has been renewed. Taking to Instagram she said: 'Finally I can officially announce that I will be part of the cast of the masters of @ballandoconlestelle 2024 for my 4th season.'

Her announcement was met by an outpouring of support from her husband's former colleagues on Strictly Giada, who met her husband in 2014 and went on to tie the knot in 2022, has been supportive following Graziano's sacking from Strictly. Two weeks ago Giovanni feared that the bosses of the Italian show would not sign him due to him not yet being exonerated as the BBC continues to take its time revealing the outcome of its investigation. Read More Amanda Abbington 'has no regrets over Giovanni Pernice bullying probe on Strictly' However, following reports that Amanda has little evidence and her claims being 'thin', they have decided to hire him, leaving the embattled star overjoyed. Ballando con le Stelle launched in 2005 - a year after Strictly began in the UK - and is filmed in a magnificent 19th century theatre at the RAI Auditorium at the Foro Italico in Rome. It will mean that he will spend a significant amount of time away from his home in West London this autumn. As Giovanni rebuilds his career in his native Italy, Graziano is still hiding out in Sicily with his mother, his wife, and the rest of the family after losing his job over claims he kicked, hit, and spat at celebrity partner Zara McDermott during training. Graziano is now staying in a remote family farmhouse surrounded by vineyards where he has been a virtual recluse since the bombshell news of his sacking broke.

He allegedly spat and kicked her in training which was captured on video, leaving Strictly bosses with little choice but to axe him as they bid to clean-up the show which has been left rocked by the scandals.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Brian Marks For Dailymail.com Published:00:53 BST, 10 September 2024 |Updated:01:18 BST, 10 September 2024 e-mail View comments Jennifer Lopez was looking her best as she displayed her washboard abs as she touched down in Los Angeles on Monday. The 55-year-old actress and singer rocked a sport ensemble that put the spotlight on her trim tummy as she deplaned. She was arriving back in Los Angeles after a trip up north to the Toronto International Film Festival for the premiere over the weekend of her new film Unstoppable. The awkward event featured Lopez and one of the film's producers, Matt Damon — who shared an intimate conversation with the actress — but her estranged husband Ben Affleck skipped out on the premiere. Although her outfit on Monday appeared to cover up the sides of her torso, Jennifer's revealing dress on the TIFF red carpet left fans wondering if she had gotten a 'commitment' tattoo removed, after she and Ben got complementary ink. Jennifer Lopez was looking her best as she displayed her washboard abs as she touched down in Los Angeles on Monday. The 55-year-old actress and singer rocked a sport ensemble that put the spotlight on her trim tummy as she deplaned She was arriving back in LA after attending her Unstoppable premiere at the Toronto Film Festival on Friday.

Jennifer Lopez and husband Ben Affleck both unveil TATTOOS to celebrate 'commitment' to each other on Valentine's Day The Out Of Sight star's travel ensemble featured a low-cut white cropped tank top with spaghetti straps, which highlighted her age-defying flat stomach and trim waist. She made the look slightly more modest with a pale gray sweatshirt that she wore draped over her shoulders, with the sleeves hanging down her front. Jennifer stayed on point with a matching set of pale gray low-rise sweatpants. Instead of athletic shoes to match her low-key look, she opted for a pair of off-white sneakers, and she kept her caramel-colored hair styled simply with a messy bun. J.Lo appeared to display a more minimal makeup look than usual, and she blocked out the light with chunky black sunglasses. After she descended from the private jet, her assistants ushered her to a black SUV before driving off. Jennifer's revealing tank top should have exposed her 'commitment' tattoo that was debuted early last year at the height of her romance with then-husband Ben Affleck. She had the ink placed high up on her left rib cage, so it is usually covered by her clothing.

It complemented a tattoo Ben got that she also posted. His ink showed two crisscrossing arrows that appeared to be tied together at the junction. Her initial, 'J,' was inked above the crossing point, and Ben's last drawn below it to symbolize their marital and romantic bond. However, when Jennifer posed in a stunning dressed covered front and back in sparkling mirrors at the Toronto International Film Festival, the tattoo didn't appear to be visible. The dress featured separate front and back sheets of mirrors, and they were tied together with thick bows over her sides that left little to the imagination. But there wasn't any obvious sign of the eternity symbol on J.Lo's exposed rib cage. It's unclear if she had already started the process of getting the tattoo removed or if she had simply covered up the ink with makeup for the time being.

They were seen clasping hands and sitting during some down time. Matt and his longtime friend Ben had produced the film together, but the Gone Girl star opted to skip the Toronto premiere to remain in Los Angeles with his children. Despite how J.Lo and Matt appeared to be having a heart-to-heart in photos of the event, an insider told DailyMail.com that the Ocean's Eleven star 'shut down any attempt' that Jennifer made to bring up her estranged husband Ben. 'It was her timing that was so awkward because she would have known that pulling Matt aside at the event to have an intimate talk was going to get picked up and go viral,' they added. The insider stressed that Matt would 'always have Ben's back no matter what,' and they clarified that he was not praying with Jennifer, after some fans interpreted his bowed head as a shared prayer. Jennifer was seen at the premiere and with Matt while wearing the sizzling 'revenge dress' to celebrate her first red carpet event since her divorce filing. She filed the paperwork last month, citing 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split. Although she was the one to file, and Ben appears to have opted not to do so, he was reportedly well aware of her plans. Jennifer was seen at the premiere and with Matt while wearing the sizzling 'revenge dress' to celebrate her first red carpet event since her divorce filing She filed the paperwork last month, citing 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, though the two had pretended to have a healthy marriage for months after her listed separation date Jennifer's sizzling dress at TIFF left little to the imagination and exposed her sides and ribcage. The tattoo was not visible on her left ribcage, though it's unclear if she has had it removed or if she covered it up with makeup Jennifer's tattoo, which she shared on social media, featured an infinity-liek symbol with an arrow piercing its loops It complemented a tattoo Ben got that she also posted. His ink showed two crisscrossing arrows that appeared to be tied together at the junction. Her initial, 'J,' was inked above the crossing point, and Ben's last drawn below it to symbolize their marital and romantic bond According to an insider, the estranged couple had agreed on the divorce terms before she filed, and neither party was looking to surprise the other. The reporting is largely in line with the couple's decision to fake a healthy marriage for months with occasional public outings together, despite having already split behind the scenes. It's unclear if the two had a prenuptial agreement in place, which wouldn't have been noted in the divorce filing, though it appears that the main sticking point for the two independently wealthy people will be their Beverly Hills mansion, which they have now put on the market while Jennifer searches for a new home.

The White Stripes, the defunct Detroit garage rock band famous for hits like “Icky Thump” and “Fell in Love With a Girl,” accused the Republican nominee of copyright infringement in a new suit filed in the Southern District of New York on Monday. The dispute began in August, when a Trump communications staffer posted a video of the former president boarding a jet on the campaign trail set to the opening bass line. “Oh….Don’t even think about using my music you fascists,” White wrote in an Instagram post with a clip of the video. “Law suit coming from my lawyers about this (to add to your 5 thousand others.)” The band claimed that the videos were “even more offensive to Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs vehemently oppose the policies adopted and actions taken by Defendant Trump when he was President and those he has proposed for the second term he seeks.” According to the suit, the video was viewed over 65,000 times and reposted over 700 times. The White Stripes’ lawyers promised to use discovery to “determine the amount of financial contributions that are attributable to the Infringing Trump Videos.” The band also claimed that the campaign “chose to ignore and not respond to” the band’s attempts to solve the copyright dispute before the lawsuit was filed. The suit claims the campaign did not seek to acquire a license to use the song, and that the duo would not have given them one if they had—which they claim the campaign “knew or should have known this based on the Plaintiff’s very public statements in 2016 making as much abundantly clear.” Trump had previously used the song in a video during his 2016 campaign—which also caught the ire of the band. “The White Stripes would like to unequivocally state that they have nothing whatsoever to do with this video,” the band wrote in a statement at the time. “They are disgusted by this association, and by the illegal use of their song.” The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Beast. The White Stripes consisted of Jack White on guitar and vocals and Meg White on drums. The duo was famous for their minimalist style, red, black, and white color aesthetic, and were an instrumental part of the post-punk revival movement of the early 2000s. The Whites were married during the White Stripes’ earliest days, but divorced in 2000. The band continued putting out records and touring for years, but officially split in 2011. In a statement at the time, the Whites said they decided to call it quits “mostly to preserve what is beautiful and special about the band and have it stay that way.” “Seven Nation Army,” a song from their 2003 album Elephant, might be one of the most enduring parts of the band’s legacy. To this day, the iconic riff is chanted in soccer stadiums across the globe. The band’s lawsuit acknowledges this, calling it “one of the most memorable and widely recognized pieces of modern-day music.” Trump is also facing a lawsuit from the estate of soul and funk legend Isaac Hayes, who obtained an injunction against the campaign for using the song “Hold On, I’m Coming.” Hayes penned the song for the soul duo Sam & Dave in 1966. A judge granted the Hayes estate an emergency injunction and later ordered the campaign to stop using the classic at campaign events.","summary":"Nicky J.

READ MORE: Trump Late Night Rant Signals Plan to Evade Harris Debate as Rules Come Back Into Play Penzeys Spices is a Wisconsin-based chain of spice stores that has gone viral in the past for making anti-Trump statements, according to the Tufts Daily. The store has sold a “January 6 Box” of spices which included blends named “Justice” and “Outrage.” Penzeys has also posted signs in its windows, including a “Welcome Future Fake Electors” sign at its Milwaukee location during the Republican National Convention in the city. Its website even has a page titled “About Republicans” slamming the party. Though Trump is likely accurate in calling Penzey’s Spices “Trump Hating,” his other claims are more suspect. Harris is much closer to the center than Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Both Sanders and Warren are regarded as progressive, while Harris has been labeled a “reliable ally of the Democratic establishment” by the New York Times. While Harris’ political momentum has stalled in the most recent polling, according to Politico, it hasn’t reversed, and the outlet reports that she’s still gaining popularity. NPR has also pointed to Harris’ previous debate performances and her past as a prosecutor as boons in Tuesday’s debate that could put her above Trump. But regardless of whether she wins or loses the debate, it would be difficult for her to do as poorly as Biden did during his June 27 debate with Trump. Less than a month after that disastrous debate, Biden exited the race. Though Trump ultimately agreed to tomorrow’s debate with Harris, Trump made an attempt to change the venue to Fox News from ABC, and even initially pulled out before changing his mind.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump suggested Democrats put President Joe Biden back in play as the nominee a day before the scheduled debate with Vice President Kamala Harris by claiming Harris was doing poorly in the polls, asking “How about a Biden comeback?”\n\nOn Monday, Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social, calling out Harris’ Saturday afternoon campaign stop at Penzeys Spices in Pittsburgh.\n\n“Comrade Kamala Harris goes to an ultra Left Wing, Trump Hating, spice shop, which I hear has terrible, overpriced product, and calls for ‘unity.’ As people begin to realize that she is a Marxist, FAR MORE LIBERAL than Crazy Bernie Sanders, or even Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren, her poll numbers are beginning to crash.

Kennedy Jr.'s name will appear on Michigan's Nov. 5 presidential ballot, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled Monday. The high court's decision reverses a Michigan Court of Appeals opinion Friday that allowed RFK Jr. not to appear on the ballot in the battleground state. In a majority ruling, the court wrote that Kennedy \"has not shown an entitlement to this extraordinary relief.\" Kennedy, 70, had qualified after being nominated by the Natural Law Party, a minor party with ballot access in Michigan. But on Aug. 23, he suspended his campaign and endorsed Republican and former President Donald Trump. Kennedy doesn't want his name on ballots in battleground states in fear it would hurt the former president's chances against Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democrat opponent. Trump lost to Joe Biden by about 150,000 votes in 2020 but beat Hillary Clinton by about 10,000 votes in 2016. \"In about 10 battleground states where my presence would be a spoiler, I'm going to remove my name, and I've already started that process and urge voters not to vote for me,\" Kennedy said on Aug. 23. Besides Michigan, battleground states are Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin. In North Carolina, Kennedy has won an appeal to remove his name from the ballot. This has delayed sending out ballots, which had been scheduled for last Friday. Courts have ruled he is off the ballot in Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas. Wisconsin is keeping his name on the ballot. Before his announcement, Kennedy's campaign had said there were enough signatures to appear on 47 ballots and officially gained access in 22 states. The vote in the high court's opinion wasn't revealed. It only shows that Justice Elizabeth Welch, a Democratic nominee, wrote a separate concurring comment and Justices Brian Zahra and David Viviano, both Republican nominees, wrote dissenting comments. \"When plaintiff made his request, defendant faced a deadline for ballot printing that was two weeks away,\" Welch wrote. Democratic nominees have a 4-3 edge on the court. In their dissenting comments, Zahra and Viviano said \"no provision in law\" supports Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's rejection of Kennedy's request to remove his name from the ballot. \"Now countless Michigan voters may be deluded and deceived into casting their ballots for a candidate who has no intention to hold the office,\" the dissenting justices wrote. In an earlier ruling in the Michigan Court of Claims, Judge Christopher Yates ruled that minor party presidential candidates cannot withdraw from the ballot. The ballots also will include independent candidate Cornel West. In a separate decision, Michigan's high court declined to take up an appeal that sought to have him disqualified. Military and overseas ballots must be mailed by Sept. 21, with absentee ballots on Sept. 26.","summary":"Despite his objection, Robert F.

Maybe, next time Google “Strasberg” and find out he died in 1982? The Telegraph hilariously reported that Harris is “preparing for the debate with a stand-in Trump, Lee Strasberg, an acting teacher who has been wearing a wide-shouldered boxy suit and red tie.” The Times reference that inspired it merely said that the Trump stand-in was “in full Lee Strasberg method-acting mode, not just playing Donald J. Trump but inhabiting him, wearing a boxy suit and a long tie.” Strasberg — who, we once again will point out, died in 1982 — counted future Oscar winners as his students, including Marlon Brando, Sidney Poitier, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Shelley Winters and Al Pacino. They studied together at the legendary Actors Studio in New York City. After the error was called out on social media by Wired’s David Gilbert, the Nieman Journalism Lab’s Joshua Benton and others, The Telegraph scrubbed the Strasberg reference from its story, merely noting that the vice president “is preparing for the debate with a stand-in Trump, an advisor who has been wearing a wide-shouldered boxy suit and red tie.” The Harris and Trump debate will air live on ABC from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Sept. 10, at 9 p.m. EDT/6 p.m. PDT. The debate will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks, moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. There will be no audience. In the rules for the debate released last week by ABC News, it’s noted that, as is often the case, candidates are not permitted to ask each other questions. Microphones will be muted for each candidate when their opponent is speaking, which proved to be a Trump advantage during his debate with President Joe Biden. Also, per ABC News, “Moderators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a ‘civilized’ discussion.”","summary":"The Telegraph seems to have misunderstood a reference in the New York Times to the legendary Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982\n\n\nThe post British Paper Mistakenly Reports Kamala Harris Doing Debate Prep With Long-Dead Acting Coach appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/lee-strasberg-debate-prep-kamala-harris-telegraph/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/kamala-harris-lee-strasberg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:06:20","author":"Sharon Knolle","authors":["Sharon Knolle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.173},{"id":256028714,"title":"ABC News Feels the Heat as Harris and Trump Ready for the Debate Stage | Analysis","text":"With two months to go before the presidential election, the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is widely considered to be a toss up.

Former President Trump and Harris will face off for the first time on Tuesday in Philadelphia, in a debate moderated by ABC News. While the Harris campaign had insisted on moving forward with the debate as previously negotiated between the Biden and Trump Teams, it appears they were expecting the rules to change to make the microphones live throughout the event. \"Kamala Harris had planned to object, fact-check and directly question Donald Trump while he was speaking during their debate next week,\" Politico reported on Friday. \"But now, with rules just finalized to mute the candidates when their opponents speaks, campaign officials said Harris advisers are scrambling to rewrite their playbook.\" TRUMP, HARRIS CAMPAIGNS CLASH OVER DEBATE RULES: ‘WE SAID NO CHANGES’ The Harris campaign, according to the report, had wanted un-muted microphones \"so that the vice president could lean on her prosecutorial background, confronting the former president in the same way she laced into some of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees and Cabinet members during Senate hearings.\" Four of her own campaign officials now reportedly claim that she will be \"handcuffed\" by the rules set by her predecessor. Some Democratic strategists said the debate terms were bad from the start. One told Politico, \"It was a bad set of rules for someone [Biden] who needed to be protected, who never should’ve been on the debate stage. And now they’re stuck with it.\" Democratic strategist James Carville, by contrast, suggested the rules don’t tip the scales either way. \"[Trump] won’t be able to do his shenanigans either,\" he said. \"So it seems kind of like a wash to me.\" The same report also claimed, \"Some Democrats privately dismiss the Harris campaign’s frustration as largely gamesmanship and expectation-setting around Tuesday’s debate in Philadelphia.\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller reportedly expressed joy on behalf of the campaign that Harris \"finally accepted the already agreed-upon rules of the debate that they wrote in the first place,\" later adding, \"Americans want to hear both candidates present their competing visions to the voters, unburdened by what has been. No notes, no sitting down, no advance copies of the questions.\" The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Harris' campaign had repeatedly pushed back on the rule about microphones, trying to goad Trump into backing out of the original agreement to mute mics, even initially refusing to sign off on the rules in an attempt to renegotiate. The campaign sent a letter to the network last week officially agreeing to the original debate rules while still complaining about the terms. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,\" the letter read.

Can you even imagine this? What the hell is wrong with our country?” Trump said Saturday at a campaign rally in Wisconsin, a vital swing state. Trump made similar remarks — saying children were returning home from school after having had surgical procedures — the previous weekend at an event hosted by Moms for Liberty, a parent activist group that has gained outsized influence in conservative politics in recent years. Asked by one of the group’s co-founders how he would address the “explosion in the number of children who identify as transgender,” Trump said: “Your kid goes to school and comes home a few days later with an operation. The school decides what’s going to happen with your child.” There is no evidence that a student has ever undergone gender-affirming surgery at a school in the U.S., nor is there evidence that a U.S. school has sent a student to receive such a procedure elsewhere. About half the states ban transition-related surgery for minors, and even in states where such care is still legal, it is rare. In addition, guidelines from several major medical associations say a parent or guardian must provide consent before a minor undergoes gender-affirming care, including transition-related surgery, according to the American Association of Medical Providers. Most major medical associations in the U.S. support gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. For those who opt for such care and have the support of their guardians and physicians, that typically involves puberty blockers for preteens and hormone replacement therapy for older teens. A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign did not substantiate his claims and pointed NBC News to reports about parents’ being left in the dark about their children’s gender transitions at school. “President Trump will ensure all Americans are treated equally under the law regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation,” said the spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt. Kate King, president of the National Association of School Nurses, said that even when it comes to administering over-the-counter medication such as Advil or Tylenol, school nurses need explicit permission from a physician and a parent. “There is no way that anyone is doing surgery in a classroom in schools,” she said when she was asked about Trump’s remarks. Trump’s claims stand out even amid years of allegations by conservative politicians and right-wing media pundits that teachers, Democratic lawmakers and LGBTQ adults are “grooming” or “indoctrinating” children to become gay or transgender. The practice of labeling LGBTQ people, particularly gay men and trans women, as “groomers” and “pedophiles” of children had been relegated to the margins for decades, but the tropes resurfaced during the heated debate over Florida’s so-called Don’t Say Gay law, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in March 2022. The law limits the instruction of sexual orientation and gender identity in school and has been replicated in states across the country. At the Republican National Convention in July, at least a dozen speakers — including DeSantis and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. — mentioned gender identity or sexuality negatively in their speeches, according to an NBC News analysis. DeSantis, for example, alleged that Democrats want to “impose gender ideology” on kindergartners. Nearly 70% of public K-12 teachers who have been teaching for more than one year said topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity “rarely or never” come up in their classrooms, according to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center. Half of all teachers polled, including 62% of elementary school teachers, said elementary school students should not learn about gender identity in school. Trump vowed last year that if he is re-elected he would abolish gender-affirming care for minors, which he equated to “child abuse” and “child sexual mutilation.” This year, Trump also said he would roll back Title IX protections for transgender students “on day one” of his potential second presidential administration. His campaign website says he would, if he is re-elected, cut federal funding for schools that push “gender ideology on our children” and “keep men out of women’s sports.” More broadly, Trump has promised to eliminate the Education Department, claiming that doing so would give states more authority over education. During his first administration, Trump barred trans people from enlisting in the military — which he has vowed to do again if he is re-elected — and rolled back several antidiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump repeated his false claim that children are undergoing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump continues to spread misinformation about children having transgender surgery at school first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-continues-to-spread-misinformation-about-children-having-transgender-surgery-at-school/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump-repeats-false-claims-that-children-are.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:00:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":256028434,"title":"Team Harris Is Well Aware a Bad Debate With Trump ‘Could Cost Us the Election’","text":"The past two months in American politics have been a whirlwind: Joe Biden fumbled the first debate so badly he had to drop out of the presidential race. Someone tried to assassinate Donald Trump. The new Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, reinvigorated the party’s presidential hopes, sparking widespread joy among a previously dejected base while generating an unprecedented fundraising groundswell. On the surface, it may have seemed like the race fundamentally changed: Harris had an impeccable campaign launch, and Trump has been in absolute hell — angrily posting away his feelings while repeatedly complaining that Harris replaced Biden as the nominee. And yet, despite all the upheaval, the broader contours of the 2024 election remain eerily similar: The race is deadly close — and Trump may well still be the favorite. The stakes of Tuesday’s presidential debate in Philadelphia — the second of the campaign, and the first between Harris and Trump — could not possibly be higher. With the race between the vice president and the former president trending uncomfortably close — particularly in recent private and public polls conducted in the handful of battleground states that will decide the election — various officials in each camp say Tuesday night’s contest could make or break their candidate’s chances at taking the White House. Those on Team Harris believe the debate is crucial to preserving the democratic order in the face of Trump’s fascistic whims. “There is no room for error. None,” says a Harris ally, who adds that a lackluster performance could “cost us the election.” In the estimations of Democrats working on her campaign, the debate is very likely to set the tone — in the political press and elsewhere — for the final two-month sprint of the 2024 contest. And if Harris fails to define herself to the American people on live television, it could prove catastrophic, in a presidential election that appears destined to be fought at the margins. New polling from The New York Times and Siena College indicates many voters still want to know more about Harris and her plans for what she would do as president. A majority of likely voters think Harris deserves blame for rising prices and for “problems at the border,” as the Times/Siena survey put it — suggesting that Republicans’ attacks on Harris and attempts to define her may be resonating. So much for coasting on positive vibes. The Harris campaign finally published an issues page on its website Sunday, a month and a half since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, two days before the debate. Now, she needs to communicate her policy vision directly to the millions of Americans who will tune in on Tuesday, all while standing a few feet away from Trump. “It will be devastating if we screw this up,” one Harris adviser tells Rolling Stone, adding: “It really is one of those ‘failure is not an option’ kinds of evenings, isn’t it?” As Harris and Trump have prepared for Tuesday night in Philly, their campaigns have actively brainstormed tactics and canned lines that each side thinks would work best at getting under the other candidate’s skin — in the hopes of provoking an overreaction or stumble that sticks in the minds of voters. In the lead-up to the debate, Trump’s team and allies have pressed him to be “happy Trump” at the debate, not “mean, bully Trump,” according to the Times. According to two sources with knowledge of the matter, when some members of Team Harris were reviewing recent and older videos of Trump — at events, during media interviews, onstage at televised debates — they noticed that Trump is sometimes not as easily baited as some would assume. “Donald Trump is famous for being easily lured into acting like the oaf and bully that he is, but if you watch him at points during, and also after, his time in office, you will be able to spot the times when he knows somebody is trying to get a rise out of him, and then he just refuses to give them what they want … at least for that short amount of time,” one of these sources says. In the weeks leading up to the Philadelphia debate, this led to further brainstorming among these Harris 2024 officials, who wanted to flesh out every angle for the kinds of onstage barbs and attacks that stood a chance at effectively triggering the former president. The two sources declined to share what the new ideas were, which they added were shared with the vice president, as they aim to catch Trump off-guard on Tuesday.","summary":"After two months of upheaval, the race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is a dead heat — and the stakes of Tuesday’s debate couldn’t be higher","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/kamala-harris-trump-debate-2024-election-1235098271/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/kamala-trump-debate-walk-up.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 00:00:00","author":"Andrew Perez","authors":["Andrew Perez"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":256028310,"title":"Alvin Bragg Hits Back at Donald Trump's Request","text":"New York City prosecutors are asking the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals to deny former President Donald Trump's motion for the federal appellate court to order a stay on his hush money conviction.Trump's defense team argued in their motion last week that his sentencing in the case—where he was found guilty on 34 felony counts related to a hush money payment to an adult film star during his 2016 campaign—that the former president's sentencing in the case should be delayed until the Second Court of Appeals can hear arguments on whether the case should be moved to federal court.In a response filed Monday, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued that the appeals court should deny Trump's request because it \"is not only legally unavailable, but also unnecessary\" given Judge Juan Merchan's decision to postpone Trump's sentencing date until after the 2024 presidential election.\"That adjournment eliminates any exigency or irreparable injury that would support a stay pending appeal here,\" Bragg wrote in his motion Monday, referring to Merchan's adjournment of Trump's original sentencing date that was scheduled for September 18. \"There is now no chance that defendant will be sentenced, let alone incarcerated, 'in the final weeks of the Presidential election, while early voting is ongoing.'\"Trump's lawyers have repeatedly sought to delay the former president's sentencing date as the former president's reelection campaign heats up. In a filing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals last week, Trump attorney Emil Bove argued that \"irreparable harm\" would come if the sentencing took place before election day on November 5. That request was sent to New York federal judge Alvin Hellerstien, who has rejected Trump's attempts to move the case to federal court on two separate occasions.Merchan issued a decision on Friday to delay Trump's sentencing until November 26, three weeks after the presidential election. He wrote in his decision that his postponement was \"to avoid any appearance—however unwarranted—that the proceeding has been affected by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the Defendant is a candidate.\"Trump has also sought to dismiss the case following the Supreme Court's immunity ruling in July, which found that presidents are protected from facing criminal charges for actions they take as part of their official duties. Merchan said he will issue a ruling on Trump's immunity claims on November 12.The former president pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts of falsifying business records against him in the case and has repeatedly claimed that Bragg's prosecution is a form of \"election interference.\" In a post to Truth Social on Friday, Trump called the case a \"With Hunt\" and again claimed, \"I DID NOTHING WRONG!\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for further comment Monday.","summary":"Trump has sought for a federal appeals court to intervene in his hush money conviction in New York City.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alvin-bragg-hits-back-donald-trump-request-1951223","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2467637/bragg-hits-back-trumps-request.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:59:26","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.567},{"id":256029310,"title":"James Earl Jones - known for his iconic voice in Star Wars and The Lion King - overcame a speech condition as a kid","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Tuesday, Sep 10th 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 12°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Actress Alice Evans is kicked out of court after risking contempt charges by confronting ex-husband Ioan Gruffudd during child support hearing in LA and taking photos of the Fantastic Four star on her phone Unions pile pressure on Starmer over 'cruel' winter fuel payment axing for 10 million people TODAY - as poll shows half of elderly Brits will now heat their home less... but Rachel Reeves insists pensioners will be £1,700 better off Rachel Reeves tells struggling pensioners losing £300 winter fuel cash to blame the Tories and warns Labour MPs there are 'more difficult decisions to come' Racing commentator John Hunt returns to work 60 days after his wife and two of his daughters were killed in crossbow attack - and issues heartbreaking statement Emily Maitlis reveals request from Prince Andrew after notorious Newsnight interview had finished - and how it haunted her career ahead of A Very Royal Scandal's launch The truth about what happens if you drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week - and how much it shortens your life by (and it's shorter than you think) Revealed: The universities that give you the highest graduate salary... and the lowest.

While he is a three-time Tony Award winner, two-time Emmy Award winner and a Grammy winner - just an Oscar shy of the EGOT - Jones is certainly best known for voicing two of cinema's most iconic characters: Star Wars' Darth Vader and The Lion King's Mufasa. Ironically, the screen icon rose not only from humble beginnings in Depression-era Mississippi, but he also overcame a speech impediment as well. Jones was born in Arakbutla, Mississippi in January 1931, though from the age of 5 on, he was raised by his maternal grandparents on their farm in Dublin, Michigan, moving north as part of the Great Migration. The move - with his mother and 13 cousins - was so traumatizing that it lead to a speech impediment... which Jones told Daily Mail back in March 2010 that he originally thought was a 'curse.' The entertainment world is in mourning today as the legendary actor James Earl Jones - who has perhaps the most iconic voice in Hollywood history - has passed away at 93 on Monday While he is a three-time Tony Award winner, two-time Emmy Award winner and a Grammy winner - just an Oscar shy of the EGOT - Jones is certainly best known for voicing two of cinema's most iconic characters: Star Wars ' Darth Vader and The Lion King's Mufasa. The Lion King's Mufasa, voiced by the late legendary actor James Earl Jones 'I had an Uncle Randy - who passed away last year - who was my brother really. I was the youngest grandchild and he was the youngest child and only four years older than me,' Jones began. 'Randy stuttered while we lived in Mississippi and I feel that I mocked him. I used to imitate him. I don't know whether I was imitating him to keep him company or to embarrass him. And then I ended up stuttering myself. I feel I was cursed,' he said. Read More James Earl Jones, 91, signs over the rights to his iconic Darth Vader voice in Star Wars franchise sparking speculation he's retired from the role While he was not actually cursed, there is still no exact cause known for why people start to stutter, though for Jones it was so bad for him he was practically mute for eight years of his childhood. 'As a small child, I would communicate to my family, or at least those who didn't mind being embarrassed by my stutter or my being embarrassed,' Jones explained. 'I did communicate with the animals quite freely, but then that's calling the hogs, the cows, the chickens. They don't care how you sound, they just want to hear your voice,' he added. 'Stuttering is painful. In Sunday school, I'd try to read my lessons and the children behind me were falling on the floor with laughter,' Jones said, though he admitted that stuttering is 'funny' to him. 'Well, I knew I was funny. I still know why it is funny. I think stutterers are funny. And I know it's rude and politically incorrect to laugh at stutterers. But I think it is OK because I know why they're funny,' he said. Jones would explain, 'They make people nervous. People think, when on earth are they going to get the word out, so they start laughing out of their own nervousness.' 'I had an Uncle Randy - who passed away last year - who was my brother really. I was the youngest grandchild and he was the youngest child and only four years older than me,' Jones began 'Randy stuttered while we lived in Mississippi and I feel that I mocked him. I used to imitate him. I don't know whether I was imitating him to keep him company or to embarrass him. And then I ended up stuttering myself. I feel I was cursed,' he said Jones would explain, 'They make people nervous. People think, when on earth are they going to get the word out, so they start laughing out of their own nervousness' The actor said that the stuttering continued when he started school, and it got so bad, 'that I gave up trying to speak properly.' 'There was another pupil who sat behind me who was also a stutterer and the teacher, who was young, would shake him, and I'd say, \"L-l-lll-l-let me teach him\" and I took over his studies, or when he had to talk. I understood him. I understood that shaking him was not going to help. She was relieved,' Jones added. The one teacher that truly helped him though was an English teacher and poet named Donald Crouch, who Jones calls, 'the father of my voice.' 'He was a contemporary of Robert Frost, and memorized a poem every day in case he ever went blind so he might have poems he could read in his head,' Jones recalled... adding later that ironically Crouch 'I had started writing poetry in high school and he said of one of them, \"Jim, this is a good poem. In fact, it is so good I don't think you wrote it. I think you plagiarised it. If you want to prove you wrote it, you must stand in front of the class and recite it by memory. Which I did. As they were my own words, I got through it,' Jones revealed. The teacher said that if Jones, was interested in being 'involved with words,' he would have to say them in front of the class and work on his stuttering. His teacher argued that if James Earl wanted to be 'involved with words' he would have to be able to say them and read to the class and work on the stuttering problem. 'And he got me engaged in the debating class, the dramatic reading class and so on. He got me talking, and reading poetry - Edgar Allan Poe was my favourite,' Jones said. The actor said that the stuttering continued when he started school, and it got so bad, ' that I gave up trying to speak properly' By the time he went to study drama at the University of Michigan, Jones had enough of a handle on his stuttering... though it never fully went away for good By the time he went to study drama at the University of Michigan, Jones had enough of a handle on his stuttering... though it never fully went away for good. 'I've learned that sometimes the synapses in your brain trip up, like stumbling on a sidewalk,' he explains, with consonants like M still a struggle for him. Jones made his stage debut in the 1950s and quickly became known as one of the best Shakespearean actors of his era, starring in Othello, King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream, to name a few. He won his first Tony in 1969 for playing boxer Jack Jefferson (based on real-life boxer Jack Johnson) in The Great White Hope, then earning his first Oscar nomination for reprising that role in the 1970 film adaptation. When George Lucas thought David Prowse's voice was unsuitable for Darth Vader, Jones was brought in for what would be one of the most iconic voice roles ever. Jones retired from acting in 2021 after reprising his role as King Jaffe Joffer in Coming 2 America. He also signed a deal in 2022 with Respeecher and Lucasfilm, authorizing the companies to use his archived audio for future Darth Vader voice performances.

Director Shaun Peterson’s feature Lover of Men: The Untold History of Abraham Lincoln is now playing in theaters. The movie uses interviews with prominent Lincoln scholars, in addition to never-before-seen photographs and letters, to suggest that the revered politician had romantic relationships with men. The film focuses on four men — including close friend Joshua Speed — with whom Lincoln shared a bed at separate points in his life, according to this research. “I’ve been researching this for a very long time, since around 2007,” Peterson tells The Hollywood Reporter. “[There was] fluidity that existed throughout human history, before the words and ideas ‘homosexual’ and ‘heterosexual’ were invented around 1870. That’s what really captivated me, is this idea that these binaries are very new. The binaries were used against people, whether it was the psychological community in the early days or the church, and then where we find ourselves today.” Producer Robert Rosenheck has been creative partners with Peterson for 20 years. Although Rosenheck is a lifelong Lincoln fan, he hadn’t been aware of the conversations surrounding whether the politician was queer until Peterson mentioned his plans for the project, at which point the producer jumped on board. “I said, ‘We need to make a movie that is not about Abraham Lincoln’s queerness — it’s got to be about something larger,'” Rosenheck recalls. “It tells a universal story. So if you’re a queer person, you see this film, and you experience a catharsis when you realize that America’s greatest president was queer. But if you’re not a queer person, the story is a universal one about tolerance and how we ‘other’ people.” Rosenheck is aware that social media users have voiced questions regarding why a film should emphasize apparent speculation about someone like Lincoln, who was private with key elements of his personal life. Lincoln had been married to Mary Todd Lincoln for more than two decades at the time of his assassination in 1865. “We get all kinds of reactions to the film,” the producer says. “Surprisingly, we’ve gotten a lot of people on the left who are skeptical, [and] people on the right who have seen the film and go, ‘Wow, I didn’t realize all that history. That’s fascinating.’ So it’s definitely a conversation starter and a mind-opener to see the film.” The team behind Lover of Men edited the film with a focus on getting it finished in time for this November’s presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and in fact, the movie hit theaters just days before Tuesday’s presidential debate. Seeing the project as a rallying cry for Americans to continue to encourage diverse voices and identities, the filmmakers acknowledge that conservative pundits, including Elon Musk, Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones, posted negatives remarks about the movie’s concept prior to its release. “I would just invite them — and anybody that has questions about the film — to watch the film, give it a chance, look at the evidence and look at the possible message,” says Peterson. “Just go into the film with an open mind because we’re at a time where we need some open minds. We are living history right now, everything that’s going on, and so it’s important to look back at our past in order to inform our future.” As for how the Lover of Men team feels about such right-wing pundits trolling the movie, Rosenheck says, “We’re thrilled when people like Elon Musk notice the film, and the reason that they notice the film is because it is compelling. This story is provocative. There are very few original stories. There are very few stories with a hook, and this movie has a huge hook.”","summary":"The filmmakers behind Lover of Men, the new documentary examining whether former President Abraham Lincoln may have been gay, are proud of the film that they made, regardless of the trolling from conservative pundits.

However, Hogan will likely need strong support from moderates, including anti-Trump voters, to win in November.During an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday, Hogan doubled down on his criticism of the former president. The former governor insisted that he was unconcerned after being asked by Tapper if he was was worried that Trump would \"come after\" him due to his \"election integrity\" stance if he wins back the White House.\"I'm not afraid of it, that's for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I've always been willing to stand up. He's lashed out at me a few times. But look, I've battled life-threatening cancer, a few mean tweets from Donald Trump aren't going to bother me.\"Hogan also denounced Trump for threatening unnamed Democrats, including \"donors,\" in a Truth Social post over the weekend with \"long term prison sentences\" for participating in a nonexistent scheme of \"rampant Cheating and Skullduggery\" in the 2020 election.The former governor touted his record of opposition to Trump since he announced his first presidential run in 2015, despite remaining a member of the same political party as the ex-president.\"I've been one of the most outspoken critics since the moment that Donald Trump came down the escalator... One of the only Republicans who never caved,\" said Hogan. \"I was disgusted by the talk about the stolen election and disgusted by what happened on January 6.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump campaign via email on Monday evening.Hogan has said that he will vote for neither Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The agreement imposed restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the US government under former President Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement in May 2018, reinstating sanctions and prompting Iran to scale back some of its nuclear commitments.

He also told a gathering of police officers last Friday that they should “watch for the voter fraud,” an apparent attempt to enlist law enforcement that would be legally dubious. Trump has contended, without providing evidence, that he lost the 2020 election only because of cheating by Democrats, election officials and other, unspecified forces. On Saturday, Trump promised that this year those who cheat “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” should he win in November. He said he was referencing everyone from election officials to attorneys, political staffers and donors. “Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country,” Trump wrote in the post on his social media network Truth Social that he later also posted on X, the site once known as Twitter. The former President’s warning — he prefaced it with the words “CEASE & DESIST” — is the latest increase in rhetoric that mimics that used by authoritarian leaders. To be clear, Trump lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden in both the Electoral College and in the popular vote, where Biden received 7 million more votes. Trump’s own attorney general said there was no evidence of widespread fraud, Trump lost dozens of lawsuits challenging the results and an Associated Press investigation showed there was no level of fraud that could have tipped the election. Additionally, multiple reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Trump contested his loss all confirmed Biden’s win. Trump, who has spoken warmly of authoritarians and mused recently that “sometimes you need a strongman,” has already pledged to prosecute his political adversaries if he returns to power. His allies have drawn up plans to make federal prosecutors more able to target the president’s opponents. In one possible conservative outline for a new Trump administration known as Project 2025, a former Trump Justice Department official writes that Pennsylvania’s top election official should have been prosecuted for a policy dispute —- in deciding that voters there have a chance to fix signature errors on their mail ballots. Trump has disavowed Project 2025, but his rhetoric matches that example, said Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department official and Biden White House staffer who now teaches law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. “He is increasingly showing us what type of president he hopes to be, and that involves using the Justice Department to punish people he disagrees with — whether they committed crimes or not,” Levitt said. Levitt said he was skeptical that a Trump Justice Department would be able to simply file charges against people who contradicted his election lies, but he and others said the suggestion was dangerous nevertheless. “Threatening people with punishment for cheating is deeply disturbing if ‘cheating’ simply means that you don’t like the outcome of the election,” Steve Simon, a Democrat who is Minnesota’s secretary of state and the president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said in a post on X. Trump’s campaign said the former president was simply talking about the importance of clean elections. “President Trump believes anyone who breaks the law should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, including criminals who engage in election fraud. Without free and fair elections, you can’t have a country,” campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Trump already has lodged threats against people who engaged in no apparent illegal activity during the 2020 election. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan Zuckerberg, in 2020 donated more than $400 million to local election offices to help them deal with the pandemic. In a book released earlier this month, Trump threatened that Zuckerberg will “ spend the rest of his life in prison ” if he makes any more contributions. Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic Secretary of State, said in an interview Monday that Trump’s comments have prompted election officials, already reeling from years of threats due to Trump’s false claims of 2020 corruption, to increase their level of vigilance and security planning. “That is a level of vitriol and threats that we have not seen before, and it is very alarming and concerning,” Benson said. “We worry that individuals will read that rhetoric and take it on themselves to exact the vengeance prior to the election — or immediately following, if their candidate doesn’t win — that their candidate has called for.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday that Trump’s rhetoric was dangerous: “This is not who we are as a country. This is a democracy.” Stephen Richer, the Republican Recorder of Maricopa County, Arizona, who’s been repeatedly attacked by Trump and his supporters for standing by the accuracy of that county’s 2020 vote count, took to X to point to one election official who has been charged for her actions that year — Tina Peters. The former clerk of Mesa County in Colorado was convicted in August of helping activists access her county’s voting machines to try to prove Trump’s lies. “She was on your side of this,” Richer wrote to Trump in his post. Earlier this summer, Richer was defeated in the Republican primary in his bid for reelection. Trump’s call for police officers to watch polling stations in case of fraud in November came Friday as he addressed a gathering of the Fraternal Order of Police, an organization that has endorsed him. “I hope you can watch and you’re all over the place. Watch for the voter fraud. Because we win. Without voter fraud, we win so easily,” he told the officers. “You can keep it down just by watching. Because believe it or not, they’re afraid of that badge. They’re afraid of you people.” What he’s suggesting could violate several federal and state laws against voter intimidation — some of which specifically prohibit uniformed officers from being at the polls unless they are responding to an emergency or casting a ballot themselves, according to Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center. Diaz said those laws emerged from the nation’s fraught history of law enforcement officers abusing their power to stop Black people from voting. “We have to remember that history when we think of the presence of law enforcement at the polls,” he said. “Even the best-intentioned officers who are there really just to keep people safe with no ill will, their presence might be perceived by voters in a way that is different than they intended.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWith early voting fast approaching, the rhetoric by Republican presidential nominee Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The tone of Trump&#8217;s speeches about the elections gets more serious as the presidential voting draws closer first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-tone-of-trumps-speeches-about-the-elections-gets-more-serious-as-the-presidential-voting-draws-closer/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump039s-rhetoric-on-elections-turns-ominous-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:39:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":256028352,"title":"JD Vance’s latest cat flub is bizarre misinformation about migrants eating them","text":"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance — a vocal proponent of conspiracy theories about immigrants “replacing” Americans — is now spreading misinformation about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio killing family pets and protected wildlife. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country,” Vance posted on X on Monday, echoing an unsubstantiated rumor that took off on right-wing social media over the weekend. The unnamed “reports” Vance cites are likely from Infowars or the Daily Mail, both of which published thinly sourced posts about Haitian migrants eating pets and wildlife. Both publications reference a Facebook post in which someone claims their neighbor’s daughter’s friend lost her cat — and later found it “hanging from a branch, like you’d do a deer for butchering,” outside a house “where Haitians live.” Local police, however, tell the Springfield News-Sun that there are no reports of pets being stolen and eaten in the community. Still, the Springfield pet situation is a particularly instructive example of how right-wing media often launders and mainstreams obvious misinformation. The rumor, which reports suggest had been spreading locally for at least a month, was amplified by conservative influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers — and then mainstreamed by politicians including Vance and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and immigration obsessives like Elon Musk. The News-Sun suggested that the original Facebook post conflated Springfield with Canton, Ohio, a city 175 miles northeast where a woman was recently arrested for allegedly killing and eating a cat in front of multiple people. Right-wing commentator Ian Miles Cheong — who frequently posts about US politics despite living in Malaysia — suggested the woman who ate the cat was Haitian. \"The Springfield pet situation is a particularly instructive example of how right-wing media often launders and mainstreams obvious misinformation\" That woman, Allexis Ferrell, is a US citizen, according to Daniel Di Martino, a PhD student at Columbia and fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who found her voter registration information. Other reports suggest the rumor began before Ferrell’s arrest. “We get these reports ‘the Haitians are killing ducks in a lot of our parks’ or ‘the Haitians are eating vegetables right out of the aisle at the grocery store,’” Jason Via, Springfield’s deputy director of public safety and operations, told NPR in August. “And we haven’t really seen any of that. It’s really frustrating.” But the rumor has persisted. One Springfield resident brought it up during an August 27th meeting of Springfield’s City Commission, claiming Haitian migrants were “in the park grabbing up ducks by their neck and cutting their head off and walking off with them and eating them.” The city commission meetings, which are archived on YouTube, have been a steady source of content for right-wing commentators eager to prove that real Americans are suffering due to the supposedly open border. On September 8th, the X account End Wokeness posted a clip from the commission’s August 27th meeting, amplifying the duck-eating rumor to more than 2.9 million followers. Two days earlier, the same account posted a screenshot of the unsubstantiated Facebook post, claiming “ducks and pets are disappearing” in Springfield. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk reposted the image on September 8th. “Apparently, people’s pet cats are being eaten,” wrote Musk, who often posts about the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. “If not for 𝕏,” End Wokeness posted the following day, “you would have no idea that Haitians were eating cats in Springfield.” Right-wing misinformation campaigns about migrants are by no means limited to Springfield. Last month, after a video depicting armed men knocking on an apartment door went viral on X, conservative commentators claimed members of a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex in Colorado. End Wokeness claimed gang members had begun collecting rent in a second building. City Journal, the in-house publication of the Manhattan Institute, claimed two apartment complexes were “under siege” by Venezuelan gang members. Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman later said “criminal elements” had taken over buildings in the city, and were extorting residents. Former President Donald Trump parroted the reports, saying Venezuelans were “taking over the whole town.” In fact, Aurora police told the Associated Press that gang members hadn’t taken over the apartment complexes and weren’t collecting rent. Residents of one building, some of whom are Venezuelan, said the complex’s New York-based management company had neglected repairs. But the rumor continued to spread on X, where it was amplified by Musk. “Unless Trump wins,” he posted, “meet your new building managers.”","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240338/haitian-migrants-cats-springfield-disinformation-jd-vance-elon-musk","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CfxgtOLIWBLVibkiBnKLJ67TlA=/0x0:2040x1334/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x667:1021x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25532393/STK204_JD_VANCE_A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:37:15","author":"Gaby Del Valle","authors":["Gaby Del Valle"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":256028286,"title":"Trump threatens to jail political opponents if reelected","text":"Trump threatens to jail political opponents if reelected Former President Donald Trump is pledging on social media to prosecute political opponents if he wins reelection in November.

Harris spent the weekend cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh where she focused on honing crisp two-minute answers, per the debate’s rules. ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch Meanwhile, Trump has publicly dismissed the value of studying for the debate. The former president is chose instead to fill his days with campaign-related events. “He can say outrageous things. It won’t detract from his support. Harris, on the other hand, has the potential to drop, lose some enthusiasm, or she could gain it all, right?” said Wayne Steger, political science professor at DePaul University. Steger said while Harris, a former prosecutor, is detail-oriented, she must keep policy issues simple. READ MORE: What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate “If she can paint Donald Trump as not having new ideas and she’s the future, then she creates that change candidate, and then, I think, is the frame she wants to go for,” he said. Trump is expected to improvise using the same predictable themes he used against President Joe Biden: immigration and inflation. “I think that Kamala Harris will see a lot of this coming, and of course, her strengths as a former prosecutor are being prepared and having a game plan about how to respond when the expected and the unexpected happens,” said Northwestern University Director of Debate Dan Fitzmier. MORE 2024 ELECTION: Where Harris, Trump stand on key issues Debate experts say Trump’s strength is debate experience and his love for the camera, but the rules are different from past debates. There will be no opening statements, no studio audience, no pre-written notes or huddling with staff during commercial breaks, and microphones will be muted when it’s not the candidate’s turn to speak. Since the last presidential debate resulted in a sitting president dropping out of the race, Tuesday’s debate will be quite significant. “Debates are consequential again, and for so many years, we kind of got used to them being a little boring. In this case, there’s gonna be a huge audience,” Fitzmier said. The 90-minute debate will have two commercial breaks. As of now, the ABC debate is the only one scheduled between Harris and Trump. A vice-presidential debate is set for Oct. 1.

In this case, there's gonna be a huge audience,\" Fitzmier said. The 90-minute debate will have two commercial breaks. As of now, the ABC debate is the only one scheduled between Harris and Trump.

Harris, on the other hand, has the potential to drop, lose some enthusiasm, or she could gain it all, right?\" said Wayne Steger, political science professor at DePaul University. Steger said while Harris, a former prosecutor, is detail-oriented, she must keep policy issues simple. READ MORE: What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate \"If she can paint Donald Trump as not having new ideas and she's the future, then she creates that change candidate, and then, I think, is the frame she wants to go for,\" he said. Trump is expected to improvise using the same predictable themes he used against President Joe Biden: immigration and inflation. \"I think that Kamala Harris will see a lot of this coming, and of course, her strengths as a former prosecutor are being prepared and having a game plan about how to respond when the expected and the unexpected happens,\" said Northwestern University Director of Debate Dan Fitzmier. MORE 2024 ELECTION: Where Harris, Trump stand on key issues Debate experts say Trump's strength is debate experience and his love for the camera, but the rules are different from past debates. There will be no opening statements, no studio audience, no pre-written notes or huddling with staff during commercial breaks, and microphones will be muted when it's not the candidate's turn to speak. Since the last presidential debate resulted in a sitting president dropping out of the race, Tuesday's debate will be quite significant. \"Debates are consequential again, and for so many years, we kind of got used to them being a little boring. In this case, there's gonna be a huge audience,\" Fitzmier said. The 90-minute debate will have two commercial breaks. As of now, the ABC debate is the only one scheduled between Harris and Trump. A vice-presidential debate is set for Oct. 1.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Carolina Piras For Mailonline Published:00:21 BST, 10 September 2024 |Updated:00:24 BST, 10 September 2024 e-mail 5 View comments Beyonce is reportedly set to 'unveil a series of UK stadium gigs for next summer' going head-to-head with Oasis' stadium tour. The music icon, 43, is rumoured to have already planned five dates at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium in London - and will be rivalling the iconic band's epic reunion stadium tour. A source told The Sun: 'Beyonce is about to raise the roof. The demand for tickets will be just like Oasis' and will rival fans' rush to get their hands on a seat. 'Oasis and Beyonce are top tier and demand for tickets will be fierce. Over seven million people tried to get Oasis tickets — and Beyonce's fans will be out in force too.' Summer 2025 will be full of major artists filling UK arenas as Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Usher and Sabrina Carpenter are also reportedly planning live dates next year. The insider explained: 'The boost to the economy is going to be phenomenal.' Beyonce is reportedly set to 'unveil a series of UK stadium gigs for next summer' going head-to-head with Oasis' stadium tour She will be rivalling the iconic Oasis' epic reunion stadium tour (Liam and Noel Gallagher pictured) Meanwhile, Oasis have 'verbally agreed' to play stadiums in America as part of their epic reunion tour. Read More Noel Gallagher is worth '8 times more' than his younger brother Liam - but BOTH are 'set to earn £400million' with highly anticipated Oasis reunion Liam, 51, and Noel Gallagher, 57, are set to sign a multi-million pound deal to play their biggest-ever US concerts, as the band have 'financial incentive' to expand the tour. A source told The Mirror: 'Their promoters at Live Nation are incredibly keen for this to happen, and Liam and Noel have verbally agreed plans. The question of if they will manage to go the duration of the tour without falling out has been raised, but there is now a massive financial incentive for them to keep the show on the road.' The report claims the band will play the 70,000 seat SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles as well as other huge venues across the United States. Billboards in New York's Times Square appeared to tease US dates. Electronic messages featured the Amazon Music logo and a picture of the Gallagher brothers with the message: 'If we need to put up a billboard to get these guys to come to the States, here it is.' It comes after Oasis have announced details of how fans who missed out on tickets in last weekend's ticketing farce can get a second chance at securing a spot at the Manchester band's reunion gigs. A source told The Sun: 'Beyonce is about to raise the roof. The demand for tickets will be just like Oasis' and will rival fans' rush to get their hands on a seat' Oasis have 'verbally agreed' to play stadiums in America as part of their epic reunion tour The rock outfit has revealed that true fans who had been sitting in the queue on Ticketmaster as the scramble for briefs began may receive an invite to buy tickets for the extra Wembley dates announced last week. Posting on their official account on X, formerly Twitter , the band said in a statement that registered Ticketmaster account holders who had been waiting to snap up spots at a specific show could receive a follow-up email inviting them to join the ballot. However, entry to the ballot will not guarantee fans a chance to buy tickets - with the band warning that entry into the box office will be 'strictly limited'. The invitations are being dished out for the two further gigs at Wembley Stadium on September 27 and 28 next year, added due to the overwhelming demand. Liam and Noel Gallagher, pictured here at the V Festival in Chelmsford in Essex in August 2005, have not played together after Oasis broke up in 2009 The band has been trying to reestablish goodwill with fans who were left bitterly disappointed when they failed to secure tickets for the limited run of reunion concerts announced on August 27. Millions of fans sought to secure some of the approximately one million tickets available for the 17 dates on the tour, which include two shows in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Dublin and five in Manchester and London apiece across July and August. But queues for some shows numbered more than 600,000 - and shortly after sales began scalpers began listing tickets on resale websites such as Viagogo for as much as £10,000.

At a Rotary Club meeting in a church south of Atlanta, the Georgia Secretary of State wants to assure any \"hardcore Republicans\" that he hasn't \"gone to the dark side\". What he means by that is the Democratic side of politics. Raffensperger is the Republican who pushed back when Donald Trump famously called him in January 2021 and said he wanted to \"find \"11,780 votes\" in Georgia. That would have given Trump one more vote than Joe Biden, who flipped the state in the 2020 presidential election from Republican to Democrat. Raffensperger's stance alienated the MAGA wing of his own party and led to threats against him and his family. But he stood firm and got re-elected as secretary of state. He has since overseen a series of voting reforms that he argues should strengthen trust in the electoral system and leave less room for conspiracy theories to flourish. The changes include more restrictions on the locations and opening hours of absentee ballot boxes. Photo identification is now required for all forms of voting, and it's illegal to give food or water to anyone waiting in line to vote. Democrats decried the changes as an assault on democracy. Raffensperger argues they benefit all Georgians. \"I want to really give you great confidence in Georgia, because we have a great story to tell,\" he tells the assembled Rotarians. But the actions of the Republican-dominated state election board are threatening to undermine those assurances. Taking on Trump's 'pitbulls' The board, which oversees and regulates elections in Georgia, has been making some other changes. The five-member board has been overhauled by Republicans in Georgia's state legislature. Raffensperger, its previous chairman, was removed from it. Three other Republicans have effectively been put in control. They have set about pushing through a series of new rules empowering local officials to investigate ballot counts at their own discretion. Raffensperger describes those new rules as \"a mess\". \"They're talking about opening up those ballot boxes at the local precincts, instead of bringing back to the headquarters in a secured box,\" the secretary of state told the ABC on the sidelines of the Rotary event. Marc Elias, a top election lawyer for the Democrats, told a podcast that the rules were akin \"to saying at a football game that we're going to give the scoreboard operator the opportunity to investigate for themselves whether a touchdown was scored\". The national and state Democratic parties have launched legal action demanding the rules be overturned. Raffensperger appears to agree with them, even if he won't say so outright. \"I do not support the rules as they are,\" he says. At a recent rally in Georgia, Trump called out the board's Republican members by name and called them \"pitbulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory\". One of the so-called pitbulls is Janelle King, a former deputy director of the state Republican Party who was appointed to the board earlier this year. \"President Trump gets excited, he says a lot of things,\" she told the ABC. \"We get attacked 24/7, all day long, so I welcome positive comments.\" King insists she is not a MAGA extremist and says she's had no conversations with Trump or his team about the rule changes. She dismisses concerns they will lead to delays in certifying the vote. \"Why do we have to overturn a rule that gives election officials more confidence in their decisions?\" she says. \"These are the things that strengthen our elections.\" But Raffensperger fears they are \"really going to jam up the works\". \"When you have too much time, it's a great friend to conspiracy theories,\" he says. 'Out of its way to basically rig the election' Democratic state senator Nabilah Islam Parkes describes the board's new rules as \"unethical\" and \"illegal\". She's written to Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp asking him to remove the board members. \"I'm worried that the state election board is going out of its way to basically rig the election for this November 5,\" Senator Islam Parkes said. \"Last time around ... Donald Trump tried to overthrow our votes, and now him and his MAGA allies are doing similar things at the state election board.\" Kemp asked his attorney-general, Chris Carr, to determine whether he was obliged to open an investigation into the board's activities. Carr found he wasn't, leading Senator Islam Parkes to accuse him of \"providing cover for the MAGA election board members\". Critics of the state election board are urging voters to keep pressuring Kemp to take action. Back in 2020, Kemp also pushed back on Trump's attempts to challenge the outcome of the election, leading to a public falling out. Recently there seems to have been a thaw in relations and, so far at least, Kemp has given no signal he's prepared to intervene in the dispute about the board's actions. Battle for the 'Black vote' The latest polls indicate another very close race in Georgia, with Trump neck and neck with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. The Republicans think they have a good chance of taking back the traditionally conservative state and Trump is making overtures to African Americans who make up one third of Georgia's population. It's here in Georgia that the former president was booked last year on criminal charges related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results in the state of the 2020 election. The case is currently on hold pending appeals, but Trump is making hay with the mugshot he got at the local jail. \"The mugshot, we've all seen the mugshot, but you know who's embraced it more than anyone else? The Black population,\" the former president said earlier this year. \"It's incredible.\" Azad Ahmadi, an Atlanta businessman and committee chair on Georgia's Black Republican Council, describes that comment as \"awkward\". \"But I get it,\" he says. \"It's not a matter of Black men identifying with being criminals. \"This is about Black men feeling like they've been marginalised, and he's one of the few white men in America that can relate to that.\" African Americans have traditionally been part of the Democrats' core constituency. In 2020 Joe Biden secured 92 per cent of the Black vote nationwide. Even a small shift in voting patterns could have seismic consequences. Azad, a 41-year-old army veteran, said he realised before the 2016 election that the Republican Party was more aligned with his \"core values\" than the Democratic Party. He was also drawn to Trump's background as a property tycoon. \"I decided that one of the things that this country needed was a businessman, and so that was very appealing to me at the time.\" For a while Azad says he kept his thoughts to himself. He jokes that, even in 2020, when he mentioned his support for Trump at his barber shop, he thought he was going to have to shoot his way out of there. Now, he says, the conversation is more open. Maurice Combs doesn't buy that. The Atlanta master barber says Trump's claims that Black men relate to his mugshot are \"like a slap to the face\". \"Because he's privileged,\" says Maurice. \"I got friends that can't vote because they're convicted of a felony and he can run for president.\" Maurice began sweeping floors in a barber shop as a teenager, and he's been working in the profession for three decades. The 51-year-old is not convinced more Black men will vote for Trump this time around. \"I don't know what Black men he talking about. Might be the guys around him that say yes to everything he say.\" Maurice doesn't think too highly of politicians in general, but says he will be voting for Kamala Harris. \"In America, we always have to go for the lesser of two evils, and I have to do what I think is going to be better for my people in the long run.\" But Harris can't rely on the support of Black voters, even here in the Deep South. Azad Ahmadi's fiancée, 34-year-old Alexandra Knoten, thinks that for the first time in her life she'll back a Republican presidential candidate. \"Your initial thought is, wow there's an African-American woman in the position to be president. \"And then that facade kind of went out the window. It's like, where has she been the whole presidency when Biden was here? I mean, it's like she was a ghost.\" When she was growing up in Louisiana, Alexandra said she just accepted that everybody around her voted Democratic. That's just the way it was. \"It's kind of like, your grandmother is a Democrat, your mother's a Democrat, so you're automatically a Democrat.\" Some of her relatives still can't believe she's \"really gonna vote for Trump\". But the sales and events manager says she also felt better off under Trump than Biden. \"I think my monthly cost in gas is about almost $1,000 or more a month, and I didn't have that issue when Trump was in office.\" A brewing political storm Georgia's secretary of state is having people from his office drop in on voting offices across Georgia to test their electronic election systems, sometimes with the media in tow. \"We want everyone to understand that we have fair, secure, accurate elections here in Georgia,\" Raffensperger tells a group which includes the ABC and crews from the US, UK and Germany. The company whose voting machines Georgia uses, Dominion, settled a defamation case against cable news giant Fox last year for $US787.5 million ($1.17 billion). Dominion sued Fox News and Fox Corporation over the airing of conspiracy theories involving the machines. Raffensperger assures the assembled media that the test at the Spalding County offices has confirmed everything is working perfectly. He wants to prevent a repeat of the chaos that followed the last vote. After he resisted Trump's attempts to find him more votes in 2020, Raffensperger says he was doxed. In 2022, he told a congressional committee that threatening messages his wife received were often sexualised and were \"disgusting\". Raffensperger also testified that someone broke into the home of his widowed daughter-in-law and her two children. (Raffensperger's son died in 2018 of a fentanyl overdose.) \"We were very concerned about her safety also.\" Asked at the time why he didn't just quit and walk away, he said he \"had to be faithful to the constitution\". \"I think sometimes moments require you to stand up and just take the shots.\" If one of those moments arises again, Raffensperger says he won't hesitate to do what he thinks is right. \"I'm always prepared to follow the law and follow the constitution,\" he told the ABC. \"I'll do my job.\"","summary":"A shake-up of the state election board in Georgia means it's now controlled by Republicans, who are changing voting rules.

The new charges brought to seven the number of wire fraud and conspiracy counts against Michele Fiore, a former state Assembly and Las Vegas City Council member who has been suspended with pay from her elected position as a justice of the peace in rural Pahrump. Each count carries a possible penalty of 20 years in prison. Fiore had pleaded not guilty July 17 to a five-count criminal indictment. Fiore and her defense attorney, Michael Sanft, invoked her right to a speedy trial and U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorse in Las Vegas said jury selection will begin Sept. 24. Sanft and federal prosecutors Dahoud Askar and Alexander Gottfried told the judge they expect trial can be completed by the second week of October. Askar and Gottfried declined outside court to speak with reporters. Neither Fiore nor Sanft commented to reporters about the case. They were accompanied by Fiore’s friend, Sigal Chattah, a lawyer and conservative GOP firebrand who lost a bid for state attorney general in 2022 to Aaron Ford, a Democrat. Chattah also is representing one of six Nevada Republican party members accused of submitting certificates to Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020 presidential election. A state judge in Las Vegas dismissed that so-called fake elector case over a venue challenge by attorneys for defendants including state GOP chairman Michael McDonald. Ford is appealing that decision to the state Supreme Court. Fiore, 54, is a sometimes flamboyant political figure best known for supporting gun ownership and backing states’ rights advocate Cliven Bundy during and after armed standoffs against federal officers in Bunkerville, Nevada, in 2014, and at a national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016. Fiore was appointed as a judge by Nye County lawmakers in 2022 after she lost her campaign for state treasurer. She was elected in June to complete the unexpired term of a judge who died. Pahrump is an hour’s drive west of Las Vegas. Fiore served in the state Legislature from 2012 to 2016, making headlines posing with guns and her family for Christmas cards in 2015.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rolled out legislation late last week to extend the current year's government funding levels through March via a continuing resolution (CR) to give congressional negotiators more time to work out the next fiscal year's spending priorities. It's attached to a Republican-led bill for a proof of citizenship requirement in the voter registration process. CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION Despite former President Donald Trump blessing the plan, Johnson can afford little room for error with a razor-thin House majority of just four votes. As of early Monday evening, it appears that at least four House Republicans are opposed to their leaders' bill – one more GOP \"no\" vote would ensure Johnson will need to seek out Democratic support for its passage. Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., told reporters on Monday that he and Reps. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., are all opposed. \"I've made it clear…that I'll be a no on the CR,\" Mills said. \"As far as I'm concerned, this is nothing more than messaging.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Burchett to confirm his stance. JOHNSON UNVEILS TRUMP-BACKED HOUSE GOP PLAN TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, SETS UP BATTLE WITH SCHUMER Massie told Fox News Digital last week that he believed it was a mistake for Johnson not to push for a longer CR. Under a bipartisan deal passed last year, a CR extending past April 30 would automatically trigger a 1% government funding cut. \"Speaker Johnson has this teed up in front of him. The 1% cut is in law. All we need is a one-year CR to queue it up. When the April 30 deadline arrives, he could even trade the cut for something. But he’s afraid to even create a spending cut deadline,\" Massie said. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., who is retiring at the end of this year, also told Fox News Digital last week that he is against the bill. MCCARTHY'S 'FINAL STRUGGLES' THREATEN TO HAUNT JOHNSON'S GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN FIGHT Lawmakers anticipate a Wednesday vote on the plan, but enough opposition could force House GOP leaders to scuttle the vote. It's possible that some Democrats will vote for the bill. Five House Democrats voted with Republicans to pass the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this year. But Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have both come out in opposition to the plan. The White House also announced Monday that President Biden would veto the bill if it got to his desk. Johnson told reporters earlier in the day that he did not have a fallback plan in case of failure. \"There is no fallback position. This is a righteous fight. This is what the American people demand and deserve,\" Johnson said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It's a position that is likely to worry moderates who worry the political fallout from a government shutdown weeks before Election Day could cost them their seats. \"If we shut down, we lose,\" one Republican told Fox News Digital last week.

The contest has completely changed since then, with Vice President Kamala Harris ascending to the top of the ticket and surpassing Trump in the polls, signaling that she may be overcoming some of the deficits that voters saw in Biden's campaign. Now it's time for another debate. Harris comes into this debate riding relatively high on climbing approval ratings and a small lead in national polling, as well as a wave of enthusiasm among her base following the Democratic National Convention in late August. Her performance Tuesday night in Philadelphia could either continue the upward trajectory or bring it to a halt, particularly as more undecided voters are likely to tune in than usual. With that in mind, we dug into the numbers to see what's on voters' minds heading into the first Harris-Trump presidential debate. Recent polling suggests that voters view Harris's campaign fairly favorably so far and think she's favored to win the debate. Meanwhile, Trump still has an edge on some of the most important issues on voters' minds, but he may be vulnerable to the same age-based attacks that his side once lobbed at Biden. From the time she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, Harris's favorability has shot up. In 538's latest average, it's about 46 percent, just short of her disapproval rating. That's much better than where she was right before Biden dropped out, when she was underwater by around 15 points: Harris' favorability surge represents a notable improvement over Biden, who's been mired at around a -15 net favorability rating for most of this year, and it's also notably better than Trump, whose rating has remained mostly flat since the start of 2024. In our most recent average, he remains almost 10 points underwater (53 percent view him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably). In an ABC News/Ipsos poll taken Aug. 23-27, 56 percent of adults said Harris is doing an excellent or good job on her campaign, compared to 41 percent who said the same of Trump, and 53 percent said she is very or somewhat qualified to serve as president, compared to 47 percent who said so of Trump. And in the all-important horse race, she's currently ahead of Trump in 538's national polling average by about 3 points in head-to-head matchups - though her momentum looks to have stalled or slipped slightly in the last couple of weeks: We appear to be at the tail end of a honeymoon period for the Harris campaign, and polls suggest that's because her candidacy energized some of the many voters who were disillusioned and unexcited about the rematch between Trump and Biden. Indeed, in that same ABC News/Ipsos poll, 64 percent of her supporters said they strongly supported her, compared with only 34 percent who said the same of Biden in early July. Forty-five percent in the August poll also said they were very or somewhat satisfied with the choice between Harris and Trump for president, compared to only 28 percent who said the same about Biden and Trump in July. Voters seem to be bringing some of their good vibes about Harris into their debate expectations too. In the ABC News/Ipsos poll, a plurality of respondents (43 percent) said they expect Harris to win Tuesday's debate, compared to 37 percent who said they expect Trump to win. That's reversed from the last debate, where voters expected Biden to perform poorly (and do worse than Trump) even before the debate. While higher expectations are a good sign for how Harris's campaign has been doing, they likely also mean that she has a higher bar to clear than Trump when it comes to impressing voters and meeting expectations. That's one reason this week's debate could be critical in whether Harris's honeymoon period translates into sustained gains, or fizzles out. So, what might voters be looking to hear from Harris and Trump in the debate? When it comes to the issues, both candidates will be looking to hold their ground on issues that they have an advantage on, while cutting into their opponents' lead on areas of weakness. Trump in some ways starts off with the high ground on key issues. The ABC News/Ipsos poll showed Trump with an advantage of 8 points over Harris when it comes to whom Americans trust more to handle inflation and the economy. Trump also had a 9-point advantage on the issue of immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, and a 7-point advantage on handling the war between Israel and Hamas. Harris has an even larger advantage over Trump on her strongest issues in this poll: 16 points on abortion and race relations, and 10 points on health care. But other recent polling has shown that voters rank those issues as less important in determining their vote than the economy and immigration. (Health care and abortion ranked just after those two issues on a similar list, while race relations was among the least important to voters.) We'll expect both candidates to talk up signature issues like abortion (for Harris) and immigration (for Trump), but we'll also be looking out for how Harris tries to shift the narrative on the economy and immigration - and how well Trump stays on topic to bolster his advantage on those issues. Of course, debates are often as much about style as substance: Voters will be keeping a close eye on how the two candidates act on stage, or who seems more \"presidential.\" And when it comes to personal attributes, Harris generally outperformed Trump. Respondents in the ABC News/Ipsos poll were particularly likely to view her as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, 43 percent to 25 percent, and she came out ahead when respondents were asked which candidate represents their personal values and understands the problems of people like them. Notably, Harris also beat out Trump by a large margin when it came to who Americans think has the better \"physical health\" and \"mental sharpness\" to serve effectively as president, with more than twice as many saying Harris was in better physical health (57 percent to 25 percent). That difference underscores one of the most obvious ways Harris's candidacy changed the dynamic of this race - she's around 20 years younger than both Biden and Trump - and raises the question of whether Trump will face some of the same age-based concerns that drove Biden out of the race. Little about this presidential contest has been traditional, and after a first presidential debate blew open the presidential race in June, this debate is expected to attract more eyes than usual. In an unusually abbreviated race between Harris and Trump, the candidates have had a short amount of time to make their cases to voters, and this week's debate will be one of the most high-profile, and-high stakes, opportunities to do so. The country will be watching to see if Harris meets high expectations, and how Trump responds in their first head-to-head matchup.","summary":"Harris' favorability surge represents a notable improvement over Biden, who's been mired at around a -15 net favorability rating for most of this year.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-what-polls-say-ahead-presidential/15283512/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15283605_kamala-trump-538-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/090924-cc-abcnl-3p-polling-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:12","author":"FiveThirtyEight,Monica Potts","authors":["FiveThirtyEight","Monica Potts"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.109},{"id":256026832,"title":"What the polls say ahead of the Harris-Trump presidential debate","text":"The June 27 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump was arguably one of the most consequential in modern history, catalyzing Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21, less than a month later.

(Haiyun Jiang and Eric Lee) Ahead of Tuesday’s presidential debate and less than two weeks before early voting begins, Minnesota’s Democratic leaders are keeping their focus on the former president and abortion rights. Despite Gov. Tim Walz’s nomination as the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate, almost all the talk at a Monday news conference by Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and DFL Party Chair Ken Martin was focused on the conservative Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025,” a collection of policy proposals the think tank wants to see enacted if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and the possibility that abortion would be banned nationwide. Flanagan said policies like abortion bans are already being enacted in some parts of the country. “Half the women in this country do not have access to safe, legal abortions,” she said. “We know that because they are coming here.” The combative tone was a marked contrast to the “politics of joy” chord that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has sought to strike, especially since Walz joined the ticket. “It is happening right now and we don’t have to wait until day one” of a second Trump administration, Flanagan said. Tayler Rahm, a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign in Minnesota, said he also expected to see a marked contrast between Harris and Trump. “I think people tomorrow are going to watch two completely different candidates,” Rahm said Monday. He said he expected Trump to talk about how prices were lower during his presidency, and about border security and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza that began while Harris has been serving as vice president. Rahm said whatever policy proposals Harris brings up, he wants to know what she has been doing for three and a half years as vice president to advance them. The Democrats also attacked Trump on style. Related Coverage Nation Little debate that Pennsylvania is key as Harris and Trump prep for Philly showdown “Just disagreeing on policies is not weird,” Carter said, echoing Walz’s well-worn quip about Trump and his vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance. “Going on and on and on about Hannibal Lecter is weird,” Carter said, referring to the fictional horror movie villain Trump has spoken about often in campaign speeches this summer, comparing the movie character to undocumented immigrants. Flanagan and Carter both said they anticipated Trump would be disruptive during the debate.","summary":"Donald Trump, abortion rights and the “Project 2025″ conservative policy framework are the focus for the DFL headed into the debate.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/ahead-of-trump-harris-debate-minnesota-democrats-focus-on-former-president/601141500","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/6XECBHHP3RFVPLOC5UOGADXS3E.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:14:11","author":"Josie Albertson","authors":["Josie Albertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":256027168,"title":"The important action Kamala Harris needs to take against Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump is now exposed","text":"A liberal columnist says Kamala Harris has to repudiate the unpopular positions of Joe Biden and say how she’ll be a change from her current boss to beat Donald Trump. Harris has struggled to differentiate herself from Biden, who was underwater in the polls before he dropped out of the race. Jonathan Chait, a reliably left-wing pundit who pushed for the Dems to dump Biden after his debate disaster in Georgia, now says Harris has to ‘cut Biden loose’. He slammed Harris’ CNN interview for ‘turning the page buy contrasting herself exclusively against Donald Trump, rather than her current boss’. Chait then asks, ahead of Tuesday night’s pivotal debate: ‘Why is this a struggle? Why not directly repudiate unpopular Biden positions?’ He goes on to cite polls released by the New York Times Sunday which says 61% of voters want someone to bring ‘major change’ from Biden. However, only 25% of those surveyed would see Harris as being a major change from the president. He says that these polling figures and Biden’s unpopularity before he dropped out of the race make him a ‘liability’ for Harris. Because of this, Chait argues ‘Harris’s strategy should focus entirely on catering to the public with no attention whatsoever to Biden’s feelings’. He finishes his New York Magazine piece by disagreeing with a Trump spokesperson who claims Harris is tethered to Biden completely as the VP. ‘The vice-presidency is a strange office, lacking any formal authority. Its inhabitants have generally lamented the powerlessness of the job. Harris really ought to stop thinking about her position as a confining dilemma and realize that it is a liberating opportunity to define her campaign as whatever she wants it to be, unburdened by what has been.’ The latest polls – which include the Times’ poll Chait cited – have tilted the Daily Mail’s election model in Donald Trump’s direction giving him a decisive lead over Kamala Harris a day before he goes head to head with his Democratic rival on the debate stage. The algorithms show he now has a 55 percent chance of becoming president, a 4.5-point boost since last week. The model works by crunching all the latest polling numbers—national and state—along with decades of historical trends and economic data before feeding the results through the electoral college to work out who is most likely to hit the 270 votes needed to win the election. Our result comes hard on the heels of a New York Times/Siena College poll giving Trump a one-point lead at the weekend, suggesting Harris’s honeymoon is coming to an end. Feeding that and other recent surveys into the model, developed for us by J.L. Partners, shows that the crucial battleground of Pennsylvania has now moved clearly into the Trump column. Tuesday brings a potentially decisive moment when Harris meets Trump in a televised debate. The Harris campaign’s goal for the debate is to create a viral moment similar to what Harris experienced during her questioning of Brett Kavanaugh in his Supreme Court confirmation hearing and during her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, when she famously told him: ‘I’m speaking.’ Those moments played over and over again on social media, casting her in a good light. Her advisers expect many Americans will see the debate through those types of social media moments. Trump, however, will be on mute while Harris answers questions, denying him the opportunity to interrupt and her the opportunity to snap back at him. Harris is locked up with staff in Pittsburgh, going through five days of intense debate prep before the September 10th showdown in Philadelphia. The debate will be the first time she and Trump actually meet. The two have been in the same room before – Harris, as senator, attended Trump’s State of Union addresses in the House chamber when he was president but the two have never been formally introduced. The pressure is on. Joe Biden’s performance in the first presidential debate resulted in his departure from the race. While no one expects the same result for Harris, she will need to show she can take on the former president.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA liberal columnist says Kamala Harris has to repudiate the unpopular positions&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The important action Kamala Harris needs to take against Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump is now exposed first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-important-action-kamala-harris-needs-to-take-against-joe-biden-to-beat-donald-trump-is-now-exposed/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/09/23/89465421-13831391-image-a-1_1725922061091.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:13:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":256027144,"title":"On the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to survive","text":"AURORA, Colo. — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November. Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son Dylan by the hand and led him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn & Suites. It was one of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of them Venezuelan, over the last two years. First they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband earned begging on the street, they bought a tent. They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its immigrant population. “We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,” Herrera, 28, said in Spanish. “It feels safer.” That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her body around her son’s, Ivanni Herrera cried. Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to the U.S. seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers – or whether to help at all. Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets – even those who are pregnant. Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S. Border Patrol reports – more than in the previous nine years combined. Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the success she had seen was real. She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now sleeping outside in the cold. In Colorado’s third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants into the community because it “does not currently have the financial capacity to fund new services.” Yet still they come, because of its lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community. Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city, suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex. Authorities say that hasn’t happened. The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by emergency Medicaid. Herrera refused. “How,” she asked, “could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?” Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700 migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to another city. Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities, scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like Aurora. Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit. “It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,” Marley said. “That leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars. Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.” When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby getting close. She called an ambulance. The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together. Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She brought him to the tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the baby, had contracted chicken pox. “The baby was in a bad state,” said Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to Herrera’s. Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited the family to live with her – at first, for free. After a couple weeks, the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month. To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about $50. Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don’t have the money. What’s worse, they’re deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of staying in the U.S. “I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,” she says. Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand their phones to whoever answers the door. Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the months-long trip from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. “I’ll have my family back together,” she says. And she believes her sister will be able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work. The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how she spends her time. “They think I’m fixing up homes and selling chocolate and flowers,” she says. “I’m living a lie.” Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to Denver? The tickets are $600. Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has let on. She texts back: No.","summary":"Over the past two years, an unprecedented number of Venezuelans have come to the United States seeking a better life.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/09/on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/US_Immigration_Pregnant_Migrants_35581_22b9f0.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:12:21","author":"Bianca Vázquez Toness,BIANCA VÁZQUEZ TONESS - Associated Press","authors":["Bianca Vázquez Toness","BIANCA VÁZQUEZ TONESS - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":256026404,"title":"Clarence Thomas Faces Recusal Call From Democrats After Wife's Comment","text":"Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have called on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving a religious legal group after his wife reportedly thanked the conservative organization for its efforts to block Supreme Court reform.Thomas, a conservative appointed by former President George H.W. Bush in 1991, has been one of the justices at the center of calls for court reform after it was revealed that he has accepted millions of dollars in gifts from some top Republican donors without disclosing the items and luxury vacations to the court. Questions of Thomas' impartiality were also raised after his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, pressured officials to overturn the 2020 election results in favor of former President Donald Trump.Investigative outlet ProPublica first reported last week that Ginni Thomas recently praised conservative legal group First Liberty Institute in an email to the firm's president and CEO, Kelly Shackelford, for the organization's work in opposing change to the High Court.Per the report, which included a clip of Shackelford reading Thomas' email aloud during a meeting with donors on July 31, the justice's wife wrote that she could not \"adequately express enough appreciation for you guys pulling into reacting to the [President Joe Biden] effort on the Supreme Court.\"Shackelford said that Thomas added later in the email, writing in all caps, \"YOU GUYS HAVE FILLED THE SAILS OF MANY JUDGES. CAN I JUST TELL YOU, THANK YOU SO, SO, SO MUCH.\"Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released a statement on Monday that Ginni Thomas' email to First Liberty Institute is \"deeply problematic,\" writing, \"Whether she's inflating her knowledge of judges' views on ethics reform or telling the truth, her apparent comments on behalf of judicial officers create a clear appearance of impropriety for Justice Thomas.\"\"He must recuse himself from any case involving First Liberty Institute,\" Durbin added in the statement, which was posted to X, formerly Twitter, by Law360 reporter Katie Buehler.The Senate Judiciary Committee's account on X also shared a video of Shackelford reading Ginni Thomas' email, writing in the post, \"Commenting on behalf of judicial officers creates a clear appearance of impropriety.\"Newsweek on Monday reached out to Durbin's office for further comment. An email was also sent to First Liberty Institute.Two days before the reported meeting between Shackelford and donors, Biden unveiled a plan for Supreme Court reform, which would include instituting term limits and an enforceable ethics code. Republican leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have said that Biden's plans would \"tilt the balance of power\" between the federal branches of government.Public trust in the High Court has steadily dropped in recent years, and Thomas is not the only conservative jurist who has faced scandals related to Trump. Justice Samuel Alito, appointed by former President George W. Bush, was under fire earlier this year after The New York Times reported that two separate symbols related to the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election were seen outside of Alito's homes after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol waged by Trump supporters.Several Democrats have called on the justices to recuse themselves from cases related to the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in July also filed articles of impeachment against Alito and Thomas.","summary":"ProPublica reported that Ginni Thomas recently praised a religious conservative legal group's push to block Supreme Court reform.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/clarence-thomas-faces-recusal-call-democrats-after-wifes-comment-1951204","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2467611/thomas-facing-recusal-call-democrats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:06:30","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.11},{"id":256026470,"title":"Ariana Grande Applauds Megan Thee Stallion for Encouraging People to Vote for Kamala Harris","text":"Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion may have collaborated on “34+35,” but their stance on whether people should vote in the upcoming election is as simple as 1+1.

In late July, a network of influencers who had been recruited to push conservative messages about Donald Trump or President Joe Biden throughout the summer, received an email requesting they make colorful sexual insults about Harris, according to Semafor. In return, they would be paid tens of thousands of dollars via Zelle, a digital payments network. The email, titled “War Room – Kamala Messaging” was followed by a Zoom invitation from the person who organized the group, a man calling himself James Bacon. On the Zoom call, individuals kept their cameras off and did not identify themselves by name, the report noted. However, Semafor reports that one person on the call was able to identify an individual who spoke up in protest of making sexual allegations about Harris and later left the call - disgraced Republican congressman George Santos. The unidentified person who participated in the calls claims Santos broke the usual anonymity to say he disapproved of the messaging which included comparing Harris to the “Hawk Tuah girl” - a woman who went viral for talking about sex - and other crude sexual allegations. Santos confirmed to The Independent that he was invited to the call and joined out of curiosity but was quickly taken aback by the organizers’ suggestions to call Harris “a hoe” and openly objected to it. He said the message the organizers provided was “lewd, disgusting and unbecoming of the political process” so he logged off. “Nothing in this world would make me smear VP Harris or anyone running for office with slanderous sexual innuendos, it’s beneath the standards of what the American people deserve,” Santos said. “If you’re getting paid, I don’t care how much it is. Nothing justifies calling a person running for President of the United States ‘a hoe’,” he added. The former New York congressman said the call was the first time he was invited to the group by Bacon. The Independent has reached out to an email associated with a man named James Bacon for comment. It is unclear if the person behind the social media network is actually named James Bacon. A man named James Bacon who served as a former aide to Trump and has been an adviser to The Heritage Foundation, told Semafor he was unfamiliar with the social media influencer group. The individual who was on the call claimed Bacon’s voice at public appearance did not match the one on the Zoom calls. Days after the influencers received the email and call request, Santos said he was so “bothered” by it that he tweeted criticizing the “talking points” of the election, specifying “conservative influencers talking about Kamala’s sex life and race.” Criticisms about Harris’s sex life and history began swirling on social media around the time she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket. This included allegations of infidelity, using sexual relationships to advance her political career and more. In late August, Donald Trump reposted on Truth Social an unsubstantiated suggestion that Harris gave sexual favors in exchange for power. Four people who made posts or videos accusing Harris of sex-related improprieties around the time of the email being sent, denied involvement with the influencer network being paid to push similar rhetoric, Semafor reported. However, one individual who spoke with the news outlet said they were paid upwards of $20,000 for their work. Zelle receipts viewed by Semafor confirmed their information. This individual claimed the payments were connected to an anonymous, wealthy American, but offered no evidence to substantiate this claim, the report noted. The participant indicated the payments were connected to an unnamed wealthy American but there was no evidence linking them, per the report. Besides making sexual smears against Harris, the mysterious group also encouraged influencers to attack Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump’s New York criminal trial, accuse Biden of being weak and claim Democrats were weaponizing the government against conservatives.","summary":"Ex-congressman George Santos told The Independent he was invited to join call but objected to making such slurs about Harris","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/influencers-paid-sexual-smears-harris-b2609542.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/09/15/newFile-7.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/72WTN4Z6-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 23:04:31","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":256026684,"title":"How to watch the Harris-Trump presidential debate on TV and online","text":"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are set to meet Tuesday, Sept. 10, in Philadelphia, for what might be their only debate before the November election.
