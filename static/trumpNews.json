The RNC delegates greeted Navarro with a standing ovation lasting more than a minute. Making light of his time in the joint, Navarro said in jest: “You folks just want to know if you can see the MAGA tattoo that I got in there.” Navarro regaled the audience with the tale of how “Joe Biden and his department of injustice put me there” because the Jan. 6 committee had demanded he “betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin. I refused.” Navarro warned the crowd: “If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful. They will come for you.” The crowd lustily applauded this convicted criminal when he insisted of his supposed persecution: “They did not break me. And they will never break Donald Trump.” Trump has privately promised to reward for Navarro for holding his tongue and not becoming yet another Trump sycophant-turned-“fucking rat.” (That is a preferred, profane term that former President Trump has often used — especially when privately mocking his ex-fixer Michael Cohen — to ridicule those who’ve turned on him or flipped under pressure from law enforcement.) For days, various sources close to Trump and other Republicans working at the convention reveled in the unveiling of Navarro at the downtown Milwaukee arena, eagerly awaiting and planning it out as a theatrical owning-of-the-libs kind of moment. One Republican close to Trump gleefully messaged Rolling Stone from the arena as Navarro was mid-speech, sending a short video of the former Trump White House official and just one word: “Gangsta.” In the past, Trump so appreciated Navarro’s counsel and his cult-like devotion that Trump bestowed upon him the affectionate nickname of: “My Peter.” The Republican Party has long touted itself as the party of “law and order,” and did so repeatedly during Tuesday night’s programming. But the unprecedented and inescapable outcome of nominating a man convicted of dozens of felony counts is that the GOP convention has become a defiant celebration of criminality and lawless conduct — a festival where obedience to the law is far less important than loyalty to Trump. Trump has been convicted of 34 felonies for falsifying business records in part of a scheme to hide a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Daniels has claimed she had an extramarital affair with Trump — the politically damaging news of which threatened to spill into public view in advance of the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton. The party line at the convention is that Trump — rather than being a perpetrator of crime — is in fact the victim of “lawfare” maliciously wielded by his Democratic enemies. (Navarro coined the phrase “lawfare jackals,” to describe those who put him in prison.) Despite the recent gift by a Trump-appointed judge dismissing the felony charges for stockpiling classified documents at his Florida club, Mar a Lago, Trump remains in significant legal jeopardy in the election tampering cases — both on the federal level and in Georgia. For Trump, personally, the biggest upshot of regaining the White House could be the ability to instruct his Justice Department to intervene to drop the federal charges against him. Trump has also pledged to use his pardon power liberally to free the insurgents who stormed the U.S. Capitol on his behalf on Jan. 6. Remarkably — or, inevitably — official merchandise for sale inside Fiserv Forum, where the convention is staged, celebrates the trappings of Trump’s criminal record. T-Shirts and beer koozies are for sale featuring Trump’s mugshot and the slogan “Never Surrender!” Another vendor at the outdoors ConventionFest was doing brisk business selling a shirt reading “I’m Voting for the Convicted Felon,” and another with the number 47 made up of a cross hatch of the words “CONVICTED” and “FELON.” When asked if she saw any irony in selling this kind of merch when Trump’s convention had just staged their law-enforcement-adulating “Make America Safe Once Again”-themed festivities in the arena the night prior, third outdoor vendor simply snapped at Rolling Stone: “It doesn’t count if the crimes are bullshit!” With its recent decision on presidential immunity, the Supreme Court has now endowed the presidency king-like powers — such that as long as presidential conduct can be deemed an “official act,” it is beyond the reach of criminal law that would apply to any other citizen. Trump — the only party nominee with a rap sheet — is poised to be immune from prosecution for any future crimes he might commit, or instruct others to commit on his behalf. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Navarro authored several dossiers claiming to prove nonexistent fraud in the election. With Steve Bannon, he also helped formulate a plot known as the Green Bay Sweep, seeking to block certification of the Electoral College. Navarro discussed his post election role in an interview with Rolling Stone — but was subsequently convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify under oath. Navarro is not the only high profile RNC conventioneer with significant legal challenges or a flippant view of the laws he chooses not to follow. Longtime Trump lawyer and confidant Rudy Giuliani faces felony charges in Arizona for his alleged role in attempting to subvert the outcome of the 2020 presidential contest with a “fake electors” scheme. Three fellow defendants from this fake elector case received permission from a judge to attend the convention; they are RNC delegates. Giuliani, who made a tumbling entrance at the convention earlier this week, also lost a massive $148 million judgment for defaming a pair of election workers in Georgia. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz also earned a speaking slot Wednesday. Gaetz was investigated — but will not be facing criminal charges — for his alleged connection to a sex trafficking crime involving a teenager, for which an associate has been convicted. Gaetz remains under a House ethics investigation that is looking into a laundry list of potential misbehavior including whether he “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.” Regardless, Gaetz used his convention speech to take a jab at playing himself up as a clean politician who doesn’t accept lobbyist money, and said he looks forward to joining Donald Trump and vowed “the swamp draining will recommence soon.”","summary":"The RNC gave Peter Navarro a minute-long standing ovation after his release from jail.

But now, as the show comes to the end of its fourth season, it is blurring the line between real and fiction more than ever — to the delight and disappointment of its huge, fractured fanbase. What is The Boys about? The Boys is a hyper-cynical action comedy series skewering the superhero franchises that have taken over pop culture in recent years, as well as capitalism at large. In this world, superheroes, or supes, are a real and integral part of society. Not because they do any real saving, but because they are the shoulders the catastrophically profitable Vought International company leans on. Vought's crowning glory is the Seven, an Avengers knock-off of supes led by Superman stand-in Homelander. Homelander will sell everything from milk to Marvel-esqe action films for Vought, and he also likes to dabble in a little mass murder. The titular Boys are the rag-tag group of rogue agents working with the FBI to stop Vought and Homelander from taking over the world. With an executive producing dream team of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen (who had already proved their graphic-novel-to-TV-show chops with Preacher) as well as showrunner Eric Kripke — the guy who is also responsible for a little show called Supernatural — it's no surprise the show has seen success. The Boys was one of the first Amazon Prime shows that Nielsen started to track. By the time it hit its third season in 2022, it was the number one most-streamed superhero show in the US, hoovering up 10.6 billion minutes watched (which is about 20,000 years of The Boys). Its fourth season, arriving in June of this year after being delayed by the 2023 WGA/SAG strike, confirmed that The Boys fanbase is still growing: Prime reported the first episodes improved on season three's numbers by 21 per cent. Is The Boys left leaning or right wing? The Boys has always taken pride in skewering as many problematic parts of capitalism as possible. Homelander and his cronies might do the dirty work, but Vought is the main antagonist, always there to spin the mess into money. For example, in season two, Homelander outs fellow Seven member Queen Maeve as queer to punish her for insolence. Then, in a send-up of rainbow-washed capitalism, Vought immediately branded her 'Brave Maeve' and began making her sexuality a marketable product. But something strange started to happen. Some viewers seemed to be shocked when progressive storylines emerged, as they had believed the show was actually making fun of left-leaning politics. The Boys boisterous subreddit went into meltdown last season after cop-coded supe Blue Hawk killed an innocent, unarmed Black man and then, when he attempts to apologise, ends up injuring more Black people while yelling \"Supe Lives Matter!\" Season four's upset concerned Frenchie, the chemical mastermind of The Boys, who enters into a homosexual relationship. This led to allegations of review bombing, with season four only scoring 52 per cent on review site Rotten Tomatoes, even though the critical rating was 93 per cent. One of the reviews on the site said they rated it low because of \"the blatant alienation of half their audience by implication that if you have any conservative views at all you are evil\", with another reviewer saying: \"They totally ruined this show. I really liked the unwoke versions, seasons 1–3. Season 4 is terrible.\" Conversely, someone who gave the show five stars wrote: \"I loved it, especially episode 4. It's getting review bombed because the people the show is satirising just realised they were being satirised.\" In typical Boys fashion, the show took aim at the review bombers with an in-universe advertisement for a Vought browser guaranteed to make it easier to leave bad reviews on undesirable shows. Showrunner Eric Kripke was more direct in his response to the fans crying \"woke\". \"Anyone who wants to call the show 'woke' or whatever, that's OK. Go watch something else,\" Kripke told The Hollywood Reporter. What does Homelander have to do with Donald Trump? The character of Homelander has quickly become the face of The Boys, as a character who challenges the notion that a person with superpowers would also automatically be benevolent. Blessed (or cursed) with flight, super strength, durability, heightened senses and laser eyes, Homelander is not only the most physically powerful person in The Boys universe but also beloved as America's hero, thanks to Vought's cultural omnipresence. Publicly he's saving the world, but behind closed doors he's a megalomaniac, committing dozens of unspeakable atrocities — from fatally eye-lasering people, to making a fellow Seven member eat his best friend alive as a loyalty test (to be fair, his best friend was an octopus, but the scene is still horrifying). One of the more baffling interpretations of Homelander from fans is that he is an anti-hero. \"I don't know how you root for Homelander,\" Kripke told Variety in June. \"When the guy is slurping up breast milk, and being the weakest character in the show over and over and over again and being like — he's not even particularly macho. He's weird. He's weird and thin-skinned, and I don't know how you look at that guy and you're like, 'That's my guy.'\" Since the very first season, people have been drawing the line between 'anti-hero' Homelander and another divisive man in a position of extreme power — former US president Donald Trump. Although the allusions in the show were pretty clear, it wasn't until 2022 that Kripke explicitly said Homelander is an analogue for Trump. \"All [Homelander] ever wants is to be the most powerful person he can be, even though he's completely inadequate in his abilities to handle it,\" Kripke told Rolling Stone. \"So it's white-male victimisation and unchecked ambition. And those issues just happened to reflect the guy who, it's just still surreal to say it, was fucking president of the United States.\" A season of blurred lines While The Boys was never subtle about holding up a mirror to US politics, season four takes the analogy and runs wild. Canonically Homelander could destroy the world, if only it wasn't for his deep-rooted and immutable need for the love and adoration of other people — his kryptonite. It's so integral to the plot that season two concluded with Homelander being thwarted because Maeve threatens to destroy his public image by leaking a video of him killing innocent civilians. But this small amount of leverage dissipated upon the climax of season three, when Homelander lasers off the head of an anti-Vought protestor in the middle of the street, in broad daylight. Instead of surrounding crowds being horrified, they clap and cheer, and Homelander learns that the public will love him even when he shows his real self. There has been speculation that this is a direct parallel to another very powerful man who openly theorised that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and not lose any favour with the public. But Trump isn't the only public figure to get a Boys counterpart. One of the first new characters introduced in season four is Misty Tucker Gray, aka Firecracker, the supe host of a wildly popular InfoWars-like conspiracy podcast. Homelander brings her into the Seven so he can capitalise on her loyal audience. Draped in ammo, spitting micro-aggressions and spouting theories about paedophile cabals and Jewish space lasers, Firecracker was modelled on controversial Republican figure Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kripke admitted to Variety. They even have the same initials. And in a stomach-twisting parallel to reality, the season ramps up to an insurrection against the US government, orchestrated in part by Homelander. It's to be conducted on January 6th, and there are plans in motion to construct internment camps for any dissidents. The Boys now so closely reflects real-life US politics that some fans are projecting plots onto the recent shooting at a Pennsylvania Trump rally. What's next for The Boys? Kripke has confirmed that the fifth season will be The Boys' last. But The Boys franchise will live on. Amazon Prime has already funded two spin-offs: the animated The Boys Presents: Diabolical, and the college version of The Boys, Gen V, which is in pre-production for season two. A Spanish language spin-off called The Boys: Mexico is currently in the early stages of conception. This is in addition to an Audible (subsidiary of Amazon) podcast spin-off and multiple web series. Outside of TV, Homelander is now a playable character in Mortal Kombat 1 and in Call of Duty. The Boys is starting to resemble the superhero cinematic universes that it parodies. It's a strange parallel for fans who have spent years reckoning with the fact that such a fiercely anti-capitalist is produced by Amazon, a multinational technology company worth more than US$2 trillion ($2.9 trillion) that also has branched into original entertainment, government and military contracts. The irony isn't lost on Kripke either. Earlier in the year he tweeted that he refused to let Amazon include demographic-specific product placement in the show, even going as far to parody the concept in season four. But that doesn't mean some Amazon product placement doesn't slip through. \"I worry a lot about becoming the thing that we're satirising. Like, daily, I worry about it,\" Kripke told Rolling Stone in June. \"I say it all the time to people: our brand is punk rock. We deserve extra scorn if we sell out.\"","summary":"Superhero satire The Boys has been brutally sending up late stage capitalism for half a decade but the latest season might hit too close to home. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-18/the-boys-season-four-finale-trump-homelander/104108714","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b04b6fad5c45cdb81361c45846c51d25?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=608&cropW=1080&xPos=0&yPos=586&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 00:05:14","author":"Velvet Winter","authors":["Velvet Winter"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":252025778,"title":"The challenges of navigating an unrelenting news cycle","text":"Millions of Americans absorbed a dizzying political news cycle this past weekend, trying to process a series of extraordinary headlines for an already divided electorate.

And what his research says about such news events — especially extraordinary moments like the attempted assassination — might be surprising.\"The people who consume the most news, they're there for a reason, they enjoy this type of content, even news that might stress them out,\" Motta told CBS News, explaining that to some degree, \"a fair way of putting it\" is that they enjoy being miserable. \"And they are a relatively small number of people in the American electorate, but they are precisely the types of people who are the most likely to vote,\" Motta said. Normally, only 38% of Americans pay close attention to the news, according to a Gallup survey last year, but there was nothing normal about this three-day news cycle.The assassination attempt served as a ground-shaking moment, grafting next-level news trauma on the American psyche.America's mindset was already racing with the pandemic, racism and racial tension, inflation and climate disasters.

But that also comes with consequences. \"If people disengage, then we potentially run the risk of losing their opinions at the ballot box,\" Motta said.

Nancy Mace (R-SC) took the stage during the third day of the Republican National Convention to appeal to female voters as GOP lawmakers made the case for former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Mace introduced herself as both a “single mom” and “rape survivor” in her remarks, telling female attendees in the crowd that they “have a sister in me.” The South Carolina Republican also pointed to her father’s experience as an Army brigadier general as she lauded Trump’s foreign policies when he was in office. “What we’re witnessing today is proof that strength preserves peace and weakness invites war,” Mace said. “We can never project strength around the world when weakness stands in the White House.” Mace specifically cited the threat China poses, arguing the country has caused an increase in fentanyl being smuggled across the U.S. border. Mace again made an appeal to female voters to argue China “oppress[es] their own people, especially women.” “I know a strong leader when I see one,” Mace said. “Donald Trump’s stood up to China before and he will do it again.” Mace’s speech comes on the third day of the quadrennial convention, which bears the theme “Make America Strong Again,” focusing on the country’s foreign policy and international standing. Mace was one of several House Republicans to hold a speaking slot during the high-profile nominating convention, especially as GOP leaders look to expand their historically small margin next year.

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$238.8 billion for the quarter ended June 30, according to an LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 21 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 second-quarter net profit of T$181.8 billion. While TSMC's stock - and the broader Taiwan market - has reached record highs, it dropped 2.4 per cent on Wednesday after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Taiwan \"did take about 100 per cent of our chip business\" and should pay the U.S. for its defence as it does not give the country anything. TSMC last week reported a jump in Taiwan-dollar denominated second-quarter revenue, comfortably beating market expectations. It will give third-quarter revenue guidance in U.S. dollars. On Wednesday, ASML, the world's biggest chipmaking equipment supplier, reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. TSMC, at its quarterly earnings call starting at 0600 GMT on Thursday, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including its capital expenditure, as it races to expand production. TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it has said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. On its last earnings call in April, TSMC maintained its guidance for capital spending this year at $28 billion to $32 billion, compared with last year's $30.45 billion, and said 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the total would go towards advanced technologies. The second half of the year is traditionally the peak season for Taiwanese tech companies as they race to supply customers ahead of the year-end holiday season in major Western markets. The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock leaping 74 per cent so far this year to historic highs, compared with a 31 per cent gain for the broader market. TSMC, colloquially referred to in Taiwan as the \"sacred mountain protecting the country\" for its critical role in Taiwan's export-dependent economy, faces little competition, though both Intel and Samsung are trying to challenge its dominance.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/tsmc-set-report-strong-profit-stock-pressured-trump-comments-4487216","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--u8aOYyXR--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-18t000304z_1_lynxmpek6h001_rtroptp_3_tsmc-results.jpg?i","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-18 00:03:04","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":252025580,"title":"Peter Navarro Slams Nancy Pelosi During His RNC Moment: 'Did Not Break Me'","text":"Peter Navarro, who previously served as former President Donald Trump's adviser, took the stage at the Republican National Convention the day he was released from prison.Navarro spoke in Milwaukee on the third day of the RNC too loud cheers from the crowd.

Thousands of his supporters are gathered in Milwaukee, Wisc. in a hall filled with balloons and draped in red, white and blue. Each night, people like House Speaker Mike Johnson, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson have criticized the policies of the current administration. They cited everything from the border, the Constitution and foreign policy as areas of weakness that their candidate could improve upon if elected.

An attempt on Trump's life Trump's platform has been consistent since he first launched his bid for president in 2015, making foreign policy comments like: \"When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China, in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time.\" His message for America has long been one of grievance and retribution, and he's talked about crime and drugs, immigrants and taxes in his typical Trump fashion. But this was, of course, before an attempt was made on his life on Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump spoke with Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito in the hours after the shooting. She recounted that interview on CNN, saying: \"He said in that moment he understood that everything had changed for the country and himself.\" Will anything change? NPR's Franco Ordoñez joined Ari Shapiro from Milwaukee to share where the RNC might be headed now. For one, he says the vibe is fairly euphoric, as if the Republican Party is celebrating an election already won. But when it comes to Trump himself, some are saying he seems different, more vulnerable. \"He's been kind of visibly subdued,\" Ordoñez said. \"He's got that white bandage on his right ear, he sits in the VIP section surrounded by friends and family. He's calm, sometimes even emotional, such as when Sarah Sanders and Laura Trump were telling stories about how he is as a grandfather. People tell me that an experience like that on Saturday, being so close to death can change a person. And sources tell me it has impacted him.\" But when it comes to the messaging of Trump's campaign, Ordoñez believes that remains unchanged: \"Trump's not known for being vulnerable. And I said again, a key message of the campaign is strength versus weakness. And his campaign insists those message are not going to change.\" This episode was produced by Brianna Scott and Gurjit Kaur.

Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records to the public, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family. The first word on Trump’s condition came about half an hour after shots rang out and Trump dropped to the ground after reaching for his ear and then pumping his fist defiantly to the crowd with blood streaming down his face. The campaign issued a statement saying he was “fine” and “being checked out at a local medical facility.” “More details will follow,” his spokesperson said. It wasn’t until 8:42 p.m., however, that Trump told the public he had been struck by a bullet as opposed to shrapnel or debris. In a post on his social media network, Trump wrote that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part” of his right ear. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote. Presidents and major-party candidates have long had to balance their right to doctor-patient confidentiality with the public’s expectations that they confirm they are healthy enough to serve, particularly when questions arise about their readiness. Trump, for example, has long pressed Biden to take a cognitive test with the Democratic president facing doubts after his stumbling debate performance. After a would-be assassin shot and gravely wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the Washington, D.C., hospital where he was treated gave regular, detailed public updates about his condition and treatment. There has no been no further word since Saturday from Trump’s campaign or other officials on his condition or treatment. Trump has appeared at the Republican National Convention the past three days with a bandage over his right ear. The former president does not normally travel with a protective press pool, something candidates typically agree to once they become their parties’ official nominee. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who served as Trump’s White House doctor and traveled to be with him after the shooting, said in a podcast interview Monday that Trump was missing part of his ear — “a little bit at the top” — but that the wound would heal. “He was lucky,” Jackson said on “The Benny Show,” a conservative podcast hosted by Benny Johnson. ”It was far enough away from his head that there was no concussive effects from the bullet. And it just took the top of his ear off, a little bit of the top of this ear off as it passed through.” He said that the area would need to be treated with care to avoid further bleeding — “It’s not like a clean laceration like you would have with a knife or a blade, it’s a bullet track going by,” he said — but that Trump is “not going to need anything to be done with it. It’s going to be fine.” The former president’s son Eric Trump said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday that his father had had “no stitches but certainly a nice flesh wound.” The lack of information continues a pattern for Trump, who has released minimal medical information throughout his political career. When he first ran in 2016, Trump declined to release full medical records, and instead released a note from his doctor that declared Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Dr. Harold Bornstein later revealed that the glowing, four-paragraph assessment was written in 5 minutes as a car sent by Trump to collect it waited outside. Jackson, after administering a physical to Trump in 2018, drew headlines for extolling the then-president’s “incredibly good genes” and suggesting that “if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.” When Trump was infected with the coronavirus in the midst of his 2020 re-election campaign, his doctors and aides tried to downplay the severity of his condition and withheld information about how sick he was and key details of his treatment. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows wrote in his book that Trump’s blood oxygen dropped to a “dangerously low level” and that there were concerns that Trump would not be able to walk on his own if he had waited longer to be transported to Walter Reed for treatment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMILWAUKEE – Four days after a gunman&#8217;s attempt to assassinate former President&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump hasn&#8217;t provided any updates on his medical treatment after surviving an assassination attempt. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-hasnt-provided-any-updates-on-his-medical-treatment-after-surviving-an-assassination-attempt/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Trump-has-given-no-official-info-about.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:54:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":252025230,"title":"Donald Trump Breaks His Record in New Poll","text":"A record number of Americans believe that former President Donald Trump is going to beat President Joe Biden in November.In a poll released Wednesday by The Economist and YouGov, 49 percent of U.S. adults said that they think Trump would win the 2024 presidential election with him as the Republican nominee and Biden as the Democrats' pick. That number included 16 percent of Democratic participants, 46 percent of independents and 88 percent of Republicans.Trump's odds for reelection were significantly greater than the 26 percent of adults who said they believed Biden would win in November. Another 25 percent of the 1,582 adults surveyed between July 13 and 16 said they were unsure. The survey specified that participants should pick who they believe will be successful \"regardless of who you prefer\" for president.A spokesperson for YouGov confirmed with Newsweek that the recent poll result is the highest number of support Trump has received when compared to past surveys where participants were asked who they viewed as the likely next president. Last week's poll found that 48 percent of adults anticipated that Trump would be reelected, while 29 percent picked Biden.In the last survey conducted by the Economist/YouGov before the June 27 presidential debate, 41 percent of participants said they believed Trump would win, compared to the 32 percent who selected Biden.Newsweek reached out to Biden and Trump's campaigns via email for comment Wednesday evening.Participants were also asked how likely they think Biden is to step down as the Democratic Party's nominee before November. Party members have been split over whether the president should drop out of the 2024 election to allow another Democrat to take his spot on the ballot. Polling has shown that Vice President Kamala Harris is the favorite to replace Biden if he does step aside.Most Americans (65 percent) said that the president was \"not very\" or \"not at all likely\" to drop out of the race. Nineteen percent said that they believed it was \"very\" or \"somewhat likely\" that Biden would allow another Democrat to run.Over a half (51 percent) of U.S. adults said that Biden \"definitely\" or \"probably\" should step aside as the Democratic nominee.Wednesday's poll results also found that adults hold nearly equal favorable views of Biden and Harris (38 percent to 39 percent.) Harris also polled more favorably than Ohio Senator JD Vance, who Trump selected as his running mate.Only 22 percent of participants said that they view Vance favorably. Forty-three percent said that they view Trump favorably, beating Biden by a margin of 5 percentage points.","summary":"A recent Economist/YouGov poll found that a record number of Americans believe Trump will be reelected in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-breaks-record-new-poll-1926725","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2430922/trump-breaks-his-record-new-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:52:51","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":252025776,"title":"The stress of navigating an unrelenting news cycle","text":"The stress of navigating an unrelenting news cycle It has been an intense four days since the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, and the relentless stream of headlines has been a cause of stress for many Americans.

White House Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday that Biden, 81, was experiencing “mild symptoms” and will fly to his home in Delaware, where he will “self-isolate and continue to carry out all of his duties fully”. Jean-Pierre said Biden planned to spend a long weekend at his Delaware beach house. It was unclear how long the sickness would keep him for the campaign trail. Minutes after the announcement, the president’s motorcade was on the move to the Las Vegas airport, and as he boarded Air Force One, Biden told reporters: “Good, I feel good”. Dr Kevin O’Connor, the president’s physician, said in a note that Biden “presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea [runny nose] and non-productive cough, with general malaise”. After the positive COVID-19 test, Biden was prescribed the antiviral drug Paxlovid and has taken his first dose, O’Connor said. News of Biden’s illness had first been shared by the CEO of Unidos US, a Latin civil rights group, in Las Vegas. Biden had been slated to speak at the group’s convention on Wednesday afternoon as part of an effort to rally Hispanic voters ahead of the November election. Janet Murguia, the CEO of Unidos, told guests that the president had sent his regrets and could not appear because he tested positive for the virus. “He said to tell my folks that we’re not going to get rid of him that quickly, we’re going to have a chance to hear from him in the future directly,” she said. There were groans in the conference room at the news. ‘Serious concerns’ The president’s diagnosis comes amid intense scrutiny of his health and stamina after a disastrous debate with former President Donald Trump that sparked a flurry of concern among Democrats that Biden is not up to the rigours of winning another presidential term. Shortly before the news, Congressman Adam Schiff, an influential member of the Democratic Party, urged Biden to drop out of the race, saying he has “serious concerns” about the president’s ability to beat Trump. “While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement. “And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.” A poll released by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research on Wednesday showed that nearly two-thirds of Democrats believed Biden should drop out of the race and allow the party to choose a new candidate. Only about three in 10 Democrats also said they were extremely or very confident that Biden has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40 percent that said the same in a February poll. Still, The Associated Press news agency and other US media outlets have reported that Democrats are looking to hold a virtual vote to formally make Biden the nominee in the first week of August. That’s ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which is being held in Chicago from August 19 to 22 and is typically where the party’s presidential nominee would be confirmed. Biden meanwhile has been defiant in the face of the calls to quit the race, telling one interviewer that only the “Lord Almighty” could persuade him to go. The US leader last tested positive for COVID-19 twice in the summer of 2022, when he had a primary case and a rebound case of the virus. Biden has been vaccinated and is current on his recommended annual booster dose for COVID-19. The vaccines have proven highly effective at limiting serious illness and death from the virus, which killed more than 1 million people in the US since the pandemic began in 2020. Paxlovid has been proven to curtail the chances of serious illness and death from COVID-19 when prescribed in the early days of an infection, but has also been associated with rebound infections, where the virus comes back a few days after clearing up. Health officials have reported recent upticks in emergency room visits and hospitalisations from COVID-19. There has also been a pronounced increase in positive test results in much of the country – particularly the southwestern US.","summary":"White House says the US president has &#039;mild symptoms&#039; and will self-isolate at his home in Delaware.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/17/biden-tests-positive-for-covid-cancels-las-vegas-campaign-event?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-17T223916Z_1755905292_RC2AX8AL7ZMY_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-1721259909.jpg?resize=1904%2C1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:47:18","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":252025176,"title":"Here's Why This UFC Star Went from Not Caring About Trump to Deeming Him the 'USA G.O.A.T'","text":"While Donald Trump has the support of UFC's director Dana White, a former UFC star once uttered harsh words against the Republican leader in 2015. When Conor McGregor was asked about Trump trash-talking wrestler Ronda Rousey, the fighter bluntly responded, \"I don't give a f**k.\" But five years down the line, McGregor had a complete change of heart. The 78-year-old, reflecting on Rousey's defeat to Holly Holm, voiced on X (formerly Twitter), \"Glad to see that @RondaRousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!\" In response, the 36-year-old former Featherweight and Lightweight Champion condemned Trump's remark. As per X17 Online, he opined, \"It's easy for someone that's not in there to comment, but it's different when you're in there, the emotions are high. Donald Trump can shut his big fat mouth, I don't give a f**k about Donald Trump.\" He added, \"Ronda will be back. Defeat is the secret ingredient to success, and true champions can conquer it, overcome it, and come back. So I wish her all the best.\" However, in 2020, McGregor seemed to have grown fond of Trump and deemed him the \"USA G.O.A.T., publicly declaring his support. The Irishman responded to a tweet by the ex-commander-in-chief in celebration of the third anniversary of his presidential inauguration. Trump had said, \"It was exactly three years ago today, January 20, 2017, that I was sworn into office. So appropriate that today is also Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\" Replying to the same, McGregor gushed, \"Phenomenal President. Quite possibly the USA [G.O.A.T emoji]. Most certainly one of them anyway, as he sits atop the shoulders of many amazing giants that came before him. No easy feet. Early stages of [the] term also. Incredible.\" Predictably, the Republican front-runner reciprocated the admiration and congratulated McGregor on his win. \"Congratulations on your big @UFC WIN!\" What brought about the change of heart remains yet to be known. But one thing is certain— the 2024 presidential hopeful has the full support and endorsement of McGregor for a second term in the White House. In the aftermath of his potential assassination attempt, the Irish wrestler was in awe of him standing firm in his re-election bid, proceeding with his schedule as planned. McGregor wrote on X, \"A 78-year-old multiple billionaire...he should be on a yacht on the med touring golf courses. But he is not. He is in Pennsylvania spitting out bullets! Running for the love of his country! Godspeed Donald! God bless the United States,\" as per Daily Mail. Meanwhile, UFC director White, who's been an outspoken Trump fan, posted a photo of the former president from the attack on Instagram and wrote, \"I am absolutely SICK to my stomach and in complete shock.

A Florida lawmaker in touch with the ex-president's inner circle revealed that the Republican front-runner is a \"changed man\" post the shooting incident. Trump, who's running for the presidential elections in November, was attacked by a 20-year-old gunman during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A self-described born-again Christian, Rep. Maria Salazar, spoke to someone \"very close\" to the 78-year-old who said the changes in Trump are so apparent that everyone around him can feel his sense of awakening. \"He believes that God has given him another opportunity. He believes that God spared his life and that he is a – I'm not sure if spiritual is the word or the adjective. I'm not sure if it's more contemplative. But I do know that he is a different man,\" Salazar told Daily Mail. Trump made his first appearance at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee after being injured amid a cheering crowd. While he was the same man who could boldly walk into a room and command the space, something about his changed demeanor at the convention took everyone by surprise. His \"eyes were closed\" during the benediction and he \"prayed the whole time.\" Salazar further revealed, \"That changes you as a person,\" referring to the attempt on his life. \"And when you change as a person internally because somehow the powers of heaven have touched you, then you start leading a different life … This is like BC and AD.\" She also insisted that God gave Trump a \"second opportunity\" to unite the divided Americans. Meanwhile, the politician's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. echoed the same sentiment and described how the gunshot impacted his father. Speaking at an Axios event, Don Jr. was asked \"How long will this new Trump last?\" The doting son responded, \"You know, I think it lasts. There are events that change you for a couple [of] minutes and there's events that change you permanently.\" However, he also noted that the politician will reign in his rhetoric, \"Now again, it's Trump, so you're still going to be reactionary.\" He also noted that his presidential hopeful father is a \"fighter\" who wouldn't surrender in front of his critics. \"He's going to be tough when he has to be. We've seen that, he's never gonna change. But I think there will be something. I think these are momentous occasions that change people permanently,\" as per USA Today. In the wake of the shooting incident on July 13, 2024, Trump's campaign has changed the MAGA tone toward \"unity,\" insisting the ex-president has \"changed.\" However, in his latest unhinged post after Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed his Classified Documents case, the businessman-turned-politician was back with the same rhetoric of being a victim of political persecution with his usual vocabulary like \"Witch Hunts\" and \"Zombie case.\" On Truth Social, he wrote, \"As we move forward in Uniting our Nation after the horrific events on Saturday, this dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts.

Peskov was commenting on statements made by Trump in an interview with Bloomberg published on Tuesday. During the interview, Trump stated that he “got along very well” with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his tenure and added, “We were never in danger of a war.” When asked whether he would lift or ease anti-Russian sanctions to help settle the Ukraine conflict, Trump did not give a direct answer but instead said he did “not love sanctions,” arguing that such measures are “forcing everyone away from” the US. The US did “nothing good for Russia under Trump,” Peskov said, commenting on Trump’s remarks. He specifically mentioned that “new restrictions” were imposed against Moscow at that time and stated that Russia considers all such sanctions to be “illegitimate” steps that only “destroy the basis of international economic relations.” “Still, there was dialogue. That could be counted as a positive element,” Peskov added. According to the Carnegie Endowment, the US imposed sanctions against Russia on at least 40 occasions during Trump’s four years in office. Washington also withdrew from a key Cold War-era arms control agreement – the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty – in 2019, leading to its collapse later that year. Despite existing tensions, the two nations maintained some dialogue. Trump personally met Putin in Helsinki during a summit in 2018, as well as on several other occasions throughout his presidency. Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, has not talked to Putin since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in 2022. The last phone call between the two presidents took place in late December 2021. Relations between the two nations have since plummeted to their lowest point since the Cold War, according to Moscow. Last week, Biden stated that he had “no good reason” to talk with his Russian counterpart, including about the Ukraine conflict. In June, Peskov stated that Russia was ready to hold talks with the US but only if such dialogue is “comprehensive” and includes not just Washington’s agenda but also takes Russia’s concerns into account.","summary":"Relations between Russia and the US have not been easy under Donald Trump, but at least there has been dialogue, the Dmitry Peskov has said \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/601239-kremlin-trump-us-relations-dialogue/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/66984fdb85f5400ac33a8465.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:44:51","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":252025080,"title":"Biden’s devil’s deal with the hard left is an attack on America and the Democratic Party — and a gift to Trump","text":"In his desperate bid to fend off the Democratic revolt, President Biden is now pandering hard to the hard left — selfishly putting his own desires ahead of his party’s interests and the nation’s needs. The first two shoes he’s dropped, a push for national rent control and a so-called “Supreme Court reform” package of term limits and an ethics code, are terrible ideas and flagrantly unconstitutional. “Today, I’m sending a clear message to corporate landlords: If you raise rents more than 5% on existing units, you should lose valuable tax breaks,” vowed Biden ahead of addressing the NAACP convention in Las Vegas. In his actual speech, the failing prez misread the TelePromTer, pledging to limit rent-hikes to “$55.” Of course, rent control is a disastrous policy that, as Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis immediately warned: “This kind of cap would lead to less affordable housing being built and substantially increase hosting costs.” His high-court “reforms,” meanwhile, are an outright attack on an equal branch of the federal government, aimed squarely at subordinating the justices’ independence from the political branches — an independence that has protected Americans’ rights for 235 years. Sounds like an attack on our democracy to us. Until now, Biden had avoided any major support for the left’s war on the court as an institution, but it’s become a cause celebre on the left, which he now sees as his best hope to not lose the party’s nomination for a second term. (His other big gambit: Pushing for a soon-as-possible virtual roll call with delegates to lock in the nomination ahead of he convention, supposedly to comply with an Ohio ballot-qualifying law that’s already been amended to avoid the issue, not that he’s winning Ohio this year anyway.) Of course, it may not be Joe, but Hunter and Jill, behind this strategy: They’re practically his only his top advisers at this point in his rapid decline. Yes, rapid. He could at least read a script smoothly until now, but the NAACP mistake is only his latest TelePrompTer fail: “Battle box” for “ballot box” came Sunday night. And when aides handed him a note during Saturday’s Zoom with House Democrats, he read it out loud: “Stay positive, you are sounding defensive.” At another point in that call, he angrily dissed the military record of Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), an Army Ranger who earned the Bronze Star for his combat actions in the Iraq invasion. Overall, reports on the call say he was “rambling” and “even worse” than during the debate. Plus, his live ABC and NBC interviews were both disasters. In short, his efforts to show he’s not losing it instead are showing he is — while the polls he either isn’t shown or won’t read show him headed to a landslide loss in November that will drag multiple Democratic candidates down with him. Responsible party leaders are plotting behind the scenes to dump Joe, and the Bidens know it: Hence the attempted devil’s bargain of red meat for the hard left. As we’ve noted, the left calculates that its power within the party will rise if Biden loses in November: That’s what happened the last time Trump won, and since Biden’s theoretically a “moderate,” his defeat will let lefties claim that’s why he lost. Yet the fact that the president is embracing hard-left ideas now elevates them within the party — indeed, makes them part of the party’s brand in voters’ minds. That is, his selfish gambit is further reducing the Democratic Party’s appeal to centrist voters in the runup to Election Day. This, while almost getting killed has inspired former President Donald Trump to turn the GOP convention into a unity fest reaching out to swing voters and broadening Republicans’ appeal. In short, the Bidens are crippling Democrats, boosting the GOP and warring on democracy: It’s the ultimate trifecta of selfishness.","summary":"In his desperate bid to fend off the Democratic revolt, President Biden is now pandering hard to the hard left — selfishly putting his own desires ahead of his party's interests and the nation's needs.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/opinion/bidens-devils-deal-with-the-hard-left-is-an-attack-on-america-and-the-democratic-party-and-a-gift-to-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/jb45554.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jOXXOXyo-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:44:41","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":252025282,"title":"How a second Trump term could look with JD Vance","text":"How a second Trump term could look with JD Vance If former President Donald Trump wins the election, he will have an isolationist ally in his vice presidential pick, Sen.

President Donald Trump awarded Bellavia, 48, the medal in 2019 for his 2004 service in Fallujah, Iraq, where he saved members of his platoon by clearing an enemy-filled house to allow them to get to safety But the hero says he won’t be talking much about his own service when he speaks just after 8:30 pm Eastern tonight. Instead, he’ll offer his vision of how foreign policy must change after the Biden administration’s catastrophes. Bellavia is taken aback by the lack of trust Americans have in the services, saying he often speaks to parents who do not trust the military to take care of their sons after President Biden’s disastrous exit from Afghanistan. “We’re caught in this 1978 post-Vietnam malaise of ‘I don’t trust you,’” Bellavia told The Post. “I’ve never been told that in my life. When I talk to a parent, it’s, ‘I don’t trust you. I don’t believe you.’ They’re like, ‘What happened to the 13 at the gate? What happened to the civilians you left behind?’” That refers to the 2021 suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport’s Abbey Gate as America hastily withdrew; 13 service members were killed. Bellavia, who founded the organization Vets for Freedom, says it’s imperative the military win back that trust. “We gotta fix our whole military from top to bottom, and we’ve gotta restore trust and get parents to trust us. Again, our approval is down 20%. It’s the lowest approval rating for the military in 20 years.” The Army vet blames the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, which handed the country to the Taliban at the cost of American lives, on the State Department’s overreach. “I think our military leaders got saddled with decisions that were made by the State Department,” said Bellavia before praising Gens. Mark Milley, Lloyd Austin and Central Command as “warriors.” Follow The Post’s live blog for the latest from the 2024 Republican National Convention “That wasn’t their call. And yet they wore it. They had to walk the plank. They had to take the credit. The amount of bad will, how it made us look feckless. I think it made us look indecisive,” he said. Bellavia will offer his vision for a new military: “It starts with a choice. It starts with a much more responsible DoD. It starts with putting money towards programs and people and not putting money into our social experiments that really don’t help us, don’t make us stronger.” He believes the United States must stick to its word with allies such as Israel and Ukraine and present a more stable policy than the Biden administration has. The veteran calls US policy in Ukraine “schizophrenic” and “unpredictable”: “If you wanted to reach out and touch Russia, defend Ukraine, you would’ve done that at the very beginning. You would’ve probably done that before, but you didn’t.” The path forward, he said, is to promote “peace through strength,” a foreign policy he thinks only the Republican Party offers: “Power means that you keep people in check, and your strength is what keeps people safe. Reagan taught us that lesson.” Under the Trump presidency, America was safer because it was more decisive, he said. “My problem is that we do not have a response to anything. We’re reactive. Say what you want to Donald Trump, the world knew exactly what we stood for. The world didn’t test us. And when we had a shot at Soleimani, we took it,” said Bellavia. Trump ordered the 2020 drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ deadly Quds Force. Of the former prez’s foreign policy, Bellavia concludes: “I just think it’s smarter. I think it’s sounder. I think it makes America safer.”","summary":"At the RNC's third night Wednesday, Medal of Honor recipient David Bellavia will explain how the US military can win back the trust of the American public and the world after the past four years' failures.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/17/us-news/medal-of-honor-hero-david-bellavia-to-push-return-to-trumps-foreign-policy-at-rnc-wednesday-smarter-sounder-safer/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85607954.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qqHjhXe0-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:42:09","author":"George Caldwell","authors":["George Caldwell"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":252025278,"title":"What a Trump-Vance ticket means for Democrats","text":"What a Trump-Vance ticket means for Democrats Former President Donald Trump revealed Sen.

Trump’s campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records to the public, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family. The first word on Trump’s condition came about half an hour after shots rang out and Trump dropped to the ground after reaching for his ear and then pumping his fist defiantly to the crowd with blood streaming down his face. The campaign issued a statement saying he was “fine” and “being checked out at a local medical facility.” “More details will follow,” his spokesperson said. It wasn’t until 8:42 p.m., however, that Trump told the public he had been struck by a bullet as opposed to shrapnel or debris. In a post on his social media network, Trump wrote that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part” of his right ear. “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” he wrote. Presidents and major-party candidates have long had to balance their right to doctor-patient confidentiality with the public’s expectations that they confirm they are healthy enough to serve, particularly when questions arise about their readiness. Trump, for example, has long pressed Biden to take a cognitive test with the Democratic president facing doubts after his stumbling debate performance. After a would-be assassin shot and gravely wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the Washington, D.C., hospital where he was treated gave regular, detailed public updates about his condition and treatment. There has no been no further word since Saturday from Trump’s campaign or other officials on his condition or treatment. Trump has appeared at the Republican National Convention the past three days with a bandage over his right ear. The former president does not normally travel with a protective press pool, something candidates typically agree to once they become their parties’ official nominee. Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, who served as Trump’s White House doctor and traveled to be with him after the shooting, said in a podcast interview Monday that Trump was missing part of his ear — “a little bit at the top” — but that the wound would heal. “He was lucky,” Jackson said on “The Benny Show,” a conservative podcast hosted by Benny Johnson. ”It was far enough away from his head that there was no concussive effects from the bullet. And it just took the top of his ear off, a little bit of the top of this ear off as it passed through.” He said that the area would need to be treated with care to avoid further bleeding — “It’s not like a clean laceration like you would have with a knife or a blade, it’s a bullet track going by,” he said — but that Trump is “not going to need anything to be done with it. It’s going to be fine.” The former president’s son Eric Trump said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday that his father had had “no stitches but certainly a nice flesh wound.” The lack of information continues a pattern for Trump, who has released minimal medical information throughout his political career. When he first ran in 2016, Trump declined to release full medical records, and instead released a note from his doctor that declared Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Dr. Harold Bornstein later revealed that the glowing, four-paragraph assessment was written in 5 minutes as a car sent by Trump to collect it waited outside. Jackson, after administering a physical to Trump in 2018, drew headlines for extolling the then-president’s “incredibly good genes” and suggesting that “if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.” When Trump was infected with the coronavirus in the midst of his 2020 re-election campaign, his doctors and aides tried to downplay the severity of his condition and withheld information about how sick he was and key details of his treatment. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows wrote in his book that Trump’s blood oxygen dropped to a “dangerously low level” and that there were concerns that Trump would not be able to walk on his own if he had waited longer to be transported to Walter Reed for treatment.

The former president and Republican nominee in 2024 made the revelation in an extensive interview with Bloomberg Businessweek a few days before the fateful debate with President Joe Biden. When Mar-a-lago’s long-serving managing director came by during the course of the interview, Trump said “with pride” that the club was upping its fee by $300,000 in October and opening four slots for new members. The increased fee could be an indication of the rising value of being near Trump as he looks poised to possibly return to the White House. Trump bought Florida’s Mar-a-Lago in 1985, converting it into a private club nine years later. It has been his primary residence since 2019 when he officially left New York and became a Florida resident. During his time as president, he hosted world leaders at the club such as the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. On July 11, Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the club. Biden’s debate performance shocked many as he appeared confused and frail. Trump has taken the lead in multiple polls following the debate – in FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, he leads Biden by 2 percentage points as of Wednesday. “The debate certainly had a big impact,” he told Bloomberg on July 9, just four days before the assassination attempt at a rally. Trump was struck by a bullet in his right ear before he was quickly covered by Secret Service agents. Two people, including the gunman, were killed in the shooting and two people were critically injured. “A lot of the states are just starting now to come out, and it shows a very big swing,” Trump told Bloomberg after the debate. The former president was asked if his opponent should step aside as the Democratic nominee. “That’s a decision he has to make,” he said. “But I do think our country is in great danger whether he stays in or drops out.”","summary":"The former president bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985, converting it to private club nine years later","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-initiation-fee-b2581590.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/17/21/GettyImages-2161438889.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QqDhMFFQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:37:04","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":252024948,"title":"Joe Biden, the President of the United States, contracts COVID-19","text":"President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID while campaigning and trying to fight back against widespread calls for him to drop out of the 2024 race due to his age. The 81-year-old president was forced to cancel a speech in Las Vegas after taking a test when he started getting a runny nose and coughing. He gingerly boarded Air Force One, using the shorter of the two sets of stairs, for a flight back to the East Coast to begin isolation. Biden, who was not wearing a mask, gave a thumbs up, and said: ‘I feel good’. The White House physician said Biden was feeling ‘general malaise’ and will now self-isolate in Delaware. The West Wing added that the president is vaccinated and boosted, and took a dose of Paxlovid on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier on Wednesday he had been speaking to supporters at a restaurant in Las Vegas while Democrats reignited calls for him to step down from the 2024 presidential race. In an interview this week he said he would only drop out if doctors told him to and he had a medical reason that made it necessary. ‘If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem,’ Biden said in an interview with BET news. The president’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, has said Biden is mentally and physically fit to serve as commander-in-chief. But many Democrats have questioned Biden’s fitness to serve since his debate performance against Donald Trump last month, in which he fumbled for words and at times stared blankly into the camera. Biden, meanwhile, has repeatedly changed his stance on what it would take for him to step aside. He told ABC News he would only drop out only if the ‘Lord Almighty’ told him to. At a press conference in Washington D.C., he said he would stay in the race unless aides came to him with proof that he could never win. In an interview with BET, Biden said for the first time that he had expected to ‘move on’ from the presidency and ‘pass it on to somebody else’ after one term. But he decided to run again because he believed his ‘wisdom’ and experience would help heal the country.’ ‘You may remember, I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I would be able to move on from this and pass it on to somebody else,’ Biden said. ‘But I didn’t anticipate things getting so, so, so divided. And quite frankly, I think the only thing age brings is a little bit of wisdom.’ He added that ‘there’s more to do, and I’m reluctant to walk away from that.’ Janet Murguía, the CEO of Latino civil rights organization UnidosUS, announced Biden’s positive test as she confirmed he would not be appearing at a scheduled event in Las Vegas. She said : ‘Thank you all so much for your patience and understanding. Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden. ‘And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. ‘The President has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for COVID. So of course we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended and he did not obviously want to put anybody at risk.’ In a statement White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: ‘Earlier today, following his first event in Las Vegas, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. ‘He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. ‘He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time.’ She said he would ‘continued to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation.’ The President’s doctor, in a statement, said Biden had presented with ‘upper respiratory symptoms’ including a ‘runny nose’ and ‘cough with general malaise’. The doctor said: ‘He felt okay for his first event of the day but, given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus. ‘Given this, the President will be self-isolating in accordance with CDC guidance for symptomatic individuals. ‘His symptoms remain mild.’ He added that Biden’s temperature was normal.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID while campaigning and trying to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden, the President of the United States, contracts COVID-19 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/joe-biden-the-president-of-the-united-states-contracts-covid-19/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1721259359_rewrite-this-title-President-Joe-Biden-tests-positive-for-COVID.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:36:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":252024596,"title":"Joe Biden's Appearance After COVID Diagnosis Goes Viral","text":"A photo of an unmasked President Joe Biden in front of reporters after news broke of his COVID-19 diagnosis went viral on social media on Wednesday evening.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Wednesday evening that earlier today, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 after a campaign event in Las Vegas.Minutes after Jean-Pierre's statement was released, CNN White House and politics reporter DJ Judd shared a photo of Biden on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote: \"An unmasked President Joe Biden flashes a thumbs up to reporters on the tarmac before boarding Air Force One moments after the White House announced he tested positive for Covid-19 here in Las Vegas, Nevada.\"When reporters asked how he was feeling, Biden said, \"I feel good,\" according to Judd.The post has already gotten 32,900 views in the past hour.Meanwhile, a video posted by Alex Salvi, a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, showed Biden boarding Air Force One.

In the days since the shooting, the Secret Service has come under scrutiny for its response to the assassination attempt and the agency's director, Kimberly Cheatle, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said she \"welcomes the opportunity to testify.\" The revelation of the timeline came as sources told ABC News that Crooks searched on his phone for images of President Joe Biden and former President Trump and searched for the dates of Trump’s rally in Butler and for dates of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The phone search history revealed no indication of Crooks’ political views and investigators were trying to determine his motive. The FBI director, his deputy director and the head of the Secret Service told lawmakers Crooks was identified as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before the shooting took place, according to the law enforcement officials and lawmakers briefed. According to the sources, the timeline presented in the briefing was as follows: 5:10 p.m. Crooks was first identified as a person of interest5:30 p.m. Crooks was spotted with a rangefinder5:52 p.m. Crooks was spotted on the roof by Secret Service6:02 p.m. Trump takes the stage6:12 p.m. Crooks fires first shots From the time Crooks fired his first shot to the gunman being killed was just 26 seconds, according to law enforcement officials. Eleven seconds after the first shot, Secret Service counter snipers acquired their target -- and 15 seconds after that, Crooks was shot dead. Briefers told lawmakers that Crooks purchased an ammunition box at a Walmart on July 5, two days after the rally was announced. On July 13, he went to the rally site in the morning, was there for an hour and then left. He came back sometime in the early 5 p.m. hour and tried to enter the security perimeter at around 5:30 p.m.. New analysis by ABC News' visual verification team reveals that one of two sniper teams posted atop buildings to the north and south behind the rally stage repositioned before the first gunshots were fired. At 6:09 p.m., two minutes before the first gunshots rang out, the sniper team on the roof of the building south of the stage, the furthest away from the shooter’s location, repositioned, turning in from the south to the north in the direction of the shooter’s location. The motive for the assassination attempt remains a mystery, according to the briefers, and they have not identified any ideological nexus to former President Donald Trump and/or President Joe Biden. Based on interviews with the shooter's parents, law enforcement told members they believe that neither has strong political leanings. The FBI told lawmakers they've conducted 200 interviews as part of the investigation, a source said. Timeline comes into focus Crooks was able to get a clear shot at the former president by climbing onto the air conditioning unit of one building and making his way to the top of an adjacent structure where he fired from, sources told ABC News. Minutes before pulling off the brazen assassination attempt, he was seen walking around near the magnetometers where rallygoers were being scanned for weapons before entering the outdoor venue, according to law enforcement sources. New bystander video obtained exclusively by Pittsburgh ABC affiliate WTAE appears to show Crooks pacing just beyond the boundaries of the Trump rally at 5:06 p.m. Saturday -- about 1 hour and 5 minutes before shots were first fired. Law enforcement sources said they believe this video shows Crooks. Crooks' presence in the area of the metal detectors in the minutes before the shooting caught the eye of someone in law enforcement who became suspicious and started to approach him, multiple sources told ABC News. At that point, the would-be assassin backed up and faded into the crowd, according to sources. It was not clear how long before the shooting this happened. Between the time he was spotted near the magnetometers and when Crooks allegedly fired at Trump, there were two sets of radio transmissions, one reporting that police were looking for a suspicious person and another more generic warning that officers were following up on something suspicious, sources said. As officers began searching for the suspicious person, Crooks made his way to the area of the American Glass Research (AGR) building outside the security perimeter established for the event, the sources said. At the time, the building was being used as a staging area for local police, who were inside the structure, the Secret Service director, Cheatle, told ABC News in an exclusive interview this week. More specifically, sources told ABC News that there were local police personnel and counter-sniper units in the AGR building where Crooks eventually took up a position to fire at Trump, sources said. Investigators believe that could have led to confusion as Secret Service snipers were trying to determine whether there was a threat to Trump and where it might be coming from, according to the sources. Secret Service counter snipers positioned on buildings close to the rally stage were aware the AGR building was being used as a staging area by law enforcement, sources said. Investigators believe that could have led to a split-second delay in the Secret Service sharpshooters' reactions because they had to first figure out whether the suspect was a threat, sources said. But once shots were fired at the former president, the Secret Service snipers could not wait any longer and took out the gunman, sources said. \"I don't have all the details yet, but it was a very short period of time,\" Cheatle said during the interview with ABC News. \"Seeking that person out, finding them, identifying them, and eventually neutralizing them took place in a very short period of time, and it makes it very difficult.\" Meanwhile, two sources familiar with the situation told ABC News Wednesday that before the rally, the Secret Service requested a local police cruiser to be positioned at the AGR building, but local police officials were not able to provide one. The detail was first reported by the Washington Post. Crooks was killed at the scene by a Secret Service sharpshooter positioned atop a building behind the stage Trump was speaking from at the Butler Fairgrounds, the Secret Service said. Though law enforcement sources said Crooks is believed to have purchased a 5-foot ladder at a Home Depot before the shooting, it does not appear to have been used to climb on the roof and was not found at the scene. Investigators believe Crooks made his way to the spot where he fired from by scaling an air conditioning unit of an adjacent building accessible from the ground and pulling himself up onto the roof, sources said. From there, he managed to gain access to the top of the neighboring building, where witnesses told ABC News they saw him shimmying up the slope of the roof to the area where he got off up to eight shots at Trump who was speaking at a podium about 400 feet away, according to law enforcement sources. As the FBI investigation continued Wednesday, questions swirled about how the gunman was able to ascend unimpeded to the roof, gain a direct line of sight and fire a barrage of shot at the former president. While Crooks was making his way to his shooting position, Secret Service agents were listening to radio traffic about a suspicious person police were looking for and heard local law enforcement talking about some sort of confrontation involving police, the sources said. Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe told ABC News that he was informed by other law enforcement officials that a Butler Township police officer searching for the suspicious person was vaulted onto the AGR building's roof and briefly confronted the gunman, who turned his weapon to the officer, causing him to retreat back down. Shots rang out moments later. Suspicious devices Investigators said Tuesday they found a remote transmitter in the suspect's pocket that may have been intended to set off two suspicious devices found in the suspect's car and one in his home, according to law enforcement sources. Devices at both locations were similarly constructed in ammunition containers using components including receivers that appear to have been paired with the remote control found in the suspect's pocket, sources said. The receivers in each device were connected to a series of components that investigators say met the \"eye test\" -- having parts present that could have made viable explosives, although the functionality of the devices is still being determined. The purpose of the devices is also unknown. Whether they were intended to cause a significant blast to hurt people or if they were designed to create smoke, fire and a low-grade blast for a diversion is unclear. Investigators also found a tactical vest in the suspect's car, though it is unclear why he did not wear it during the assault on the former president's rally. Some investigators are wondering whether he anticipated dying in the attack. The shooter also asked his employer if he could take a day off on Saturday but said he would return to work perhaps as soon as Sunday, the day after this attack, according to law enforcement sources. But thus far, investigators have turned up nothing to suggest that he had any accomplices or other support to carry out his deadly objective. 'Bullied' in the past An examination of his phone, which the FBI has now unlocked, has not turned up any significant information about the suspect's motives -- only what sources described as \"routine\" information for a 20-year-old male. Investigators have found, so far, that Crooks was a loner without friends. He was “odd,” according to preliminary findings in the probe, multiple sources briefed on the investigation told ABC News. FBI analysts are trying to assess whether Crooks was hard to get close to or was shut off because he was hiding something, sources said. Crooks had been “bullied” a little in the past, but the acts against him were “not over the top,” one source said. Investigators are actively looking to see if perhaps Crooks covered his tracks by using “burners” or other communication devices. The Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement that it provided \"all resources\" to the Secret Service -- including 30 to 40 troopers to assist with securing the inside perimeter of the campaign rally venue -- but \"was not responsible for securing the building or property\" outside the security perimeter where the would-be assassin opened fire. In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Cheatle, the Secret Service director, confirmed that local police were present inside the building at the same time the shooter was on the roof firing at Trump. Cheatle also said that local authorities were tasked with securing that building. \"In this particular instance, we did share support for that particular site and that the Secret Service was responsible for the inner perimeter,\" Cheatle said. \"And then we sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter.\"","summary":"Twenty minutes passed between the time USSS snipers first spotted Crooks on the roof and the time shots were fired at the former president, new information shows.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-assassination-attempt-investigation-continues-new-details/story?id=112020474","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f7077556-a611-46b3-914e-22850fbaab83/rally-site_1721207692334_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:33:09","author":"Aaron Katersky,Emmanuelle Saliba,Jack Date,Jessie Dimartino,Josh Margolin,Luke Barr,Pierre Thomas","authors":["Aaron Katersky","Emmanuelle Saliba","Jack Date","Jessie Dimartino","Josh Margolin","Luke Barr","Pierre Thomas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":252025618,"title":"Jeffrey Katzenberg Warns Biden Hollywood Donors Have Stopped Writing Checks After Debate Fallout","text":"Presidential campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg met with President Joe Biden ahead of his scheduled appearance in Las Vegas on Wednesday to warn him that donors have stopped contributing to the campaign since the disastrous debate with Donald Trump. Biden cancelled the appearance when he announced he has COVID. The Hollywood power broker told Biden that many major donors are doubtful in his ability to win the election in November. TheWrap reported two weeks ago that Hollywood donors were furious at Katzenberg for vouching for the president’s physical health, and said they were moving their donations to other Democratic campaigns. The Biden campaign responded to TheWrap: “This is a complete misread of a private meeting. We had a campaign meeting where we talked about everything from the convention to new ads. And by the way, we will raise the money we need to run a winning campaign.” Katzenberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Since a disastrous debate performance and subsequent unconvincing public appearances, Democratic support for the 81-year-old president from Hollywood donors is running thin. George Clooney, a lifetime Democrat and co-host of a recent fundraiser for the Biden campaign, was one of the first A-listers to rescind his support for the president’s re-election. In his op-ed in The New York Times, he called for the president to drop out for the sake of democracy. Other influential Hollywood figures, including Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, showrunner Damon Lindelof and Disney heir Abigail Disney, have all publicly called for Biden to step aside. Many others have said behind closed doors that they will stop donating to the Biden campaign and redirect their dollars to down-ballot races. Many of these lifelong Democratic supporters put the blame on Katzenberg, as one of Biden’s closet confidants and campaign co-chair. “What Jeffrey Katzenberg has done here is unbelievable,” one Hollywood power broker, donor and influential Democrat who declined to be identified, told TheWrap. “Jeffrey lied about the whole Biden thing. The whole Biden inner circle lied… It’s such an act of hypocrisy.” The Biden campaign was already behind in fundraising in the second quarter ahead of the debate with only $240 million against his running mate’s $285 million.

Mike Heller Walnut Creek American plutocracy has taken over Can Joe Biden get away with biting the hand that feeds him? I admire Biden for calling out the elites, and he may well succeed in taking on the intellectual elites. But what about the financial elites — Wall Street and Silicon Valley? There’s the rub. Without the support of the supposedly “progressive” billionaires of the top 1%, can anyone get elected president? In other words, has America finally become a full-fledged plutocracy, controlled by people of great wealth and income? I’m afraid so. Jim Wolpman Walnut Creek While Democrats dither, authoritarians rally These past weeks have been easy for Republicans. While hand-wringing Democrats and the media have focused on President Biden, Donald Trump met with Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister. Orban has systematically dismantled his country’s democracy, taken control of the media, legislature and judiciary, yet Trump and some Republicans have endorsed and praised him and his methods. Project 2025, a plan developed by a long list of former Trump administration officials and the Heritage Foundation, promotes similar methods: dismantling the Department of Education, replacing civil servant employees with loyalists, and granting near absolute power to Trump. If there is any hand-wringing going on, it should be due to the frightening scenario of another Trump presidency.

According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before Trump selected the freshman senator as his vice presidential choice, 6 in 10 Americans don't know enough about him to form an opinion. About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him, and 22% view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don't know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative view. His wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, will speak Wednesday night, too, according to a person familiar with the program. Beyond Vance's primetime speech, the Republican Party focused Wednesday on a theme of American global strength. Speakers were to include family members of service members killed during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and of someone taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, the person said. Republicans contend that the country has become a \"global laughingstock\" under Biden's watch and were expected to hit on their theme to \"Make America Strong Once Again.\" That's expected to include Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy that redefined relationships with some allies and adversaries. Democrats have sharply criticized Trump - and Vance - for their positions, including their questioning U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.

Pledge of Allegiance lightning rod Suburbanite Deb Kraulidis was front and center Monday leading the Pledge of Allegiance at the RNC opening session. The former Will County Board member and vice president of conservative group Moms for America faced criticism after attending former President Donald Trump's Jan. 6 rally. Kraulidis said on a Facebook video that “the rally was amazing,” but told the Joliet Herald News in 2021 she posted that before knowing about the riot and condemned the violence that followed. The Illinois Democratic Party Tuesday objected to Kraulidis' appearance and said the RNC “prefers to spotlight extremists and peddle election lies rather than address the real issues American families face.” “Moms know exactly what’s at stake in this election, and we’re determined to fight for our families and our values,” Kraulidis said in a statement on Moms for America's website promoting her convention appearance. And, “the Illinois Republican Party thinks the Illinois Democratic Party should spend less time trolling the RNC and more time trying to work on the failed policies of the Democratic majority and keeping former elected officials out of jail,” RNC delegate Aaron Del Mar of Palatine said. South Side pastor’s secret identity Notable Chicagoan, the Rev. Corey Brooks, gave the closing prayer at the RNC Tuesday. The senior pastor at New Beginnings Church of Chicago drew fame in the 2010s by camping out for months on a rooftop to draw attention to crime and violence in the Woodlawn neighborhood and to raise money for a community center. “I would be remiss if I did not give the great state of Illinois and Chicago and the South Side a shoutout. This is a week of celebration and life. A week of democracy and liberty,” Brooks told the cheering crowd. Hopefully, Illinois tollway officials aren't feeling neglected. Brooks spent four years as a tollway board director after being appointed by GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2015. Make America ‘Grate’ Again?

On the heels of President Joe Biden’s call for “unity” that was viewed as laughable by RNC-goers Monday in light of years of vitriolic rhetoric toward MAGA Republicans and Trump — who was nearly assassinated on Saturday —Breitbart News briefly spoke with one of Trump’s attorneys, Alina Habba. WATCH — CNN’s King: “Donald Trump Is in Command” the Numbers Are Getting Worse for Biden: “I think if you take a look at how they’ve attacked [Trump] every sort of way, the fact that I am now well-known because I’ve had to be on courtroom steps for the last three years fighting for him, the only divisive party I’ve seen is the Democrat party and Joe Biden’s administration,” Habba stated. “It’s a shame, it’s a sham, and I think it’s important the American people are waking up,” she added. Rep. Cory Mills (R-FL), a staunch Trump supporter, spoke with Breitbart News about the “hypocrisy” on the left, pointing to charged rhetoric from the likes of President Joe Biden and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) over the years. “This is the exact same party who claimed to be the party of peace, the party of law and order, even though they are out there saying, ‘Defund the police,’ painting it on the streets, even though they were out here saying things, like Maxine Waters, ‘You need to be able to get in the face of all of your elected officials,’” Mills noted. “Or Joe Biden’s comment, which is so inflammatory and dangerous, where he says, it’s time to put Trump in the ‘bullseye.’ And now we’ve seen what’s happened.” WATCH — Maxine Waters: If Trump Wins in November There Will Be Violence, “More Killings”: “When President Trump made the comment we should go home peacefully, that was enough to create a J6 unselect Committee, which was illegitimized, and they went after the president for saying that he incited violence,” he added. “They’re the exact same people who are now saying that they defend law enforcement, the exact same people who said we believe in unity.” According to the Florida congressman, the political maneuvering on the left, driven by the party’s progressive win, illustrates division. “The hypocrisy and the political shifting within the Democrat party shows that they’re in a division right now where their progressive left wing of it, where everyone’s starting to pander to, is taking over the identity of their party,” the Congressman went on to add. “Here’s the best part: The Democrats will forecast and tell you their playbook; whatever they’re accusing us of is the very thing that they actually are doing.” WATCH — Biden: Shouldn’t Have Said to Put Trump in Bullseye, I “Meant Focus on” His Rhetoric, Policies: Outside Panther Arena, a few blocks south of the Fiserv Forum, Rep. Carlos Giménez (R-FL) emphasized that the GOP is unified while simultaneously pointing out that many Democrats are trying to move Biden out of the top of the ticket. “We’re united. Look, they’ve always said that we’re not united because we just within the party, we may have some differences of opinion, but we’re pretty much united in the direction we want the country to go in, and we have been for a very long time. The Democrats just fall in line. They do what they’re told to do, and that’s not really good for the country,” he said. “They’re all frazzled now because they say that we were a threat to democracy, and yet, hey, they’re trying to find a way to somehow get rid of their democratically nominated presidential candidate. So isn’t that something? Who’s really the threat to democracy here?” he added. Breitbart News also interviewed West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in the Mountain State. Morrisey said Trump’s policy vision unites people because it bests Biden’s inflation-driving policies, and “regardless of where you are from, people know that President Trump has an optimistic view of America.” The attorney general sees Trump’s America First policies and themes — “making America wealthy again, making America safe again, promoting energy independence, ending lawfare, enforcing the rule of law,” as “resonating with everyday Americans in a way that the Democrats can’t.” WATCH — WV AG Patrick Morrisey on the WV Governor’s Race, Battling the Administrative State: Matthew Perdie & Jack Knudsen “So many of the Democrat policies under Biden are so radical,” Morrisey said, adding that “they are doing absolutely nothing about” the fentanyl epidemic. He also pointed to Biden’s electric vehicle policy. “They’re trying to advance a mandatory electric vehicle policy, which would be economically disastrous for our country,” Morrisey said. “Their policies are doing nothing but driving inflation through the roof. President Trump and the Republican Party have a good answer for that, and that’s why you’re seeing people unify, because better policies, better people in place, and that’s why we’re going to win.” Morrisey also complimented Trump on running an “incredible” campaign and said his pick of Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) as his running mate “is going to help ensure that we win in November.” Virginia Republicans senate candidate Hung Cao told Breitbart News that the left is “motivated by hate” while Republicans “are motivated by love.” “The left is motivated by hate directed at one man. They will stop at nothing, all the way up to and including violating the will of their own voters, the millions who voted for Joe Biden in Democratic primaries earlier this year,” Cao wrote in a statement. “But we are motivated by love: love of God, love of family, and love of country — the greatest nation on Earth. We are united as Americans, and we will win.” Journalist Jack Posobiec spoke with Breitbart News outside the Panther Arena and underscored that “Donald Trump has always stood for unity.” “Donald Trump has always said, ‘Make America Great Again,’” he stated. “It was always the left; it was always the left-wing media that was adding words to that statement. They were the ones who said, ‘Make America Great Again only for a certain group of people.’ Donald Trump has always said make it great again for all Americans.” “He defines people as Americans and not Americans. So just your basic understanding of what is an American; that’s it. He never stood for division,” Posobiec, the host of Human Events Daily on Real America’s Voice added. “He never went in for this stuff, and there were times where people tried to push him to do so, famously at Charlottesville, and they completely twisted his words, lied about what he said to put him into their box. So he’s stood for unity for 10 years, and I think finally, finally, people are waking up to it.” One man who can be seen at every Trump Rally sporting a brick pattern suit, Blake Marnell, who goes by the nickname “Brick Suit,” told Breitbart News that Democrats “sowed the division” in America. Marnell said, “It certainly seems to be the dynamic” that Republicans are united and the left is fractured and called out Democrats for being dividers of America at large. “And it’s not only is the left divided within itself, but let’s not forget that they’re the ones who put the wedge in the log and swung the hammer,” he said. “Joe Biden going up in a podium and calling everybody who supports President Trump MAGA extremists, and blaming us all for that… they sowed the division, and now they’re going to reap it.” The unity on the right and the apparent in-roads Trump and Republicans continue to make, evidenced by a slew of polling, are also backdropped by deep tensions within the Democrat Party over Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas. Widespread protest efforts from progressives, young voters, Muslims, and Arab-Americans are further threatening his election bid, as documented in the grassroots “Uncommitted movement,” which saw hundreds of thousands of Democrat primary voters reject him this cycle.","summary":"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Prominent Republicans at the Republican National Convention (RNC) emphasized to Breitbart News on Wednesday that the GOP is, in fact, the party of unity while the Democratic Party is the party of division.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive – Prominent Republicans at RNC Say GOP Party of Unity: ‘Only Divisive Party I See Is the Democrat Party’ appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/07/17/exclusive-prominent-republicans-rnc-say-gop-party-unity-only-divisive-party-see-democrat-party/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/GettyImages-2155367581-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:22:46","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":252025076,"title":"Trump campaign trolls Biden over VP debate","text":"There can be no vice-presidential debate until the Democrats can decide on their ticket, the Republican campaign said on Wednesday, in a thinly veiled reference to calls for US President Joe Biden to step down. The Republicans formally nominated former President Donald Trump on Monday, while he announced Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate. Vice President Kamala Harris reached out to Vance with an offer of a debate, to be hosted by CBS News. “We don’t know who the Democrat nominee for Vice President is going to be, so we can’t lock in a date before their convention,” Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement on Wednesday evening. “To do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitener, or whoever Kamala Harris picks as her running mate.” The governors of California, Illinois and Michigan, respectively, have been floated as possible replacements for Harris should Biden withdraw from the ticket. Many Democrats have been clamoring for the 81-year-old to do so, since his disastrous showing in the June 27 debate against Trump. California Congressman Adam Schiff, formerly a key player in the House Intelligence Committee, was the latest to urge Biden to “pass the torch.” While Biden has refused to drop out of the race – or resign from the presidency – in a recorded interview aired on Wednesday he revealed the circumstances under which he might do so. “If I had some medical condition that emerged,” this might make him reconsider, Biden told BET. He insisted he was still fit for the job, however. Speculations about ousting Biden from the ticket were temporarily relegated from the headlines by the attempted assassination of Trump on Saturday. The Republican candidate narrowly escaped death at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The US Secret Service has yet to give a satisfactory explanation how a shooter was able to get into position to open fire on the stage, killing one rally-goer and seriously injuring two more. However, efforts by some Democrats to oust the president have apparently continued, with the New York Times claiming on Wednesday that a group of Democrat megadonors were “dangling money to members of Congress” willing to publicly call on Biden to step aside. Harris has proposed three dates for the VP debates: July 23, August 12 and August 13. The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention in Chicago on August 19, but want to nominate Biden via a “virtual roll call” before then.","summary":"The Republican presidential campaign has declined the offer to debate Kamala Harris until the Democrats pick Joe Biden’s replacement \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601240-republicans-kamala-vance-debate/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/6698517885f5400ac33a8472.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:22:11","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":252024912,"title":"Biden Tests Positive For Covid As Age Worries Mount","text":"US President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid on Wednesday, shortly after conceding that he would consider dropping his troubled reelection bid if he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. The 81-year-old Democrat gave media the thumbs up from his limousine and said \"I feel good\" as he cut short a campaign trip to Las Vegas following the diagnosis. The White House said he was suffering from a runny nose, cough and \"general malaise,\" was taking Covid medication, and was flying straight to isolation at his beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. The diagnosis came hours after the release of comments by Biden in an interview conducted on Tuesday, in which he said he could step aside as a presidential candidate \"if I had some medical condition that emerged.\" It was also the latest development over a dramatic few days in the already frenetic and polarized White House race that saw his rival Donald Trump survive an assassination at a campaign rally of his own. Biden has been fighting for political survival since a disastrous debate against Trump nearly three weeks ago, in which his tired and confused appearance sparked concerns about his age. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden had tested positive shortly after the first in a series of events in Las Vegas targeting crucial Latino voters. \"He is vaccinated and boosted and he is experiencing mild symptoms. He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,\" Jean-Pierre said. Biden's doctor said he was suffering from a runny nose and a \"non-productive cough\" along with \"general malaise,\" the White House said in an accompanying note. He has received the Covid drug Paxlovid and has already taken his first dose, the statement read. \"His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97 percent,\" it added. - 'I feel good' - Biden later leaned out of his limousine, dubbed the Beast, as he arrived at a Las Vegas airport to give the thumbs up. \"Good,\" he said to the press as he walked to Air Force One without a mask. \"I feel good.\" Janet Murguia, the president of the Unidos union for Latino workers, told the crowd about the diagnosis shortly before the White House announcement. \"I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon,\" she said. The furor over Biden's health is now set to go into overdrive, with a growing number of Democrats calling on him to step aside. Asked what could make him rethink his presidential bid, Biden told the Black media outlet BET in an interview taped Tuesday in Las Vegas: \"If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem.'\" He suffered a major blow hours earlier on Wednesday when a top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff of California, urged Biden to \"pass the torch.\" \"A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November,\" Schiff said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times. Around 20 House Democrats and one senator have now called on Biden to leave the White House race. Most polls show Biden trailing the election in a tight race with Trump. Biden insists that Democratic voters support him, but a poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research said Wednesday that nearly two-thirds want him to step aside.

Former Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson, the chair of former President Donald Trump’s re-election efforts in Massachusetts, told the Herald that he’s “never seen a group more unified” than the one he’s found at this year’s Republican National Convention. The attempt on the former president’s life, according to the MassGOP Delegate At-Large, essentially wraps up what lingering doubts remained among on-the-fence conservatives who might have previously considered another candidate. When you stack the shooting on top of that the way Trump was treated through his presidency — twice impeached and then subjected to a Special Counsel investigation into his 2016 campaign — as well as all of the legal problems he’s faced since leaving office, supporters of former candidates Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis are starting to see a pattern, the former Sheriff said. “People have said ‘enough is enough.’ This man’s been trying to give our economy back to us, make us safe, close the border, do all the things that matter to us, and now somebody is trying to take him out,” Hodgson said. “You get that sense in the arena. When he walked in the last few nights – it was just electrifying. Really unbelievable,” Hodgson said. While the party is more excited, the candidate seems more circumspect, Hodgson said. That’s a natural reaction to almost losing your life, the former police detective said. While Trump may have had the adrenaline and presence of mind required to stand up just after he was shot and tell the audience to “fight” for what they believed in, hours later Trump will have had time to consider how close he came to the end. “When he had time to pause and think…I don’t know anyone who could go through that and not feel changes emotionally. Where you reflect and say, ‘wow, I almost died.’ Thinking about family, the country, everything you’ve worked for,” he said. Trump is just as enthusiastic, Hodgson said, just as committed, but “you notice there’s something different – in some respects – when he’s there.” As a consequence, the former sheriff said Trump’s nomination speech will likely turn to the positive and speak more of reconciliation than conflict. “What you are going to see tomorrow night is a man who continues to be very focused and dedicated to moving our country forward and fulfilling the promises he made,” he said. “In addition, I think you’ll see him talk about unity and the importance of this nation coming together, maybe in a different way than people have seen him speak about those things in the past.”","summary":"Former Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson, the chair of former President Donald Trump’s reelection efforts in Massachusetts, told the Herald that he's “never seen a group more unified\" than the one he's found at this year’s Republican National Convention.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/17/republicans-unite-after-assassination-attempt-trump-looks-inward-mass-campaign-chief-says/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24199047970273.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:21:11","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.006},{"id":252025394,"title":"JD Vance has diverse record on tax, spending","text":"WASHINGTON >> Former President Donald Trump’s pick for vice president, Ohio GOP Sen. JD Vance, has made two main issues his focus during his brief Senate tenure: opposing aid to Ukraine and pushing for railway safety following last year’s freight train derailment in his home state involving toxic chemicals. Vance, first elected in 2022, has also struck interesting positions in the spending and tax spheres, including pushing a bipartisan effort to compensate former hostages in Iran. Despite opposing the final fiscal 2024 spending package, he successfully got a provision included that would ban mask mandates for the Transportation Department. He’s also pushed for partisan culture war-related bills that could signal priorities in a second Trump administration. This includes an effort to tax elite university endowments and block funding to colleges that allow protest encampments, among others. A skeptic of government spending overall, Vance does not participate in the Senate’s earmark request process and has voted against every major spending bill that has been put forward during his tenure in the Senate, including last summer’s debt limit deal; both final fiscal 2024 appropriations packages and the $95.3 billion war supplemental, though he backed standalone Israel aid legislation. Mask mandate Vance’s provision blocked the Transportation Department from enforcing mask mandates on planes, trains, buses or other federally-funded modes of transport through the end of the fiscal year. The department did not have any active mask mandates in place, but would be unable to implement any new ones through September. “Mask mandates were an outrageous overstep by the public health establishment,” Vance said. “We cannot allow this mistake to be repeated.” Vance had originally offered the provision as an amendment to the bill as the Senate considered it on the floor last fall, and it was adopted 59-38 with 10 Democratic senators and Arizona independent Kyrsten Sinema in favor. Democratic senators in tight reelection races including Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, Nevada’s Jacky Rosen and Montana’s Jon Tester, voted for Vance’s amendment. During Senate debate on its version of the Transportation measure, Senate Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Brian Schatz called Vance’s amendment “counterproductive.” Schatz, D-Hawaii, said that if there were to be a future COVID-19 variant that spread faster and was more deadly, he believes the administration should be able to enact a mask mandate on public transit. “I do think public health officials should be able to consult with agencies to try to figure out what measures ought to work,” he said. Diversity initiatives, campus protests Vance has proposed a series of bills relating to taxpayer funding that center on culture war issues, including trying to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Vance introduced a bill last month that would eliminate all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs. It would also prevent federal grant recipients from “employing DEI practices.” Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, introduced his chamber’s version. Vance has also introduced a pair of bills focusing on colleges and universities, one that would block funding for institutions that do not remove encampments from their campuses and another that would prevent colleges from hiring undocumented immigrants. That’s not the only bill Vance has put forward targeting undocumented immigrants. He and Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla., introduced bills that would block Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiaries from receiving federally-funded health care benefits and prevent waivers for undocumented immigrants to get insurance coverage under the 2010 health care law. And Vance proposed a bill that would block so-called sanctuary cities from receiving federal housing grants. Along with the conservative priorities, Vance has pushed for funding for key programs for his home state. He supports a bill that Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., has pushed that would appropriate $7 billion for a Federal Communications Commission program that helps lower-income and rural households afford high-speed internet. That program ran out of funding last month. In another bipartisan effort, Vance has partnered with Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., to provide additional compensation to former Iranian hostages. Their bill would supplement a previous $3 billion deposited into the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism fund in late 2022 that applies to a broader group of terror victims with whatever amounts are necessary to ensure that the Iran hostages and their families specifically receive their full claims. Tax bills Targeting colleges and universities seen by critics as being not sufficiently tough on antisemitism after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel has also been a focus of Vance’s forays into tax legislation. Vance has introduced three tax bills during his short time in Congress, two of which seek to bring colleges and universities to heel, and signed on as a co-sponsor to at least eight others. Taken together, the bills blend traditional business-friendly tax policies with Vance’s brand of “America First” populist protectionism. Of the three tax bills Vance has introduced, two would impose a higher tax on some college and university endowments. Vance has pushed to increase taxes on the university endowments, saying the institutions pay a lower rate than working families. University endowments face a 1.4% tax on gains to their endowments, if they hold more than $500,000 per student. Vance’s bill, which has no co-sponsors, would increase the rate to 35% on private secular schools with at least $10 billion in endowments. It would affect Yale University, where Vance went to law school. The second bill would impose a 50% tax on endowment assets and revoke federal student aid for schools that do not dismantle encampments that impede academics or other institutional functions within seven days. Vance has also prioritized tax legislation that would protect the domestic auto industry, a major employer in his home state. Ohio has the second-largest workforce devoted to motor vehicle and parts manufacturing in the country, according to Jobs Ohio. Ford Motor Co., General Motors, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Stellantis, the Netherlands-based owner of Chrysler, all have manufacturing operations based in the state. A bill Vance introduced in September last year would repeal electric vehicle tax credits Democrats established with the 2022 climate budget law, a common goal among Republicans. But unlike other measures rolling back subsidies for EVs, Vance’s would replace it with a tax credit for cars manufactured in the U.S. Vance also co-sponsored a bill introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whose name was also floated as a possible Trump vice presidential pick, that would disqualify auto manufacturers that move jobs offshore from qualifying for federal subsidies, including EV tax credits. Vance backed at least three other Rubio bills protecting the domestic auto industry through trade policy, including one measure that would impose a $20,000 tariff on cars produced in China. The Ohio Republican also co-sponsored a measure introduced by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would eliminate the ability for shareholders to delay tax on stock they receive through mergers and acquisitions, if the company’s gross receipts exceed $500 million. Vance has also supported more traditional business-friendly measures, including a bill introduced by Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., that would restore full, upfront deductions of investments in research and development. Semiconductor manufacturer Intel Corp. is building facilities in Ohio worth $28 billion, in part with subsidies from the “chips and science” law enacted before Vance was elected. Hassan’s bill was incorporated into a $79 billion tax package negotiated by Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo. Vance, who grew up poor in a family receiving government assistance, has spoken positively about elements of the Wyden-Smith bill, which includes an expansion of child tax credits for low-income households. The bill faces opposition from Senate Republican leaders who believe it would reduce incentives to work. Vance also co-sponsored a bill introduced by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., that would make permanent a 20% deduction for small businesses and partnerships established by the 2017 tax law and due to expire at the end of next year.

President Joe Biden has said he would send troops to defend the island. In Taiwan, Premier Cho Jung-tai responded that Taiwan is “willing to take on more responsibility” and would defend itself. In a statement, Taiwan’s de-facto embassy in Washington said it is in the interest of the U.S. and the international community to preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait because it is an indispensable part of global prosperity. “As the threat of military coercion increases, Taiwan is doing its part by actively strengthening deterrence capabilities with the support of the United States under the Taiwan Relations Act,“ the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office said. As the rivalry between Washington and Beijing heats up, Taiwan — an island that broke away from mainland China in 1949 following a civil war — has become one of the thorniest issues in U.S.-China relations. Beijing claims sovereignty over the island and vows to take it by force if necessary to achieve unification. Washington insists any differences be resolved peacefully and U.S. law obligates it to supply Taiwan with hardware and technology for self-defense. In the past several years, ties between Washington and Taipei have grown stronger, as Beijing ratchets up military and diplomatic pressure on the island. Last month, the Biden administration approved a $360 million weapons sale to Taiwan, sending the island hundreds of armed drones, missile equipment and related support material. Taiwan pays for the military equipment. Citing the arms sale and other unspecified U.S. moves to undermine Beijing’s interests and trust between the two countries, China’s foreign ministry announced Wednesday it was canceling talks with the U.S. on arms control and nonproliferation. “The responsibility full lies with the U.S.,” said Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry. In the interview, Trump said he didn’t feel “so secure” over the Taiwan Strait, where Beijing has “been very aggressive and got ships all over the place.” He suggested that China could easily take over the island but has not done so because of Taiwan’s prized semiconductor industry, which make the computer chips that power everything from smartphones to cars and satellites. “That’s the apple of President Xi’s eye,” Trump said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He suggested that Taiwan has a stranglehold on the computer chip industry over the U.S. and because of that, it has the means to pay. “I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy,” Trump said. Rep. Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Taiwan “a perfect example of what we want all our allies to do,” as demanded by Trump. “They have consistently been one of the biggest buyers of U.S. weapons for its defense,” said McCaul, a Republican, who travelled to Taiwan last month to affirm the U.S. support for the island. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, accused the former president of betraying Taiwan. “Former President Trump’s threat to abandon our nation’s longstanding, bipartisan commitments to Taiwan would mean betraying one of the world’s most vibrant democracies to the Chinese Communist Party,” said Krishnamoorthi, ranking member of the House Select Committee on China. “Failing to provide for Taiwan’s defense would not only be potentially illegal under the Taiwan Relations Act, it would be a betrayal of American values and our democratic institutions,” he added. Trump “did not say the U.S. won’t defend Taiwan,” said Miles Yu, who previously served in the Trump administration and is director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank. The former president said Taiwan should share more of the costs for such a collective defense, which is “far less of a problem” for Taiwan than for other U.S. allies in the region, he said. “The defense of Taiwan is enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act,” Yu said. “The joint defense of Taiwan is a national consensus. To change that will be extremely difficult.” But, compared to Biden, Trump would place “utmost importance” on building credible deterrence over Taiwan, Yu said, adding Trump has said he would “bomb” Beijing if it should invade Taiwan.

So let me count its charming ways: The rah-rah-sis-boom-bah is big time. Can’t schlep big packages, umbrellas, suitcases, shopping bags into the main arena. There’s security. Permanently placed bicycles impede walking, plus there’s cop cars, street barricades, trucks blocking turns, wristbands, protests, fights, color-coded everything, badges, photo IDs, metal detectors, chains, dudes with rifles, blockades and pat-downs. Even lampposts wear flowers. For spinsters who blew the joys of sexhood, it’s great. Why? You get tapped down and felt up more than when you were in high school. Trust me, for that alone it’s worth becoming a delegate. Cop car processions are constant. It’s like you never left Madison Avenue. And everybody has a private airplane. No plane? You don’t have a plane? No friend who has a plane? Then you can’t run for anything above alderman. Even Democrats have standards. Buckeyes wild And you can’t get anywhere. 2016 the hoo-hah was in Cleveland. Its main zone got locked inside a steel perimeter. Buses, trains rerouted. An airborne flag read “Hillary for prison.” There was even Indiana State Police. On my flight were ABC’s David Muir and CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Our short schlep from the airport took forever. Anderson jumped out, told the driver to bring his luggage, ran for the studio and was on camera longer than the cab ride. I accosted Jeff Zucker, then CNN’s boss, and complained: “You didn’t return my call last week.” His answer: “Oh, a NY Post columnist can be terrifying.” Then: “We started planning this six months ago. Got lots of people here. Way more than 100.” And Carl Bernstein’s respectful hello to me? “You still around doing this crap?” Wall-to-wall strangers. Foreign license plates. Full B&Bs. Arianna Huffington writing Trump’s name on foggy windshields. And in the book “S — t Politicians Say: The Funniest, Dumbest, Most Outrageous Things Politicians Ever Uttered by Our ‘Leaders,’ ” Newt Gingrich said: “A politician tainted by accepting money from foreign sources is essentially a socialist argument.” Rep. Peter King: “Listen, with Donald you have to expect some bumps.” Time to lodge a complaint In the ’96 Republican thing in San Diego Clinton’s bro Roger was front and center. His band called Politics also worked another convention in town called Politics. The group was mostly composed of tequila. Their motto: “Life, liberty and the pursuit of margaritas.” But hotel accommodations were nifty. One day they woke me exactly 6 a.m. Next day 6:15. One problem — I never requested a wake-up call. Air conditioning? Forget it. No mirror in the john. Only face towels. No opener in the bar. No understanding whythehell I was there. Nothing ever blinked to announce phone messages. How dudes like Grover Cleveland ever survived, God only knows. So this time around I’m not at the RNC. I’m going to stay right here at home in New York with the traffic, crime, congestion, thieves, robbers, shut shops, delivery guys, mopeds, bicycles, closed hospitals, roaches, ants, mice, robbers, heat wave — and Democrats. It’s safer. Only in New York, kids, only in New York.","summary":"Never ever had the actual personal joys of attending a political convention?

Karine Jean-Pierre, his press secretary, said the US president is vaccinated and boosted. He has tested positive for Covid twice before. Mr Biden, 81, was seen earlier on Wednesday visiting supporters in Las Vegas and speaking at an event. He has cancelled a campaign speech later in the night. The illness comes as he faces increasing pressure to step aside because of his age following a poor debate performance at the end of June. Ms Jean-Pierre said the president planned to isolate at his home in Delaware while he carries out “all of his duties fully during that time”. The president’s doctor, Kevin O’Connor, said Mr Biden presented with upper respiratory symptoms, including a runny nose and a cough and was given his first dose of Paxlovid. He felt fine during his first event of the day, but later tested positive Dr O’Connor said. Reporters on the Las Vegas trip said they were rushed to the city’s airport following the announcement. Mr Biden moved slowly and cautiously up the steps to the plane, video shows. He was not wearing a mask. As he boarded Air Force One he was heard to say: “Good, I feel good.” The president was forced to cancel a speech at UnidosUS, a Latino civil rights organisation. The organisation’s chief executive Janet Murguría confirmed the diagnosis to the audience. “Thank you all so much for your patience and understanding,” she told the crowd. “Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden. And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for Covid.” The illness comes as Mr Biden faces increased calls for him to withdraw from the race. Nearly two dozen Democratic politicians have called for him to step aside in recent weeks, including Adam Schiff, a congressman from California,, who said today he had serious doubts about whether the president could beat former President Donald Trump. He called on Mr Biden to “pass the torch”. Mr Schiff said that Mr Biden “has been one of the most consequential presidents in our nation’s history”, and he could “secure his legacy of leadership” by allowing another Democrat to step forward. In an interview with BET, which was due to be broadcast on Wednesday evening, Mr Biden said he did not feel he could pass the mantle with the country so “divided”. The president also said, for the first time, that he would consider dropping out of the race if any of his doctors said he had a “medical condition”.","summary":"Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid-19 and is suffering mild symptoms, the White House has said.

But cases of the virus are now surging, and health officials have reported spikes in emergency room visits and hospitalizations due to Covid.Donald Trump and his campaign see his running mate, JD Vance, as a way to expand Trump’s voter base, according to sources familiar with the matter, intending to lean into the senator’s previous criticisms of Trump to convince voters who dislike both 2024 candidates to back the former president.In the years before Vance ran for the US Senate, he repeatedly criticized Trump and his presidency in interviews where he made clear he never liked the former president and considered him “cultural heroin” and in private conversations where he suggested Trump was “America’s Hitler”.But the criticisms, which once angered Trump, are now being seen by the Trump campaign as a unique asset that could resonate with voters who could be in a similar position: people who have previously found Trump unsavory but might prefer him to Biden, the sources said.The Trump campaign has suggested that they want Vance to lean in to the fact that he was previously a so-called “Never Trumper”, with the hope that it could give independent and uncommitted voters a path towards supporting the former president in November.Trump sees former ‘Never Trumper’ JD Vance as a way to expand his base, insiders sayRead moreThe Biden/Harris campaign earlier released a statement chastising their rivals for backing away from a vice-presidential debate, linking it to Vance’s resurfaced comments endorsing an abortion ban.“Donald Trump is the one whose campaign said he would debate ‘anytime, anyplace; and who picked JD Vance specifically for his debating skills,” the campaign said in a statement. “Now suddenly right after a damning new leak showing his support for a nationwide abortion ban, Vance is backing off a debate against Vice President Harris, who has spent the last two years prosecuting the case on behalf of reproductive freedom.”The Trump campaign, meanwhile, has said they are hesitant to schedule the debate due to uncertainty over who will be the Democratic nominee for vice-president.Joe Biden is headed back to Delaware..⁦@POTUS⁩ is back on Air Force One and we’re headed to Delaware pic.twitter.com/SLGfL8pcN1— Nandita Bose (@nanditab1) July 17, 2024 Meanwhile at the Republican national convention, Paul Manafort, Trump’s 2016 campaign chair, has been spotted on the floor.Manafort was pardoned after being found guilty of several financial crimes in 2018, following an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and his team.Manafort, 69, was convicted on Tuesday of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to report a foreign bank account.Trump had signalled that he wanted to bring Manafort back in the fold for his latest campaign, but it is unclear whether he has been officially enlisted and, if so, in what capacity.The White House confirmed Joe Biden has been tested positive for Covid.According to the press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the president is “vaccinated and boosted” and has mild symptoms.“The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,” she said in a statement to the press.The president’s doctor said that Biden “presented this afternoon with upper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general malaise.He “felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for Covid-19 was conducted, and the results were positive”,” in a statement shared with media. “His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97%. The President has received his first dose of Paxlovid. He will be self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth.”“He needs to take the precautions that have been recommended,” Murguía said. “He obviously didn’t want to put anybody at risk. He said to tell my folks that we’re not going to get rid of him that quickly – we’re going to hear from him in the future directly.”Biden was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the conference, before 1,500 Latino leaders, advocates and allies.Joe Biden has cancelled a speaking engagement at the UnidosUS annual conference because he has tested positive for Covid, according to the organization’s president and CEO Janet Murguía.“We appreciate very much his wanting to have been here,” she announced from the podium where he was expected to speak shortly.here's the moment news of Biden's positive covid test was announced at the UnidosUS conference in Las Vegas, where people were assembled waiting for his speech that was supposed to start 90 minutes ago pic.twitter.com/OPOl14QE6b— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 17, 2024 Peter Navarro, a former Donald Trump White House adviser who was just released from prison, has been spotted in Milwaukee:Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, not in prison.

Public calls for Biden to drop out appeared to subside in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on the former president and as this week’s Republican National Convention commenced, but the movement against Biden has regained steam as behind-the-scenes lobbying against him persisted. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), a prominent Democrat who was an impeachment manager against Trump and is running for the Senate seat of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, on Wednesday joined 18 of his House colleagues and Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) by calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new nominee. “A second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the president can defeat Donald Trump in November,” Schiff, former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. “There is only one singular goal: defeating Donald Trump. The stakes are just too high.” Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem (D-NY) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), reportedly helped fuel a pressure campaign to delay the Democratic National Committee’s plans to nominate Biden before next month’s party convention. Neither office responded to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner. Either way, the clock is ticking for Democrats. The DNC announced to committee members on Wednesday that it would not hold a virtual roll call to nominate Biden until August. An exact date is not set, but officials have said after Aug. 1 and before Aug. 7, the date of Ohio’s initial deadline to have Biden appear on the ticket. Ohio lawmakers have since extended the deadline, with many Democrats arguing that the roll call is no longer necessary. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon, who is president of ​​political polling and consulting firm Bannon Communications Research, told the Washington Examiner that he thinks there is a one-week time frame before two things happen: either Biden withdraws or Democrats “suck it up.” “Either the president needs to find a way to quell the Democratic dissent, and if he can’t do that in the next week, he should step aside,” Bannon said. “I think you could make a good argument for the president to step aside. But he isn’t going to step aside, so I think it’s incumbent on Democrats to suck it up and support the president.” Schiff became the first Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw from the race following the shooting at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally — and many strategists, including Bannon, argue that it sent a “shock wave” through the Democratic and Republican parties. “Because of the assassination attempt, I think that stopped everybody in their tracks,” Bannon said. “But I also do think previous to Saturday … the president and his campaign had pressed very hard to make it clear that he’s intent on running for reelection.” Eyes will be on Biden to see if he will take the concerns from the Democratic conference in stride and push forward as the nominee or if he will bow out and allow a new face to take his place. For now, he seems to be dealing in hypotheticals. The president said in an interview with BET’s Ed Gordon that he would consider dropping out if his medical staff diagnosed him with a new condition or disease that would make continuing his campaign impossible. “If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody, if doctors came to me and said, you got this problem and that problem,” the president said when Gordon asked if anything would make him change his mind about running. The medical condition is another “if” added to Biden’s list of potential reasons he’d step down: a sign from God, urging from his family, or if polls showed that he had no chance of winning. Following the debate on June 27, Biden found himself trailing Trump nationwide by 6 percentage points. Many swing districts and battleground states are paying the price for Biden at the top of the ticket, with several shifting further to favor Republicans. Polling has shown, however, that Biden is still within the margin of error to win a few of the states that have shifted into GOP territory. But a new poll released Wednesday showing that a majority of voters want Biden to drop out of the race is likely to put increased pressure on congressional Democrats to decide if they support the president or think it’s time to move on to someone new. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a Biden-Harris campaign co-chair, said in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday that he would remind his concerned colleagues there are several months to go before the November election. “Poll after poll, nationwide head-to-head polls, still show this within the margin of error in a head-to-head race and bluntly, it’s July,” Coons said. “There are months left. I don’t know of any candidate for president in modern history who, because the polls are moving one way or the other by a few points, abandon their campaign for the presidency in July.” Both Bannon and Hank Sheinkopf, Democratic strategist and former adviser to President Bill Clinton and New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said the Democratic Party is “torn” right now on how to approach the issue of Biden as the nominee. Concerns over Biden’s viability to serve another term in the White House have been steadily growing over the months after the president tripped or fell down at events, messed up people’s names, and made repeated verbal gaffes. The president’s lackluster debate performance, in which he stammered and stumbled over words, only added fuel to the fire. Initially, Biden’s allies attempted to brush off his display as one bad night compared to years of his administration’s record. However, in the days following the debate, he misspoke while introducing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “President Putin” before correcting himself. During a press conference following the NATO summit, Biden referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” Biden has repeatedly said he will run for reelection and remain in the race despite some Democrats still stating that it is “his decision,” insinuating that the choice is not finalized. Sheinkopf said that for Biden to change his decision now, “the pressure against him would have to be immense, and it’s nowhere near that now, not publicly.” A new polling memo from BlueLabs Analytics released Wednesday could incentivize Democrats to join the chorus of their 20 colleagues in calling him to step aside. The memo found nearly every other Democrat tested performed better than Biden in a matchup with Trump. It found the strongest candidates were Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Govs. Wes Moore (D-MD), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), and Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), all of whom polled above Biden “by roughly 5 points across battleground states.” Bannon thinks most Democrats are waiting to see what happens in the coming days before deciding to join their colleagues or accept the president as their nominee. “Every day that we cross off the calendar strengthens Biden’s support with Democrats,” Bannon said. “It’s pretty clear that, I think, a lot of Democrats think that Biden’s nomination, renomination, is inevitable,” the strategist added. “Why jump out in front of a rolling freight train, because everything I see is that Joe Biden is going to be the nominee unless he chooses not to be.”","summary":"President Joe Biden is facing a renewed wave of anxiety among Democrats over his ability to take on GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.&#160; Public calls for Biden to drop out appeared to subside in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt on the former president and as this week’s Republican National Convention commenced, but the [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/congressional/3087833/biden-democratic-groundswell-turn-against-him-allies-look-run-out-clock/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joe-biden-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 23:08:42","author":"Rachel Schilke and Ramsey Touchberry","authors":["Rachel Schilke and Ramsey Touchberry"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179}]}
