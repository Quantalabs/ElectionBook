He’s an advocate of cutting spending while extending the tax cuts approved by Congress in Trump’s first term.\n\nHere are four things to know about the South Carolina billionaire who, if confirmed by the Senate, will manage the nation’s finances:\n\nHe worked for George Soros and donated to Democratic causes\n\nBefore becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore’s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.\n\nBessent had an influential role in Soros’ London investment operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on “Black Wednesday,” when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.\n\nHe speaks regularly about deficit reduction, while supporting extending Trump’s tax cuts\n\nBessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office, though estimates from various economic analysis of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years.\n\nBessent calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that the tax extension would add to the federal deficit.\n\n“That’s going to be a negotiation with the Republican Congress,” Bessent told CNBC on Nov. 6. “I’ve already been in conversations with a lot of the Republicans who will chair those committees,” he said. “The Republican Congress, there’s a big appetite for pay-fors. It will be a negotiation.”\n\nHe has in media interviews spoken about the need to tackle the nation’s debt. “I do think this debt and deficit is going to be the big issue of the day. I think Americans are worried about it.” He argues that consumer prices can be brought down “by starting with a deficit reduction program.”\n\nHe views tariffs as a sanctions tool\n\nTrump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China — and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports. Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.\n\nBessent told Bloomberg in August that he views tariffs as a “one time price adjustment” and “not inflationary,” and tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. “I think that tariffs in a way can be regarded as an economic sanction without a sanction. If you don’t like Chinese economic policy, flooding the market with over production, you could put a sanction on them, or a tariff. Its also an answer to currency manipulation.”\n\nAnd he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are “a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.”\n\nHe told CNBC that “I would recommend that tariffs be layered in gradually.”\n\nHe would be the first openly gay treasury secretary\n\nIf confirmed to the role, he would also be the first openly LGBTQ Senate-confirmed cabinet member in a Republican administration.\n\nIn 2020, Trump named Richard Grenell, who is openly gay, acting director of national intelligence. However, the role was not subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nIn 2015, Bessent told the Yale Alumni Magazine: “If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated, and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I’d be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn’t have believed you.”\n\nPete Buttigieg is the first openly LGBT Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, nominated by President Joe Biden to lead the transportation department.","summary":"WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump has chosen money manager Scott Bessent, an&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/scott-bessent-key-facts-about-trumps-choice-for-treasury-secretary/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-What-to-know-about-Scott-Bessent-Trump039s-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 01:12:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":266605744,"title":"“Florida’s Surgeon General Recommends Against Fluoride Addition in Drinking Water”","text":"On Friday, Florida’s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced that communities in the state shouldn’t add fluoride to drinking water because of what he called the “neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure.”\n\nFluoride has long been proven to drive down tooth decay by strengthening teeth, which Ladapo acknowledged in the guidance.\n\nBut he added that there are also possible “safety concerns related to systemic fluoride exposure,” including reductions in IQ. While some studies have suggested potential links, the research is considered preliminary and far from definitive.\n\nThe American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support the use of fluoridated water, calling it one of the top 10 public health achievements of the past century. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%. \n\nOnce its benefits were proven, fluoride was also added to toothpaste and some mouthwashes. Dentists began giving kids fluoride treatments. Some communities are restoring fluoride to their water systems after seeing a rise in children’s cavities. \n\nThe anti-fluoride drumbeat has become louder in recent years. Communities have increasingly opted out of adding it to water, citing possible health risks.\n\nThere are ongoing, active investigations about safe levels of fluoride exposure. \n\n“Rates of tooth decay are absolutely a concern,” said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada. “But science is evolving. There’s growing evidence suggesting that fluoride may not be as safe as previously thought.”\n\nLanphear is an author of a 2019 study published in JAMA Pediatrics that found that mothers who drank fluoridated water while they were pregnant were more likely to have children with lower IQ levels.\n\nHe and his colleagues concluded that pregnant women may want to avoid fluoride, but stopped short of advocating for its removal from water systems. \n\nAbout 70% of community water systems in Florida receive fluoridated water, according to the surgeon general’s release.\n\n“It is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation,” Ladapo said in the release.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who tracks illnesses on her website, Your Local Epidemiologist, reacted to Ladapo’s announcement Friday. “Replacing community good for individualism is a slippery slope,” she said. \n\nLadapo has been previously criticized for going against basic public health measures. Pediatricians were enraged in February, for example, when Ladapo left the decision on whether to quarantine children amid a massive measles outbreak to parents. He has questioned the effectiveness of Covid vaccines and threatened criminal charges against TV stations in Florida that aired an ad supporting the state’s abortion rights ballot measure until a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against him.\n\nHe’s rumored to be on a list of people who could play a major health role in the next administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, has said he would advise against fluoride being added to U.S​. water systems. \n\nCalls for reintroducing fluoride\n\nDespite fluoride skeptics, some communities are actively working to get the mineral back into their water supply.\n\nWhen residents of Buffalo, New York, realized in January 2023 that fluoride had been missing from their water supply since 2015 — uncovered by a local investigative reporter — demand to reinstate the cavity-fighting mineral to their drinking water was swift. \n\nParents said their kids’ teeth were full of cavities despite drinking and brushing regularly with what they thought for years was fluoridated water. \n\n“There’s many stories of young children who have ended up in (the) hospital needing emergency dental surgery,” Robert Corp, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Buffalo parents, told NBC affiliate WGRZ.\n\nCity leaders acted. Less than two years later, in late September, fluoride once again flowed from Buffalo taps. \n\nOther cities, such as Abilene, Kansas, and McVille, North Dakota, have done the same, according to the American Dental Association.\n\n‘Helping the most vulnerable’\n\nAccording to the CDC, kids in lower-income families have nearly three times higher rates of untreated cavities compared to children in higher-income families. \n\nThere are several reasons. Just 1 in 3 dentists in the U.S. treat Medicaid patients. And nearly half of U.S. kids do not receive regular dental care, according to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nAdding fluoride to water systems “mitigates the impact of disparities in access to dental care,” said Jetelina, the epidemiologist. “This is one of the beauties of public health — a mainly invisible population intervention, helping the most vulnerable.”\n\nStill, the scrutiny continues.\n\nIn September, a federal judge in California ruled that even though he couldn’t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations.\n\nAnother report stemming from that decision, looking specifically at kids’ IQ levels, is expected early next year.","summary":"On Friday, Florida’s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced that communities in the&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/floridas-surgeon-general-recommends-against-fluoride-addition-in-drinking-water/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Floridas-surgeon-general-advises-against-adding-fluoride-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 01:07:35","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":266605220,"title":"Coleen Rooney is being eyed up as the next Holly Willoughby as ITV bosses 'hope to capitalise on her girl next door charm for presenting roles'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Nov 23rd 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside the wild night out that led to a jury finding that Conor McGregor DID sexually assault woman: How a flirty comment on Instagram escalated into a 9am rendezvous with his rape accuser - before things went 'badly wrong'\n\nThe little girl who never stood a chance: How nursery worker mother of murdered little Isabella turned a blind eye as her boyfriend subjected two-year-old to a horrific campaign of abuse in the final months of her life\n\nRevealed: Queen Elizabeth was 'annoyed' at Donald Trump over 'ignorant and hurtful' comment about her sister Princess Margaret\n\nPrivate sector shrinks after Labour Budget\n\nShocking last pictures of Liam Payne alive that raise a troubling question - could he have been saved?

I voted in the summer for the Euro parliamentary elections,\" said one Romanian woman in Paris.\"I feel that the whole topic of voting abroad has not been addressed enough in the country.

No other country in the world opens over 900 polling stations abroad.\"Greblă also said more than 19,000 polling stations will be set up across the country where Romanians at home can vote.Sunday's presidential election has 13 candidates vying for the presidency and is widely expected to go to a 8 December runoff.Leading in the polls is Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who is backed by Romania's largest party, the Social Democratic Party, or PSD.Ciolacu said he has a \"clear plan for a more developed Romania that leaves no one behind, an internal plan based on economic growth on investments and a plan for a more respected and influential Romania abroad.\"\"Unfortunately, we have political leaders who challenge our presence in the EU and NATO […] I believe that extremists must be politically isolated and not taken into account by any government,\" the PSD leader added.But far-right nationalist George Simion is also in with a chance of winning.

What you need to know about Trump’s Treasury secretary pick.","text":"President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president’s policies, from tariffs to spending cuts. \n\nIf confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation’s finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds. \n\nPerhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump’s backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president’s policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren’t inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump’s plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.\n\n“Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,” Bessent wrote for Fox News. “But the facts argue against this. President Trump’s first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.”\n\n Here’s what to know about Scott Bessent. \n\nWhat is Bessent’s educational and work history?\n\nBessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn’t get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros’ first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university’s alumni magazine. \n\n“And he even offered — which was key for me — a place to stay on the office sofa,” Bessent told the publication. \n\nBessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.\n\nWhat are Bessent’s political and economic views? \n\nIn an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.\n\n“Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,” he wrote. “The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.”\n\nAmong those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can “increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.”\n\nBessent has advised Trump to create a “3-3-3” policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n\nWhat about Bessent’s ties with Soros? \n\nThe relationship between a one-time Soros protégé and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.\n\nBut Trump views Bessent’s experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor’s wealth. \n\nWhile at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.\n\nWhat about Bessent’s personal life?\n\nBessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children. \n\n“If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I’d be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn’t have believed you,” Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.\n\nPolitics also runs in his family, as former Rep. John Jenrette was his uncle and is also known for serving a prison sentence for his role in 1980s Abscam scandal, South Carolina’s Post and Courier reported.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president&#8217;s policies, from tariffs to spending cuts.  If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Who is Scott Bessent?

A federal judge ordered him released on bond after his initial court appearance.\n\nGorski didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. An attorney who represented him after his arrest declined to comment on Gorski's behalf.\n\nAuthorities allege that during the attack, Gorski climbed scaffolding, breaching police lines, and took photos and videos inside the building. He yelled at officers, pushed against an officer's riot shield and was eventually forced out after being sprayed with a chemical irritant, authorities said.\n\nWhen the FBI interviewed him, Gorski did not claim that he was working as a photojournalist during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and said he didn't bring his professional camera to the Capitol. He told federal agents that he had worked as a photographer for the Chicago Fire Department and for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nHe has not professionally published any photographs of the Capitol riot, according to the FBI.\n\nAn FBI agent's affidavit says some of Gorski's sports photographs are available through Getty Images and have been \"picked up\" by The Associated Press and USA Today. Gorski also shot photos for the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAuthorities said Gorski has continued to take photos at some local sporting events in Chicago but hasn't published any political photographs in the last five years.\n\nGorski is not an Associated Press journalist and has never been employed by the news organization, said Lauren Easton, AP's vice president of corporate communications.\n\n\"We have distributed some photos he took for AP's photo partners and member news organizations,\" Easton said in a statement.\n\nGorski's resume says he works as a building commissioner for the Village of Norridge, Illinois, near Chicago, and graduated earlier this year from Southern Illinois Edwardsville with a master's degree in public administration.\n\nA commencement program from ceremonies in May at SIUE lists Gorski, who said he graduated with high honors in a social media post. He enrolled there in August 2022, according to a social media post from the school.\n\nHe attended then-President Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" rally near the White House on Jan. 6 before he marched to the Capitol in a group of people that included conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Owen Shroyer, who has hosted a show on Jones' Infowars website.\n\nOn the west side of the Capitol, Gorski climbed up a wall onto stairs, helped another rioter onto the wall and removed a tarp covering scaffolding, according to the FBI. He climbed up and down the scaffolding before he helped pass a bike rack to other rioters, the agent's affidavit says.\n\nGorski pointed and yelled at police officers outside the building. He also clapped and chanted, \"Let us in!\" After rioters broke through a police lines and sent officers retreating, Gorski hung a flag over the edge of a balcony.\n\nGorski used his phone to take photos or videos inside a tunnel entrance that police were guarding, according to the affidavit. He screamed at the officers, \"This is our house!\" as he pushed against an officer's riot shield, the FBI said.\n\nGorski left the tunnel after several minutes and entered the Capitol through the Senate Wing door, taking more photos or videos inside the building, the affidavit says. An officer had to forcibly move Gorski from a doorway in another part of the Capitol, according to the agent. Gorski retreated after police sprayed him with a chemical irritant.\n\nApproximately one year after the attack, the FBI received a tip that Gorski had posted photos of the riot in a group chat with friends.\n\nMore than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the Capitol riot.","summary":"Patrick Gorski graduated earlier this year from Southern Illinois Edwardsville with a master's degree in public administration.","url":"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-courts/recent-siue-graduate-arrested-in-chicago-on-capitol-riot-charges/article_a3ff71d6-a933-11ef-a333-0f7886378f38.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/3f/a3ff71d6-a933-11ef-a333-0f7886378f38/674128a049d7b.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:56:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":266604124,"title":"Being black in US a big struggle – Nigerian-American Rep, Owolewa","text":"How does it feel to be re-elected representative of the District of Columbia? \n\nI’m very excited to be a re-elected representative. Being the only Nigerian American elected US Rep, it’s an honour to have the support of DC residents.\n\nWhat challenges do you encounter daily as a black in America? \n\nBeing Black in America is a constant struggle. We have to maintain our values, integrity, and dignity every day. As a Nigerian American with immigrant parents, I also have to prove that I understand the pain of descendants of slaves and try to support their needs.\n\nHow do you surmount these challenges? \n\nI surmount them by being available and reliable. We have been in a position to do great things for the community. For example, our expungement clinics help returning citizens get that second chance and our seminars help get businesses on the right track.\n\nWhat was the turning point for you from studying pharmacy to finding yourself in American politics? \n\nI was pushed into politics. I never thought I could actually be a politician. Someone saw the work I was doing in the community and convinced me to consider running for office. I had a patient named Brianne who told me to attend a community meeting. I went to that meeting and a former commissioner told me I wouldn’t be able to speak on what was agreed. I was upset. So I went to the back of the room to complain. Then, a lady told me ‘if I can do better, then I should run for an office’. I did, and won by one vote and the rest is history.\n\nHow do you combine pharmacy and politics in the US? \n\nI work in both arenas. Some day I’m a pharmacist, other days I’m working in politics. I’m the only elected pharmacist out here.\n\nAs a Democrat, what are your views on the emergence of Republican Donald Trump as the President-elect?\n\nIt’s a huge challenge to deal with Trump. Not only that, the Democrats have lost the House, Senate, White House, and Supreme Court. It may be challenging to pass legislation in DC, but we’re up for it.\n\nTrump has been talking about conducting the highest deportation in American history. Do you think it’s just a threat or is he capable of doing this?\n\nTrump has the power and potential to cause mass deportations and massive displacement. However, he’s such a wildcard, he can also do amnesty. I hope he can be pushed into a humane immigration policy.\n\nThere are debates in global politics that Americans aren’t ready for a female president yet. What are your thoughts? \n\nWe are ready for a female president. Any person who presents as an economic populist will become president. Trump is not a true populist, but he played one on the campaign trail. He spoke on the struggles of the working class, but turned around and gave tax cuts to billionaires.\n\nAre you eyeing another political office in the US?\n\nI’m glad and focused on being DC’s representative.\n\nNigeria is considered the Giant of Africa but marred with social and economic problems. What is your perspective on this?\n\nI believe the diaspora needs a bigger role in the shaping of the continent. For example, Nigeria relies on diasporan dollars. Half of its budget (20 billion of the 40 billion total) comes from repatriated dollars.\n\nHave you been to Nigeria recently?\n\nI was in Nigeria in 2023. I went to Nigeria on a personal trip with my dad. I learned his life story by going to Kwara State.\n\nHow do you stay connected to your Nigerian roots while living in abroad?\n\nMy parents help keep me connected.

Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term that he tried to distance himself from during the campaign.\n\nThe announcements Friday evening showed how Trump was fleshing out the financial side of his new administration. Although Bessent is closely aligned with Wall Street and could earn bipartisan support, Vought is known as a Republican hardliner.\n\nTrump said Bessent would “help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,\" while Vought “knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.”\n\nIn a separate announcement, Trump said he had chosen Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, an Oregon Republican, as his labor secretary.\n\n\"I look forward to working with her to create tremendous opportunity for American Workers,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nBessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation’s first openly gay treasury secretary.\n\nHe told Bloomberg in August that he decided to join Trump's campaign in part to attack the mounting U.S. national debt. That would include slashing government programs and other spending.\n\n“This election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,” he said then.\n\nAs of Nov. 8, the national debt stands at $35.94 trillion, with both the Trump and Biden administrations having added to it. Trump’s policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, while the Biden administration increased the national debt by $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.\n\nEven as he pushes to lower the national debt by stopping spending, Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years. Nearly all of the law’s provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\nBefore becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore’s presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. Bessent had an influential role in Soros’ London operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on “Black Wednesday,” when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.\n\nBessent’s selection wasn’t surprising; he had been among the names floated for the treasury secretary role. At an October Detroit Economic Club event, Trump called Bessent “one of the top analysts on Wall Street.”\n\nBessent told Bloomberg in August that he views tariffs as a “one time price adjustment” and “not inflationary,” and tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are “a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.”\n\nBessent told Fox News earlier this month when asked if tariffs would pay for Trump’s large scale deportation operation that he had been working on a plan for what he called “financial deportations,” explaining he would restrict the flow of remittances to migrants’ home countries.\n\nBessent has also floated ideas for how the Trump administration could put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Last month, Bessent suggested Trump could name a replacement chair early, and let that person function as a “shadow” chair, with the goal of essentially sidelining Powell.\n\nBut after the election, Bessent reportedly backed away from that plan. Powell, for his part, has said he wouldn’t step down if Trump asked him to do so, and added that Trump, as president, doesn’t have the authority to fire him.\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term as president for raising the Fed’s key rate in 2017 and 2018. During the 2024 campaign, he said that as president he should have a “say” in the central bank’s interest rate decisions. Presidents traditionally avoid commenting on the Fed’s policies.\n\nBessent and his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, married in 2011 and have two children.\n\nVought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump’s first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director. A graduate of Wheaton College and George Washington University Law School, he had a deep knowledge of government finances that has been paired with his own Christian faith.\n\nAfter Trump’s initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as renewing \"a consensus of America as a nation under God.”\n\nThe Center for Renewing America released its own 2023 budget proposal entitled “A Commitment to End Work and Weaponized Government.” The proposal envisioned $11.3 trillion worth of spending reductions over 10 years and about $2 trillion in income tax cuts in order to bring the budget into surplus by 2032.\n\n“The immediate threat facing the nation is the fact that the people no longer govern the country; instead, the government itself is increasingly weaponized against the people it is meant to serve,” Vought wrote in the introduction.\n\nVought has also previously worked as the executive and budget director for the Republican Study Committee, a caucus for conservative House Republicans. He also worked at Heritage Action, the political group tied to The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\nVought’s proposed budget plan would cut spending on food aid through the Agriculture Department. There would be $3.3 trillion in spending reductions in the Health and Human Services Department in large part through how Medicaid and Medicare funds are distributed. It also contains about $642 billion in cuts to Affordable Care Act. The budgets for the Housing and Urban Development and Education departments would also be cut.\n\nVought’s budget ideas were independent of Trump, who has not entirely spelled out the details of his economic plans, other than to campaign on income tax cuts and tariff hikes.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Algunos de sus planes requerirían la acción del Congreso, pero con un Congreso controlado por los republicanos a su lado, los expertos dicen que Trump tiene muchas probabilidades de éxito.\n\nLos planes de Trump pueden sonar impactantes en áreas progresistas de California, pero están lejos de ser inéditos, dijo Agustina Paglayan, profesora de ciencia política de la UC San Diego y autora de Raised to Obey: The Rise and Spread of Mass Education, un nuevo libro sobre cómo los gobiernos occidentales han utilizado la educación pública para controlar a los ciudadanos.\n\n“Todo lo que Trump quiere hacer… en realidad no es una anomalía en absoluto, y sigue un patrón global”, dijo Paglayan. “Los gobiernos están particularmente interesados en usar la educación para enseñar a la gente que el statu quo está bien, y que no se debe cuestionar”.\n\nLos líderes demócratas de California ya han dicho que lucharán contra futuras acciones de Trump que, según ellos, contradecirían los valores del estado. El gobernador Gavin Newsom convocará una sesión legislativa especial el 2 de diciembre que, según dijo, tiene como objetivo “salvaguardar los valores y los derechos fundamentales de California”, como las protecciones para personas LGBTQ+, mujeres e inmigrantes.\n\nMenos dinero\n\nUno de los impactos más sustanciales que los expertos y educadores anticipan de Trump para las escuelas K-12 es la reducción o eliminación del financiamiento federal.\n\nEl financiamiento federal representa un porcentaje pequeño del presupuesto escolar, típicamente menos del 10%. Pero gran parte de este financiamiento va a algunos de los estudiantes más vulnerables, incluidos los estudiantes en escuelas de alta pobreza (que inscriben a una mayor proporción de estudiantes de color) y los estudiantes con discapacidades.\n\nUna de las promesas de campaña de Trump fue quitar fondos federalmente a cualquier escuela que él crea que esté enseñando lo que llama teoría crítica de la raza o “adoctrinamiento de género”. No sería difícil para Trump identificar tales escuelas, dijo Paglayan, porque los padres ya han estado reportando distritos escolares con lo que consideran contenido cuestionable, con la ayuda y el apoyo de organizaciones conservadoras nacionales.\n\nUn gobierno liderado por Trump podría cambiar el financiamiento federal de derechos, como el Título I para escuelas de alta pobreza, y convertirlo en subsidios para los estados, dijo Jonathan Collins, profesor asistente de ciencia política y educación en la Universidad de Columbia.\n\nEso permitiría a los estados decidir cómo distribuir los fondos y adjuntar condiciones al financiamiento federal para los distritos escolares; también eliminaría la garantía de que las escuelas recibirían fondos federales para estudiantes vulnerables, dijo.\n\n“Si los niños en situación de pobreza reciben o no ayuda financiera adicional dependerá de la política de sus estados”, dijo Collins. “Lo que esto podría parecer es un sistema de apartheid donde, en los estados republicanos, la responsabilidad educativa y la inversión en educación se ve de una manera, y en los estados demócratas de otra”.\n\nEn el Distrito Unificado de San Diego, el financiamiento federal representa menos del 6% del presupuesto total del distrito para el año en curso, alrededor de $95 millones.\n\nEso incluye alrededor de $37 millones en fondos del Título I, $23.7 millones en fondos para educación especial y $10 millones en “ayuda por impacto” destinada a ayudar a los distritos escolares a apoyar a estudiantes “conectados federalmente”, como estudiantes de familias militares y estudiantes que viven en tierras indígenas.\n\nAunque el dinero federal no representa una gran parte del presupuesto general de $1.9 mil millones del Distrito Unificado de San Diego, cualquier pérdida de fondos agravaría el déficit financiero existente del distrito, que totaliza $176 millones en su lado no restringido del presupuesto.\n\nY cualquier pérdida de fondos del Título I se sentirá intensamente a nivel de cada escuela, especialmente en las escuelas de mayor pobreza que no tienen fundaciones o asociaciones de padres y maestros para recaudar grandes cantidades de dinero y dependen del Título I para pagar el personal adicional necesario más allá de las proporciones de personal ya ajustadas del distrito.\n\nPor ejemplo, Perkins K-8 en Barrio Logan, donde más del 90% de los estudiantes son de bajos ingresos, recibe alrededor de $206,000 cada año en fondos del Título I. Ese dinero paga el salario y los beneficios del decano de la escuela, quien es un apoyo vital para muchos estudiantes que sufren de pobreza y otros traumas.\n\n“Eso es lo que más me preocupa: mucho menos dinero del que realmente, realmente necesitamos”, dijo el director Fernando Hernández sobre el riesgo de perder fondos del Título I.\n\nLos estados demócratas como California podrían optar por intervenir y “rescatar” a las escuelas llenando el vacío de fondos federales perdidos. Pero California probablemente estaría limitada en sus opciones debido a su déficit financiero.\n\n“No sé de dónde vendría el ingreso en este momento. Pero es una opción que la legislatura (estatal) podría considerar”, dijo Paglayan.\n\nMenos supervisión\n\nOtra de las plataformas educativas más destacadas de Trump es desmantelar el Departamento de Educación de EE. UU., establecido por primera vez en 1979 por el presidente Jimmy Carter.\n\nEl departamento supervisa la distribución de fondos y subvenciones federales para la educación y proporciona orientación y mejores prácticas para las escuelas. También hace cumplir las protecciones para los estudiantes a través de su Oficina de Derechos Civiles, que recientemente investigó al Distrito Unificado de San Diego por no cumplir con las protecciones del Título IX para estudiantes contra el acoso y abuso sexual.\n\nEliminar el departamento no eliminaría necesariamente las funciones del mismo. Más bien, los expertos dicen que es probable que Trump asigne sus funciones a otras agencias federales existentes, lo cual es el plan delineado en el Proyecto 2025, un manual para la presidencia de Trump escrito por sus seguidores y excolaboradores.\n\nLa idea detrás de abolir el departamento es reducir la “grasa administrativa”, dar más control sobre la educación a los estados y debilitar los sindicatos de maestros, que se benefician de tener una agencia única a nivel federal para hacer cabildeo.\n\nLos educadores y expertos también dicen que Trump podría fácilmente apartarse de las protecciones federales del Título IX para los estudiantes LGBTQ+ que han sido mantenidas por el departamento bajo la administración de Biden.\n\nCalifornia ya tiene algunas protecciones legales propias para estos estudiantes.\n\nEl estado acaba de promulgar la ley AB 1955, que prohíbe que las escuelas obliguen a sus empleados o contratistas a revelar información sobre la orientación sexual, identidad de género o expresión de género de un estudiante a cualquier persona sin el consentimiento del estudiante, a menos que sea requerido por ley.\n\nTodos los niños de California tienen derecho a una educación pública gratuita, independientemente de su estatus migratorio o el de sus padres, y la ley estatal establece que las escuelas no pueden recolectar información o documentos sobre el estatus migratorio de un estudiante o su familia.\n\nOtras promesas de campaña de Trump incluyeron promover la eliminación de la tenencia docente, así como el uso de pagos basados en el rendimiento para los maestros, en lugar de pagos que aumentan automáticamente según los años de experiencia y los niveles educativos.\n\n“Existe ese temor”\n\nAdemás de los cambios en las políticas y el financiamiento, los educadores temen que el regreso de Trump traiga consigo un clima particularmente hostil para los estudiantes LGBTQ+, los estudiantes inmigrantes y los estudiantes de color.\n\n“Más inmediatamente frente a nosotros ahora está el trauma que sabemos que muchos de nuestros estudiantes y familias ya están experimentando en anticipación a lo que va a hacer la administración Trump, y eso incluye a nuestras familias inmigrantes, incluye a nuestros estudiantes LGBTQ+ y sus familias”, dijo el fideicomisario del Distrito Unificado de San Diego, Richard Barrera.\n\nLas promesas de Trump de deportaciones masivas, si se cumplen, generarían disrupciones para muchos estudiantes. Aproximadamente el 9% de los estudiantes de K-12 en California tienen al menos un padre que es inmigrante no autorizado, según estimaciones del Pew Research Center.\n\nLos funcionarios del Distrito Unificado de San Diego, que han sido vocales en su apoyo a los estudiantes LGBTQ+ y estudiantes de color, ya han comenzado a prepararse para la presidencia de Trump. El distrito planea recordar y aclarar a los directores y las familias las políticas existentes que, por ejemplo, dicen que las escuelas no proporcionarán información a agencias de inmigración sin el consentimiento de los padres, salvo que se requiera por citación o orden judicial.\n\nLos líderes del distrito también planean realizar foros de “conoce tus derechos” en las escuelas, en colaboración con organizaciones de defensa locales, de manera similar a lo que hizo el distrito durante la primera presidencia de Trump, dijo Barrera.\n\n“Sé que existe ese temor, y queremos responder y hacer saber a nuestra comunidad que estamos aquí para educarlos, para proporcionarles espacios seguros en nuestras escuelas, sea cual sea lo que eso signifique”, dijo Enrique Ruacho, director ejecutivo senior de personal del Distrito Unificado de San Diego. “De muchas maneras, estamos más preparados gracias a la primera administración. Así que, la segunda vez, en muchos aspectos, es recordar a nuestras comunidades: ‘Oye, ya estuvimos aquí antes — no es la primera vez.'”\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"El financiamiento federal y la supervisión podrían recortarse","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/11/22/como-una-segunda-presidencia-de-trump-podria-impactar-las-escuelas-del-condado-de-san-diego/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SUT-L-PERKINS-EDUCATION-12.jpg?w=1024&h=644","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:52:00","author":"Kristen Taketa","authors":["Kristen Taketa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":266604890,"title":"King ‘charming and funny’ as he attends Royal Variety Performance alone","text":"The King appeared “charming and funny” as he attended this year’s Royal Variety Performance alone after the Queen was forced to miss the event to recover from a chest infection.\n\nCharles attended the show at the Royal Albert Hall in London for the first time as patron of the Royal Variety charity, following in the footsteps of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe arrived alone on Friday evening after Camilla pulled out of the event at the last minute, having been advised by doctors to rest following her recent chest infection.\n\nShow hosts Alan Carr and Amanda Holden expressed gratitude at Charles’ attendance despite his wife’s lingering illness – and enthusiasm at the news their comic numbers on stage made the monarch laugh.\n\nHolden said: “His Majesty was amazingly charming – he said we definitely earned our pound that we got paid.

We will restore fiscal sanity to our Nation, and unleash the American People to new levels of Prosperity and Ingenuity. I look forward to working with you again, Russ. Congratulations. Together, we will Make America Great Again!’\n\nWall Street had been closely watching who Trump will pick, especially given his plans to remake global trade through tariffs.\n\nBessent was picked from a crowded field of candidates for the coveted role.\n\nThat list included Apollo Global Management Chief Executive Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. \n\nInvestor John Paulson had also been a leading candidate, but dropped out while Wall Street veteran Howard Lutnick, another contender, was appointed as head of the Commerce Department.\n\nBessent, 62, primarily lives in Charleston, South Carolina with his husband and two children. \n\nHe grew up in the fishing village of Little River, South Carolina, where Bessent has said his father, a real estate investor, experienced booms and busts.\n\nBessent worked for noted short seller Jim Chanos in the late 1980s and then joined Soros Fund Management, the famed macroeconomic investment firm of billionaire George Soros. \n\nHe soon helped Soros and top deputy Stanley Druckenmiller on their most famous trade – shorting the British pound in 1992 and earning the firm more than $1 billion.\n\nIn 2015, Bessent raised $4.5 billion, including $2 billion from Soros, to launch Key Square Group, a hedge fund firm that bets on macroeconomic trends. \n\nKey Square’s main fund gained about 31% in 2022, according to media reports, but firm assets have declined to approximately $577 million as of December 2023, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThrough his family office, Bessent controls a number of businesses in industries including agriculture, hospitality, publishing, and real estate. He has been in the Investment Management Business for over 35 years.\n\nBorn in Conway, South Carolina, Scott is a member of the French Huguenot Church of Charleston, where his family were founding members in the 1680s. \n\nBecause of family economic anxiety, Scott took his first summer job at the age of nine. \n\nHe attended Yale University, graduating in 1984. Scott was also an Adjunct Professor of Economic History at Yale.\n\nFollowing Trump’s election victory the market surged. Bessent wrote the market’s reaction signaled investor ‘expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans.’\n\nBessent follows other financial luminaries who have taken the job, including former Goldman Sachs executives Robert Rubin, Hank Paulson and Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s first Treasury chief. \n\nJanet Yellen, the current secretary and first woman in the job, previously chaired the Federal Reserve and White House Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nAs the 79th Treasury secretary, Bessent would essentially be the highest-ranking U.S. economic official, responsible for maintaining the plumbing of the world’s largest economy, from collecting taxes and paying the nation’s bills to managing the $28.6-trillion Treasury debt market and overseeing financial regulation, including handling and preventing market crises.\n\nThe Treasury boss also runs U.S. financial sanctions policy, oversees the U.S.-led International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other international financial institutions, and manages national security screenings of foreign investments in the U.S.\n\nBessent would face challenges, including safely managing federal deficits that are forecast to grow by nearly $8 trillion over a decade due to Trump’s plans to extend expiring tax cuts next year and add generous new breaks, including ending taxes on Social Security income.\n\nWithout offsetting revenues, this new debt would add to an unsustainable fiscal trajectory already forecast to balloon U.S. debt by $22 trillion through 2033.\n\nManaging debt increases this large without market indigestion will be a challenge, though Bessent has argued Trump’s agenda would unleash stronger economic growth that would grow revenue and shore up market confidence.\n\nBessent would also inherit the role carved out by Yellen to lead the Group of Seven wealthy democracies to provide tens of billions of dollars in economic support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion and tighten sanctions on Moscow. \n\nBut given Trump’s desire to end the war quickly and withdraw U.S. financial support for Ukraine, it is unclear whether he would pursue this.\n\nAnother area where Bessent will likely differ from Yellen is her focus on climate change, from her mandate that development banks expand lending for clean energy to incorporating climate risks into financial regulations and managing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits.\n\nTrump, a climate-change skeptic, has vowed to increase production of U.S. fossil fuel energy and end the clean-energy subsidies in President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe Treasury secretary is also the administration’s closest point of contact with the Federal Reserve. \n\nBoth Yellen under Biden and Mnuchin under Trump typically met weekly with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, often over breakfast or lunch.\n\nBessent has floated the idea of creating a ‘shadow’ Fed chair. \n\nThis would entail nominating as early as possible a presumptive Powell predecessor to the Fed Board who would then deliver their own policy guidance so that, as Bessent told Barron´s last month, ‘no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.’\n\nThe next seat to open up at the Fed Board is that of Governor Adriana Kugler, whose term runs to January 2026. \n\nBessent has since said he no longer thinks the idea of a shadow chair worth pursuing, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nPowell’s term as Fed chair expires in May 2026, but presidents rarely wait until the Fed chief’s term ends before nominating a successor.","summary":"Donald Trump has named hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary.&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-selects-billionaire-scott-bessent-as-treasury-secretary-known-for-pro-tariff-stance/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Trump-picks-pro-tariff-billionaire-Scott-Bessent-for-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:50:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.592},{"id":266604110,"title":"Haitian immigrants in Springfield face uncertainty post-election","text":"Haitian immigrants in Springfield face uncertainty post-election\n President-elect Donald Trump's threat to carry out mass deportations is putting immigrant communities across the nation on edge.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy CAROLINA PIRAS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:48 GMT, 23 November 2024 |Updated:00:49 GMT, 23 November 2024 \n\nI'm A Celebrity viewers were left baffled by a major editing gaffe on Friday's episode.\nEagle-eyed fans noticed Maura Higgins and Danny Jones' names were completely wrong when they were speaking in the Bush Telegraph. \nAs Love Island alum Maura, 33, appeared on screen during the segment - instead of her name, she was unintentionally introduced as fellow campmate Melvin Odoom, the TV presenter and DJ.\nMeanwhile McFly star Danny, 38, was called his other fellow celeb campmate, Dean McCullough, Radio 1 DJ.\nViewers of the show took to X after spotting the major mistake. They wrote: 'What’s going on down in the jungle editing booth?! #ImACeleb';\n\nI'm A Celebrity viewers were left baffled by a major editing gaffe on Friday's episode, with Danny Jones being introduced as Dean McCullough in a name caption \n\nAs Love Island alum Maura, 33, appeared on screen during the segment - instead of her name, she was unintentionally called fellow campmate Melvin Odoom, TV Presenter and DJ \n'Who proofs this before it goes on air?!?';\n'This is EXTREMELY poor #imaceleb';\n'This continuity editors had one job, get a grip and get it right!!! #ImACeleb';\n'it's from the 2 different camps lol';\nMeanwhile some other people didn't seem to catch the error and asked: 'What’s the issue'; 'what's wrong?'; 'What am I missing?'. \nIt comes after Danny and Dean, 32, bagged eight stars for camp as they braved the High Street Of Horrors in the latest Bushtucker Trial on Friday's episode - before one of them was faced with a huge twist.\nThe radio presenter and the singer finally ended the streak of poor performances that saw Dean shout 'I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!' not once but twice.\nAs voted for by the British public, the duo headed down to the Bushtucker Trial area to face the challenge, as Danny jokingly asked Dean: 'Fancy going shopping?'\n\nFans were confused how Danny could be mistaken for Dean (left) and Maura for Melvin (right) \n\nViewers of the show took to X after spotting the major mistake\nHorrified to learn they'd be joining them there, Maura and Rev Richard Coles also headed down to the Trial area for the day's Bushtucker Trial, not knowing what lay in store.\nFirst to arrive were Maura and Richard. They were greeted by Ant and Dec and asked how they were enjoying the Jungle Junkyard, Maura revealed: 'We've had a lovely time… I'm loving it!'\nWhile Richard joked: 'I'm really consumed with guilt!'\nAnt and Dec explained to the duo that as they successfully got a bed delivered to them from main camp yesterday, they won three portions of food for the junk food buffet. \nThey were also told the trial was their next opportunity to continue the charade, as they had to convince Danny and Dean that they had already taken part in The Deadly Department Store to try and win 2 stars for their dinner, but failed.\nMaura and Richard both got stuck into the pretence, as they covered one another in feathers and molasses and put on their best acting performance. \nDean and Danny stopped at the Grim Grocers first, where there were three stars on offer and they had three minutes to find them. \nWinning two stars for camp, they proceeded to the Electrifying Electrical store where they picked up a further two stars out of three, within the three minute time slot. \n\nIt comes after Danny and Dean, 32, bagged eight stars for camp as they braved the High Street Of Horrors in the latest Bushtucker Trial on Friday's episode\n\nWorking together, he and Danny picked up a further four stars, meaning they won eight in total\n\nAs Dean and Danny entered, Maura and Richard looked as downcast as the jungle weather, as they shared the news that they had won zero stars.\nBut that wasn't all, when asked what they faced in there, Richard panicked and described there were 'weird Australian birds', while Ant and Dec tried to keep a straight face.\nAnt and Dec then told Dean and Danny what they were due to face in their part of the Trial. \nThere were three shops, each containing a number of stars to win for camp - all they had to do was find them within the time allocated for their shopping spree.\nI’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here! continues nightly at 9pm on ITV1, STV and ITVX. \n\nI'M A CELEBRITY 2024: MEET THE ALL STAR LINE UP\n\nOTI MABUSE \n\nOti Mabuse has already two Strictly glitterballs under her belt\n\nOCCUPATION: Professional dancer\nFAMOUS FOR: Oti is best known for being a professional dancer on the British television series Strictly Come Dancing, which she won in 2019 and 2020. \n\nDANNY JONES \n\nDanny Jones is one of the bookies' favourites to win this year's I'm A Celeb\n\nOCCUPATION: McFly singer\nFAMOUS FOR: Danny is one of the lead vocalists and the lead guitarist for pop-rock band McFly. \nHe is also a coach on The Voice UK. \n\nBARRY MCGUIGAN \n\nFormer boxer Barry McGuigan is heading into the jungle\n\nOCCUPATION: Retired professional boxer\nFAMOUS FOR: Barry was nicknamed The Clones Cyclone and held the WBA and lineal featherweight titles from 1985 to 1986. \n\nGK Barry is a TikTok star who recently joined the ITV family on Loose Women\n\nOCCUPATION: TikTok star \nFAMOUS FOR: Grace is known for her comedic commentary on culture, lifestyle, and fashion.

He has said civil servants who work in the government — people who are not political appointees — should be loyal to the president, and not the institutions they work for.\n\nHe has long pushed for curtailing the independence of federal agencies and ending protections granted to thousands of people who work as federal employees — part of what Trump and his allies have called the \"Deep State.\"\n\n\"The notion of an independent agency — whether that's a flat-out independent agency like the FCC or a agency that has parts of it that view itself as independent, like the Department of Justice — we're planting a flag and saying we reject that notion completely,\" Vought said in an interview with NPR last year.\n\nFor the last few years, Vought has led the Center for Renewing America, which promoted Trump's agenda after he left the White House.

She is very pretty, actually,\" she said, continuing the banter.\n\nA clip of the same recently surfaced as DeGeneres reportedly fled the United States, following Trump's recent election victory. A source said the comedian, along with her wife, Portia de Rossi, have moved to Cotswolds— a picturesque region in South West England— and are refusing to set foot on American soil again.\n\nDeGeneres was an ardent supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris during her 2024 campaign, going so far as to reshare a 2018 interview in which she effused over just how great Harris is. \"There is nothing more powerful than a woman whose time has come!! I can't wait for Kamala Harris to be our next president,\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe comedian's reported departure wasn't a spur-of-the-moment choice. Sources close to TMZ said DeGeneres and de Rossi bought their UK home before the election results were in. But when Trump won, sources said they became 'very disillusioned' and decided to speed up their departure to 'get the hell out' of the country. DeGeneres reportedly put her money where her mouth was, politically speaking, donating $3,300 to Harris' campaign. Their new Cotswolds home puts them in a rarefied company. Celebrities such as the Beckhams, Kate Moss, and Elizabeth Hurley are known to reside there.\n\nEven British royalty stays close by, as King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla's Highgrove House is based across the border in neighboring Gloucestershire. The couple has already been spotted out and about enjoying local life, including visits to Jeremy Clarkson's establishment, The Farmer's Dog. The move represents a major career shift for DeGeneres, who recently stated that she was \"kicked out of show business\" in her Netflix special For Your Approval. The comedian had been engulfed in immense controversy over reports she ran a toxic work environment on the sets of her talk show.\n\nThis trend of celebrities relocating over political gambits isn't new. Actor Eva Longoria also splits her time now between Mexico and Spain for similar reasons relating to concerns over Trump's leadership. \"If he keeps his promises, it's going to be a scary place,\" Longoria said after Trump's 2016 victory. \"I am privileged,\" she admitted in a recent interview. \"I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren't so lucky. They are going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them,\" as per HuffPost.","summary":"DeGeneres joked after Trump made it known he saw her mom in the audience. &#34;I&#39;d like to offer her.

The Queen was very annoyed with this remark, which she viewed as ignorant and hurtful. She always defended Margaret to the hilt.\"\n\nPrincess Margaret, the Queen's only sibling, died in 2002 aged 71, after she had her fourth stroke in as many years. Her marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, frequently made headlines as both engaged in extramarital affairs before they separated in 1976 and divorced in 1978.\n\nThe Queen, though, always supported her younger sister despite the negative publicity aid the 18-year marriage. It’s not clear why Mr Trump made the alleged comment, however, but the remark in 2018 happened after The Crown on Netflix had portrayed Margaret as rebellious, volatile and resentful of her elder sister. The second season had not long aired on Netflix, and covered the first four years of Margaret's marriage to Lord Snowdon, a British photographer. \n\nBut Mr Trump, set to return for another tenure as US President, said the comments were \"totally false’.

Goodbye, boys. Perhaps, we will meet when you are adults. California Judge Juhas gave my ex-wife authority to castrate my son, James.” Younger wrote, referring to a treatment known as chemical castration. \n\nChemical castration involves the use of puberty-blocking drugs to stop sex hormone production. Unlike surgical castration, chemical castration does not remove organs. While the Department of Health and Human Services claims this practice is reversible, the long-term sexual side effects are unknown. Studies have also reported symptoms such as loss of bone density.\n\n“Let my story be a cautionary one for young men. Fathers have no rights to their children,” the dad added. \n\nThe long legal battle between Younger and Georgulas made headlines in 2018, when she sought a restraining order against Younger to block him from entering the twins’ school or telling other parents or students “that the gender of Luna is different than a girl named Luna,” the Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nGeorgulas insisted James, who was 6 at the time, identified as female and wished to wear dresses and be called “Luna” instead. \n\nYounger, however, said that his son behaved like a boy when they were together — and that the gender confusion was due to his mother’s influence. \n\nTexas courts initially granted both parents joint custody in 2019, however, Georgulas won sole custody of their twin children in 2021 — with the caveat that she must seek Younger’s consent for medical procedures related to James’ gender dysphoria, The Texan reported.\n\nThat all changed in 2022, when Georgulas relocated with James and his twin brother Jude to California to take advantage of the state’s “trans sanctuary” law that allows parents to pursue gender-affirming care for their transgender child without legal interference from other states.\n\nYounger petitioned the Texas Supreme Court to have his sons returned to Texas before California’s law went into effect, but the court denied his request.\n\nYounger’s case has progressed in the throes of a national culture war over gender-affirming care for minors.\n\nAs of this year, 25 states have banned medical treatments on children who identify as transgender, and a challenge to one of those states heads to the Supreme Court next month. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump vowed to take action on the issue at a campaign event in August, telling the crowd: “On Day 1, I will sign an executive order instructing every federal agency to cease the promotion of sex or gender transition at any age. \n\n“They’re not going to do it anymore.”","summary":"\"I lost all parental rights to my sons.

Rather, there are, in my estimation, six films that look all but assured of landing one of the category’s 10 slots. Alphabetically, they are: Neon’s Anora, A24’s The Brutalist, Focus’ Conclave, Netflix’s Emilia Pérez, Paramount’s September 5 and Universal’s Wicked. Let’s discuss them one by one.\n\n Anora, which won Cannes’ Palme d’Or, is Sean Baker’s portrait of a stripper-turned-sex worker from Brooklyn — played magnificently by breakout star Mikey Madison — whose life is jolted for the better, and then the worse, by a wealthy Russian client. This unusual variation of a Cinderella story, which blends drama, comedy and action, is tremendously entertaining and has gone over very well with critics and at the box office. But, some gripe, it drags a little during the pursuit portion. It doesn’t really seem to have anything larger to say about the world today (I suppose one could argue that it’s about economic inequality, but that feels like a bit of a stretch). And the Academy has never shown as much appreciation as film fest audiences and critics for Baker’s brilliant but quirky films, which heretofore have collectively landed just one nomination.\n\n In The Brutalist, for which 36-year-old Brady Corbet won Venice’s best director prize, a Hungarian architect (The Pianist Oscar winner Adrien Brody) who survived the Holocaust immigrates to the U.S., only to discover that the American dream is not all it’s cracked up to be. Seven years in the making, it’s a remarkably ambitious project featuring outstanding performances, stunning production design and VistaVision cinematography — and when Q&A attendees learn that it was shot in just 33 days and for less than $10 million, they literally gasp. The biggest hurdle that it will have to overcome is its runtime of three-and-a-half hours, including a 15-minute intermission — some voters and members of the public weren’t even willing to make that commitment for Martin Scorsese films available on streaming services, so will they do so for this? Plus, a common refrain from those who do check it out is that its first half is stronger than its second.\n\n Then, there’s Conclave from Edward Berger, the German director of the Oscar-winning 2022 version of All Quiet on the Western Front. It’s a riveting, edge-of-your-seat thriller about — believe it or not — the process of selecting a new pope. Adapted from Robert Harris’ 2016 novel, it is packed with juicy politicking, backstabbing and scandal — one person I know affectionately refers to it as The Real Housewives of the Vatican — and features a career-best performance by lead actor Ralph Fiennes as the Cardinal tasked with overseeing the proceedings, plus strong supporting appearances from Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini as others in his orbit. Enjoyment of the film can be undermined by hearing spoilers about its numerous shocking twists and turns — especially the one at the end, which is polarizing — so don’t wait too long to check it out.\n\n Emilia Pérez sounds off the wall — it’s a French director’s Spanish-language film about a Mexican cartel leader who transitions from male to female, and it also happens to be a musical — but its uniqueness has enchanted many since its premiere in Cannes, where its four principal stars (Karla Sofía Gascón, Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz) were jointly awarded the best actress prize. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea — Film Twitter has numerous issues with it (not that their opposition hurt the Oscar prospects of Green Book, Bohemian Rhapsody or CODA), and many people are transphobic (see: Donald Trump’s campaign ads ahead of the election, followed by his victory). But Academy members are overwhelmingly left-leaning, and for them, a vote for Emilia Pérez is a way to not only support a film that they admire but also to send a middle finger to an incoming administration that they abhor.\n\n This brings us to September 5, a film about ABC Sports’ coverage of the terrorist attack at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Plenty of people have registered their disagreement about my belief in the film’s prospects — many of whom haven’t seen the film and don’t speak with Academy members, and some of whom have been plainly antisemitic in their comments. The fact of the matter is that when Academy members see it, they love it — it’s a fastball right down the middle of their strike zone, not unlike, say, Spotlight, another film about journalists and journalism that featured an outstanding ensemble. Now, we just need to wait and see if Paramount is able to mobilize enough of them to check it out. They are certainly making every effort, with producer Sean Penn, star Peter Sarsgaard’s brother-in-law Jake Gyllenhaal, Jim McKay’s son/TV exec Sean McManus and others joining the film’s principal talent on the campaign trail.\n\n Then, there’s the Oscars’ great green hope: Wicked, the first installment of a two-part adaptation of the hit Broadway musical of the same name (part two is coming next year), which itself was inspired by The Wizard of Oz. The film was directed by Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. It will be released in theaters on Friday and — you’ll have to forgive me — it’s going to be popular. For that reason, the fine folks at the Academy and ABC are praying that it will be nominated for best picture, as that would certainly boost the telecast’s ratings. And the good news for them? The film is also excellent, somehow managing to appeal to both kids and adults, with perfectly cast stars, mind-blowing production value and tunes that have already stood the test of time. And, as Universal is happy to remind people, it plays a bit differently now than it did before the election, with a subtext about fascism that feels timely. But do voters based abroad know or care about the property?\n\n Those are your top six. As for the remaining four slots? There are three that strike me as pretty likely to make the cut.\n\n A24’s Sing Sing, the story of incarcerated men making art behind bars, reminds me of recent best picture winner CODA, in that it’s an arthouse film with a lot of heart and multiple Oscar-caliber performances (from Colman Domingo and Clarence Maclin) — and in that it probably faces more of an uphill climb to get nominated than it would face, should it get nominated, to actually win. The reason for this is that it came out a long time ago (July) and didn’t make a lot of money at the box office (less than $3 million worldwide), so it’s not necessarily high on voters’ watch-lists — but once voters get around to checking it out, they absolutely adore it.\n\n Twenty-four years after Ridley Scott’s original Gladiator, which went on to win best picture, comes its Paul Mescal-led sequel, Paramount’s Gladiator II. The new film strikes me as every bit as entertaining and well-made; has been reviewed comparably (on Rotten Tomatoes the first is at 80 percent and the second is at 75 percent); and seems poised to be a similarly giant blockbuster (the first grossed nearly $500 million worldwide). It’s hard to imagine that the first would win, but the second, in an era with twice as many best picture slots, would not even be nominated.\n\n Speaking of sequels in the race, there’s also Warners’ Dune: Part Two, which comes three years after Dune, which itself was nominated for best picture. Denis Villeneuve’s sequel made a big impression (it’s at 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and a lot of money (it’s 2024’s fourth biggest hit). But it came out way back in March, its principal talent is largely promoting other films, and the trilogy’s third installment is still to come, so it’s not a complete certainty.\n\n That leaves 11 titles battling it out for the last slot.\n\n MUBI’s The Substance is a love-it-or-hate-it horror dramedy that is a biting sendup of Hollywood. Made on a mid-range budget ($17.5 million) and propelled by Demi Moore’s Oscar-worthy performance, it has exceeded all expectations at the box office (it’s coming up on the $70 million mark). It could end up being this year’s Saltburn — perhaps a bit too edgy for some Academy members — but I suspect that enough love it for it to have a real shot.\n\n Searchlight, meanwhile, comes to the race with two legit contenders, A Real Pain and A Complete Unknown. I’ve learned over the years to think twice before betting against a “Holocaust movie” with the Academy, and while that’s a reductive way of describing A Real Pain, which is also very funny, I think the point stands. A Complete Unknown, meanwhile, is a fairly conventionally-structured but highly-engaging biopic built around a stunning lead performance from Timothée Chalamet as Bob Dylan.\n\n Only three animated features have ever been nominated for best picture, none since 2010’s Toy Story 3, but two have a real shot this year: Universal/DreamWorks’s The Wild Robot and Disney/Pixar’s Inside Out 2. Inside Out 2 made an absolute fortune (its $1.7 billion worldwide gross is 2024’s highest), and its backers emphasize how its discussion of emotions has helped children and adults during a tumultuous time. The Wild Robot, which comes along in the 30th year of DreamWorks, has generated much less money ($309 million) but even more enthusiasm from critics and audiences (it’s at 98 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with both). Fun fact: 2015’s Inside Out was not nominated for best picture, but that was at a time when there could have been anywhere from five to 10 nominees, and there wound up being eight, so we can’t know if it might have finished ninth or tenth.\n\n Then there’s a handful of movies that aren’t for everyone, but, if championed by critics groups, as may well happen, might need to be taken more seriously. These include Amazon/MGM’s Nickel Boys, the feature directorial debut of the Malickian filmmaker RaMell Ross; Janus/Sideshow’s All We Imagine as Light, which won Cannes’ second-place prize; Apple’s Blitz, the latest from 12 Years a Slave helmer Steve McQueen; and two from Sony Classics, I’m Still Here, a haunting Brazilian film, and The Room Next Door, Pedro Almodóvar’s first English-language feature, which won Venice’s top prize.\n\n Lastly, there’s a bit of a question mark in Warners’ Juror No. 2, which might be the last film from the master Clint Eastwood, who is 94. The studio didn’t seem to have high hopes for the film, but it’s at 93 percent with critics and 91 percent with audiences on Rotten Tomatoes; the studio, having faced criticism for not doing right by a filmmaker who has made it a ton of money, is now scrambling to establish a campaign; and if Eastwood is able and willing to offer a few indications that awards recognition for the film would mean something to him, perhaps a Hail Mary could be completed.\n\n Best director \n\n For better or worse, the Academy’s directors branch marches to its own beat, as demonstrated in recent years by the people it nominated (a lot of non-American filmmakers) and didn’t (e.g. Barbie’s Greta Gerwig).\n\n This cycle, it’s hard to imagine that the branch will not bestow first best director noms on Audiard (Emilia Pérez), Corbet (The Brutalist), Berger (Conclave) and Baker (Anora). If that’s correct, then who gets the last slot? I would assume either Gladiator II’s Scott — who is 86, five years older than the current record-holder of oldest nominee, Scorsese — or Dune: Part Two’s Villeneuve, both of whom oversaw massive films, and both of whom were nominated for those films’ prior installments.\n\n But there are a number of other people who stand a shot. Mohammad Rasoulof had to flee Iran because The Seed of the Sacred Fig displeased the reigning regime, so I could see the branch rallying behind him. For I’m Still Here, Brazilian Walter Salles, an auteur whose Central Station won the best international feature Oscar 25 years ago, also strikes me as their cup of tea. Swiss-born Tim Fehlbaum helmed September 5 and then there’s the aforementioned Eastwood.\n\n There’s also a trio of female filmmakers in contention who most voters have not heard of, but whose films they are responding to: The Substance’s Coralie Fargeat, Babygirl’s Halina Reijn and All We Imagine as Light’s Payal Kapadia.\n\n Finally, the directors branch doesn’t usually embrace glossy productions like Wicked, but if its box office is as impressive as its reviews, as it is likely to be, they may have to reconsider that policy for Chu.\n\n Best actor \n\n Three contenders appear to be slam-dunks: Conclave’s Fiennes (who has somehow never won an Oscar), The Brutalist’s Brody (who holds the record for the youngest person ever to win in this category — he was 29 when he won for 2002’s The Pianist) and A Complete Unknown’s Chalamet (who would break Brody’s record by a few months if he were to win).\n\n Right on their heels, I believe, is Sing Sing’s Domingo, a nominee last year for Rustin, who would become the first person nominated in the category in consecutive years since Denzel Washington seven and eight years ago.\n\n The fight is for the fifth slot. My gut feeling at the moment is that it will go to Sebastian Stan for one of his two terrific 2024 transformations, which have blown away fellow actors: one into a young Trump in Briarcliff/Rich Spirit’s The Apprentice and the other, for which he received Berlin’s best actor prize, into a man with the facial condition neurofibromatosis in A24’s A Different Man. He can only be nominated for one, and his biggest impediment to a nom may be his supporters splitting down the middle.\n\n Several past nominees seem to have a real shot: Mescal, a nominee two years ago for Aftersun, ably carries Gladiator II, and why wouldn’t he be able to ride its popularity to a nom, given that Russell Crowe won this award for the original Gladiator? Jude Law is terrific as a grizzled cop in Vertical’s The Order, but it remains to be seen if enough voters have seen the film. And Jesse Eisenberg is very good as the lead of A Real Pain, which he also wrote and directed.\n\n A number of well-known actors are doing the rounds hoping to land the first nom of their career. Among them: Daniel Craig, who gives as bold and daring a performance as he ever has onscreen in A24’s Queer, though the movie is very long and pretty weird, which could work against him; John David Washington for Netflix’s The Piano Lesson; and Richard Gere, for his performance as a cranky filmmaker giving one last interview in Oh, Canada.\n\n And then there’s the wild card: Joaquin Phoenix, who won this award five years ago for Joker and is now eligible for Warners’ Joker: Folie à Deux, which has been critically and commercially savaged, but not through any fault of his. He’s still pretty mesmerizing in the part.\n\n Best actress \n\n The three contenders with the most obvious support are Angelina Jolie, a winner 25 years ago in the supporting actress category, who has made a very strong case for a second statuette for her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas in Netflix’s Maria (if Renée Zellweger could win a lead acting Oscar for Judy after having won a supporting Oscar years earlier, why couldn’t Angelina win for this one, which gets a standing ovation at every screening?); Anora‘s 25-year-old Madison, who is this year’s ingenue who everyone adores; and Sofía Gascón, who, many are shocked to discover, plays two parts very impressively in Emilia Pérez, and who would be the first openly trans person ever nominated for an acting award.\n\n Beyond that trio, there are a bunch of admired veterans in the running, including Moore, who has never been nominated, for The Substance; past winners Nicole Kidman for a gutsy turn in A24’s Babygirl and Tilda Swinton for the juicier of two parts in The Room Next Door; past nominees Marianne Jean-Baptiste, for skillfully bringing to life a character who is pretty hard to warm up to in Bleecker Street’s Hard Truths, and 95-year-old June Squibb for Magnolia’s charming Thelma; and Brazilian Fernanda Torres, daughter of past nominee Fernanda Montenegro, who carries I’m Still Here.\n\n But they will have to fend off the younger set, such as four-time past nominee Saoirse Ronan for her portrayal of an alcoholic in Sony Classics’ The Outrun; Harriet nominee Erivo for Wicked; Zendaya for her first real lead in a film, in Amazon/MGM’s Challengers; and Norwegian rising star Renate Reinsve, who you may remember from The Worst Person in the World and/or Presumed Innocent, and who is great in IFC’s Armand.\n\n The long shot who is really working it at the moment: Pamela Anderson for Roadside’s The Last Showgirl. What a story it would be if the former Baywatch lifeguard were to sneak in.\n\n Best supporting actor \n\n The two who you can take to the bank are Gladiator II’s Denzel Washington, a two-time past winner, and The Brutalist’s Guy Pearce, one of the finest actors who has never been nominated. After that, Kieran Culkin would seem to stand a strong shot for A Real Pain, in which he plays a variation of the lovably wacky character who he has played in numerous other projects, most notably Succession.\n\n Voters may find it impossible to resist Sing Sing’s Maclin, a man who was once incarcerated and in this film masterfully plays a man who is incarcerated. Culkin’s former Succession co-star Jeremy Strong is eerily great as Roy Cohn in The Apprentice.\n\n But either of those two could be vulnerable to three-time past nominee Edward Norton, whose Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown is unlike any other character he has previously played, or to one — or more — of the scene-stealers from Conclave (Tucci and Lithgow, both past nominees), Anora (Russians Yura Borisov and Mark Eydelshteyn) and September 5 (Sarsgaard and John Magaro, both great character actors who have never been nominated).\n\n Best supporting actress \n\n I don’t think any category has as clear a frontrunner as this one does in Saldaña, who draws upon her background as a Spanish speaker, dancer and action star to give the performance of a lifetime in Emilia Pérez.\n\n Beyond her, my guess is that coattails will boost the fine work of Conclave’s Rossellini (her mother Ingrid Bergman won in this category for another part with little dialogue, in Murder on the Orient Express), Wicked’s standout Grande and Saldaña’s co-star Gomez.\n\n Felicity Jones struck me as very impressive in The Brutalist, but she is exclusively in its second half, which some will not get to, and which those who do get to it often like less than the first half. So she will have to fend off Ronan for Blitz and scene-stealers from The Piano Lesson (Danielle Deadwyler, the film’s clear standout); The Substance (Margaret Qualley, who goes toe-to-toe — or should I say back-to-back — with Moore); September 5 (German actress Leonie Benesch, so good last year, as well, in The Teacher’s Lounge); Focus’ Dìdi (veteran Joan Chen); and A Complete Unknown (Monica Barbaro, magnetic as Joan Baez).\n\n Best adapted screenplay \n\n Conclave, an adaptation of a bestselling novel, is in. I assume that Emilia Pérez, which was loosely adapted from a 2018 novel, is also in, although musicals have a spotty track record in the screenplay categories, which is why I am not totally certain about its prospects and even less confident about Wicked’s.\n\n The scripts for the first Gladiator and Dune films were both nominated, so one has to take seriously the prospects for the scripts for their sequels. Sing Sing has passionate supporters, so I suspect it will make the cut. But I wouldn’t rule out I’m Still Here or Nickel Boys, which are comparably powerful.\n\n Only nine animated films have ever been nominated in either screenplay category, and only two in this one, so I’m skeptical that it will happen this year, but it could for The Wild Robot and/or Inside Out 2. (Inside Out was nominated for best original screenplay.)\n\n Academy members love Almodóvar, but I’m not sure that his work translates, in The Room Next Door, quite as effectively as his prior films that were done in Spanish, and besides, he has only once been nominated for a script (he won best original screenplay for Talk to Her).\n\n Lastly, the screenplays for the last two August Wilson adaptations — Fences and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom — got nominated, so don’t count out The Piano Lesson’s.\n\n Best original screenplay \n\n Anora is in, which is nice, overdue news for fans of Baker. The Brutalist is tremendously creative, as well, and I can’t imagine it not being among the finalists.\n\n After that? The writers branch has a long history of embracing smart, witty, dialogue-heavy scripts with lots of characters, which bodes well for September 5, A Real Pain and Saturday Night.\n\n There are also precedents for something like the sexually risqué Babygirl (see: Fatal Attraction, nominated in adapted, and Tár, in original), the political dark-comedy The Apprentice (Vice and Don’t Look Up, nominated in original) and the non-English-language All We Imagine as Light, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig (two of last year’s five original screenplay nominees were in another language).\n\n But the branch, in recent years, has also increasingly been willing to embrace truly original and frankly weird stuff — think Yorgos Lanthimos’s films, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Triangle of Sadness and May December — which is why I think The Substance should not be underestimated.\n\n Best international feature \n\n Basically, the question in this category is which four films will have the privilege of being runners-up to France’s Emilia Pérez.\n\n I’ve watched quite a few of this year’s 85 submissions — and still need to watch many more — but the ones that have received widespread attention already, and that have come up most often in conversation with voters, include the aforementioned I’m Still Here (Brazil), The Seed of the Sacred Fig (Germany, by way of Iran), Armand (Norway), Mubi’s Dahomey (Senegal), Netflix’s In Her Place (Chile), Focus’ Touch (Iceland), Sony Classics’ Kneecap (Ireland) and Sideshow/Janus’ Flow (Latvia).\n\n Others that also have vocal fans include Oscilloscope’s Universal Language (Canada), Mubi’s The Girl with the Needle (Denmark), Greenwich’s Come Closer (Israel), Metrograph’s Santosh (United Kingdom) and the still-seeking-distribution Lost Ladies (India) and Waves (Czech Republic).\n\n Best documentary feature \n\n The doc branch marches to its own beat. Last year, it selected as its nominees five non-English-language titles, while also passing, as it has done repeatedly in recent years, on acclaimed and popular celeb-centric docs (American Symphony and Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie).\n\n This year? There appears to be just one sure-thing: Nat Geo’s Sugarcane, which has been named a finalist for the highest honor of every important doc community group, including the Cinema Eye Honors, DOC NYC, IDA, Critics Choice Documentary Awards and, if I may say so, SCAD Savannah Film Festival.\n\n Others that have performed notably well with these precursor groups, and appear to be on course to make the doc branch’s shortlist of 15, include Netflix’s Daughters (CCDA, CEH, DNYC, SCAD), The Remarkable Life of Ibelin (CCDA, DNYC, IDA) and Will & Harper (CCDA, DNYC, SCAD); Kino Lorber’s Soundtrack to a Coup d’Etat (CEH, DNYC, IDA); MTV’s Black Box Diaries (CEH, DNYC, IDA, SCAD); Dahomey (CEH, DNYC, IDA); the self-distributed No Other Land (CEH, DNYC, IDA); Picturehouse’s Porcelain War (DNYC, SCAD); Level Ground’s Union (DNYC, SCAD), the self-distributed Queendom (DNYC, IDA); Magnolia’s Ernest Cole: Lost and Found (DNYC, IDA); Warners’ Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story (CCDA, SCAD); and Focus’ Piece by Piece (CCDA, SCAD).\n\n That brings us to 14.\n\n In conversations with doc branch members this season, I have found that the celeb factor does not seem to be an impediment to the prospects of Will & Harper and Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, but can it also be overcome by other films? Worthy options include Greenwich’s Carville: Winning Is Everything, Stupid (SCAD), Amazon/MGM’s I Am: Celine Dion, Disney’s Music by John Williams (CCDA), MTV’s ¡Casa Bonita Mi Amor! and two titles from R.J. Cutler, Disney’s Elton John: Never Too Late, which he directed with John’s husband David Furnish, and Netflix’s Martha.\n\n The Benjamin Netanyahu exposé The Bibi Files (DNYC), though still seeking U.S. distribution, is a late-breaking and über-timely doc that counts Oscar winner Alex Gibney as a producer, and should not be underestimated. Other titles that may also benefit from tackling things that are in the news include Submarine’s Separated and War Game; SDG Releasing’s controversial Am I Racist?; the self-distributed Bad Faith, Zurawski v Texas, Invisible Nation, October H8te: The Fight for the Soul of America and Gonzo for Democracy.\n\n A few additional things to consider: A number of great docs that received Emmy recognition are also eligible for Oscar recognition, even if their distributors are downplaying them, including Netflix’s The Greatest Night in Pop (CCDA), Nat Geo’s Jim Henson Idea Man (CCDA) and Apple’s Girls State. Showbiz-related docs may have a particular appeal, and options — in addition to Will & Harper, Super/Man, The Greatest Night in Pop and Jim Henson — include Merchant Ivory, William Shatner: You Can Call Me Bill, Happy Clothes: A Film about Patricia Field and Remembering Gene Wilder. Netflix’s Skywalkers: A Love Story, a doc about the most daring adventurers since those featured in Oscar winner Free Solo, has some very passionate supporters in the branch and could be a dark horse.\n\n Best animated feature \n\n By opening up voting to determine the animated feature shortlist and nominations to all Academy members who wish to participate, rather than just the members of the animation branch (formerly the short films/feature animation branch), the Academy theoretically has boosted the prospects for high-profile studio films over low-profile indies.\n\n That’s not particularly relevant to studio films like Inside Out 2, The Wild Robot and Netflix’s Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, as they start out with plenty of support. It might help some of the other studio films in the race, like Disney’s Moana 2 and Universal/Dreamworks’s Kung Fu Panda 4. But it remains to be seen if/how it will impact some of the great indie animated films that are eligible, including Flow and IFC’s Memoir of a Snail.\n\n The most interesting case is Piece by Piece. It’s very well done and entertaining — but filmmaker Morgan Neville is new to animation, it’s a celebrity-centric film and 2014’s The Lego Movie, probably the closest thing to Piece by Piece in terms of style of animation, was infamously snubbed.

The first installment of Wicked has no original songs, but Emilia Pérez has two (Camille and Clement Ducol’s “El Mal,” co-written with Audiard and performed by Saldaña, and “Mi Camino,” performed by Gomez, both of which seem likely to be nominated), as does Moana 2 (“Beyond” being a better bet than “Can I Get a Chee Hoo?”).\n\n Apart from those, I’d keep a close eye on tunes from Elton John (“Never Too Late” from Elton John: Never Too Late), a winner in this category in 1995 and 2020; Pharrell Williams (“Piece by Piece” from Piece by Piece); Maren Morris (“Kiss the Sky” from The Wild Robot); and Kristen Wiig (“Harper and Will Go West” from Will & Harper).\n\n And never, ever bet against Diane Warren, even for a song in a movie that no one you know has actually seen. This year, she’s up for “The Journey” from Netflix’s The Six Triple Eight.\n\n Below-the-line categories \n\n Few are the craft and technical categories that won’t include Wicked, Gladiator II and Dune: Part Two.

But he added that there are also possible “safety concerns related to systemic fluoride exposure,” including reductions in IQ. While some studies have suggested potential links, the research is considered preliminary and far from definitive. The American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support the use of fluoridated water, calling it one of the top 10 public health achievements of the past century. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%. Once its benefits were proven, fluoride was also added to toothpaste and some mouthwashes. Dentists began giving kids fluoride treatments. Some communities are restoring fluoride to their water systems after seeing a rise in children’s cavities. The anti-fluoride drumbeat has become louder in recent years. Communities have increasingly opted out of adding it to water, citing possible health risks. There are ongoing, active investigations about safe levels of fluoride exposure. “Rates of tooth decay are absolutely a concern,” said Dr. Bruce Lanphear, a professor of health sciences at Simon Fraser University in Canada. “But science is evolving. There’s growing evidence suggesting that fluoride may not be as safe as previously thought.” Lanphear is an author of a 2019 study published in JAMA Pediatrics that found that mothers who drank fluoridated water while they were pregnant were more likely to have children with lower IQ levels. He and his colleagues concluded that pregnant women may want to avoid fluoride, but stopped short of advocating for its removal from water systems. About 70% of community water systems in Florida receive fluoridated water, according to the surgeon general’s release. “It is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation,” Ladapo said in the release. Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who tracks illnesses on her website, Your Local Epidemiologist, reacted to Ladapo’s announcement Friday. “Replacing community good for individualism is a slippery slope,” she said. Ladapo has been previously criticized for going against basic public health measures. Pediatricians were enraged in February, for example, when Ladapo left the decision on whether to quarantine children amid a massive measles outbreak to parents. He has questioned the effectiveness of Covid vaccines and threatened criminal charges against TV stations in Florida that aired an ad supporting the state’s abortion rights ballot measure until a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against him. He’s rumored to be on a list of people who could play a major health role in the next administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, has said he would advise against fluoride being added to U.S​. water systems. Calls for reintroducing fluoride Despite fluoride skeptics, some communities are actively working to get the mineral back into their water supply. When residents of Buffalo, New York, realized in January 2023 that fluoride had been missing from their water supply since 2015 — uncovered by a local investigative reporter — demand to reinstate the cavity-fighting mineral to their drinking water was swift. Parents said their kids’ teeth were full of cavities despite drinking and brushing regularly with what they thought for years was fluoridated water. “There’s many stories of young children who have ended up in (the) hospital needing emergency dental surgery,” Robert Corp, a lawyer who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Buffalo parents, told NBC affiliate WGRZ. City leaders acted. Less than two years later, in late September, fluoride once again flowed from Buffalo taps. Other cities, such as Abilene, Kansas, and McVille, North Dakota, have done the same, according to the American Dental Association. ‘Helping the most vulnerable’ According to the CDC, kids in lower-income families have nearly three times higher rates of untreated cavities compared to children in higher-income families. There are several reasons. Just 1 in 3 dentists in the U.S. treat Medicaid patients. And nearly half of U.S. kids do not receive regular dental care, according to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, part of the National Institutes of Health. Adding fluoride to water systems “mitigates the impact of disparities in access to dental care,” said Jetelina, the epidemiologist. “This is one of the beauties of public health — a mainly invisible population intervention, helping the most vulnerable.” Still, the scrutiny continues. In September, a federal judge in California ruled that even though he couldn’t conclude with certainty that fluoridated water was a danger to public health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should strengthen water fluoridation regulations. Another report stemming from that decision, looking specifically at kids’ IQ levels, is expected early next year.","summary":"On Friday, Florida’s Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced that communities in the state shouldn’t add fluoride to drinking water because of what he called the “neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fluoride-florida-surgeon-general-drinking-water-rcna180630","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-11/241122-fluoride-ch-1508-34b618.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:31:48","author":"Erika Edwards","authors":["Erika Edwards"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":266603126,"title":"Letters: Build relationships | Whatever it takes | Americans unite | Taking credit | Voters’ choice | Sound healing","text":"Build relationships with\nmembers of Congress\n\nRe: “There’s time for Lee to add to her legacy” (Page A6, Nov. 5).\n\nIt was encouraging that the author of ‘the letter gave recognition to outgoing Rep.

Recognizing the consequences of income inequality on quality of life, he has supported expanding the Child Tax Credit by co-sponsoring the American Family Act (HR 3899) and voted in favor of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act (HR 7024).\n\nBut we can’t take such altruistic values of our representatives for granted.

You present all information and debate in a peaceful way to influence people and bring changes, not that you walk away from people you don’t agree with. … But when Trump dims the beacon of freedom and democracy in this country, people like me have nowhere to go. That was the moment I realized that I have to fight for America.”\n\nThe Constitution speaks for all Americans in its “We the People of the United States” preamble. We must act in willful solidarity to use the Constitution to defend ourselves.\n\nBob Smithfield\n\nTrump will take credit\nfor Democrats’ economy\n\nHere we go again. In 2008 Barack Obama inherited one of the worst economic disasters in American history from the previous Republican administration and turned it into six straight years of record employment and record stock market gains. Donald Trump inherited that economy and his followers gave him the credit for it. That is why the first two years of Trump are looked at so fondly by his followers. By Trump’s third year, the economy started to fall, his last year was a disaster, and worldwide inflation would have happened even if Trump had been reelected in 2020.\n\nNow, Joe Biden has brought us to an economy that is the envy of the world and it appears that Trump will, again, take credit for it as Biden’s policies, the Infrastructure Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act and the PACT Act pay off for the next 10 years.\n\nFrank Grygus\n\nVoters, not Harris or\nBiden, chose this fate\n\nBy any objective traditional metric, per Mitt Romney’s campaign manager, in the span of 107 days, Vice President Harris ran a masterful, organized, disciplined campaign, complete with thoroughly documented, well-researched policy solutions. Yet much of the post-election narrative has been centered around finding fault with Harris’ campaign or President Biden.\n\nThese narratives are not only specious but they reflect a desire among many to simply not accept the results as a choice that was made. During the campaign, a clear distinction was made on which path each candidate would take in leading the nation on health care (expand or eliminate the ACA), climate (promote clean energy or expand drilling), NATO (support for Ukraine), immigration (path to citizenship versus mass deportation), and the economy (consumer protections or financial deregulation). Whatever happens next won’t be anyone’s fault, it will simply be the desired outcome of the choice made by the majority.\n\nBarry Gardin\n\nSound healing a door\nto self-discovery, health\n\nIn a world filled with noise and distractions, the transformative power of sound healing often goes unnoticed. My journey with it began during a debilitating arm and shoulder injury that left me unable to play the piano, which devastated me as a pianist and teacher.\n\nTraditional treatments provided little relief, leading me to sound healing — a gentle practice using vibrational frequencies for relaxation and healing. Immersing myself in the soothing sounds of singing bowls and tuning forks felt like a spa day for my soul. This practice eased my physical discomfort and helped me confront long-buried traumas, with self-compassion.\n\nI discovered that our bodies and emotions are deeply connected; healing one can facilitate the healing of the other. I encourage anyone seeking healing to explore the power of sound. Embracing this practice can lead to profound self-discovery and ultimately guide us toward consciousness, creativity and reclaiming our personal sovereignty.\n\nKadie Kelly","summary":"East Bay Times Letters to the Editor for Nov. 24,. 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/22/letters-1942/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EBT-L-4THPARADE-0705-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:30:59","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":266604562,"title":"Judge Merchan and Alvin Bragg must end the Trump hush-money case witch hunt — for the good of the country","text":"Judge Juan Merchan and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg just can’t give up their lawfare against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nMerchan on Friday punted yet again on the question of just how he’s going to handle the Trump conviction, after a Tuesday filing from Bragg suggested — incredibly — that the judge delay sentencing until after Trump’s term ends.\n\nThe judge has now ordered Trump’s legal team and Bragg to file arguments in December on whether the case should be tossed. \n\nUnacceptable. \n\nThe election was weeks ago.

For, in a real-life Hollywood horror story, Rust ceased production after a prop gun held by Baldwin – the lead character – went off on October 21, 2021, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. A live round had somehow got into the vintage Colt revolver Baldwin was holding.\n\nHutchins, 42, had been demonstrating how she wanted him to hold the weapon when it went off, fatally shooting her in the chest.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath Baldwin said he was grief stricken but denied responsibility.\n\nIn a TV interview soon afterwards he said: ‘I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don’t say that lightly.’ He added: ‘I have dreams about this constantly now. I go through my day, and I make it through the day. Then I collapse at the end of the day. Emotionally, I collapse.’ \n\nBaldwin also insisted: ‘I couldn’t give a s*** about my career any more.’ Asked: ‘Is it over?’ He replied: ‘Well it could be.’\n\nBut three years on – with Rust’s armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed serving 18 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter and Baldwin cleared of the same charge after his trial collapsed in July on a technicality after the prosecution withheld potentially relevant evidence – the actor has no intention of retiring from showbusiness, which has made him a fortune.\n\nInstead, he is in the throes of a multi-pronged attempt to relaunch his career.\n\nHe has a new slot on legendary US comedy show Saturday Night Live, a reality TV show featuring himself, his wife Hilaria and their seven children, and is about to receive a ‘lifetime achievement’ in cinema award.\n\nHe is, though, far from forgiven by Hutchins’ family and colleagues, who are appalled that he should do all this while still being sued over events on the set of Rust.\n\nFor the accidental shooting has left a complicated legacy when it comes to Ukrainian-born Hutchins and her family.\n\nDirector Joel Souza said this week that Hutchins’ widower Matthew and son Andros, now 12, will benefit financially from any success that the film has, and was one of the reasons they wanted to finish and release Rust.\n\nMelina Spadone, representative for Rust Movie Productions, said: ‘The decision to complete Rust was made with the full support of Halyna’s family.’\n\nTheir argument is that the finished film honours Hutchins’ work.\n\nThat’s all very well, but despite these claims Matthew Hutchins was not in Poland for the premiere.\n\nHe is still waiting for the financial payment agreed when he settled a wrongful death suit with Baldwin and the film’s backers – and the suit may actually be reactivated and come to trial, more of which later.\n\nMeanwhile Hutchins’ mother, Olga Solovey, who lives in Ukraine, is among those still pursuing Baldwin.\n\nShe expressed her disgust this week, saying: ‘It was always my hope to meet my daughter in Poland to watch her work come alive on screen. Unfortunately, that was ripped away from me when Alec Baldwin discharged his gun and killed my daughter.\n\n‘Alec Baldwin continues to increase my pain with his refusal to apologise to me and his refusal to take responsibility for her death.\n\n‘Instead, he seeks to unjustly profit from his killing of my daughter. That is the reason why I refuse to attend the festival for the promotion of Rust, especially now when there is still no justice for my daughter.’\n\nHer lawyer Gloria Allred added: ‘Even though Mr Baldwin discharged the gun that killed Halyna, he has never called them to apologise. Even worse, he argued, through his attorneys, that Halyna was emotionally distant from her family in Ukraine. That is false, hurtful and insulting.\n\n‘Now, a decision has been made to promote Rust to buyers in order to make a profit for Alec Baldwin and others that had a role in Halyna’s death.’\n\nThell Reed, father of armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who is seven months into her prison sentence, told the Mail: ‘They’re trying to make money, that’s all they care about.’ He adds: ‘People will go see it because of what happened.’\n\nBaldwin faces four civil suits, three of which are being handled in New Mexico, where the accident happened in a church which was being used for filming.\n\nOne is a negligence lawsuit brought by Halyna’s mother, her father Anatolii Androsovych, her sister Svetlana Zemko and script supervisor Mamie Mitchell, who was standing next to Hutchins at the time. Lawyers for the family confirmed the case is ongoing.\n\nThe second suit is from Hutchins’ widower Matthew, accusing Baldwin of reckless conduct while handling the gun and the Rust production of cost-cutting measures that put the crew in danger.\n\nWhile the suit seemed to have been resolved by a settlement in 2022, earlier this year Matthew Hutchins’ lawyers said in a court filing that the payments had not been made by June 2023, the agreed date. The delayed payment appears to be due to the decision by the New Mexico authorities not to give Rust a $1.6 million (£1.2 million) tax break.\n\nThe widower’s lawyer, Brian Panish, has said that the case could still go to trial and that he wants to hold Baldwin ‘accountable for his actions in the senseless death of Halyna Hutchins’.\n\nThe third New Mexico case is from three members of the Rust crew: Ross Addiego, the dolly operator, Doran Curtin, the set costumer, and Reese Price, the key grip [responsible for equipment]. They claim they suffered anxiety and post-traumatic stress as they were in the church when Halyna Hutchins was killed.\n\nThe fourth negligence lawsuit was filed by Rust gaffer [chief lighting technician], Serge Svetnoy, who held her as she died.\n\nIn the Svetnoy case, filed in Los Angeles, Baldwin’s lawyers argue that the matter be adjourned due to the impending appeal in the criminal case. Because that case against Baldwin may yet not be resolved.\n\nIt was dramatically dismissed on July 12 – two days into the trial –after the judge ruled prosecutors mishandled evidence. The trial judge then rejected a request from prosecutors late last month to overturn that decision.\n\nBut court documents seen by the Daily Mail show that Baldwin’s lawyers claim the Santa Fe district attorney ‘is not done trying to prosecute Baldwin’ for the shooting of Halyna Hutchins.\n\nThe District Attorney vowed to appeal to a higher court, meaning that the case grinds on.\n\nKari Morrissey, the special prosecutor who brought the case, declined to comment but in court filings has strenuously defended the way Baldwin was prosecuted.\n\nBaldwin’s lawyers have angrily fired back, claiming she ‘buried evidence’ and had the ‘audacity’ to continue the case.\n\nThe actor’s lawyer Alex Spiro demanded that the state of New Mexico even cover Baldwin’s legal fees as the conduct of the prosecution was so egregious.\n\nMeanwhile the family of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed say she has been ‘scapegoated’ over the killing. Her father Thell said: ‘She shouldn’t be in jail in the first place. She never checked the guns or anything. They never called her to the set. It’s crazy.\n\n‘I don’t think anyone should be in jail. They turned Alec Baldwin loose. They should turn my daughter loose.’\n\nIn these circumstances many may think it’s extraordinary that Baldwin wants to return to the spotlight.\n\nNow 66, Baldwin started out as one of three handsome acting brothers, the others being Billy and Stephen. He rose to fame through macho roles in films like Working Girl and The Hunt for Red October.\n\nOff-screen he had a fiery marriage to actress Kim Basinger, and became infamous when, following a vicious seven-year custody battle over their daughter Ireland, he left a voicemail message for her calling the girl ‘a rude, thoughtless little pig’ for avoiding his phone calls. Revealing he wasn’t sure if she was 11 or 12, he added: ‘You [Ireland] don’t have the brains or the decency as a human being.’\n\nYears later, Ireland checked into rehab for ‘emotional trauma’.\n\nMore recently, Baldwin had huge success with the TV show 30 Rock and was acclaimed for his portrayal of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live from 2017 to 2020.\n\nLast Saturday he was on the show again portraying RFK Jr, Donald Trump’s new health supremo. There was an instant backlash over that performance which mimicked the controversial politician’s raspy voice, the result of a vocal condition called spasmodic dysphonia.\n\nOne critic wrote: ‘SNL actually brought back Alec Baldwin… after he killed a woman… to do the worst possible impersonation of RFK Jr. This is what they’re reduced to.’\n\nIt remains to be seen if his take on RFK will become a running joke on the show.\n\nBaldwin’s biggest professional step back into the spotlight is not being taken alone, however, but with wife Hilaria in a family reality TV show called The Baldwins.\n\nHe met yoga instructor Hilaria in a restaurant in 2012 when she caught his eye and winked at him. They were married the same year and have seven children aged between ten and one.\n\nThe cameras began rolling on The Baldwins – to be shown on cable network TLC – earlier this year, even before he had faced manslaughter charges. A trailer suggests it will depict the chaos of life in the big family at their New York home. They’ve also been seen filming an outdoor cook-outs in The Hamptons.\n\nHilaria – controversial for adopting a Spanish persona, despite being raised plain Hillary in Boston, by American parents – seems to have been instrumental in putting the family on the screen.\n\nAt one time she was interested in joining the cast of The Real Housewives of New York before she switched her attention to a proposal for her own show. Insiders say The Baldwins, out in January, pitches Alec as the doting older dad, the butt of ‘amusing’ jokes about how out of control his brood are, and how he struggles to keep up with them.\n\nMany, though, disapprove of the move. One online critic wrote: ‘If he had any decency he would disappear permanently after what he did. Instead he flaunts his family in a show after destroying a different family.’\n\nOthers are critical of Hilaria calling her: ‘Thirstier (for attention) than a camel in the Sahara and as Spanish as your average Bostonian.’\n\nYou certainly can’t just blame Hilaria for Baldwin’s return to the spotlight, though. The Mail has learned he is flying to Italy this weekend to pick up an award.\n\nOrganisers say he is due to arrive in Turin on Sunday, without his family. He will be handed the Stella della Mole lifetime award at the Torino Film Festival on Monday. He’s also going to give a press conference.\n\nHe’ll have lots to say – Alec Baldwin always does. But whether that will include an apology to the family and colleagues of the woman who was shot by the gun which was in his hand is much less of a certainty.","summary":"Three years on and Baldwin has no intention of retiring from showbusiness, which has made him a fortune and is instead in the throes of a multi-pronged attempt to relaunch his career.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14116495/Alec-family-rescue-career-shooting-camerawoman-set.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/23/00/92395979-0-image-m-65_1732320375445.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:30:28","author":"Alison Boshoff,Daniel Bates,Editor","authors":["Alison Boshoff","Daniel Bates","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":266603342,"title":"Collins likely to chair Senate Appropriations Committee after McConnell chooses a new role","text":"Sen. Susan Collins is closer than ever to helming the Senate’s Appropriations Committee after Sen. Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he will lead a subcommittee overseeing defense spending as he carves out new roles once he relinquishes his long-running post as Senate Republican leader.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican revealed he will assume the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. The role dovetails with his constant message that America needs a bulked-up military to deter threats from adversaries such as Russia, Iran and China.\n\nThe transition comes as McConnell is ending his role as the longest-serving Senate leader in history, just as Republicans prepare to take majority control of the chamber after big gains in this month’s election. Republicans elected South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a top deputy to McConnell, as the next Senate majority leader.\n\nWhile the appropriations committee’s next slate of leadership will not become official until next year, Collins has previously signaled her intent to take the position. Collins, among the Senate’s most senior members, currently serves as vice chair.\n\n“As Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my priorities will remain helping Maine’s communities, funding biomedical research to save and improve lives, improving our infrastructure, supporting rural economic development, and helping to strengthen our workforce by supporting education, job training and child care programs,” Collins said in a statement Friday night.\n\nCollins said she has secured more than $1 billion for projects inside Maine over the past three years, and she vowed to “ensure that federal spending produces real results for the American people and that our state’s needs are met.”\n\nTraditionally, Senate committee appointments are determined based on seniority, but they are formalized through an organizing resolution at the start of a new Congress.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations Committee oversees detailed decisions on all discretionary spending, with its chair setting the body’s agenda, heading the budgeting process and leading negotiations.\n\nCollins, a moderate Republican, has clashed with President-elect Donald Trump in the past, including when she was one of seven Republican senators who voted to impeach him following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. In the latest election, Collins said she would write in Nikki Haley rather than vote for Trump.\n\nBut Trump will likely need the committee’s support to enact certain campaign promises, including spending cuts, the elimination of some federal agencies and the mass deportation of immigrants, which experts predict could be costly to carry out.\n\nMCCONNEL’S FUTURE\n\nMcConnell, 82, said Thursday that he will assume the subcommittee chairmanship at a critical time.\n\n“America’s national security interests face the gravest array of threats since the Second World War,” the senator said in a statement. “At this critical moment, a new Senate Republican majority has a responsibility to secure the future of U.S. leadership and primacy.”\n\nMcConnell frequently evokes Ronald Reagan’s mantra of “peace through strength” when discussing foreign policy risks and how the U.S. should respond.\n\nMcConnell’s stance could clash with Trump’s “America First” doctrine on foreign affairs. McConnell worked with Trump on a tax cuts package and the appointment of conservative judges – including three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court – during Trump’s first term as president.\n\nFighting back against isolationism within his own party, McConnell has championed sending weapons and other aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion.\n\nMcConnell said Thursday that he’s also set to become chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, which is often a more low-key panel at the center of big issues, both at the Capitol and in the country.\n\nThe committee oversees the administration of the Senate side of the building, including during inaugurations. But it also puts McConnell at the center of weighty topics, namely federal elections and voting rights, as well as the procedures of the Senate, including the debate around the filibuster.\nMcConnell said the committee will have important work in the coming two years.\n\n“Defending the Senate as an institution and protecting the right to political speech in our elections remain among my longest-standing priorities,” he said.\n\nThere had been considerable speculation about what roles McConnell would take after stepping down as Republican leader. He has two years left in his current Senate term and has not signaled whether he will run for reelection in Kentucky in 2026. McConnell has been a prolific appropriator for the Bluegrass State, a role he’s well-positioned to continue.\n\nThis report contains material from The Associated Press.","summary":"While the committee's new leadership will not become official until next year, Collins, one of the Senate's most senior members, has previously signaled her intention to take the chair position.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/11/22/collins-likely-to-chair-senate-appropriations-committee-after-mcconnell-chooses-a-new-role/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Maine_Shooting_69981_1d1649.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:30:18","author":"Daniel Kool","authors":["Daniel Kool"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.232},{"id":266602422,"title":"Yale professor concedes in NYT opinion essay: ‘Yearslong effort to vanquish’ Trump was a ‘dismal failure’","text":"Yale University law professor Samuel Moyn admitted on Friday that the legal efforts to stop President-elect Donald Trump over the past several years have failed and only made him stronger. Moyn made the declaration in a New York Times guest essay, adding that liberals need to shed the strategy of trying to use the law to stop Trump during his second term. \"The yearslong effort to vanquish Donald Trump in court was a dismal failure,\" the professor wrote. The Times published Moyn’s essay on the same day that Judge Juan Merchan granted Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss the charges in New York v. Trump and removed Trump’s sentencing date of Nov. 26 from the calendar. BRAGG CASE 'EFFECTIVELY OVER' IN 'MAJOR VICTORY,' TRUMP OFFICIALS SAY The news of Merchan’s ruling comes just days after Department of Justice Special Counsel Jack Smith filing a motion to vacate all deadlines in his 2020 election interference case against Trump, a move that signals the case could be dropped entirely. Moyn wrote that the courts failing to end Trump’s political career shows that \"our search for political salvation primarily through the law has backfired.\" The professor explained that liberals have put too much focus on the legal system to pursue their agenda. He noted that while there have been some progressive victories in the process, they have not been able to use the law to stop their political opposition. \"While liberals saw breakthroughs afterward for women and L.G.B.T.Q. people, delivering progress more quickly than elections could, they failed to stop the conservative drift of American law,\" he stated. Specifically, Moyn criticized progressives for acting as if their use of the law was a matter of principle and justice, while \"ignoring that their movement had mainly treated it as a weapon for legalistic political change.\" He noted that conservatives have been able to use it as a weapon as well, and now Trump has more power than ever. \"Along the way, you claim that the rules are on your side and impose them on your political enemies, and sometimes yourself, because the results are good ones,\" the professor stated, adding, \"The trouble is that they regularly aren’t. In this election, legalistic tactics contributed to Mr. Trump’s victory, helping to produce the popular majority he had never boasted before.\" \"For all of Mr. Trump’s misdeeds, prosecuting them was not worth the cost of restoring him to power.\" SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS PENNSYLVANIA PROVISIONAL BALLOT RULING, IN A MAJOR LOSS FOR GOP He pointed out several examples throughout Trump’s political career of liberals using (what's been called by some) \"lawfare\" against him that backfired, including former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into claims Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. \"But when Mr. Mueller’s inconclusive report was released in April 2019, it was an embarrassment to liberals. The politics of law had misdirected their focus for years, and in the process convinced millions of Americans that Mr. Trump’s foes were as prone to conspiratorial thinking as his allies,\" he said. Moyn went on to note how all the cases brought against Trump following his first term, including the New York case, Smith’s case, and one brought against him in Georgia, stalled out for various reasons, despite liberals alleging they would prove successful on principle. \"But agonizingly, Mr. Trump revealed how unprepared the law was for his acts. The law is open to interpretation and, even when clear, allows for discretion and selectivity in its enforcement.\" Moyn then described how liberals, driven by self-righteousness, made Trump even more relevant and immune from their attacks. \"Yet many liberals, convinced that their causes were righteous, didn’t register the risks of this legalistic strategy, which included being seen by voters as treating the law as politics by other means. The criminal investigations fueled their target’s dominance of the Republican primary race and breathed new life into his campaign fund-raising,\" he wrote. Moyn added, \"The election became something like national jury nullification — after the fact for the New York case, and pre-emptively for the others.\" Because of this dynamic, Moyn declared, \"[T]here can be no federal criminal investigations or prosecutions of Mr. Trump while he is in office.\" Rather, he advocated for diminishing Trump by political means only, \"But there are the midterm elections in two years, and in the meantime a Democratic Party in dire need of reimagining and a public to win over.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"A liberal professor of law at Yale University wrote a New York Times guest essay admitting that the lawfare used against President-elect Trump throughout his career has backfired.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/yale-professor-concedes-nyt-opinion-essay-yearslong-effort-vanquish-trump-dismal-failure","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/cee44137-usatsi_20390513-1-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:30:08","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":266603248,"title":"Meme lord Musk, pro crypto Trump fuel fresh mania","text":"Bitcoin may be on song, but there’s plenty more keeping fans abuzz in the crypto verse. Over the past month a new cohort of memecoins have been delivering windfall gains to investors. Scripted with generous lashings of community humour these new coins such as X, Dogwifhat, Peanut the Squirrel, Popcat and Goatseus Maximus have crypto investors in thrall following Donald Trump’s ascension as US President Elect and Tesla founder Elon Musk’s consequent rise having triggered an explosion in crypto valuations.Even as Bitcoin is inching closer to the $100,000 mark having surged 49% over the last month, Dogwifhat, the Japanese dog with a hat, touched a market cap of $3.3 billion, making it the 36th ranked coin among 2.4 million currencies. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) surged by 2,315% since its launch this month, according to CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies. Memecoins are regarded as the “penny stocks” of the crypto verse or low -priced coins.Also Read: Bitcoin nears $90,000 as Trump victory fuels surge: what's driving the rally?In India, X was the second largest traded meme coin on trading platform CoinDCX last week holding a market cap of $20 million.While CoinSwitch, a Bangalore-based cryptocurrency trading platform said it has seen nearly a ten-fold jump in trading volumes week-on-week in the new meme coins.Balaji Srihari, business head at CoinSwitch said meme coins may be following the upward trend “fueled by renewed memecoin hype, strong support from Elon Musk, and speculation around pro-crypto policies with Trump's election win.”“However, sustaining this momentum may be challenging due to its limited utility and retail-driven volatility,” he said.To be sure, crypto being a decentralised currency, the price of these coins is not determined by any single exchange.“Meme coins are created purely from an entertainment perspective and represent shared culture among crypto enthusiasts,” said Edul Patel, CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange Mudrex.For instance, coins like Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe have always been popular among the crypto community.“Time-and-again we have seen many esoteric coins which die down after gaining unbelievable popularity within hours or days. We advise investors to exercise caution before participating in such volatile trade,” Patel added.Quirky tradesPNUT is a meme coin created as a tribute to a squirrel shortly after his death. The coin has been gaining popularity for the outpouring of grief and sympathy from his online community.Elsewhere, Goatseus (GOAT) is the world’s first AI meme coin which was created by a self-controlled AI agent called Terminal of Truths which autonomously promotes the coin by posting on community platforms. GOAT has seen a 68% increase over the past month and touched an all-time high five days ago, placing it among the fastest currencies to cross $1 billion market cap within a month of launch.However, some believers of meme coins said that community enthusiasm has the potential to serve a useful cause.Adithya Iyer, author of the book ‘How I met God and got into Crypto’ said that he plans to raise $3 million by launching a new meme coin called ‘GIC’ to fund his new writing project.“My investors are extremely excited about how we can capitalise on the meme culture and create a crowdfunding source. I am excited about this experiment,” Iyer said.Bitcoin surgeFollowing a prolonged period of dormancy post-Covid, the largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is undergoing a resurgence in 2024. It is breaching all-time highs month-after-month. November has been the highest-grossing month for Bitcoin, aided by Trump’s crypto-friendly stance, the possibility of the creation of a Bitcoin strategic reserve, and heavy buying from corporates like MicroStrategy. At the current price of $99,192, BTC is close to breaching the $100,000 mark.Indian investors want a share of the bull run.Sumit Gupta, co-founder of Indian exchange CoinDCX said, since November 6, 2024, our 24-hour trading volume stands at $21 million, with a peak of $36.5 million recorded on November 10. Mudrex said it has recorded $30 million in total trading volume since the past week, which is expected to surge to $50 million.

The government previously appealed the decision to invalidate the Universal Service Fund, which aims to provide affordable telecommunications services to low-income and rural families. A lower court found the organization violates the non-delegation doctrine within Congress.Along with agreeing to hear the case, the Supreme Court told attorneys on both sides of the case to be prepared to argue whether the case is moot because of the challengers' failure to seek preliminary relief before the Fifth Circuit.What is the Universal Service Fund?In 1996, Congress created the fund through the Federal Communications Commission, and the law required telecommunication companies to contribute to it. That charge is often passed onto consumers on their monthly bills.Opponents of the fund argue it's being unlawfully overseen by the administering nonprofit, in violation of the non-delegation doctrine, which prevents Congress from delegating its power to another entity.The U.S. Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit nullified the program in a 9-7 decision. The decision came after the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit courts ruled against challenges to the non-delegation doctrine. The 5th Circuit said the funding method for the telecommunications program is unconstitutional since it gives too much authority to the Federal Communications Commission.The Biden Administration argued that nullifying the program would \"devastate\" the FCC's ability to ensure funding for the program. Since there were conflicting lower court rulings, both the FCC and Consumers' Research, a conservative group fighting the fund, asked the Supreme Court to hear the case. In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case promptly, the Consumers' Research group said time was \"of the essence\" because funds are still being collected.What's Next?The case will likely be argued in late March after President-elect Donald Trump has taken office, according to the Associated Press.If the Supreme Court rules against the FCC, it could restrict Congress' ability to pass open-ended laws giving agencies leeway in using their powers to regulate issues, such as banking and the environment.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled several times against federal agencies. In one ruling, the Supreme Court overturned a decades-old precedent that allowed federal agencies to interpret laws that were written ambiguously. The court sided along ideological lines with a 6-3 majority.The Supreme Court previously denied two appeals from Consumer Research to hear the case.","summary":"The Supreme Court agreed to take upon cases even if they may be moot.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-fcc-telecommunications-case-congress-1990510","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2528335/supreme-court.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:24:14","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.451},{"id":266602758,"title":"Trump Team Eyeing Billionaire as Treasury Secretary Nominee","text":"President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is in the final stages of announcing Scott Bessent as treasury secretary nominee, an unnamed source told Bloomberg.\n\nBessent, who runs the Key Square Group macro hedge fund, has served as a key economic adviser for Trump’s presidential campaign and helped craft policy speeches, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThe New York Post reported that 62-year-old Bessent got Trump’s backing as early as Thursday, after Trump met with financier Kevin Warsh and billionaire Marc Rowan at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week.\n\nBessent has shown his loyalty to Trump many times over, hitting the campaign trail and endorsing Trump’s plan to increase tariffs in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.\n\n“If you want to bring a genius into that job who is loyal to the president, Scott is the right guy,” a source told New York Post.\n\nIf Bessent accepts the nomination, he will join a growing list of Trump administration officials that will need to be confirmed by the Senate.","summary":"Jonathan DrakePresident-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is in the final stages of announcing Scott Bessent as treasury secretary nominee, an unnamed source told Bloomberg.\n\nBessent, who runs the Key Square Group macro hedge fund, has served as a key economic adviser for Trump’s presidential campaign and helped craft policy speeches, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThe New York Post reported that 62-year-old Bessent got Trump’s backing as early as Thursday, after Trump met with financier Kevin Warsh and billionaire Marc Rowan at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-team-eyeing-hedge-funder-as-treasury-secretary-nominee/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/EO5E7UPDHFBERACRRF3DOATL34.JPG?smart=true&auth=c79a2b2eaffb2ec3ae12a00d726827415cb9fed144277e634cf9ead82086fb29&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:24:02","author":"Emell Derra Adolphus","authors":["Emell Derra Adolphus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.362},{"id":266603940,"title":"Trump nominates hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for treasury secretary","text":"President-elect Donald Trump says he plans to nominate hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to serve as secretary of the treasury.Starting in 1991, Bessent worked for Soros Fund Management for close to a decade.

What to know about Trump's Treasury secretary pick.","text":"President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent as his pick for U.S. Treasury secretary, choosing a former executive with Soros Fund Management who in recent years has been a vocal supporter of the former president's policies, from tariffs to spending cuts. If confirmed, Bessent would follow Janet Yellen, a labor economist who was the first woman to lead both the Federal Reserve and Treasury, in running the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.Bessent, who had provided economic advice to the Trump campaign, has had a decades-long career in finance. He analyzed macroeconomic and geopolitical risks while working at the Soros Fund, where he served as chief investment officer, as well as at other hedge funds. Perhaps more importantly in helping him gain Trump's backing, Bessent countered other economic experts during the presidential campaign, arguing that they were wrong about the impact of the former president's policies. In a recent Fox News opinion piece, he asserted that tariffs aren't inflationary, rejecting the views of 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists that Trump's plans to impose broad tariffs could reignite price increases.\"Critics of tariffs argue that they will increase the prices Americans pay for imported goods,\" Bessent wrote for Fox News. \"But the facts argue against this. President Trump's first-term tariffs did not raise the prices of the affected goods, despite predictions back then that the tariffs would prove inflationary.\" Here's what to know about Scott Bessent. What is Bessent's educational and work history?Bessent, a Yale graduate, initially sought to become a journalist, but when he didn't get the post as editor of the Yale Daily News, he changed direction. Bessent secured an internship with money manager Jim Rogers, George Soros' first partner and co-founder of the Quantum Fund, he told his university's alumni magazine. \"And he even offered — which was key for me — a place to stay on the office sofa,\" Bessent told the publication. Bessent is the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of New York-based hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, according to S&P Capital IQ. He has also taught at Yale University, offering classes on economic booms and busts in the 20th century and the history of hedge funds.What are Bessent's political and economic views? In an October opinion piece in The Economist, Bessent singled out globalization as sparking growing inequality in the U.S., which has led to widening social and economic disparities.\"Western middle- and working-class populations are growing increasingly wary of globalization,\" he wrote. \"The only way to preserve the benefits of the international trading system is to question some of its mistaken assumptions and update them for the current moment.\"Among those updates: tariffs, with Bessent arguing in his Fox News piece that taxes on goods imported into the U.S. can \"increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals.\"Bessent has advised Trump to create a \"3-3-3\" policy, which includes cutting the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, as well as pushing GDP growth to 3% via deregulation and pumping out an extra 3 million barrels of oil each day, according to the Wall Street Journal. What about Bessent's ties with Soros? The relationship between a one-time Soros protégé and a Republican leader like Trump may seem unusual, given that the billionaire philanthropist is viewed negatively by many conservatives.But Trump views Bessent's experience working for Soros as a positive, according to the Journal, which noted that the former president is impressed with the legendary investor's wealth. While at Soros Fund Management, Bessent bet against the yen, generating almost $1 billion over a three-month period, the Journal noted.What about Bessent's personal life?Bessent now lives in his home state of South Carolina with his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, with whom he has two children. \"If you had told me in 1984, when we graduated [from Yale], and people were dying of AIDS, that 30 years later I'd be legally married and we would have two children via surrogacy, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Bessent told the Yale alumni magazine in 2015.Politics also runs in his family, as former Rep. John Jenrette was his uncle and is also known for serving a prison sentence for his role in 1980s Abscam scandal, South Carolina's Post and Courier reported.","summary":"If confirmed, Bessent would runn the department that manages the nation's finances as well as its tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-scott-bessent-what-to-know-trump-treasury-secretary-pick/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/23/35b0cafd-9125-4c8b-a0a3-26eeea46ab43/thumbnail/1200x630g9/e0860558b0a25deb5ddd7b8d58650131/gettyimages-2155831262.jpg?v=b1635869826311f914073798d8df6484","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3351327_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-11-23 00:20:00","author":"Aimee Picchi","authors":["Aimee Picchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.047},{"id":266601240,"title":"President-elect Donald Trump set to name hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has signalled his intention to nominate hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as his Treasury secretary, sources tell CNBC and NBC News.\n\nThe founder of Key Square Group had been considered a strong favorite for the position along with a few other close contenders including former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and private equity executive Marc Rowan.\n\nAs head of Treasury, Bessent, 62, will be both the U.S. fiscal watchdog as well as a key official to help Trump enact his ambitious economic agenda. Both a Wall Street heavyweight and advocate for many of the incoming president’s economic goals, he would come to office at a critical time as the U.S. wrestles with a growing economy alongside long-festering debt and deficit issues.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent favours gradual tariffs and deregulation to push American business and control inflation. In addition, Bessent has advocated for a revival in manufacturing as well as energy independence.\n\n“If you’re going to think about the market and think about what matters, the guy is brilliant,” said a source familiar with Trump’s thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to talk frankly about the matter. “There aren’t many people who know the market better than Bessent does.”\n\nThe prospective nominee also has deep philanthropic ties through Yale University along with Rockefeller University and Classical American homes Preservation Trust.\n\nOne obstacle Bessent will have to overcome is his past affiliation with billionaire investor and global gadfly George Soros.

Dr. Daniels said, “the goal of this critical Summit is to assess the outcome of the election and to develop strategies for a cultural, political offensive to mobilize/organize our people to resist the dangers posed by the white supremacist tinged MAGA policies promised by President-Elect Donald J. Trump. We need to build psychological momentum for the fight-back we must wage.” Dr. Daniels suggested that the Summit be convened in Selma, Alabama to coincide with the Annual Bridge Crossing Jubilee that commemorates Bloody Sunday. Elaborating on the goal of the Summit, Dr. Daniels commented, “We must not only resist, Black America needs a bold, transformational agenda to advance and protect our interests and aspirations as a people.” He plans to reach out to the eight Civil Rights Legacy Organizations as the logical group to convene the Emergency Summit.\n\nMarc Morial at IBW’s post-election town hall meeting, November 14, 2024.\n\nDr. Daniels believes the most immediate, pressing issue on the Agenda is to encourage President Biden to enact the HR-40 Commission by Executive Order. As mandated in the legislation, the Commission would study and develop reparations proposals for African Americans. “President Biden could have an Emancipation Proclamation moment by boldly moving to create the Commission during the lame duck session.” Dr. Daniels suggested. “It would be a fitting tribute to the late Congressman John Conyers, Jr. and the visionary Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee who courageously took the torch and carried HR-40 to the brink of the finish line. President-Elect Trump has already intentionally insulted Black people by indicating he will provide reparations for White people. When he takes office, President Trump will certainly rescind Biden’s HR-40 Executive Order, but by doing so, he will once again show his real colors,” Dr. Daniels concluded. IBW assembled some of Black America’s most influential leaders for the Town Hall Meeting which was thought provoking, informational, inspirational and encouraging: Marc Morial, President/CEO, National Urban League; Dr. Julianne Malveaux, Educator, Author, Political Economist; Melanie L. Campbell; President/CEO, National Coalition of Black Civic Participation; Rev. Shavon Arline-Bradley, President/CEO, National Council of Negro Women; Hilary Shelton, Senior Vice-President, Governance and Policy, NAACP; Jennifer Jones Austin, Esq., CEO, Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; Dr. George Fraser, President/CEO, FraserNet; Mel Foote, President/CEO, Constituency for Africa; Rev. Graylan Hagler, Senior Advisor, Fellowship for Reconciliation, USA; Maurice Mitchell, National Director, Working Families Party; Dr. Melina Abdullah, National Director, Black Lives Matter Grassroots; and Robin Rue Simmons, Founder/Executive Director, FirstRepair were the Panelists who led the discussion. In addition to the Panel Discussion, there was an update on the horrific crisis in Haiti by Jocelyn McCalla, Senior Policy Advisor for the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy and the presentation of the IBW Legacy Award to Mary Frances Berry, Esq., who served as Chairperson of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission from 1993 to 2004.\n\nMary Frances Berry at IBW’s post-election town hall meeting, November 14, 2024.\n\nDr. Daniels closed the Town Hall Meeting by presenting an ambitious series of initiatives as part of a proposed cultural, political offensive. The following is a synopsis of his Charge and Call to Action:\n\nConvene National Emergency Black Leadership Summit in SelmaConvene 100 representatives of organizations and influencers to assess the impact of the 2024 presidential election on Black America and the Pan African World. The Summit would also develop an Action Agenda and mobilizing, organizing strategy to build psychological momentum. Reconstitute the National Black Leadership ForumBlack America needs to develop a united front to devise collective, collaborative and coordinated strategies by reconstituting a defunct formation called the National Black Leadership Forum. This formation could be comprised of 100 Black leaders with the Civil Rights Eight legacy organizations and 22 additional organizations functioning as the Executive Committee. Urge Biden to Enact HR-40 by Executive Order The Civil Rights Eight and representatives from reparations advocacy organizations should meet with President Biden immediately to encourage him to enact the HR-40 Commission by Executive Order during the lame duck session. Target date January 15th, the Birthday of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Revive the National Council of Negro Women’s Black Family ReunionsUnder the leadership of the iconic President Dorothy Height, the National Council of Negro Women hosted a series of mass gatherings called Black Family Reunions to build a sense of community and family in the Black community. A revival of these inspirational gatherings should be part of the cultural, political offensive for resistance and transformation in Black America. Develop a Culture of Political Literacy and Civic EngagementDespite high voter turnout by Black voters led by Black women, the 2024 election revealed a critical need for increased and consistent education in all sectors of Black America to maximize Black voter power. We need an all-hands on deck commitment to civic engagement and political literacy to achieve this crucial objective. Convene a Conference of Rap Activists and Cultural MessengersAll across the country there are Rappers and Cultural Messengers who use Hip Hop as a media to encourage and inspire Black people to improve our communities and fight for racial and social justice and a fundamental transformation of a racialized Capitalist system. These Rap Activists and Cultural Messengers must be connected to each other to form a formidable force to advance and protect the interests of Black people. To achieve this goal, we should call on the likes of the legendary Chuck D and Paradise Gray to facilitate the convening of a National Conference of Rap Activists and Cultural Messengers as a vital component of the cultural, political offensive. Support the Working Families Party as a Third Force in American PoliticsThe 2024 presidential election also revealed growing disenchantment with the Democratic Party that appears to take Black voters for granted when it comes to investment of resources to maximize Black voter power. The emergence of the Working Families Party under the leadership of National Director Maurice Mitchell and his team now offers a viable option as a third force to advance and protect the interest and aspirations of Black people and our allies. Build for a 2 Million Woman and Man March in October of 20252025 will mark the 30th Anniversary of the historic Million Man March and Day of Atonement organized by the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. 2025 will also mark the 28th Anniversary of the Million Woman March organized by Phile Chionesu and Asia Coney. Now it’s time for women and men to stand together in a Two Million Woman and Man March modeling the triumph of partnership over patriarchy in the Black community as a powerful dimension of the cultural, political offensive. Convene a National Black Political Convention in 2028Continuing to broaden and deepen the essential cultural, political offensive to mobilize organizations in Black America to combat the dangers of MAGAISM, on the occasion of the 56th anniversary of the history Gary National Black Political Convention, one of the most significant gatherings of Black People in America, we should organize city by city, county by county and state by state to deliberate on a National Black Political Agenda and gather at a National Black Political Convention to adopt a comprehensive Black Agenda in preparation for marching on ballot boxes to take-back America from the racist and reactionary forces of MAGAISM in the 2028 presidential election. Release of All Political Prisoners and Prisoners of WarWith a convicted felon in the White House who inspired an insurrection to subvert democracy, we must uncompromisingly demand the exoneration of the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey and all political prisoners and prisoners of war who fought for full freedom, justice, equality and self-determination for Black people in America as the indispensable pre-condition to achieve a more perfect union. Employ Economic Sanctions as a Weapon in the Black Freedom StruggleLast but not least, it is imperative that Black people unitize our trillions of dollars in spending/economic power as a weapon to bring corporations, retail establishments and financial institutions to their knees in defense of our freedom. Those at the commanding heights of capital and finance have the power to check the authoritarianism of Donald J. Trump and MAGAISM. We must take a page from Dr. King’s successful Montgomery Bus Boycott and employ economic sanctions to repeal policies which are harmful to our interests and adopt policies which advance and protect our interests. Economic sanctions must be a powerful weapon Black cultural, political offensive.

Vought was closely involved with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump's second term that he tried to distance himself from during the campaign.\n\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App In Pictures:Meet the people tapped to be in Trump's administration \n\n The dual announcements Friday evening showed how Trump was fleshing out the financial side of his new administration. Although Bessent is closely aligned with Wall Street and could earn bipartisan support, Vought is known as a Republican hardliner.\n\n Trump said Bessent would \"help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States,\" while Vought \"knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government.\"\n\n Bessent, 62, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management, after having worked on-and-off for Soros Fund Management since 1991. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be the nation's first openly gay treasury secretary.\n\n He told Bloomberg in August that he decided to join Trump's campaign in part to attack the mounting U.S. national debt. That would include slashing government programs and other spending.\n\n \"This election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,\" he said then.\n\n As of Nov. 8, the national debt stands at US$35.94 trillion, with both the Trump and Biden administrations having added to it. Trump's policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, while the Biden administration increased the national debt by $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.\n\n Even as he pushes to lower the national debt by stop spending, Bessent has backed extending provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analysis of the costs of the various tax cuts range between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years. Nearly all of the law's provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025.\n\n Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips \n\n Before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, Bessent donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. Bessent had an influential role in Soros' London operations, including his famous 1992 bet against the pound, which generated huge profits on \"Black Wednesday,\" when the pound was de-linked from European currencies.\n\n Bessent's selection wasn't surprising; He had been among the names floated for the treasury secretary role. At an October Detroit Economic Club event, Trump called Bessent \"one of the top analysts on Wall Street.\"\n\n Bessent told Bloomberg in August that he views tariffs as a \"one time price adjustment\" and \"not inflationary,\" and tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China. And he wrote in a Fox News op-ed this week that tariffs are \"a useful tool for achieving the president's foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defence, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"\n\n Bessent told Fox News earlier this month when asked if tariffs would pay for Trump's large scale deportation operation that he had been working on a plan for what he called \"financial deportations,\" explaining he would restrict the flow of remittances to migrants' home countries.\n\n Bessent has also floated ideas for how the Trump administration could put pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Last month, Bessent suggested Trump could name a replacement chair early, and let that person function as a \"shadow\" chair, with the goal of essentially sidelining Powell.\n\n But after the election, Bessent reportedly backed away from that plan. Powell, for his part, has said he wouldn't step down if Trump asked him to do so, and added that Trump, as president, doesn't have the authority to fire him.\n\n Trump repeatedly attacked Powell during his first term as president for raising the Fed's key rate in 2017 and 2018. During the 2024 campaign, he said that as president he should have a \"say\" in the central bank's interest rate decisions. Presidents traditionally avoid commenting on the Fed's policies.\n\n Bessent and his husband, former New York City prosecutor John Freeman, married in 2011 and have two children.\n\n Then-acting Office of Management and Budget director Russel Vought speaks during a press briefing at the White House, March 11, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File)\n\n Vought, 48, was the head of the Office of Management and Budget from mid-2020 to the end of Trump's first term in 2021, having previously served as the acting director and deputy director. A graduate of Wheaton College and George Washington University Law School, he had a deep knowledge of government finances that has been paired with his own Christian faith.\n\n After Trump's initial term ended, Vought founded the Center for Renewing America, a think tank that describes its mission as \"renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.\"\n\n The Center for Renewing America released its own 2023 budget proposal entitled \"A Commitment to End Work and Weaponized Government.\" The proposal envisioned $11.3 trillion worth of spending reductions over 10 years and about $2 trillion in income tax cuts in order to bring the budget into surplus by 2032.\n\n \"The immediate threat facing the nation is the fact that the people no longer govern the country; instead, the government itself is increasingly weaponized against the people it is meant to serve,\" Vought wrote in the introduction.\n\n Vought has also previously worked as the executive and budget director for the Republican Study Committee, a caucus for conservative House Republicans. He also worked at Heritage Action, the political group tied to The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.\n\n Vought's proposed budget plan would cut spending on food aid through the Agriculture Department. There would be $3.3 trillion in spending reductions in the Health and Human Services Department in large part through how Medicaid and Medicare funds are distributed. It also contains about $642 billion in cuts to Affordable Care Act. The budgets for the Housing and Urban Development and Education departments would also be cut.\n\n Vought's budget ideas were independent of Trump, who has not entirely spelled out the details of his economic plans, other than to campaign on income tax cuts and tariff hikes. ----\n\n Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that he'll nominate hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, an advocate for deficit reduction, to serve as his next treasury secretary.
