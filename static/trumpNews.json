In the ongoing blockbuster that is the United States election, this week's interview with Kamala Harris offered another yet another piece of prime-time viewing. The vice-president's last-minute rise to the top of the Democratic ticket came without a new primary election process. And her reluctance to engage with the traditional media in the weeks after Joe Biden withdrew from the race meant the sit-down with CNN was the first time she'd been seriously tested in an unscripted setting since she emerged as his replacement. It all added up to a heightened level of scrutiny over how she performed. Harris avoided any major stumbles like the awkward \"I haven't been to Europe\" comment from 2021 that now forms part of Republican attack ads. And while she also didn't deliver any stand-out moments that might have helped to accelerate her early momentum, overall, her campaign would presumably be happy with a somewhat neutral result. But the vice-president didn't fully answer some of the biggest questions being asked of her. And with only two months to go until election day, she'll come under continued pressure to do so. 'My values have not changed' Loading... Harris is selling herself as a candidate of change, using the campaign slogans \"A new way forward\" and \"We're not going back\". As vice-president in the current administration, however, it leads to inevitable questions about what exactly she's proposing to do differently to Biden. Harris insisted she had no regrets about defending the president's abilities in the aftermath of his dismal debate performance, saying that serving with him had been an honour. She made clear she would not be deviating from US policy over the war in Gaza, echoing Biden by arguing Israel had a right to defend itself, although \"how it does so matters\". And when she spoke about wanting to \"turn the page on the last decade\" — prompting CNN anchor Dana Bash to point out that the administration she's part of made up nearly four years of that period – she suggested she was referring to Trump. \"I'm talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down,\" Harris said. \"Instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up.\" Harris was pushed on energy policy and immigration, two areas in which she's moved her position further towards the political centre in recent years. In 2019, while running for her party's presidential nomination, Harris told a town hall meeting that she was in favour of banning fracking – a process used to extract natural gas. Five years on, with the resources-rich state of Pennsylvania considered a must-win for Democrats, she insists she's not opposed. Pressed on why she'd shifted her position, Harris argued the Biden administration had shown climate change action could be prioritised without imposing a fracking ban. But she also introduced a line that was repeated throughout the interview: \"My values have not changed.\" Harris was then asked about her stance on border security, having previously raised her hand on a debate stage in 2019 when asked whether crossing into the US without authorisation should be decriminalised. Harris now says there \"should be consequence\" for those who enter the country illegally. She blamed Donald Trump for deliberately sinking a package of border legislation that had support on both sides of Congress, because it wouldn't benefit him politically, before pivoting back to her earlier argument. \"My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed,\" Harris said. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, mocked the vice-president's position as \"bizarre\". \"If you have the same values, why have you changed your mind on literally every topic that you previously held an opinion on?\" he said on Fox News. \"I think it's important for us not to buy this.\" Trump will use what he describes as Harris's \"flip-flops\" to prosecute one of his most consistent lines of attack against her: that she's disingenuous. \"I look so forward to debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is,\" he said on Truth Social. \"Harris has changed every one of her long-held positions, on everything.\" The last time the former president took to the debate stage, his opponent ended up exiting the race weeks later. With his head-to-head with Harris taking place in less than a fortnight, neither side should be under any illusions about how significant the match-up will be. Trump's IVF promise While much of the focus this week was on the answers Harris was providing, Trump prompted further questions over his own position on another major election issue: reproductive rights. The former president made a promise that either his government, or medical insurers, would cover all of the costs associated with in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments. Trump nominated three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who helped to overturn Roe vs Wade in 2022, giving the states the power to introduce abortion bans. An Alabama court's ruling earlier this year that a frozen embryo was considered a child gave new weight to Democratic warnings that other reproductive rights could also be affected. The state legislature later passed a law allowing IVF clinics that shut down in the wake of the ruling to resume their services. Trump's announcement didn't come with any detail on how his administration would pay for IVF treatments, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. But it's part of a broader effort to try to neutralise a topic that could cost him support in November. The balancing act proved trickier when it came to questions over a ballot measure aimed at undoing a six-week abortion ban in Florida, where Trump is registered to vote. Trump first suggested he would vote in favour of the measure, telling NBC he believed \"we need more than six weeks\". But anti-abortion campaigners reacted angrily to the comment, and Trump's team soon intervened to argue he hadn't in fact revealed what he was planning to do. Within hours, Trump had announced he'd be voting against it after all – something Harris's campaign was quick to highlight. \"Kamala Harris is going to fight for your rights,\" Democrat campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz argued. \"Donald Trump will take them away.\" ICYMI: An ugly spat on hallowed ground Not far from Washington DC, the Arlington National Cemetery – where thousands of veterans are buried — is one of the most solemn places in the US. Trump visited the cemetery earlier this week at the invitation of some of the families of service members killed during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The former president took part in a wreath-laying ceremony to mark three years since they died. But when he moved to an area known as Section 60, where the gravesites of those who died in Afghanistan and Iraq are located, an altercation ensued. Trump's team included staffers who were taking photos and videos, with footage from the visit later posted on TikTok. The US Army alleges a cemetery employee, who tried to enforce laws preventing any kind of political activity happening in the area, was \"abruptly pushed aside\". Trump's campaign hit back by accusing the employee of being the one \"who initiated physical contact and verbal harassment that was unwarranted and unnecessary\". The former president himself argued he took pictures at the request of the families, and blamed Biden's \"incompetence\" for their deaths. The army said the incident had been reported to police, but the employee had decided against pressing charges. It considers the matter resolved. The political controversy might not be.","summary":"As the energy around Kamala Harris's nomination settles and she emerges from her first real test, the strategy behind Republican attack ads becomes clear, writes Jade Macmillan.  ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-31/kamala-harris-interview-donald-trump-ivf-promise-ahead-of-debate/104294430","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/826d8960b9e29f0ab32bdafbb1d84795?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=11&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:53:43","author":"Jade Macmillan","authors":["Jade Macmillan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":255306722,"title":"Michigan Residents Weary of National Politics, Hopeful for Truth","text":"Michigan voters helped swing the Electoral College to Donald Trump in 2016 and then to Joe Biden in 2020. The votes were close in each election, with the winner decided by 0.2 percent in 2016 and 2.8 percent in 2020. The state’s major cities, including Detroit, Ann Arbor, Lansing, and Grand Rapids, are Democratic strongholds, while the smaller cities and rural areas tend to vote Republican in national elections. From the shores of the Port of Detroit to the sandy beaches of Grand Haven, The Epoch Times traveled Michigan from coast to coast to find out how this year’s political messaging is landing with voters. Jake Anderson, 28, an epidemiologist from Grand Rapids, said he has seen ads from both campaigns that give negative information about the other candidate. “I would say, overall, it’s a pretty dividing way,” Anderson said. Anderson, who is employed by a nonprofit working with Native Americans, said that while he’s not very involved in politics, he’d like to see more bipartisanship. “Just to focus on working together. That would be my biggest takeaway,” he said. Javon Shivers, 28, of Saginaw, Michigan, said he had received mail from the Harris–Walz campaign but did not pay much attention to it. “I’m really not into politics,” he said. “I’m my own president. That’s how I look at it.” The clothing entrepreneur said he sees a disconnect between politics and the lives of ordinary people. “It really doesn’t change anything for me myself,” he said. “You still have to live your day-to-day life outside of what they’re doing.” Shivers said he would like to see the candidates speak candidly about the issues. “I would like to see them talk about the truth, about what’s really going on in society,” he said. “Yeah, I’ve seen some ads,” Germaine Green, 51, of Grand Rapids, said. “I’m probably not going to vote for either one of them.” Green said he'd like to hear candidates talk more about illegal immigration and its effect on working people. “They’re giving all this money to immigrants, like food stamps. The average American wants to see money in their paycheck.” Sam Bayle, 33, of Grand Rapids, said he had seen advertisements from both campaigns but that none made a positive impression on him. “I get through them as quick as I can because I’m sick of seeing all of them, to be completely honest,” he said. “I would like a little talk about the general way that government works, like all the money involved in it. “A little more transparency in terms of where funding is coming from and what you’re looking to do. Actual conversations instead of just the party line.” Larena Singleton, 50, of Detroit, said she has received mail from both the Harris and Trump campaigns. “We’re being bombarded with it,” she said. “At least five days a week, we get mail from both.” Singleton said she dislikes the tone she hears from both campaigns. “I don’t like the bickering back and forth,” she said. “Debating is one thing, but then when you’re trying to throw shade or throw dirt on each other, that’s something different. “Both campaigns should be talking more about helping the homeless and about education.” Many children are not being fully educated in public schools, she said. Education should be “getting the kids back into the fundamentals.” Ryan Decker, 49, of Grand Haven, said he has not seen any materials from either campaign and isn’t eager to do so. “They talk too much,” he said. “In my mind, it’s a mess.” The avid surfer said he would like to see the candidates address global conflict. “I’m always worried about war. I mean, who isn’t?” he said. Jesse and Latral Charles, 74 and 67, respectively, of Romulus have received mail from both campaigns. “I think Harris has definitely given more information so you can make a concrete decision on what she’s going to do,” Latral said. “She laid out her plan, her fight for the middle class.” Both Charleses would like to hear more about the candidates’ views on women’s rights, they said. “[Trump] has got me a little confused,” Jesse said, referring to the former president’s stance on abortion. “He’s not stable on it.” Dirk O’Brien, 49, a flooring installer from Marne, Michigan, was fishing from the pier in Grand Haven with his two young sons when we approached him. “None,” he replied when asked whether he’d received any contact from the campaigns. He added that he’s a felon and is probably not included on their lists. O’Brien said he’s less concerned with global politics and would like to hear candidates talk more about domestic issues, especially those regarding the environment. “I’m more concerned about China buying up all this farmland and all this mining we’re doing for batteries,” he said. Speaking of mining operations to make batteries for electric vehicles, he asked, “What are we going to do with all this waste we’re creating?” Mike and Jaclyn Bussert, 36 and 35, respectively, of New Hudson, have had contact from neither campaign. They said they’ve seen social media ads but don’t recall the content. Jaclyn said she’s not especially interested in politics at this point. “I haven’t quite dove into all that yet,” she said, noting that she’s expecting to pay closer attention as the election draws near. Jeff Gardner, a resident of Grand Blanc, Michigan, in his 50s, has received mail from both parties. “I think their messages are all on track,” he said of the Republican campaigns. After a pause, he added, “The others, I don’t.” The issue that gets too little attention, in his view, is the attempt on Trump’s life in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Democratic candidates and the news media “ought to be saying what a problem it is that President Trump was nearly assassinated,” he said. “They ought to be exposing it ... and never allowing anything to ever happen to any former president.”","summary":"Many voters in the battleground state said they discard mailers and tune out video ads but would like to hear more candid talk from the candidates.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/michigan-residents-weary-of-national-politics-hopeful-for-truth-5716047","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/30/id5715974-Michigan-Voters-5-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:43:07","author":"Lawrence Wilson","authors":["Lawrence Wilson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":255306548,"title":"Trump Will Vote ‘No’ On Florida’s 6-Week Abortion Ban After Earlier Comments Stirred Confusion","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday he will vote against Florida’s Right to Abortion initiative, doing so a day after he made comments critiquing the state’s six-week abortion ban that caused confusion among conservatives and anti-abortion supporters.

Trump’s commitment against the initiative comes a day after he told NBC News that Florida’s six-week abortion ban is “too short,” without clarifying how he would vote, triggering speculation the former president was in support of the Right to Abortion initiative and sparking criticism from figures like Southern Baptist Theological Seminary President Albert Mohler Jr., who tweeted Trump’s comments “seem almost calculated to alienate prolife voters.” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement Thursday she spoke with Trump and learned he had yet to commit to a vote on the initiative. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and his campaign clarified Trump’s Thursday comments, with the latter saying Trump had “not yet said how he will vote” on the initiative. Vance told CNN on Friday the former president would “make his own announcement on how he's going to vote.” Mohler quote tweeted a post about Trump’s intent to vote against the initiative, saying the “clarification was appreciated,” while Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America thanked Trump for saying he would vote “no.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Ron DeSantis’ signing of the ban a “terrible mistake” last year, according to the BBC. The former president has maintained he believes abortion should be a state-level matter. He has kept the stance amid calls from anti-abortion activists to adopt a national abortion ban if he wins in November. Vance said this week Trump would deny a national abortion ban if he’s elected to a second term. However, Trump has indicated he may be open to stern national restrictions on abortion such as banning the abortion drug mifepristone.

Trump. Election officials disqualified nearly 16,000 mail-in ballots for irregularities during April’s primary election. Almost half were disqualified because of issues like missing signatures and wrong dates on outer envelopes. The ruling applies only to Philadelphia and Allegheny Counties.

MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin tweeted Friday evening that U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein (an appointee of former President Bill Clinton) officially denied the Trump team's request to remove his felony hush money cover-up case from Manhattan to federal jurisdiction. While Trump has the option to refile the petition, Rubin noted that he has to do so either with the blessing of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg or from Judge Juan Merchan. So far, he has neither. In an interview with MSNBC host Chris Hayes, Rubin explained that the former president's 11th-hour effort to push back his sentencing date isn't done yet. He still has pending motions before Judge Merchan that may result in either postponing the imposition of a sentence until after the election, or even throwing out the case altogether due to the immunity the Supreme Court granted to the ex-president in its controversial Trump v. United States decision in July.

If Judge Merchan denies their motion to set aside the verdict, they have already indicated that they are going to try to appeal that prior to any sentencing as well. They signed a letter to him indicating that they believe they have state and federal appellate vehicles for that ... if and when they get Judge Hellerstein's permission to file a third notice, if that happens and they don't like his ultimate answer, they could try to exercise their appellate rights with respect to that, too.\" \"The question is whether or not they have left themselves enough time to essentially beat Merchan to the punch if he wants to go forward with the sentencing on September 18th,\" she added. This prompted Hayes to ask Rubin if he was \"crazy,\" as he was under the impression that \"you usually can't appeal post-conviction pre-sentencing.\" She assured the host that he was \"not crazy at all,\" and acknowledged that \"we are making up a lot of new rules as we go along\" as the 45th president of the United States-turned-convicted felon and his team of expensive attorneys have created multiple unprecedented legal questions. \"They seem to believe that the unprecedented nature of the case plus the immunity decision necessitates an appellate option prior to that post-conviction review that is typically unusual in the state courts,\" Rubin said. \"That's at least the argument they have made, that they don't have to go through sentencing first, that if they lose the motion to set aside the verdict that they are entitled to take this up through state or federal courts. But you're not wrong to say that's not usually the way that this happens.\" READ MORE: Defendants in Merchan's courtroom say toughness of sentences depends on level of 'respect' As of right now, Trump is due in Manhattan on September 18th to be sentenced for his 34 class E felony convictions. Judge Merchan has the ability to sentence Trump as many as 20 years behind bars, though that's an unlikely scenario given that Trump is a 78 year-old first-time offender who was convicted for non-violent crimes. The September 18th date was already more than 60 days after the date he was initially scheduled to be sentenced, as Merchan needed extra time to determine whether the Supreme Court's ruling granting absolute broad immunity to presidents for official acts affected Trump's guilty verdict. However, former defendants who have been sentenced in Merchan's courtroom have said that the toughness of the sentences he imposes depends entirely on how respectful a defendant is toward both Merchan and the legal process as a whole. And after the former president repeatedly attacked the judge overseeing his case, his daughter and numerous witnesses, Merchan imposed a gag order, only for him to violate that on 10 separate occasions.

(WSVN) - Former President Donald Trump is in damage control mode on the heels of a pledge to change Florida’s strict new abortion law. At an event in Michigan, Trump expressed his support for last year’s Supreme Court overturning of Roe vs. Wade. “We have abortion, we have the whole thing brought back to the states, where it belongs,” he said. “That’s where everybody wanted it for years and years.” On Friday, the Trump campaign attempted to clarify recent remarks made by the former commander in chief on abortion and on an upcoming amendment on Florida’s ballot. An NBC News reporter asked Trump whether or not he will vote in favor of Amendment 4. He suggested that he plans to vote yes. “I’m voting that – I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said. A yes vote would overturn the state’s current ban on abortion after six weeks. “If you go back 10 years, 15 years, all they wanted to do is, they wanted [abortion] back in the states; they didn’t want it to be in the federal government,” he said. “I was able to do that. I believe in exceptions for the life of the mother, If you look, incest, rape.”‘ But in a statement, Trump’s team attempted to rework those remarks. In a statement, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt wrote the 78-year-old “has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida,” adding that he “simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short.” However, Trump’s response to NBC News does not seem to align with his campaign’s statement. A spokesperson for the campaign of his Democratic presidential opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was quick to pounce. “He has bragged openly about how he supports the decision of what the court did, and so, it is comical that Donald Trump would talk about women’s reproductive health,” said the spokesperson. Abortion has been a hot issue state by state for Republicans since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. “They celebrated for a while, but then they lost a lot of seats in 2022 that they would have won otherwise in the midterm elections, and it’s really catch up to Donald Trump now in the presidential race,” said a scholar with the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Anna Hochkammer with the Florida Women’s Freedom Coalition also weighed in on the issue. Se said the welcomes the former president’s support for Amendment 4. “I think he can see the same polling that we can see,” she said. “He said that he is going to be voting for more weeks. Well, in Florida, we’ve got a binary in front of us: yes on Amendment 4, or let the six-week cruel ban stand, so I think we have a pretty clear answer about his position, and interestingly, it’s a position that resonates with the vast majority of people across the state of Florida.” Trump also publicly pledged to fund in-vitro fertilization for women, despite U.S. Senate Republicans having recently blocked legislation that would have made it a right nationwide for women to access IVF. Friday afternoon, Trump addressed his position on abortion during a campaign appearance in Pennsylvania. He reiterated he is still in favor of more weeks beyond Florida’s current six-week ban, but because he believes Democrats are too radical, he will be voting no.

Given the pro-Israel bias of the bill’s supporters, it’s likely the lessons in question aren’t anti-Jewish, but rather critical of Israel, and the bill is designed to quiet dissent during the U.S.-funded genocide in Gaza. I find the view that Jews require special oversight of ethnic studies curriculum both anti-Semitic and racist. Stevie Schwartz Berkeley Trump isn’t fit to be commander in chief Re: “Trump tries to tie Harris to the Afghanistan withdrawal” (Page A3, Aug. 27). As a Vietnam War-era veteran, I have friends buried at Arlington National Cemetery. More so, I have been a pallbearer for funerals in that dignified and hallowed ground. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, considered national cemeteries such as Gettysburg to have been consecrated by the soldiers who died fighting for democracy during the Civil War. I cannot fathom why any veteran or current service member would not be outraged at the low moral standard our current Republican presidential candidate has shown by using the graves of fallen heroes to make political photo-ops for his campaign. Donald Trump is not fit to ever be called commander-in-chief again.

Republican state representative Carolina Amesty, 29, was charged with forgery, uttering a forgery, false acknowledgment or certification by a notary public and notarizing your own signature, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The charges are in connection with her time as an administrator at Central Christian University in Orange County, Florida, which her father runs, according to the Sentinel. State Attorney Andrew Bain said a “concerned citizen brought potential criminal wrongdoing” to his office’s attention. “That information was presented to the grand jury who found sufficient evidence to return an indictment,” Bain said. “I am committed to upholding fairness and justice in every case by applying the law equally to everyone and my record reflects this dedication.” Amesty released a statement before turning herself in to the Orange County Jail on Thursday. Amesty faces up to twenty years in prison for the four felony charges. “This prosecution, initiated just a few weeks prior to absentee ballots being dropped, is based on misleading reports from a partisan newspaper about a notarization of an employee verification background report, the truth of the contents which have not been questioned in any manner,” Amesty wrote. “Rep. Amesty calls for a speedy trial, looks forward to her day in court, and is confident of her public vindication,” she continued. The indictment follows major investigations into Amesty’s past by the Sentinel. The outlet published a report earlier this year claiming that Amesty notarized a form in 2021 that claimed Robert Shaffer, a long-time educator, was an employee at Central Christian. But Shaffer said that he has never worked at the school, and never signed any forms indicating he did, the Sentinel reported. The Orlando outlet also reported that Amesty filed false information with the state about Central Christian; failed to ensure taxes were paid on her $1.3 million home; and falsely claimed to run a successful restaurant, among other allegations. Amesty later called the Sentinel’s investigation a “hit job” based on “misunderstandings.” The Republican lawmaker is a staunch ally of Donald Trump. She met her fiancé at a 2020 rally for the former president, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The Independent has contacted Amesty’s office for comment.","summary":"The 29-year-old lawmaker says she ‘looks forward’ to her day in court","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/florida-maga-republican-carolina-amesty-b2604768.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/30/22/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:29:54","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":255306720,"title":"Missouri Man Arrested for Allegedly Threatening to Kill Trump, Republicans, Police Officers","text":"A Missouri man is facing federal charges following a series of alleged violent threats made via social media against former President Donald Trump, Republicans at large, and law enforcement officers, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Western District of Missouri on Aug. 30. Justin Lee White, 36, is accused of using interstate communication to spread a slew of online threats to injure Trump, Republicans, and law enforcement in violation of federal law, culminating in a multi-agency investigation led by the FBI, according to the complaint. The FBI said in the criminal complaint that from late July to August, White allegedly posted multiple messages on platforms like TikTok and Facebook threatening violence if his demands regarding supposed electoral fairness were not met. According to the complaint, one of White’s videos around July 31 said, “This goes to every Republican out there. You don’t start playing fair with them votes, I’ll start showing up with a gun, I promise you. I’ll show you what real [expletive] violence is, and I’m not afraid to kill you or a [expletive] cop. So, if you want to play dirty at the votes this year, in 2024, just remember, where I come from, we get physical. So, if you Republicans don’t play fair, there will be guns and violence involved this year.” The TikTok video was captioned, “This is a message to Donald Trump and the Republicans. If you don’t play...” The Springfield, Missouri, Police Department received a tip about the TikTok video—and forwarded the tip and video to the FBI for further action. Upon closer examination, law enforcement said they discovered additional threatening posts on the suspect’s Facebook page. In one post dated Aug. 22, White allegedly included a photograph of a firearm and ammunition, warning that any police officer who approached his residence would be met with violence. The complaint describes these posts as containing explicit threats to “kill” and “beat the [expletive] life out” of police officers. The tip led to a search warrant being executed at White’s residence on Aug. 29, where FBI agents said they recovered firearms, ammunition, and further evidence supporting the charges. During his subsequent arrest and interview, White allegedly admitted to creating the threatening posts and expressed regret, adding that he had “[expletive] up” in posting the content out of anger. Authorities said he described getting into a shooting altercation with a police officer when he was around 16 or 17 years old, saying he “beat” the case because the officer had allegedly shot at him first. He allegedly said that this incident and other videos where cops were allegedly “aggressive or violent toward members of society” made him hate cops. White is in custody and faces up to five years in prison if convicted and/or a fine of $250,000, according to the complaint. A preliminary and detention hearing is set for Sept. 5. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri had no further comment at this time, and an attorney listed as representing White did not respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times before publication.","summary":"Justin White is accused of making multiple threats against Republican officials and police officers in social media posts from late July through August.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/missouri-man-arrested-for-allegedly-threatening-to-kill-trump-republicans-police-officers-5715921","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/13/id5704790-GettyImages-1242409189-1-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:27:44","author":"Chase Smith","authors":["Chase Smith"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":255305988,"title":"North Carolina Dem AG Josh Stein viewed more favorably than GOP Lieutenant Gov. Mark Robinson: poll","text":"(The Center Square) – Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson struggles to maintain the approval of voters in North Carolina, even from those within his own party. While 30% hold a very or somewhat favorable view of Robinson, his opponent, Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein, garners 44% favorability. This is according to a new Elon University Poll, which asked 1,095 registered voters in North Carolina about issues related to both the presidential and gubernatorial campaigns. The survey was conducted from Aug. 2 to 9, and the margin of error is +/-3.86%. With just days until absentee ballots go out in North Carolina, Robinson’s popularity, or lack thereof, looks even more stark. While half of state voters hold unfavorable views of Robinson, just 29% felt the same about Stein. Though North Carolina voters regularly choose Republican candidates for president, its downballot races often swing Democratic. Currently, the state’s governor, attorney general and secretary of state are all Democrats. In the last 100 years, only four Republicans have held the governor’s seat. While Stein’s favorability is comparable to Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads the Democratic ticket, the poll found that a 16% favorability difference exists between former Robinson and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Professor Jason Husser, director of the Elon University Poll, told The Center Square that some of the poll’s findings show how voters splitting their tickets could hurt Robinson. “The bad news for Robinson in this is that Republicans are more than twice as likely than Democrats to be in those ticket splitter groups,” he said. “Sixteen percent of Republicans were ticket splitters and 6% of Democrats. Making matters worse, 39% of Independents are ticket splitters.” Husser said this could be problematic because though Independents often choose Republicans, they are a decisive subset of voters for North Carolina elections. “[Independents] are how Republicans are able to win statewide elections, despite being a smaller registered, registered voting group than Democrats,” Husser said. Most Independents polled said they viewed Robinson unfavorably, while 27% said they did not view Stein favorably. Political advertising likely plays a role in the candidates’ favorability gap. Stein’s fundraising has outpaced Robinson’s significantly, with the attorney general bringing in more than double the amount of money. Sixty percent of all of Stein’s donors have come from out-of-state, compared with Robinson’s 40%. Polls released last week were mixed on how much Stein leads Robinson, with some as much as an 11-percentage point spread to as little as 4 percentage points.","summary":"While 30% hold a very or somewhat favorable view of Robinson, his opponent, Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein, garners 44% favorability.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/north-carolina-dem-ag-josh-stein-viewed-more-favorably-than-gop-lieutenant-gov-mark-robinson-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88603419.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:24:46","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.658},{"id":255306134,"title":"Trump claims that migrant children are either being trafficked for sex, lost, or deceased because of Kamala Harris","text":"On Friday, ex-President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of the border situation, claiming that many children who entered the US unlawfully since he departed the White House have been exploited as sex slaves, gone missing, or even died. Trump told a rally audience in battleground Pennsylvania that the Democratic presidential nominee, who serves as President Biden’s point person on addressing a surge in illegal crossings, bears responsibility for roughly 325,000 minors whose whereabouts are unknown to federal officials. “Think of the number — 325,000 children are missing. Many are dead. Many are involved in sex operations. Many are working as slaves in different parts of probably this country,” the Republican presidential candidate said in Johnstown. “She was the border czar,” Trump added. “Now she says, ‘I wasn’t the border czar,’ but she was. It was headlines — ‘border czar’, ‘border czar’ — but now she doesn’t want that term. But whether she was border czar or not, she was in charge of the border. 325,000 children are missing.” The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general issued a report last week saying that 232,000 migrants under age 18 have either failed to show up for immigration court hearings or were released from custody but have yet to be contacted for subsequent proceedings. Unaccompanied migrant children were allowed to remain in the United States upon crossing the border illegally beginning shortly after Biden took office — at a time when most others were summarily expelled under a temporary COVID-19-era health policy that under Trump also applied to minors. Biden’s aides described the policy as humane, but Republicans argued it could lead to even greater numbers of unaccompanied minors — many of them in their late teens — crossing into the country. Investigative reporting revealed that many unaccompanied minors were placed by the Department of Health and Human Services with businessmen who treated them like indentured servants and put them to work rather than into school. Some were forced to clean sharp equipment in slaughterhouses in overnight shifts. Over time, the administration allowed most family units and single adults to remain in the United States as they pursue asylum from alleged persecution in badly backlogged proceedings. After six months of waiting, asylum seekers are entitled to work permits. Illegal crossings hit all-time record highs in each year of Harris’ tenure in charge of stemming the crisis — totaling nearly 2.5 million in fiscal 2023 — though recent monthly apprehensions have trended downward since Biden in June issued an order allowing for caps on the processing of illegal entrants. Harris defended herself in a Monday interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, saying she had made some progress. “The root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president, has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we’ve began that work,” she said. But Trump slammed his rival Friday for allegedly fueling the crisis by allowing most unlawful entrants to stay in America — after Biden repudiated his predecessor’s “Remain in Mexico” policy requiring them to await asylum rulings elsewhere. “She created a fast pass entry program to speed the admission of illegals into all of our ports of entry,” Trump charged in Johnstown. “Now they have a new line, ‘We created a strong border’. They keep saying it over and over. The worst border in history, but they think, if they keep saying it over and over …” Trump added that the influx of migrants could harm social safety net programs — especially if legislation proposed by Biden and Harris passed allowing a pathway to citizenship for most people present illegally. “Kamala vowed to grant, remember, mass amnesty and citizenship to all of the millions of illegals that she let in, which will obliterate Medicare and obliterate your Social Security for seniors,” Trump said. He also said migrants pose a threat to public safety, musing that “typically when you have tic-tac-toe boards [tattooed] on your forehead it’s not a good thing.” Harris spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Trump invoked the plight of migrant children after facing years of criticism for presiding over the forced separation of families, including about 5,000 children during then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ “zero tolerance” approach of prosecuting adults who illegally crossed the border. As of last year, about 1,000 of those children remained separated from their parents, though just 81 of them had parents who hadn’t been located.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Friday, ex-President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump claims that migrant children are either being trafficked for sex, lost, or deceased because of Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-claims-that-migrant-children-are-either-being-trafficked-for-sex-lost-or-deceased-because-of-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trump-says-migrant-kids-are-sex-slaves-missing-or-dead.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:21:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":255305954,"title":"Trump Moves To Contain Fallout Of Abortion, IVF Rows","text":"Republican White House nominee Donald Trump sought Friday to contain the blast radius of a fierce backlash over his remarks publicly backing away from right-wing positions on reproductive rights.The ex-president has been under fire from conservatives over an announcement that in a second term he would ensure free in vitro fertilization -- an expensive fertility procedure that many in the anti-abortion movement want to see curbed.The rift widened as he hit out at his home state Florida's six-week abortion ban, calling it too restrictive and suggesting he planned to vote for an upcoming ballot measure that would make the procedure legal until a fetus becomes viable.Trump, 78, walked back the comment ahead of a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Friday, telling Fox News that \"I will be voting no.\"But conservatives had already begun criticizing Trump's ever-shifting positions on abortion, with a new Republican policy platform dropping calls for a national ban and the tycoon's recent claim that his government would be \"great\" for reproductive rights.The pushback from anti-abortion groups on his latest remarks was swift, with activists warning that he risks alienating his base.Evangelical theologian Albert Mohler said Trump's positions appeared \"almost calculated to alienate pro-life voters\" while conservative commentator Erick Erickson posted that Trump's abortion stance \"will be a bridge too far for too many.\"Trump's rally, in Johnstown, was notable for the absence of any remarks on reproductive rights, despite Thursday's big IVF announcement. The campaign of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was happy to weigh in on the issue, smelling blood in the water. \"The majority of Americans support abortion access, they support IVF, they support contraception,\" Mini Timmaraju, of the Reproductive Freedom for All lobby group, told reporters in a campaign call.\"(Trump) has finally figured it out, and he'll do anything to distract from his abysmal, horrifying record on this issue.\"Trump has been all over the map on abortion in the last 15 years, initially describing himself as \"pro-choice\" before calling for \"some form of punishment\" for women seeking the procedure. He boasts about appointing Supreme Court justices who ended federal protections for abortion access in 2022 but has more recently begun to worry that Republicans are out of step with the majority of voters on reproductive rights.His IVF pledge appeared calculated to appeal to moderates but will upset conservatives who for years opposed Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act because they were against the redistributive economics of taxpayer-funded health insurance. Almost every Senate Republican voted against assuring IVF access in a vote in June in any case, and more than half of the House Republican lawmakers have sponsored legislation that threatens its legality. Republicans are divided on fertility treatments such as IVF, with many hailing them as a boost to American families. Others, with strong beliefs that life begins at conception, oppose IVF because the procedure can produce multiple embryos, not all of which get used.Abortion rights activists worry that the Supreme Court decision threatens IVF and were given cause by a February ruling in Alabama that frozen embryos could be considered people, causing several clinics to briefly pause treatments.Yet if the abortion and IVF rows threatened to alienate Trump's most loyal supporters, rally-goers in Johnstown weren't showing it.\"It's not enough to make me not vote for him, no way, because he is pro-life,\" said Lisa Davis, a 54-year-old retired office manager from the nearby town of Somerset.\"I know he wants to give some exceptions -- and I think there should be.\"\"Why should I pay with my tax dollars for a baby getting killed?\" added retired nurse Rosemary Drzal, 69.Trump was due to head to the capital Washington later Friday to speak to the powerful conservative group Moms for Liberty.","summary":"Republican White House nominee Donald Trump sought Friday to contain the blast radius of a fierce backlash over his remarks publicly backing away from right-wing positions on reproductive rights.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-moves-contain-fallout-abortion-ivf-rows-3741402","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4544664/former-us-president-republican-white-house-candidate-donald-trump-speaks-rally-johnstown.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:21:21","author":"Michael Mathes With Sarah Titterton","authors":["Michael Mathes With Sarah Titterton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":255305818,"title":"Trump says migrant kids are sex slaves, missing or dead due to Kamala Harris","text":"Former President Donald Trump said Friday that thousands of children who entered the US illegally since he left office are working as sex slaves, missing or dead due to Vice President Kamala Harris — making one of his most forceful denunciations yet of her performance as border czar.

Whether it's trend, a drug war, that remains to be seen,\" Coffman told Fox News, after a video of armed gang members went viral.On Friday, the city announced that it was seeking a court order to clear the apartments by declaring them a \"criminal nuisance\".That criminal nuisance was reportedly the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua (TdA), who were operating in the area.The video in question showed men with assault rifles busting down doors of an apartment unit in the city.Aurora's police department said Thursday that it had set up a special task force to address concerns about the Venezuelan gang members and other criminal activity linked to migrants in the area.\"We are aware that components of TdA are operating in Aurora. APD has been increasingly collecting evidence to show the gang is connected to crimes in the area,\" the department said.The TdA began as a prison gang in Aragua, Venezuela, before expanding rapidly in recent years, according to the U.S. Department of State, focusing on human trafficking and other abuses of desperate migrants.The gang is accused of smuggling women and girls for sexual exploitation, killing them if they try to escape.Members of that group are now allegedly operating in Aurora, with the mayor blaming federal policies for allowing the situation to develop—an idea backed up by Donald Trump.\"These stupid people that we have leading our country are allowing these people, these criminals to come into our country, and we've got to get them the hell out of here,\" Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday.Aurora PD said it believed the influence of TdA was isolated to the buildings in question, adding that it was working with federal and state partners, including the DEA.Newsweek reached out to the DEA for further comment Friday, with the agency referring to comments made on Denver 7 by its Field Division Special Agent in Charge for Rocky Mountain, Jonathan Pullen.\"It is not appropriate for DEA to offer any additional comments on the organization's role or presence in the region due to the ongoing, active investigative work being conducted by our agents and law enforcement partners,\" Pullen said.Mayor Coffman said in a post on Facebook Friday that the city was waiting for a municipal judge to issue a court order, which would then give back control to property owners.\"The problems associated with Venezuelan gang activity has been isolated to properties that are all under the same out-of-state ownership whose problems with code violations and criminal activity preceded the migrant crisis,\" the mayor said.\"I strongly believe that the best course of action is to shut these building down and make sure that this never happens again.\"The Denver Gazette reported that, according to residents of the building, the real managers disappeared when violence began.When speaking to Fox News earlier this week, the mayor, a Republican, said the gang's presence was the result of \"failed policy\" at the southwest border, as well as being close to Denver, a sanctuary city.Newsweek reached out to the mayor's office Friday for further comment, as well as the building's management company, CBZ Management.A spokesperson for Colorado's Democratic Governor, Jared Polis, told Newsweek on Friday that the state had been \"ready for weeks\" to back up any police operation to tackle the problem.\"Colorado is a zero-tolerance state for illegal activity, taking over buildings has no place in Colorado, and the Governor believes that the city of Aurora shares this basic value and will enforce the law,\" the spokesperson said.\"Over the last month, Governor Polis has been in regular contact with the City of Aurora and the Aurora Police Department and has offered all state assistance to support their efforts if requested.\"In July, the Biden administration sanctioned the gang, while also offering a reward totaling $12 million for any information that led to the capture and/or conviction of multiple leaders of the group.Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

On Thursday, the former president told NBC News that the state’s recently-enacted ban on abortions at six weeks of pregnancy is “too short” and that he wants “more weeks.” If Florida voters approve Amendment 4 on their ballots this fall, the state’s constitution would be amended to state that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” The amendment would effectively overturn the six-week ban that Trump said he opposes. However, the Republican presidential candidate told Fox News on Friday that he plans to vote against it. “So I think six weeks, you need more time. Six weeks, I disagreed with that from the early primaries, when I heard about it,” he said. “At the same time, the Democrats are radical, because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the nine months,” added Trump, who then repeated his false claim that states allow doctors to “execute a baby after birth.” He said he would vote against the measure for that reason. Trump’s description of Florida’s amendment – the “Right to Abortion Initiative” — is also wrong. If passed, the amendment would prevent the state from passing any law that bans abortion care at any point in a pregnancy, before a fetus is viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks. The state would also be prohibited from enacting any law that criminalizes emergency abortion care at any point during a pregnancy. The former president’s conflicting statements on reproductive healthcare over the last 25 years have drawn criticism from both abortion rights supporters and his anti-abortion allies. Florida’s six-week ban – a point before many women even know they are pregnant — was only possible after the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v Wade. Trump routinely takes credit for that decision, after he appointed three conservative justices to the nine-member court who voted to reverse the 50-year precedent. A radically reshaped federal judiciary under his administration has also supported anti-abortion measures that included threats to emergency care and widely used abortion drugs. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, recently rejected Democratic legislation to protect IVF access. And his allies in Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also supported federal anti-abortion laws and so-called “fetal personhood” language that is now baked into the GOP’s official 2024 platform. Trump’s allies behind Project 2025, a right-wing think tank’s blueprint for his administration, would also effectively outlaw abortion drugs and strip access to birth control and fertility treatments. In response to Trump’s latest comments, Vice President Kamala Harris said that her White House rival made his position on abortion “very clear”, and underscored her plan to enshrine abortion rights protections into federal law. “He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant,” she said in a statement through her campaign. “So, of course he thinks it’s a ‘beautiful thing’ that women in Florida and across the country are being turned away from emergency rooms, face life-threatening situations, and are forced to travel hundreds of miles for the care they need.” She added: “I trust women to make their own health care decisions and believe the government should never come between a woman and her doctor.” Earlier on Friday, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump’s attempts to amend his record on abortion and in vitro fertlization as “gaslighting” and “smoke and mirrors.” “American women are not stupid,” she said during a press call for Harris’s campaign. The former president will “do anything to distract from his abysmal, horrifying record on this issue,” added Reproductive Freedom for All president Mini Timmaraju. “It’s desperation and it’s lies,” she said. Harris’s campaign, meanwhile, is launching a 50-stop bus tour to promote reproductive healthcare access — and making its first stop in Trump’s backyard of Palm Beach, Florida, on September 3. Florida is among more than a dozen states that have outlawed all or most abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision. Since earlier this year, Florida’s six-week ban makes it a felony to perform or actively participate in an abortion in the state after roughly six weeks’ gestation, or about two weeks after a missed period. Voters in at least 10 states will vote on abortion rights measures this November, including measures that could enshrine a right to seek abortion care in their states’ constitutions.","summary":"The former president will vote against an amendment that would overturn an abortion ban that he says he opposes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-florida-abortion-ban-desantis-b2604783.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/30/23/247672f6da10468593723ff043734da4.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PqTPhVzD-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:14:09","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":255305858,"title":"Behind Donald Trump's IVF plan, reproductive rights comments","text":"Behind Donald Trump's IVF plan, reproductive rights comments Former President Donald Trump is suggesting the government and insurance companies should pay for in vitro fertilization.

Trump cleared the air a day after he criticized the Sunshine State’s six-week abortion ban, and appeared to suggest he was open to voting in favor of the ballot measure aimed at overturning the law. “I think 6 weeks, you need more time than 6 weeks. I’ve disagreed with that from the early primaries when I heard about,” Trump told Fox News in a Friday interview before his Pennsylvania rally. “At the same time, the Democrats are radical because the 9 months is just a ridiculous situation. You can do an abortion in the 9th month,” Trump went on. “Some of the states like Minnesota and other states have it where you could actually execute the baby after birth — All of that stuff is unacceptable so I will be voting no for that reason.” Floridians will vote on Amendment 4 in November, which would provide a state constitutional right to abortion before viability. The measure will require 60% of voters to agree to the measure to pass. The former president, a Florida resident, first commented on Thursday that he thought the current 6-week law is “too short,” sparking speculation that he would vote for the amendment. “I think the six week is too short. It has to be more time,” Trump told NBC News. “I want more weeks.” “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” Trump added on Thursday. His campaign quickly issued a statement following his remarks clarifying that he did not yet indicate how he would be voting on the amendment. “President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida, he simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,” Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. He has also previously spoken out against the 6-week ban, which was signed into law by Florida Gov.

Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss urged the U.S. District Court in Manhattan to force Giuliani to turn over his Madison Avenue apartment, any remaining cash and some of his prized New York Yankees memorabilia, including three World Series rings and a signed Joe DiMaggio shirt. Freeman and Moss also staked a claim to about $2 million Giuliani has said Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign owes him and they sought to take control of another Giuliani property — his Palm Beach, Florida, condominium — through another legal mechanism known as receivership. Freeman and Moss, the mother and daughter targeted by Giuliani in the wake of Trump’s 2020 election loss, are looking to chip away at what the ex-mayor owes them following the collapse last month of his bankruptcy case, which had paused collection. If Giuliani does not turn over his property in a timely fashion, Freeman and Moss’ lawyers said they will see other remedies to wrest control, citing his history of “evasion, obstruction, and outright disobedience.” “That strategy reaches the end of the line here,” lawyer Aaron Nathan wrote. Giuliani spokesperson Ted Goodman criticized Friday’s filing as a step “designed to harass and intimidate the mayor” while he’s appealing the “objectively unreasonable” judgment. “This lawsuit has always been designed to censor and bully the mayor, and to deter others from exercising their right to speak up and to speak out,” Goodman said. He contends that the “the justice system has been weaponized” against Giuliani “and so many others for strictly partisan political purposes.” Giuliani, a longtime Trump ally, filed for bankruptcy last December just days after the eye-popping damages award to Freeman and Moss. The women said Giuliani’s unfounded attacks on them after Trump narrowly lost Georgia to Joe Biden led to death threats that made them fear for their lives. As Giuliani’s bankruptcy case played out, Freeman and Moss’ lawyers accused him of using the process as a “bad-faith litigation tactic” and a “pause button on his woes.” Creditors accused him of flouting bankruptcy laws and potentially hiding assets. Troubled by Giuliani’s repeated “uncooperative conduct,” self-dealing, and a lack of transparency, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane decided in July to dismiss the case. Lane labeled Giuliani a “recalcitrant debtor” and said he had thumbed his nose at the bankruptcy process while seeking to shield himself from the defamation judgment and other debts. Among Lane’s concerns were that Giuliani funneled his income — including at least $15,000 a month from his now-canceled talk radio show — into companies he owned; never reported any income from those entities; failed to disclose that he had started promoting his own “Rudy Coffee” brand; and was late to disclose a contract he has to write a book. The bankruptcy dismissal cleared the way for Giuliani’s creditors – chief among them Freeman and Moss – to pursue legal remedies to recoup at least some of the money they’re owed. It also freed Giuliani to pursue his appeal of the defamation verdict. Soon after the bankruptcy case ended, Freeman and Moss’ lawyers said they filed paperwork regarding the judgment, placed liens on Giuliani’s New York and Florida properties and sent him a subpoena demanding information about his assets. Giuliani had not responded to the subpoena as of Friday, the lawyers said. Giuliani has been trying to sell his Manhattan co-op apartment for more than a year, amid mounting debt and legal woes. Initially listed for $6.5 million in July 2023, the asking price has since fallen to $5.7 million. During the bankruptcy case, he said the Palm Beach condominium had been appraised at $3.5 million. In addition to his homes, cash and Yankees mementos, Freeman and Moss are also seeking to take about two dozen of Giuliani’s watches, a diamond ring, costume jewelry, a TV, various items of furniture and a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL500. The items, including autographed Reggie Jackson and Yankee Stadium pictures, would then be auctioned off with proceeds going to Freeman and Moss, their lawyers said. All told, the property and cash the women are seeking could be worth somewhere north of $10 million – a sizeable sum, but just a small fraction of what they are owed. The potential loss of his possessions is one of a host of legal woes consuming the 80-year-old Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor and 2008 Republican presidential candidate who was once heralded as “America’s Mayor” for his calm and steady leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In July, he was disbarred as an attorney in New York after a court found he repeatedly made false statements about Trump’s 2020 election loss. He is also facing the possibility of losing his law license in Washington, D.C., after a board in May recommended that he be disbarred. In Georgia and Arizona, Giuliani is facing criminal charges over his role in the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases. When he filed for bankruptcy, Giuliani listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including the $148 million owed to Freeman and Moss, almost $1 million in state and federal tax liabilities and money he owed lawyers. He estimated he had assets worth $1 million to $10 million. In his most recent financial filings, he said he had about $94,000 cash in hand at the end of May while his company, Giuliani Communications, had about $237,000 in the bank. A main source of income for Giuliani has been a retirement account with a balance of just over $1 million in May, down from nearly $2.5 million in 2022. In May, he spent nearly $33,000 including nearly $28,000 for condo and co-op costs for his Florida and New York homes. He also spent about $850 on food, $390 on cleaning services, $230 on medicine, $200 on laundry and $190 on vehicles.","summary":"Lawyers for two former Georgia election workers asked a court to force Giuliani to turn over his Madison Avenue apartment and other assets, including some prized memorabilia.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10727662/rudy-giuliani-assets-lawsuit-defamation/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024071314078-6692c2fa60536bd2ab31300ajpeg_4c2027.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:06:49","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":255306150,"title":"In reversal, Trump won't back Florida abortion ban repeal amendment","text":"Donald Trump announced his opposition to a Florida ballot initiative to restore some abortion access in the state after it enacted a restrictive six-week ban, providing a long-awaited final answer to a question he publicly flip-flopped on. “I’ll be voting no,” Trump told Fox News on Friday, falsely claiming that Democrat-led states were allowing abortions “in the ninth month” and “after birth,” while adding that he didn’t fully agree with the state’s current six-week ban, which has few exceptions in cases of rape or incest, requiring additional legal and medical documentation. The comments were somewhat of a reversal from a Thursday statement on the initiative, in which he seemed to endorse the idea that the state’s current abortion ban called for more legal protections for women. “I'm going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,\" Trump said when asked about the measure, which would have superseded Governor Ron Desantis’ six-week abortion ban, which went into effect in May. Trump’s comments sparked massive backlash from the conservative, pro-life factions that form the core of his support, prompting his campaign to issue a sudden backtrack on Thursday evening. The flip-flop is one of many instances in which Trump has taken opposing positions on abortion policy since he took credit for ending Roe v. Wade. Trump, who takes policy cues from multiple groups calling for a nationwide abortion ban, has at times claimed he would veto such a policy, a promise that garnered scrutiny from pro-choice politicians. Trump’s Republican National Committee platform, released in July, also included anti-choice “fetal personhood” language, suggesting that the former president supported an abortion ban nationwide.","summary":"A day after criticizing the state's restrictive 6-week abortion ban, Trump announced he'll vote to keep it","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/08/30/in-reversal-wont-back-florida-abortion-ban-repeal-amendment/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/donald_trump_2163538844.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 23:03:41","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.536},{"id":255306596,"title":"Trump says he will vote against Florida’s abortion initiative","text":"After weeks of not providing a direct answer, former President Donald Trump said in an interview today that he will vote against Florida’s abortion amendment in November. During an interview with Fox News, Trump was asked about his stance on Amendment 4, which would protect abortion access in the state. Trump responded by saying that Democrats had a “radical” stance on abortion and claimed that their stance would allow abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy. “I’ll be voting no for that reason,” Trump said in the interview. The argument that the amendment will allow abortions up “until birth” has been repeated frequently by conservative opponents, though health care practitioners say that abortions past the point of viability happen rarely, and when they do happen, tend to be related to potentially fatal health complications for the fetus or mother. Trump’s announcement was quickly celebrated by anti-abortion groups, including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. In a statement, the organization’s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, said, “We thank President Trump for shedding light on how extreme this measure is and call on all Republican leaders in Florida to follow the president’s example.” Amendment 4 says in part that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health.” If passed, it would essentially invalidate Florida’s ban on most abortions after six weeks. Trump’s comments today came one day after he sidestepped a direct answer on his stance on the amendment but said he would be voting that “we need more than six weeks,” referring to Florida’s current law.

But they also suggested it was a missed opportunity that the vice president can quickly put right. Her overall performance received positive reviews. When 294 viewers were asked for their one-word review, the most common were ‘presidential’ and ‘smart.’ After avoiding interviews for more than a month, the vice president sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash as well as her running mate Tim Walz to answer questions in a Georgia restaurant on Thursday. J.L. Partners asked a representative sample of viewers: ‘Kamala Harris did the interview with her running mate, and has not sat for a solo interview since she has been named the nominee. How do you think this makes Kamala Harris look?’ Unimpressed was the overall answer. ‘I think it kind of makes her look bad because I really think she should sit down and have this interview so everyone in the world can see her point of view and where she’s coming from, said 52-year-old female restaurant manager from Texas, who plans to vote for Harris in November. Another Harris voter from Massachusetts said she worried that it makes her look ‘as though she’s not fit to be president.’ However, others also said delaying the interview made her look ‘busy’ and Walz made look part of a ‘team.’ James Johnson, co-founder of J.L. Partners which conducted the snap survey after the interview aired, said there were positives for Harris and for Walz. ‘Voters split by party on their views of how Harris did but they agree on one thing: Harris looked weak for not appearing solo,’ he said. ‘Voters felt she came across quite well in the interview, so it was a mistake not to appear solo straight away. ‘This, though, is something the campaign can dispel quite easily by putting her up for a solo interview soon—it doesn’t feel like something that is going to dominate the campaign.’ Harris fended off questions about flip-flopping on her policy positions, as she confirmed she no longer wanted to ban fracking and that there should be ‘consequences’ for people who cross the border illegally. ‘I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,’ Harris said. The interview got the all-star treatment from CNN, with an on-screen countdown clock and excerpts released ahead of its 9pm broadcast time. Viewers responded with a collective ‘meh.’ When asked for the most memorable moment or issue, the words dominating the resulting word cloud were: Nothing, questions and Trump. Johnson said Harris had cleared a hurdle, without messing anything up. ‘Voters shrugged at the CNN interview last night—it hardly gripped the nation, with “nothing” being the most common response when viewers were asked what they noticed most,’ he said. ‘But in a campaign where views of Harris are already broadly positive and they need to avoid gaffes, the Harris-Walz campaign can notch that up as a win. ‘She was seen by some as presidential and smart during the interview, while others said she was fake and liberal, hesitations that still lurk in voters’ minds when it comes to Harris.’ A 62-year-old retired man from Louisiana who voted Trump in 2020 but plans to vote for Harris now said: ‘From what I saw, I think she cares about this country more than Donald Trump.’ Otherwise a lot of the reactions broke down along party lines in the sample. ‘Approachable, even headed. She kept to her points pretty well,’ said a 36-year-old Harris supporter from Michigan. But a Trump voter in New Jersey said: ‘She was given softball questions and she gave softball answers.’ And Trump 2020 voter in Ohio who has yet to make up his mind this time around said: ‘She came across as a normal politician, fake and only worried about getting votes to stay in power.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris looked &#8216;weak&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; for waiting weeks and then sitting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Audience thinks Harris appeared timid while appearing with running mate in CNN interview first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/audience-thinks-harris-appeared-timid-while-appearing-with-running-mate-in-cnn-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1725058681_rewrite-this-title-Viewers-say-Harris-looked-WEAK-for-appearing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:58:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":255305396,"title":"New Trump documentary ‘The Apprentice’ secures distributor and will release prior to the election","text":"NEW YORK – After struggling to drum up interest following its Cannes Film Festival premiere, “The Apprentice,” starring Sebastian Stan as a young Donald Trump, has found a distributor that plans to release the film shortly before the election in November. Briarcliff Entertainment will release “The Apprentice” on Oct. 11 in U.S. and Canadian theaters, just weeks before Americans cast their ballots on Nov. 5. Director Ali Abbasi, the Danish Iranian filmmaker, had prioritized getting “The Apprentice” into theaters before voters head to the polls. After larger studios and film distributors opted not to bid on the film, Abbasi complained in early June on X that “for some reason certain power people in your country don’t want you to see it!!!” Steven Cheung, communications director for the Trump campaign, in a statement Friday called the film’s release “election interference by Hollywood elites right before November.” “This ‘film’ is pure malicious defamation, should never see the light of day, and doesn’t even deserve a place in the straight-to-DVD section of a bargain bin at a soon-to-be-closed discount movie store, it belongs in a dumpster fire,” Cheung said. Part of what dampened interest in “The Apprentice” was the potential threat of legal action. After its Cannes premiere in May, Cheung called the movie “pure fiction” and said the Trump team would file a lawsuit “to address the blatantly false assertions from these pretend filmmakers.” “The Apprentice” chronicles Trump’s rise to power in New York real estate under the tutelage of defense attorney Roy Cohn (played by Jeremy Strong). Late in the movie, Trump is depicted raping his wife, Ivana Trump (played by Maria Bakalova ). In Ivana Trump’s 1990 divorce deposition, she stated that Trump raped her. Trump denied the allegation and Ivana Trump later said she didn’t mean it literally, but rather that she had felt violated. Abbasi has argued Trump might not dislike the movie. “I would offer to go and meet him wherever he wants and talk about the context of the movie, have a screening and have a chat afterwards, if that’s interesting to anyone at the Trump campaign,” Abbasi said in May. Briarcliff Entertainment has released films including the 2022 documentary “Gabby Giffords Won’t Back Down” and the Liam Neeson thriller “Memory.” The indie distributor is run by Tom Ortenberg, who at Lionsgate helped released Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11” and as chief executive of Open Road backed the best picture Oscar winner “Spotlight.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – After struggling to drum up interest following its Cannes&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Trump documentary &#8216;The Apprentice&#8217; secures distributor and will release prior to the election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-trump-documentary-the-apprentice-secures-distributor-and-will-release-prior-to-the-election/","image":"https://www.ksat.com/resizer/UY_mSdRePrFUBlB8IDtCGt6u2zk=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/MXBWPWQF2FBJZFOB7JUYGMTW2A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:55:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":255306284,"title":"Moms for Liberty features ‘culture warrior’ Trump at DC summit","text":"Justice spoke on the culture wars driving Democrats to support Moms for Liberty, actor and comedian Rob Schneider spoke on the first night, Gabbard participated in the morning roundtable with Justice, and Texas state Rep. Shawn Thierry announced she is leaving the Democratic Party and switching to the GOP. “RFK Jr. just came out and endorsed Trump,” Justice said. “I think what is happening right now is that Democrats are getting permission to be able to stand up and say some of these radical policies that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promoting in their own states of California and in Minnesota are not what American parents broadly, overall want. We see that in the polling, and it’s exciting to see that kids are going to be prioritized in America.” Suburban mothers and independent voters who may not be convinced experimental surgeries on children are the answer for body dysmorphia are a very important voting bloc in this election. “A lot of Americans have a real problem with the idea of cutting off the healthy body parts of children and of disengaging parents in the decisions about their children’s education, their medical care, and their upbringing,” Justice said. The Moms for Liberty co-founder feels former President Donald Trump, who will speak at a fireside chat during the summit, is a “culture warrior” in the movement to protect children. “It’s not very surprising to see that President Trump doesn’t seem to shy away from any fight,” Justice said. “You know, he’s a dad and a grandfather. He’s a businessman. We’re in the middle of a cultural revolution. And so, for me as an individual, he’s a culture warrior.” The mother of four also compared Trump doing rallies and roundtables with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who just with CNN as their first news interview since the launch of their campaign. “I think it’s great that he’s willing to answer all of the questions that are asked of him,” Justice said of Trump. “You see him all of the time stopping and answering reporters’ questions, and Kamala Harris won’t answer any questions. I think the American people are going to grow tired of that. If you’re not willing to answer questions, then how could you possibly lead our country?” Harris has spoken with reporters several times while on the campaign trail. Justice also touched on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitting to falling to pressure from the Biden administration to censor content on Facebook. “We know that the social media landscape has been censored because Moms for Liberty has been a victim of that, even a victim of Facebook,” Justice said. “We wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg at one point because our chapters were being removed from the platform. I’m glad that he’s being honest about what is happening.” “We know the federal government, the American government, has been weaponized against the people,” Justice added. “The FBI went so far as to call one of our moms after speaking at a school board meeting.

The ratings bump was CNN’s second major programming event of the summer, after a presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, which drew 47.9 million viewers, a 20-year debate low. Harris and Walz were touring rural Georgia on a campaign bus Thursday following the Democratic National Convention, during which Harris saw a ratings victory, drawing in 26.2 million viewers to her acceptance speech, nearly a million more than Trump’s RNC address. During the interview, CNN’s Dana Bash pressed Harris on her past policy changes and racial identity, echoing attacks lobbed at the vice president from the Trump campaign, but largely avoided giving the duo a chance to answer on substantive policy questions. Harris spoke about the moment in which President Biden exited the race, noting that she was with family, and defended their administration’s economic record, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average creep to an all-time high on Friday.

So why is he fighting to stay on New York's ballot?","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is not actively running for president. But you wouldn’t know it if you follow the New York courts. Despite suspending his presidential campaign last week, Kennedy continues to wage an expensive and multi-faceted legal fight to keep his name on the presidential ballot in the state he called home for decades. His ongoing pursuit has confounded some onlookers, particularly as he seeks to remove his name from the ballot in a number of key battleground states. The former candidate’s attorney says Kennedy — who has endorsed former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee — is simply looking to bring fairness to New York’s rules for getting on the ballot, which he argues are unconstitutional. But Kennedy may have some personal stake in the case, too. The New York state Appellate Division ruled 4-0 against Kennedy on Thursday, upholding a lower court’s decision that he didn't live at the Westchester County address listed on his ballot petitions. At trial, Kennedy testified that he sought to keep New York as his official residence in part because he wanted to maintain ties to the state should he decide to run for office there someday. “I moved to California, but in the back of my mind, I thought one day I might run for state office in New York or maybe one of my kids would,” Kennedy said at trial. He maintained that he and his wife Cheryl Hines have always intended to move back to New York after she retires from acting. To run for governor or attorney general in New York, a candidate must have been a resident of the state for the five years preceding Election Day. The rule is more relaxed to run for U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives; a candidate only has to be a resident of the state they represent when they’re elected. Pete Kavanaugh, a longtime Democratic strategist who founded the group Clear Choice, which is funding a lawsuit to knock Kennedy off the ballot, said the former candidate's claim was “irrelevant” to the court case. But he and his organization point to another possible reason for RFK Jr.'s continued interest in proving his residence. In arguments before the Appellate Division earlier this week, attorney John Quinn — also working with Clear Choice — said Kennedy’s testimony shows he has a “voter fraud problem, too.” “It became clear at trial that his sister sold a residence that she lived in in 2015, and he continued to use that residence so that he could vote in New York while living in California,” Quinn said. “He was committing abject voter fraud.” Kennedy’s attorney Jim Walden disputed that claim outright, calling it “offensive” and “unfounded.” “It shows how these [Democratic National Committee] proxies will grasp at any straw to try to maintain the majority-party monopoly over the presidential ballot in New York, leaving it the most anti-democratic state in the union,” he said. The legal wrangling over Kennedy’s ballot status in New York has by now stretched on for months — outliving even his presidential campaign. He can try to take his case to the Court of Appeals, though there's no guarantee the state’s highest court will agree to hear the case. But he’s already turned to the federal courts, where last week his campaign amended a previous lawsuit in an attempt to throw out the New York rule requiring independent candidates to list their home address at all. In the federal lawsuit, the Kennedy campaign claims the New York requirement is “discriminatory” because it only applies to independent candidates, while major party nominees don’t have to petition or submit their home address. He’s also trying to invalidate other ballot-access rules that are the subject of a separate, similar case on Long Island. In a statement, Walden said the campaign looks forward to “taking our case to the Court of Appeals and the federal court so that New York is not the only state in the nation where the majority parties have a monopoly on the ballot.”","summary":"Robert F.

The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia was originally going to feature Trump and President Joe Biden, but when the latter dropped out, Harris took his spot.

The Maine Democratic Party issued a news release with photos it said were taken from social media accounts and showed Rep. Barbara Bagshaw smiling and posing in front of the Capitol during the so-called “Stop the Steal” rally. Supporters of then-President Trump marched to the Capitol to pressure Congress to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Bagshaw has not been charged with any crimes and the photos show her outside the Capitol with other attendees, not participating in the storming of the building. Her participation, which was confirmed by a party leader, suggests she supported Trump’s false claims that he was the actual winner of the 2020 election, although she did not make that claim publicly when she ran for and won a seat in the Maine Legislature in 2022. Bagshaw did not respond to interview requests on Friday. The disclosure of the photos more than three years after the rally comes just ahead of Labor Day weekend, the traditional start of a campaign season that will decide control of the state Legislature. Bagshaw is locked in a tough reelection battle after narrowly winning her first term two years ago. She won the District 106 seat by 23 votes after a recount. She is seeking reelection against Doris Poland, a former bus driver and library technician. Maine Democratic Party Executive Director Tim Grose said in a written statement that Bagshaw “was present at the attempted insurrection and attack on our nation’s Capitol; where rioters assaulted law enforcement officers, vandalized and desecrated public property, disrupted the peaceful transition of power, and subverted the will of Mainers by delaying the certification of votes in a free & fair election.” “The level of extremism and arrogance on display for Rep. Bagshaw to travel from Maine to Washington D.C. to support Donald Trump’s efforts to throw away the votes of her constituents, and instead impose her will on all Mainers and Americans is astounding–but unsurprising given her radical MAGA views and the fact she is the second Maine GOP candidate or elected official known to have been at the Capitol that day,” Grose said. House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, R-Winter Harbor, called the Democratic attack pathetic and defended Bagshaw, saying she did nothing wrong when she joined tens of thousands of other people who attended Trump’s rally on Jan. 6. “I don’t see that as newsworthy,” Faulkingham said in a phone interview. “I think it’s pathetic that Democrats can’t run on policy, so they have to run on stuff like this. “Anybody that knows Barbara knows she’s a good representative that serves her community well,” Faulkingham said. “I think it’s pathetic they would try to make her into an extremists, because anyone who has been around her for five minutes knows that that’s not true.” The photo shared by Democrats Friday appears to show Bagshaw standing in front of the Capitol on Jan. 6 with Justin Whynot, a Windham resident who acknowledged his attendance at the Jan. 6 rally last fall while he was running for a school board seat. He also did not enter the Capitol or face any charges. One Maine politician has faced legal trouble for his participation in the post-rally riot. Former Republican state Senate candidate Matthew Brackley pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting, impeding or resisting police during the 2021 storming of the Capitol. He was sentenced to a little more than a year in federal prison, as well as two years of probation and $3,000 in fines and restitution for damages at the Capitol.","summary":"House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham called Democrats 'pathetic' for making an issue out of Rep.

That came just days after Trump criticized Florida’s six-week abortion ban in an interview with DailyMail.com, saying, ‘I think it should be more than six weeks.’ His campaign aides insisted his comments did not reveal his final position, which the candidate then clarified in an interview with Fox News late Friday following pressure from pro-life groups. ‘So I think six weeks you need more time, then six weeks I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it I disagreed with it,’ Trump told the network, repeating the sentiment. ‘At the same time the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. … So I’ll be voting no for that reason,’ Trump said. The amendment on the ballot that he is now publicly opposing bars abortion restrictions up until the viability of the fetus, about 24 weeks – or six months – into pregnancy, with exceptions for the life and health of the mother. With a choice on Amendment 4 that offers a simple yes or no to voters, his response horrified allies in the anti-abortion movement, who are a critical part of his coalition. It followed other comments about protecting reproductive rights as Trump hopes to avoid the difficulties have suffered in off-year elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump appointed three of the conservative justices determined the majority ruling. And his campaign played cleanup on Thursday evening, after Trump made similar comments to NBC News. ‘President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida, he simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,’ said Karoline Leavitt, Trump Campaign national press secretary. Trump had told NBC that ‘I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,’ which further confused the issue, given that it is an up or down vote on the referendum at hand. He told DailyMail.com at Mar-a-Lago that he had decided how he would vote. ‘Well, I do know, but I do want more than six weeks,’ he said. ‘I want more than six weeks. Conservative commentator Erik Erikson was among those fuming at Trump’s recent comments before he finally came out against the referendum, on a night of a big Kamala Harris interview. ‘Instead of having all the focus on the Kamala Harris interview tonight, Trump decided to further divide the GOP. Not a good strategy for winning,’ he posted on X. Florida bans almost all abortions after six weeks and, when asked how he would vote on a measure that would extend the limit to more than 20 weeks, Trump told DailyMail.com: ‘I want more than six weeks.’ Trump has walked a narrow path on the issue, knowing that it could hold the key to the 2024 election. During his administration he was happy to be seen as the most ‘pro-life’ president in history. He took credit for ending federal protections on abortion after the Supreme Court (including three of his picks) overturned Roe v Wade. But he has since expressed concern that Republicans could be battered at the ballot box if they push hardline federal bans. Instead, he said it was up to states to decide the matter. However, with his home state of Florida due in November to vote on Amendment 4, which would allow abortions up to the point of ‘viability’ when fetuses can survive outside the mother’s womb, he cannot avoid explaining his personal position forever. He trailed a public reveal on the issue when DailyMail.com asked him how he would be voting. ‘I think six weeks is a mistake. And I’ll be expressing that soon, but I want more than six weeks,’ he said at his Mar-a-Lago home, speaking for the first time about his thoughts on the referendum. ‘And in Florida, we have a six-week program, and that’s what I believe that you’re voting on, and I think it should be more than six weeks.’ There is no alternative to a yes or no, delighting supporters of a woman’s right to choose, who took to social media in support. He said the same thing in a second TV interview a day later. But a key anti-abortion leader immediately got in touch with Trump to check his position. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said Trump hold her he had not yet committed to how he will vote. ‘President Trump has consistently opposed abortions after five months of pregnancy. Amendment 4 would allow abortion past this point. Voting for Amendment 4 completely undermines his position,’ she said. ‘We strongly support Florida’s current heartbeat law. For anyone who believes in drawing a different line, they still must vote against Amendment 4, unless they don’t want a line at all. Amendment 4 would lock unlimited abortion into the state constitution, preventing the Florida legislature from enacting any changes.’ Florida’s hardline abortion law was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis last year. ‘Donald Trump has consistently stated that late-term abortions where a baby can feel pain should never be permitted, and he’s always stood up for parents’ rights,’ said Taryn Fenske, communications director for the governor’s office. ‘Amendment 4 would allow late-term abortions, eliminate parental consent, and open the door to taxpayer-funded abortions. It’s extreme and must be defeated.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump revealed Thursday that he will vote against a ballot referendum&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump states his stance on Florida&#8217;s abortion law after criticizing the six-week limit in an interview with the Daily Mail. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-states-his-stance-on-floridas-abortion-law-after-criticizing-the-six-week-limit-in-an-interview-with-the-daily-mail/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-confirms-how-he-will-vote.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:36:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":255301596,"title":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly change website page recruiting poll watchers after GOP called out ‘disinformation’","text":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly updated their website Thursday night after Republicans accused them of publishing “misinformation” on the site’s recruitment page, which appeared to be enlisting out-of-state poll watchers in violation of the battleground state’s election law. The Republican National Committee sent a letter to Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt earlier in the day Thursday, pointing out that the Pennsylvania Dems’ “Voter Protection” page on their website said that poll watchers on Election Day “must be physically present in PA for their shift, but do not necessarily have to be PA voters.” That language contradicted Pennsylvania election law going back to 1937, which states, “Each watcher so appointed must be a qualified registered elector of the county in which the election district for which the watcher was appointed is located.” “The misinformation on the PA Dems’ website threatens the integrity of November’s general election,” the RNC’s letter to Schmidt reads, explaining that the Democratic Party cannot be allowed to “flood polling places with unqualified out-of-state poll watchers.” The Pennsylvania Department of State told The Post that poll watchers are “specifically defined as individuals appointed by candidates or political parties to observe inside a polling place on Election Day,” not outside. In other words, Pennsylvania poll watchers must not only be Pennsylvania voters, but they can also only serve in the polling place in the county they are registered to vote. That’s a far cry from what Pennsylvania Democrats were telling potential volunteers, thus sparking Republicans’ complaints of “misinformation.” In a statement to The Post on Friday, the Pennsylvania Dems clapped back at their Republican opponents. “Our Party takes our democracy seriously, unlike the MAGA Republicans that are busy launching bad faith attacks on voters and our volunteers,” said Mitch Kates, PA Dems’ Executive Director. “Poll watchers may be located inside or outside of polling locations, and outside poll watchers can be volunteers from any state,” Kates said. “We have always made this distinction in assigning our volunteers on Election Day.” But Pennsylvania Democrats didn’t make this distinction on their recruitment page – until it was changed Thursday night. Still, the Republicans are urging Schmidt, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, to correct the PA Democrats’ “misinformation and disinformation” on the state’s “Fact-Checking Election Claims” page, and order them to “cease and desist” from publishing inaccurate election information. Both Democrats and Republicans recruit voter protection volunteers from out of state, and both parties are recruiting armies of volunteers to monitor polling places to make sure their team’s ballots are counted, and contest questionable ballots on the opposing side. An Emerson poll released Thursday showed Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump tied at 48% support in the Keystone State.","summary":"Pennsylvania Democrats quietly updated their website Thursday night after Republicans accused them of publishing &#8220;misinformation&#8221; on the site&#8217;s recruitment page, which appeared to be enlisting out-of-state poll watchers in violation of the battleground state&#8217;s election law.

Reproductive rights remain a political land mine for Trump By Kristen Welker The past 24 hours have underscored how the abortion issue remains a major political land mine for Donald Trump and the GOP heading into the final stretch of the election. It started on Thursday — the same day Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for her first major interview as the Democratic presidential nominee — when Trump told NBC News’ Dasha Burns that Florida’s six-week abortion ban was “too short” and that he would “be voting that we need more than six weeks” when asked about a ballot measure that would expand abortion access in his home state of Florida. His campaign clarified that evening that he had not yet taken a position on the proposed constitutional amendment. And perhaps more significantly, on Thursday Trump also told Burns that he supported not only protecting access to in vitro fertilization, but also having the federal government or insurance companies pay for those costs. Then, on Friday afternoon, after receiving swift backlash from the right, he came out against Florida’s abortion-rights ballot measure. “So I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks. I’ve disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it, I disagreed with it,” Trump said in comments to Fox News. “At the same time, the Democrats are radical, because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. ... So I’ll be voting no for that reason.” Florida’s amendment would bar restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, around the 24th week of pregnancy, while ensuring exceptions to protect the health of the mother. Trump’s statements on both abortion and IVF show how thorny the issues are for the Republican nominee — even when he appears to be staking out a position that’s more popular with the general electorate, according to the polls. From one political side, there were anti-abortion conservatives, like Erick Erickson, who jeered Trump’s initial comments, warning they could cost him support from a critical slice of the GOP base. On the other, Harris’ campaign and Democrats continued to hammer Trump for his role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, which left the abortion issue to the states. And then there’s the financial aspect of Trump’s plans. With the price tag for IVF treatments at approximately $20,000 each, having the government cover the cost would amount to billions in taxpayer dollars. The reversal of Roe has hurt the Republicans and energized Democrats — just look at the 2022 midterms and the results from recent statewide ballot measures. But Trump’s last 24 hours revealed how the abortion and IVF debate continue to be problematic for Republicans, even for a presidential candidate trying his best to sidestep the issues. How Harris is preparing for her first Trump debate By Yamiche Alcindor Kamala Harris has been preparing for the debate stage for months. Only, instead of facing off against the GOP’s VP nominee as originally expected, she’s now set for her first showdown with Donald Trump in less than two weeks. Here’s a look at how Harris is getting ready for the debate, according to four sources familiar with the Democratic nominee’s preparations. Getting under Trump’s skin: A source told NBC News that while Harris’ team is preparing to talk about a variety of topics, the campaign very much views the optics of the debate as critically important. To that end, the source said, Harris and her team are focusing on homing in on how to needle Trump to rattle him. In that sense, the source said, it’s going to be less about substance and more about showcasing Harris as a woman who isn’t scared and isn’t going to cower and who is standing up to Trump and holding him accountable. Tension over how to differentiate from Biden: Drawing a distinction between Harris and Biden is a source of tension, as some on Harris’ team are taking the approach that she may have to respectfully but forcefully lay blame for some problems, like the Afghanistan withdrawal, squarely at Biden’s feet. One source said the 2021 withdrawal is seen as an “obvious vulnerability” that Harris is preparing how to tackle. Avoiding a Tulsi Gabbard moment: Harris and her team are most focused on avoiding a moment from a Democratic presidential primary debate in July 2019, when Tulsi Gabbard, then a House member from Hawaii, launched a lengthy attack on Harris’ prosecutorial record. Gabbard (who recently endorsed Trump’s 2024 bid) accused Harris of having jailed more than 1,500 people for marijuana violations when she was a prosecutor in California, adding that she “laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” a jab that elicited applause from the audience. Harris and her team were unprepared for the attack and are working to ensure she can quickly pivot in the face of a similar approach by Trump.

A day after Trump's attorneys asked a federal court in New York to remove the case from state court, the court on Friday rejected their filing as \"deficient,\" a notice on the court's docket said. According to the notice, the filing was sent back in part because the attorneys failed to include written permission from either the court or prosecutors. In a separate letter to Judge Juan Merchan, the New York judge overseeing the case, Trump's lawyers flagged their attempt to move the case to federal court while continuing to urge Merchan to delay the sentencing, which is currently scheduled for Sept. 18. \"There is no good reason to sentence President Trump prior to November 5, 2024, if there is to be a sentencing at all, or to drive the post-trial proceedings forward on a needlessly accelerated timeline relative to the manner in which similar issues are being addressed by the Special Counsel's Office and the Department of Justice,\" defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote. Trump was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election. He has said he will appeal the decision. Trump's lawyers argued in Thursday's filing that the former president's new indictment in his federal election interference case helps their argument that the New York conviction should be thrown out on the basis of presidential immunity. Special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday charged Trump in a superseding indictment in the Jan. 6 case that was adjusted to respect the Supreme Court's recent ruling that Trump is entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts undertaken as president. \"Those prosecutors' unsuccessful efforts to purge the taint of the Presidential immunity violations identified by the Supreme Court in Trump, by obtaining a new charging instrument from a different grand jury, are consistent with President Trump's position in this case that DANY's use of official-acts evidence in grand jury proceedings requires dismissal,\" Thursday's filing said.","summary":"Former President Trump's effort to delay the upcoming sentencing in his hush money case has hit a snag after a court on Friday rejected his filing as \"deficient.\"","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/trumps-latest-effort-delay-hush-money-sentencing-hits/story?id=113286396","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ba7c4e69-4c72-4b3b-a2f7-dce095271d1b/trump-gty-jt-240827_1724796563261_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:31:59","author":"Aaron Katersky,Jessie Dimartino,Katherine Faulders,Peter Charalambous","authors":["Aaron Katersky","Jessie Dimartino","Katherine Faulders","Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.429},{"id":255297246,"title":"We Created an Image of JD Vance with Trump’s Hair Because We Were Curious","text":"There’s so much diversity in the Republican party’s presidential ticket: They’ve got the blond-haired, blue-eyed guy on top, and the dark-haired, blue-eyed guy playing second fiddle to the former president.

And it doesn't end here, reportedly, the former President also called her a \"piglet.\" According to the HuffPost, several former staffers and editors of the reality television show confessed how Trump was vocal about his dislike for Kardashian. A source revealed that back in 2009, \"He called her a piglet.\" Another revealed that the Republican frontrunner for the upcoming presidential elections said, \"What is this? We can’t even get the hot one. Why did we get the ugly Kardashian?\" An insider claimed that the business tycoon was so irked that he asked the staff, \"What’s the reason we can get her off [the show]?\" The reality television star was then fired from the show when Trump brought her DUI(Driving Under the Influence) case up and clarified that he was unaware that she had to leave for a court-mandated class in LA. During an episode of Chelsea, the Good American founder shared that they \"hated every minute\" of the show. According to Cosmopolitan, she confessed, \"It is something I would never do… I was put in situations I would never be in real life. I went to home school, I don’t know how to do a fucking PowerPoint and this and that. I don’t think [Trump] would make a good president.\" The Kardashians star was fired during the sixth week of the show. An insider claimed that the businessman-turned-politician's reasoning to fire her was not sensible, \"It was absolutely ridiculous. To make a twist like that made no sense.\" An editor of the American show said, \"When they fired [her], it wasn’t on merit. It was on him not liking her.\" Other editors called the ex-POTUS an \"egomaniac\" and \"misogynistic.\" In an interview with Extra back then, Kardashian responded to the allegations swirling around Trump calling her names behind her back. The model and influencer shared, \"For Trump or any human being to judge someone off looks alone...I think that’s really immature and cruel. How am I dragged into everything?\" The Daily Beast revealed around the same time, how the business mogul would call actor Marlee Matlin \"retarded\" for being deaf during her participation in the Celebrity Apprentice. Responding to it, she shared, \"So, what’s my response? It’s not about insults or taking each other down. As a person who is Deaf, as a woman, as a mom, as a wife, as an actor. I have a voice. And I’m using that voice to make myself heard ... and vote.\" That's not all, he even called rapper Lil John \"Uncle Tom.\" However, the rapper managed to respond to the reference and got it corrected then and there. \"I can’t say if he knew what he was actually saying or not but he did stop using that term once we explained it’s offensiveness. I also want to be clear that I don’t agree with many of the statements Mr. Trump has said during his current run for president,\" he said in the HuffPost.","summary":"A source revealed that back in 2009 Donald Trump &#34;called her a piglet,&#34; behind her back on &#34;Celebrity Apprentice.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-reportedly-called-this-kardashian-a-fat-piglet-on-live-tv","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/713310/uploads/74670100-66c6-11ef-adc0-2791c8027970_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:30:44","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":255301626,"title":"Trump’s free IVF plan could cost taxpayers up to $7B: experts","text":"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump proposed Thursday that in-vitro fertilization (IVF) be made free for wannabe parents — a sweeping pitch that could transfer as much as $7 billion in annual costs to the government and insurance companies, experts tell The Post. The Trump team hasn’t specified how the policy would be adopted, but the quickest way is likely through pending legislation requiring insurance companies to consider infertility a covered medical condition or through amending former President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 healthcare law. If Trump, 78, manages to become the 47th president, he could also issue executive orders expanding free IVF coverage to all federal workers, military members and veterans, who currently are eligible only in limited cases — though such orders would likely face legal challenges. “Politicians promise and overpromise all the time,” Gerald Kominski, senior fellow at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told The Post Friday. “In this specific case, what [Trump’s] promising has never been done with regard to healthcare in this country.” The price tag for IVF is hefty — with treatments costing $15,000 to $20,000 per cycle, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Vanessa Brown Calder, the director of Opportunity and Family Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, estimated the cost of making IVF free to everyone would amount to roughly $7 billion per year — a calculation she said was based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reflecting 413,776 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles in 2021, 99% of which were IVF treatments. “Of course, this substantially understates the true long-term costs of the program,” Calder cautioned. “Most IVF patients are currently self-pay and this limits IVF use. Moreover, government-funded IVF would create new incentives for couples to delay childbearing or engage in elective fertility preservation, leading to growing use and reliance on fertility treatment long-term.” It’s unclear how much of the total burden would be shouldered directly by the government — though increased costs for insurance companies are likely to be passed on to taxpayers as well though higher policy premiums. ‘A Dramatic Moment’ Advocates have been fighting for years to make IVF free — and were thrilled by Trump’s surprise announcement. “It’s terrific that a nominee of a major party in this country is calling for universal access for IVF. That’s great, we applaud that,” said Sean Tipton, the chief advocacy and policy officer for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). “We would very much love to work with the Trump campaign on what that proposal might need to look like. So far the plan seems to consist of one sentence.” Tipton added: “There’s an active bill sponsored by Republicans right now in Congress. He could say, ‘Let’s do that.'” That legislation was introduced by Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) and cosponsored by 14 House Republicans and six House Democrats, including New York GOPers Mike Lawler, Marcus Molinaro, Anthony D’Esposito, Brandon Williams and Andrew Garbarino as well as Empire State Democrats Dan Goldman and Patrick Ryan. Tipton said the ASRM is interested in learning whether Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris also supports universal insurance coverage for IVF — after she has frequently invoked concern about safeguarding the procedure against state-level anti-abortion laws. “Everyone can speak in platitudes,” he said. “Now it’s time to move past the poetry of supporting IVF and into the prose of what those policies would look like.” Although efforts to get a federal IVF coverage mandate have gained little traction, 13 states — ranging from Republican bastions Arkansas and Utah to Democratic strongholds New York and Massachusetts already require insurance companies to cover it. California, the most populous state in the union, is poised to follow after the state legislature approved a mandate this week. If enacted, a free-IVF mandate would be a major bipartisan accomplishment for Trump, who in his first term similarly breathed new life into long-stalled criminal justice reforms, forcing through a bipartisan package known as the First Step Act after the policies languished for years. “I’ve been in this policy space for 25 years and never has IVF and infertility treatments had this sort of attention from these very top level of politicians,” Tipton said. “So it is indeed a dramatic moment. And so now the job is to take all this interest and translate it into policies that actually provide coverage.” About 2.5% of American babies are born from IVF each year — compared to 5% to 7% in European countries with free coverage for the procedure, he noted. So far, state mandates haven’t led to a large bump in IVF babies, though more incremental increases may be resulting from them. In response to criticism of the plan’s cost, Tipton told The Post opponents should look at the big picture. “In order for the species to survive we have to have reproduction,” he said. “In order for our Social Security system to be fiscally viable, we have to have young employees paying taxes. “You are in a society with those people and we need to have children.” Mixed reactions from GOP loyalists The Trump IVF plan got a range of reactions from Republicans, with some championing it as a bold pro-family initiative while others — especially abortion opponents —shared concerns due to IVF’s process of creating and destroying embryos Even some close Trump allies privately said they were horrified at the idea, with one former White House official calling it “terrible,” before predicting the former president would not lose support from anti-abortion conservatives on Nov. 5. The ex-aide said that the “inartful” plan “doesn’t change what he did and what he plans to do on life” — calling Trump “the most pro-life POTUS of our generation” after he appointed three conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and return abortion policy to the states. The Trump initiative is expected to appeal not only to suburban centrists, but more Democratic-leaning voting groups, such as LGBT people who use IVF to conceive children. “Affordable access to IVF is an important issue for the LGBT community across the political spectrum, and President Trump’s proposal would be a game changer for LGBT couples who want to start families of their own,” Log Cabin Republicans President Charles Moran said in a statement. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a prominent anti-abortion organization, called for enacting policies that would stop embryos from being destroyed if Trump’s plan is adopted. “SBA Pro-Life America has no objection to fertility treatments that help couples struggling with infertility in an ethical way, with strong medical safety standards,” said SBA president Marjorie Dannenfelser. “We believe human embryos should not be destroyed. All too often, proposals on this issue go too far by giving blanket immunity to IVF clinics — even for rogue practitioners who switch human embryos, fail to follow basic safety standards, or negligently destroy human embryos desired by infertile couples,” she added. Trump’s IVF plan followed months of Democratic candidates painting him as a potential threat to the procedure following the federalization of abortion policy, which resulted in court fights in some states over whether the practice constitutes abortion. Alabama’s state supreme court in February issued a stunning ruling saying that embryos created using IVF must be considered “unborn children” — prompting the Republican-led state government to hastily ratify a new law in March that provided criminal immunity for providers and patients.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump proposed Thursday that under his administration, in-vitro fertilization would be free and would be covered by the government or insurance companies.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/30/us-news/trumps-free-ivf-plan-could-cost-taxpayers-up-to-7b-experts-say/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/former-president-donald-trump-enters-88587690.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 22:27:23","author":"Diana Glebova,Josh Christenson,Steven Nelson","authors":["Diana Glebova","Josh Christenson","Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":255301684,"title":"Disneyland steakhouse brings Donald Trump’s former executive chef to Downtown Disney","text":"Donald Trump’s former executive chef at Mar-a-Lago who earned a Michelin Star at the former president’s DJT restaurant in Las Vegas is bringing a steakhouse and barbecue concept to Downtown Disney.

Just this week, he’s reposted messages calling for his political opponents to be jailed, calling for a return of “public military tribunals” for people like former President Barack Obama, as well as making a graphic sexual joke about Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrat Hillary Clinton, his opponent in 2016. The repost of the sexual joke now appears to have been removed from Trump’s profile. But you’d only see that if you’re a user of Truth Social. On other more mainstream platforms like X and TikTok, Trump has maintained a more even tone, one seemingly designed for consumption by a much wider swath of American voters. Truth Social has long been a safe space for Trump allies and acolytes, a place they’re free to lean into unfounded claims of election fraud and a search for revenge, with the distinct possibility those messages could be seen and reposted — or “retruthed\" — by Trump himself. But it has a far more limited reach than the major platforms, leaving things largely out of sight and mind for the vast majority of Americans. On Truth Social, Trump has been able to feed the frenzy of fans who post more extreme conspiracy theories and calls to action, while maintaining a far more manicured presence on larger platforms like X. On Wednesday, Trump made and shared a particularly extreme series of posts on Truth. “How to actually fix the system,” one Truth repost read, with photoshopped images of Hilary Clinton, President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former public health official Anthony Fauci, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Harris all sitting in orange jumpsuits behind prison bars. “Indict the unselect J6 committee sedition,” another reads, followed by “retruth if you want to lock them up.” Another features a picture of Trump sitting next to Obama with the words “All roads lead to Obama. Retruth if you want public military tribunals.” And one includes a screenshot apparently from X of a reply to a photo of Harris and Clinton that oral sex “impacted both their careers differently.” Trump has regularly used his Truth Social platform to denigrate enemies, and weigh in on the various legal cases against him, so much so that a New York judge held him in contempt of court for violating a gag order, in part based on his posts. In March, he shared a video that included an image of Biden bound in the back of a pickup truck. And in July, he reposted another call for a “televised military tribunal” for former Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and a quote from Ulysses S. Grant after the start of the Civil War, in which he said: “There are but two parties now: traitors and patriots.” But the sexualized nature of the attack on Harris broached a new frontier, one that comes as all indications point to Harris running a more competitive race against Trump than Biden was. Asked on CNN about the sexual post about Clinton and Harris, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller downplayed a discussion about the post as a “distraction,” trying to draw a comparison to the criticisms Trump has faced from Democrats “ever since he came down the escalator” in announcing his first presidential bid in 2015. “I haven’t discussed that with the president, I don’t know if the president even saw the comment that was on there, or simply the picture. That’s not something I have asked,” Miller said Thursday on CNN. That it hasn’t seen or discussed specific posts with the former president is often the defense Trump’s campaign uses when it comes to the more extreme posts he makes on Truth Social, and harkens back to GOP attempts to brush aside Trump’s statements on Twitter while he was in office by using the same claim. That social media silo has also made it easier for the general public to disengage with some of the former president’s more bombastic posts. Instead of an X post that receives hundreds of thousands of likes, Trump’s Truth Social account, which sometimes sees over a hundred posts in a single day, are often unanimously applauded by a few thousands supporters on the app. There could be a danger for Trump with the broader electorate if those highly charged posts do break through to a wider audience, former Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo told MSNBC on Thursday. “This attack is so, just, beneath a campaign, especially a presidential campaign, that it does make sense for the Harris campaign to ignore it and to allow it to speak for itself,” Curbelo said. “Ultimately, this ends up hurting him with the types of swing voters who will ultimately decide this election.” Trump’s posts to Truth Social stand in stark contrast to his presence on other social media platforms. His most controversial posts on Truth Social don’t appear on his X account, which has more than 90 million followers. Instead, he’s recently touted a new crypto project, shared campaign ads and graphics, boosted his media appearances and other projects, while also criticizing Harris and the Justice Department after a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Trump for election interference in response to a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. On TikTok, which Trump joined in June after trying to ban the app while in office, he has similarly posted content that is relatively tame by comparison. In several direct-to-camera videos to his 10.7 million followers, the former president railed against inflation, promised to make the U.S. “a safe nation again,” and repeated catchphrases including “too big to rig” and “make America great again.” His YouTube channel, which has 3.2 million subscribers, similarly posts attack ads, Trump’s Fox news appearances and his speeches. Trump comparatively has 7.6 million followers on Truth Social, where his posts can rack up a few thousand reposts and tens of thousands of interactions. Trump’s presidency was defined in part by his near-constant presence on X. He’d frequently spar with rivals at all hours of the day and night, and upend news cycles by announcing new policies or making personnel changes at a moment’s notice. But after spending much of the end of the 2020 election cycle, and the months after it, repeatedly stoking false claims the election had been stolen from him, he was banned from the platform, then Twitter, two days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The company said it had “permanently suspended” Trump, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence.” Trump retreated to Truth Social, which he launched in February 2022, and has since made it his digital home base. After some initial growth, the app has struggled to attract users, and the company behind the app has seen its share price drop in recent weeks. Elon Musk reinstated Trump’s account in November 2022 after he bought the platform.

On Thursday, Trump told a reporter he would be voting to extend the number of weeks under which abortion would be legal, saying he would vote to make it longer than six weeks. “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” he said. The ballot initiative is a yes or no question. MSNBC’s Chris Hayes framed Trump’s response in a more general direction, appearing to suggest what Trump might do if elected President: “Just to be clear, Trump now says he will vote to UPHOLD Florida’s SIX WEEK abortion ban.” “Which makes sense,” Hayes continued, “because he supports abortion bans! He got Roe overturned and he’s the head of a party that wants to criminalize abortion nation-wide.” Semafor Washington Bureau chief Benny Sarlin said, “Trump comes out against abortion rights amendment a day after he sounded so close to supporting it that social conservatives thought it was an endorsement.” READ MORE: ‘Bullying Needs to Stop’ Says Ex-Beauty Pageant Winner After JD Vance Refuses to Apologize CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod observed, “In 24 hours, Trump does a 180 on FL abortion rights referendum, after its opponents pull his chain.

Carolina Amesty Will Not Face Suspension Despite Felony Indictment”","text":"ORLANDO, Fla. – As news broke Thursday about State Rep. Carolina Amesty’s indictment and arrest on forgery charges, questions immediately arose about whether the Windermere Republican would resign or be suspended from office. Amesty’s charges stem from a Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into documents from her family’s school, Central Christian University, submitted for licensing from the Florida Department of Education. An Orlando Sentinel probe into those documents accused Amesty of notarizing a forged employment form for a teacher who never taught at the school or, according to him, applied to teach there. Orange-Osceola State Attorney Andrew Bain, an appointee of Gov. Ron DeSantis, referred the case to a grand jury, which handed up the indictment on Thursday. A statement from the Amesty campaign Thursday showed no intention of resigning or suspending her campaign: “This prosecution, initiated just a few weeks prior to absentee ballots being dropped, is based on misleading reports from a partisan newspaper about a notarization of an employee verification background report, the truth of the contents which have not been questioned in any manner. Rep. Amesty calls for a speedy trial, looks forward to her day in court, and is confident of her public vindication.”Amesty Campaign And according to Florida law, she doesn’t have to. Moreover, there’s no mechanism in Florida law for anyone else to suspend Amesty, unless she is convicted of a crime. According to the Florida Constitution, Article III, which deals with the legislature: Each house shall be the sole judge of the qualifications, elections, and returns of its members, and shall biennially choose its officers, including a permanent presiding officer selected from its membership, who shall be designated in the senate as President of the Senate, and in the house as Speaker of the House of Representatives.Florida Constitution, Article III, Sec. 2 This means Gov. Ron DeSantis has no standing to suspend Amesty. He has the power to suspend other public officials in state, county and local governments for crimes, or if he feels they have been incompetent. But it falls to the Florida House to decide whether to suspend Amesty. Here’s what the chamber’s rules say: 15.10—Felony Indictment or Information of a Member(a) If an indictment or information for a felony of any jurisdiction is filed against a member of the House, the member indicted or informed against may request the Speaker to excuse the member, without pay, from all privileges of membership of the House pending final adjudication.(b) If the indictment or information is either nolle prosequied or dismissed, or if the member is found not guilty of all felonies, the member shall be paid all back pay and other benefits retroactive to the date the member was excused.15.11—Felony Guilty Plea of a MemberA member who enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony of any jurisdiction may, at the discretion of the Speaker, be suspended immediately,without a hearing and without pay, from all privileges of membership of the House through the remainder of that member’s term.15.12—Felony Conviction of a Member(a) A member convicted of a felony of any jurisdiction may, at the discretion of the Speaker, be suspended immediately, without a hearing andwithout pay, from all privileges of membership of the House pending appellate action or the end of the member’s term, whichever occurs first.Florida House of Representatives Rules Therefore House leaders are not required to suspend Amesty, unless she requests it. News 6 has left several messages with the Florida House’s media office to get more information on the rules and have not heard back. House Speaker-designate Daniel Perez told Florida Politics.com Friday that the charges against Amesty were unrelated to her duties as a lawmaker. The Florida Legislature is not in session right now. There is a September meeting for the Joint Legislative Budget Commission in September, which Amesty is not a member of. The are no other meetings in Tallahassee planned until after the Nov. 5 election when members would be sworn in. Amesty, who represents House District 45, was first elected in 2022. She is running for reelection right now against Disney executive Leonard Spencer. The district includes the area of West Orange County along the State Road 429 corridor from State Road 50 to I-4, including Horizon West, Windermere, Winter Garden, and the western edge of Osceola County into Poinciana and Davenport. Amesty intends to continue campaigning for reelection.

Daley's take on 1968 Mike Wallace episode — 'We don’t answer to these New Yorkers!'","text":"Sneed on Sunday ... It’s a wrap! Or was it a rap? Final flotsam and jetsam from the 2024 Chicago Democratic National Convention. But first some clean-up on that 1968 affair. Remember that Mike Wallace episode? After Sneed revisited it two weeks ago, retired Chicago Fire Captain Paul McLaughlin called to add a final chapter to the sensational 56-year nationally headlined story of the CBS-TV correspondent’s dramatic arrest during the 1968 Democratic Convention at the old International Amphitheatre. It’s true Wallace’s arrest was ordered by Mayor Richard J. Daley while Wallace was muscling his way off the congested DNC floor and was escorted outside by two Chicago police officers, including Chicago plainclothes detective Joe DiLeonardi as Sneed recounted. However, McLaughlin tells Sneed the trouble really started “when Wallace threw a punch at my father, Fifth District Police Commander Paul McLaughlin,” when the TV correspondent became agitated after he was refused entry to a restricted area and restrained. “My father was then summoned to the CBS trailer where he met with the president of CBS,” said McLaughlin, who claims his dad “was then threatened with a lawsuit and the loss of his job by the CBS executives. “Mayor Daley arrived at the trailer and demanded an apology from Wallace,” said McLaughlin, adding Wallace refused to apologize. “With that Mayor Daley grabbed my father by the arm and stormed out of the trailer exclaiming, ‘We don’t answer to these New Yorkers!’” (There was speculation at the time that Wallace was pointing his fingers so angrily in Commander McLaughlin’s face that one may have made contact.) Only in Chicago, folks! No ‘Om’ arrests this time Now, about this year’s convention. Powerful former U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb also called Sneed with a special message of congrats to the Chicago Police Department and top cop Larry Snelling. “There is no question the police did a great job during the Democratic National Convention controlling the crowds, not using unnecessary force, and breaking things up before it got out of control,” he added. “The police were terrific,” added Webb, comparing it to his experiences in 1968. Webb had just moved to Chicago back then as a law student at Loyola University and saw police arresting anti-war protestors during Chicago’s National Democratic Convention. “It was a bloody nightmare,” said Webb, who then lived in the Lincoln Park area, where police were rounding up kids and arresting them. “I had just moved from southern Illinois farm country, but if I hadn’t been going to law school at night, I would have joined them,” he said of the protesters. “Back then, I watched poet/anti-Vietnam war protestor Allen Ginsberg chant peace in Lincoln Park by repeating and repeating the [ritualistic] sound ‘Om,’ and it was like anyone saying ‘Om’ was carted off and arrested,” said Webb. “I mean heads were bounced off police squad cars, and I can still hear the thud of it,” added Webb, 78, who is still in the game as one the nation’s top civil lawyers. Contrast that with 2024. “Bravo,” said Webb. “Nothing is perfect, but a job incredibly well done.” How to tell if Trump is lying New Yawk squawk: Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former New York attorney who has become notorious for spewing venom on his former “client,” is now suggesting America closely watch Trump’s hands when the Republlican presidential nominee is talking or being interviewed. Quoth Cohen: “If he [Trump] starts going into his ‘accordion’ hands [pumping hands back and forth like he’s playing an accordion], then you know he [Trump] is lying,” he told newsies this week following his attendance at the 2024 DNC in Chicago. No check, please! Oh, boy. News of the recent death of the “reputed organized Chicago crime figure years ago,” Joe “Joe A” Andriacchi, 91, prompted a personal reflection cum re-think. I was reminded of a request from him I did not accept. It was an invitation to lunch … or was it dinner? I was told he wanted to talk. I never responded. I let it go. That was approximately 10 years ago. The person who delivered the request from Andriacchi, who had served time for burglary when he was young and was never charged in subsequent mob trials, was a close friend of mine. “I can’t remember exactly why he wanted to talk,” I told my friend, who had delivered the request. “Do you?” I asked him. “I often wondered why and then … I just let it go.” “Well,’ he chuckled. “If I remember correctly, he wanted to invite you to dine with him … and talk about his side of things.” Imagine.

The request to New York State Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan cites special counsel Jack Smith’s move this week to secure a new indictment against Trump in the federal election interference case that tailors the allegations in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity decision. The superseding indictment, Trump’s lawyers say, helps the former president’s argument for a dismissal in the New York case. “Those prosecutors’ unsuccessful efforts to purge the taint of the Presidential immunity violations identified by the Supreme Court in Trump, by obtaining a new charging instrument from a different grand jury, are consistent with President Trump’s position in this case that (District Attorney of New York’s) use of official-acts evidence in grand jury proceedings requires dismissal,” the letter states. “In order to allow adequate time … to address President Trump’s recent federal submission and to avoid the forms of prejudice and irreparable harm detailed in that filing, President Trump respectfully requests that this Court refrain from deciding the pending Presidential immunity motion until after the US District Court has had an opportunity to resolve the Second Removal Notice with input from all parties,” the letter adds. Merchan has said he would issue a ruling the week of September 16 on Trump’s motion to vacate the conviction in the wake of the SCOTUS presidential immunity ruling that determined Trump has broad sweeping immunity for “official acts” while he was in office. Trump filed a petition Thursday asking a federal court in Manhattan to remove his state criminal case to its jurisdiction considering the Supreme Court ruling. The filing in federal court also says the state court shouldn’t sentence Trump until that federal request for removal is litigated. Trump has asked to delay the sentencing – a request Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg’s office did not oppose – and the judge was expected to rule on that as soon as next week, according to CNN’s reporting. In the latest letter Trump’s attorneys say “there is no good reason” to sentence him before Election Day, asking Merchan to indefinitely delay the sentencing currently scheduled for September 18. “There is no good reason to sentence President Trump prior to November 5, 2024, if there is to be a sentencing at all, or to drive the post-trial proceedings forward on a needlessly accelerated timeline relative to the manner in which similar issues are being addressed by the Special Counsel’s Office and the Department of Justice,” the letter says. Trump was convicted earlier this year of 34 charges of falsifying business records, stemming from his hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.
