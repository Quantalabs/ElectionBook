The study, conducted by the European Central Bank, found that banks charge a higher interest rate to companies with high greenhouse gas emissions, while those reducing GHG emissions get lower rates. The consideration of climate risk in lending has found support at the United Nations and in the EU, but faces pushback in the U.S. Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement, an international treaty adopted in 2015 with a goal of reducing global GHG emissions to net zero by 2050, multiple initiatives were created through the UN encouraging various business sectors to commit to the net zero goal. In 2015, the Science Based Targets initiative was created through a collaboration between the CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature. SBTi works with businesses, including banks, to create targets aligned with climate science to work towards net zero. Launched in 2019, the UN Principles for Responsible Banking encourages the banking industry to adapt their business practices to align with the Paris Agreement. Signatories commit to 6 Principles relating to all areas of the banking industry. To date, 345 banks have signed the commitment. The PRB also includes the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Launched in April 2021, the NZBA is a subsidiary of the PRB that takes implementation of the Paris Agreement a step further by using the banking industry to indirectly regulate businesses. The NZBA has a stated commitment of “aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050, consistent with a 1.5°C ambition.” To date, 145 banks have joined the alliance.

However, the impact of those initiatives has been unclear. A recent study conducted for the ECB, the institution that manages interest rates and regulates the banking industry in countries that use the euro, found a direct connection. The study was conducted by Carlo Altavilla, Head of the Monetary Analysis Division at the ECB; Miguel Boucinha, Head of Money, Credit and Financial Accounts Section at the ECB; Marco Pagano, Professor of Economics at University of Naples Federico II; and Andrea Polo, Associate Professor of Finance at Luiss Guido Carli University. While the study was conducted for the ECB, a disclaimer notes that it does not represent the views of the organization. The study analyzed data for EU banks and businesses’ carbon emission data between September 2018 and December 2022. It looked at the lending practices of banks, interest rates, and businesses’ climate disclosures. The study used a public database used by companies to disclose loans in excess of €25,000. They also looked at the sustainability reports and environmental, social, and governance reports of those companies to find GHG emissions disclosures and climate related policies. The first question addressed by the study was “whether and to what extent bank interest rates price the climate risk of their client firms.” The study found “that euro-area banks charge higher interest rates to firms with larger carbon emissions, and lower rates to firms that commit to green transition, even after controlling for firms’ credit risk as measured by their probability of default.” Second, the study addressed “whether banks committed to decarbonization apply higher prices to the climate risk of their clients.” The study looked at banks that have signed the SBTi as an indicator of their commitment to reduce climate risk. The study found that “banks appear to live up to their word on the issue of climate risk pricing: those that signed a commitment letter within the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) indeed provide cheaper loans to firms that commit to decarbonization and, to a smaller extent, penalize more polluting firms.” Finally, the study addressed the impacts ECB policies have on climate lending. Specifically, “whether monetary policy shocks impact banks’ pricing of climate risk and, if so, in which direction.” The study found “that the monetary policy of the ECB affects lending to firms not only via a credit risk-taking channel but also via a climate risk-taking channel. Contractionary monetary shocks induce banks to increase both credit risk premia and carbon emission premia, and reduce lending to high emission firms more than to low emission ones.” The study closed by saying that these “results align quite strikingly with euro-area banks’ self-reported information from a survey conducted in July 2023, which shows that banks – especially those committed to decarbonization – differentiate their terms and conditions and their credit standards depending on their clients’ perceived environmental impact.” The study demonstrates how climate change and climate risk are permeating the banking industry in the European Union, with preferential treatment being given to companies committed to reducing GHG emissions. It also demonstrates how sustainability reporting, ESG reporting, and other climate-related reporting can be used as a tool to impact businesses. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

In a video message filled with explicit language, Berkwitt voiced his anger over Trump's presence at the cemetery.\"As a veteran who gave 20 years and 28 days of his life, I AM BEYOND PISSED!\" Berkwitt wrote on X. \"Who in the f****** hell allowed Trump to lay a wreath today at Arlington Cemetery that is shitting on my brothers and sisters who served their country, something this rotten bastard never did?\"In his video message, Berkwitt elaborated on his frustration, stating, \"As a veteran, who served for 20 years 28 days, during Desert Shield, Desert Storm, the Gulf War, In the Iraq War and retired honorably. I have upheld my oath every day since September 30, 2006, my retirement day. But on this day, a f****** treasonous traitor who tried to overthrow the government on January 6th, 2021. A convicted felon, an adjudicated rapist, liable for fraud, degenerate misogynistic pig, lying grifter who pushes bibles. They're now pushing books about b******* and were allowed to go to Arlington National Cemetery on this special day. What the f***? And who in the f*** allowed this m*********** to do that s*** and defecate on our fallen soldiers that are buried there.\"Berkwitt continued his impassioned critique, saying, \"You f****** MAGA m************ veterans. They're okay with this treasonous traitor. As I said, you all f****** service means nothing because the oath that I took and the f****** oath that you took you s****** on. But I wanna know who the f*** allowed this m*********** to go today and later this week for a f******* photo op. At the expense of our fallen brothers and sisters. You're f****** right. I'm pissed off. This m************ has no f****** load. F*** every single m************ that walks this f****** planet that supports this rotten m************.\"Some veteran accounts on X also chimed in with criticism of Trump attending the ceremony at the historic cemetery.Berkwitt's outburst highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding Trump's legacy, particularly in light of the events of January 6, 2021, and subsequent legal challenges. The former president was ordered to pay columnist E. Jean Carroll $83.3 million in January for comments he made after she first publicly accused him of raping her in the dressing room of a luxury department store in New York City. That came after a separate jury in May last year awarded Carroll $5 million after finding Trump liable for sexual assault and defamation.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Monday for comment.Trump's appearance at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, marking the third anniversary of a terrorist attack during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The August 26, 2021, incident at Abbey Gate outside Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport resulted in the deaths of 13 American service members and approximately 170 Afghan civilians, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.The Trump campaign also used the occasion to criticize Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, linking her to what they termed the \"chaotic retreat from Afghanistan.\" In a statement, the campaign asserted, \"Kamala Harris failed our soldiers and their families. President Trump never will.\"Trump himself commented on the anniversary on Truth Social, saying, \"This is the third anniversary of the BOTCHED Afghanistan withdrawal, the most EMBARRASSING moment in the history of our Country. Gross Incompetence. Kamala's and Biden's incompetence left 13 dead warriors, hundreds of civilians killed and grievously wounded.\"Vice President Harris and President Biden released statements about the anniversary and the fallen soldiers. Harris' statement praised the 13 service members who lost their lives as \"devoted patriots\" representing \"the best of America,\" while also defending Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.Trump's relationship with the military has been complex and often contentious. His past comments questioning the heroism of former Vietnam POW John McCain, suggestions that the Presidential Medal of Freedom surpasses the military Medal of Honor in prestige, and accusations of \"stolen valor\" against Tim Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, have drawn criticism from many in the veteran community.As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, the treatment and perception of veterans and military affairs are likely to remain central issues.","summary":"Retired Navy veteran Brad Berkwitt says Trump used the special occasion to \"defecate on our fallen soldiers buried there.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-retired-veteran-reacts-arlington-national-cemetery-treason-traitor-1944681","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458281/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 00:16:18","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":254984024,"title":"Trump demands NATO allies spend at least 3 percent of GDP on defense","text":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Monday called on member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to spend at least 3 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on their defense, calling the current 2 percent guideline \"the steal of the century.\" The former president's remarks added to speculation that should he return to the White House, he could put pressure on South Korea to increase its financial contributions to the stationing of the 28,500-strong US Forces Korea. \"I'll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least 3 percent. You have to go up to 3 percent,\" he said in his address to the conference of the National Guard Association of the United States in Detroit, Michigan. \"Two percent is the steal of the century, especially when we're paying for it. You know, we pay for them. It's just not even believable,\" he added. Trump claimed that for years, all NATO countries spent \"far less\" than 2 percent of GDP on their defense, which he said left American forces \"overstretched.\" \"We were the ones making up the difference and paying for it to make up for shortfalls and help deter threats,\" he said. In the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO heads of state and government agreed to commit 2 percent of GDP towards defense spending to help ensure the transatlantic alliance's military readiness. This year, 23 NATO allies are expected to meet or exceed the 2 percent target, compared to only three allies in 2014. His remarks came as Seoul and Washington are set to hold their seventh round of negotiations in Seoul on Tuesday over the Special Measures Agreement, a deal that would determine South Korea's share of the cost for stationing USFK. The current SMA is set to expire at the end of next year. The two sides launched negotiations in April apparently earlier than usual amid speculation that should former President Donald Trump return to the White House, he could play hardball in a way that could cause tension in the alliance. Since 1991, Seoul has partially shared the cost for Korean USFK workers; the construction of military installations, such as barracks, as well as training, educational, operational and communications facilities; and other logistical support.

I love his name: Hung Cao,’ Trump, 78, said at a Vietnamese restaurant in Virginia alongside the candidate, who moved to the state by way of West Africa as a refugee in the wake of the Vietnam War. ‘I love that name. And that name alone can get you elected,’ a visibly tickled Trump said during the event Monday, spurring patrons, and even 52-year-old Cao, to laugh. ‘It’s really an honor to be with you,’ Trump told those convened at Truong Tien Vietnamese Restaurant in Falls Church, with the republican newcomer poised to take on Democrat Tim Kaine stationed to his right. ‘Thank you.’ In a speech that also saw the ex-commander-in-chief juxtapose the supposed laziness of Joe Biden with the hardworking nature of Vietnamese-Americans, Trump mainly sang praises for Cao – eventually spurring a chant of ‘U-S-A.’ ‘I don’t know what it is. You’ll have to explain it. But the Vietnamese community loves me, and I love them,’ Trump told the crowd of supporters convened at the eatery at the town’s Eden Center Monday morning. Of Cao, he said, ‘We think he’s got a very good chance of winning for the Senate. And I really believe it. ‘I hope your community gets out and really supports him, like 100 percent,’ he said. ‘Because you can win. You can win. Definitely win. And we’re looking to win the state. And I think we will win the state.’ Cao, a retired Navy captain who came to the US in the 70s, proceeded to address the crowd in both Vietnamese and English. ‘I’m so honored to represent the Vietnamese-American community. Next year is the 50th anniversary of fall Saigon,’ he said of the the capture of the capital of South Vietnam by communist North Vietnam and the Viet Cong on April 30, 1975 ‘And we’ll have the first Vietnamese American U.S. senator on the anniversary,’ the Republican said. Trump, in turn, talked up the political newcomer, who since moving to the town of Purcellville has been an active member of their community and church. ‘More importantly [from his name], actually,’ Trump said of his Vietnamese American ally, ‘he’s tremendous. ‘He ran a great primary campaign. I endorsed him very early and he did very well. ‘We’re looking at polls that are showing us with a lead in this state, which is traditionally not necessarily for Republicans,’ Trump said at a point. ‘But I’m not the average Republican… and neither are you.’ Cao, the father of five children, is poised to take on Kaine come November, in a race where, as of writing, Kaine maintains a substantial lead. That said, as Trump indicated, the tides could shift, as Cao bills himself as a moderate conservative with Christian values, as well as a former vet who served in the US military. That stint came shortly after Cao’s arrival in the states following the fall of Saigon in 1975, when he made the move as a small child. At a point in the talk, Trump drew a contrast between the alleged laziness of Biden and the hard-working Vietnamese people, telling onlookers, ‘We are the closest to World War III we’ve ever been. And we have a man who just took a vacation in California and he came back today. Trump on Monday even took jabs at Joe Biden, saying ‘Where’s he going?’, a little over a month since he dropped out of the presidential race. ‘Delaware — another vacation, he’s going another week,’ he added, with Cao at his side. ‘That’s not the Vietnamese — they’re hard-working’ The former president proceeded to sign autographs and speak at length with patrons, with Cao at his side all the while. ‘Make America Great Again!’ one restaurant goer shouted in a thick Vietnamese accident, drawing a smile and laugh from the former president. Trump, meanwhile, is set to face off with Vice President Kamala Harris in November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump appeared amused by Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump finds Virginia senate GOP candidate&#8217;s unusual name amusing: &#8220;He deserves to win just based on this!&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-finds-virginia-senate-gop-candidates-unusual-name-amusing-he-deserves-to-win-just-based-on-this/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-is-tickled-by-Virginia-senate-GOP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 00:11:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.276},{"id":254983674,"title":"JD Vance Criticizes Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for ‘Betraying’ 13 Service Members Killed in Afghanistan Withdrawal","text":"Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) ripped President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for their “betrayal” of the 13 U.S. service members who were killed during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021. Vance joined Gold Star Family members of several of the fallen service members — Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, and Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz — on a press call Monday, which marked the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing that took their lives. “What an incredible natural resource that we have in this country — young patriotic people who are willing to give their lives — and what an incredible betrayal that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden squandered that resource,” Vance said on the call that – News and other media attended. Vance emphasized that many of these families are particularly troubled by the lack of accountability within the Biden-Harris administration: What I hear from so many of the people speaking before me, talking about the loss of their sons and daughters and family members, is they’re not even mad that mistakes were made. Sometimes mistakes do happen, especially in a combat zone. What they’re angry about is the lack of accountability. “They’re angry that we don’t know why we made the decisions that led to these young troops dying unnecessarily. They’re mad that we don’t have any accountability,” he added. “Why has nobody been fired? Why has nobody suffered any consequences for doing what happened and, again, squandering our most precious resource in this country, the lives of the people who are willing to give it all for public service?” “The fact that we don’t know, the fact that the Harris administration has stonewalled at every step of the way, the fact that no one has been fired suggests that we have a real crisis of leadership in this country,” Vance said. Vance added that the 2024 presidential election presents a chance “to return to the kind of normalcy” where, when mistakes are made, “we will have enough respect for the American people and for the people who put on the uniform to understand those mistakes so that we can better prevent them in the future, and that’s what is most broken here.” Many of the Gold Star Family members who spoke on the call zoned in on a lack of accountability from the administration in the aftermath of their loved ones’ deaths in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021. “I’m so glad and so grateful that these families were willing to talk about that because I think it drives home how much of a dishonesty lies at the heart of Kamala Harris’s political pitch when she says that she wants to return to normal,” Vance said. “She wants to ‘return decency to the Oval Office.’ She wants to ‘return common sense to the Oval Office.’ There is no decency and there is no common sense in letting 13 Americans die unnecessarily and not understanding why it happened and not forcing those who caused it to suffer some consequences.” Vance continued: What an unbelievable country that we have, where you have these 13 beautiful young people who are willing to give their lives for it, and what an unbelievable slap in the face it is to our country that we don’t have a leadership that’s actually equal to the young people who put on the uniform every single day. So, I aim to be the kind of vice president that honors the sacrifice of the people who wear the uniform, and I know that, when President [Donald] Trump is back in the Oval Office, we are going to get to the bottom of this, and the people who screwed this up are going to suffer some consequences. He sees this as the “very least” of what each of the families deserves.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen.

Detention of Telegram messenger’s co-founder Pavel Durov in France is an element of a broader campaign of the US and the EU aimed at criminalizing not only dissent but private communication also, American author and journalist Matt Taibbi told TASS. \"The detention of Pavel Durov has to be understood as part of a wider campaign in the West to criminalize not just dissent, but private communication,\" Taibbi noted. \"As you know, free speech has always been a core American value, as is the right against ‘unreasonable’ government intrusion. Our current government wants to revoke these ‘inalienable’ Constitutional rights, and replace them with new systems of mass surveillance and censorship. The aggressive enforcement of Europe's Digital Services Act - which requires private platforms to censor - is a major escalation in the campaign against free speech in Europe and the US,\" he stressed. \"Homes of [ex-UN inspector] Scott Ritter and [political analyst] Dimitri Simes were raided here in the [United] States, apparently for disagreeing with US policy in Ukraine (which they call ‘spreading misinformation’),\" Taibbi continued. \"Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon, who hosts the most popular conservative podcast (‘War Room’), is in jail for contempt of Congress, a charge we haven't used to jail people since the 1950s,\" he added. \"This is an incredibly serious moment in U.S. and European history.

'WOW!! Mariah Carey’s Mum and sister passed on the same day! This is too much!! Sending my love and condolences to Mariah and her family.' Mariah had a famously fraught relationship with her mother and sister over the years - and was estranged from Alison, a recovering drug addict, for three decades before her death. Patricia was married to Mariah's father, Alfred Roy Carey, until she was aged three. Mariah's father died at age 72 in 2002. As well as substance abuse, Alison endured homelessness throughout her life. She was also HIV positive. In 2016 Alison made an impassioned plea to her famous sibling with DailyMail.com, begging her to mend the rift between them and help save her life, saying: 'Mariah I love you, I desperately need your help.' She was in dire need of financial support as she battled back to health following a devastating home invasion attack that left her brain damaged and seriously ill. She had been in and out of the hospital. Mariah's fans and followers sent the star plenty of love following the sad news 'So sorry for your loss,' one fan page of the star wrote, sharing photos of the singer with her sister and mom 'Our hearts go out to Mariah and her family during this incredibly difficult time' 'Rest in peace,' another fan wrote, sharing photos of Patricia and Alison with Mariah A fan page wrote, 'You are stronger than you think, we are here to send you strength in this difficult time.

'To lose one family member is hard enough, but to lose two within the same day is a whole other level of pain & sadness' Another simply comforted the star with the words 'I love you' In addition to Mariah and Alison, Patricia and Roy also had son Morgan, now 64. Julliard-educated Patricia was an opera singer and vocal coach. Mariah opened up about complicated relationships with her mom and sister in her 2020 memoir, The Meaning Of Mariah Carey. 'Like many aspects of my life, my journey with my mother has been full of contradictions and competing realities. It's never been only black-and-white — it's been a whole rainbow of emotions,' she explained. She said their relationship was a 'prickly rope of pride, pain, shame, gratitude, jealousy, admiration, and disappointment'. The book was still dedicated to Patricia: 'And to Pat, my mother, who, through it all, I do believe actually did the best she could,' the singer penned in the dedication. 'I will love you the best I can, always.' In 2020 Mariah alleged Alison who she described as 'troubled and traumatized ... tried to sell [her] out to a pimp.' In a passage in her book Carey said of her sister Allison: 'When I was 12 years old, my sister drugged me with valium, offered me a pinky nail full of cocaine, inflicted me with third degree burns and tried to sell me out to a pimp.' Winfrey, on The Oprah Conversation, asked the singer about why she feels her siblings who she described as 'extremely violent' - treated her as such to which the singer insisted they were 'damaged'. Mariah said of the trio: 'We don't even really know each other, and that's the thing. We didn't grow up together, but we did.' 'Like, they were on their journeys, by the time I got into the world, they had already been damaged, in my opinion. But again, I wasn't there. I was dropped into this world and I literally felt like an outsider amongst my own family.' 'My heart is broken that I’ve lost my mother this past weekend. Sadly, in a tragic turn of events, my sister lost her life on the same day,' the singer told People on Monday; seen with her mom Mariah had a famously fraught relationship with her mother and sister over the years; (L) seen with her mom, (R) seen with her sister at the singer's 1993 wedding to Tommy Mottola The Grammy-winning singer wrote that both siblings have been 'attacking' her verbally for years, amid their very public feud. She told Oprah: '[My siblings] just grew up with the experience of living with a Black father and a white mother together, as a family, and I was, for the most part, living with my mother, which they saw as easier, but in reality it was not.' She added that her siblings 'have always thought that [her] life was easy' and 'also always looked for ... a get rich quick scheme.' Mariah also famously claimed her mother called the police on her before her hospitalization in 2001. The singer was hospitalized in July of 2001 as her reps said she was dealing with 'extreme exhaustion.' The Grammy-winning singer told Oprah that her mother Patricia contacted the authorities amid a family fight. She said she was going through an 'emotional crisis' amid her promotional tour for her film Glitter, and was staying with her mother at the time. 'There was a code switching that happened and a power shift that was immediate,' the Hero singer said. 'It was immediate and she was in charge and instead of saying, 'I'm taking care of my daughter, she's tired, somebody called the cops by mistake,' or whatever, it was like, 'Oh no, because you defied me, this is what's going to happen.'' The I Don't Wanna Cry singer said she felt a strange sense of relief when police arrived and she got into their vehicle. 'In the backseat of the police car, it's a vivid memory I'll never forget,' she said. 'I have never spoken about it, but at that moment, that seemed like a better alternative than where I was.' Carey told Oprah that she didn't feel like she was in a 'breakdown mode' at the time, but rather overworked with her project Glitter, which was considered a critical and commercial failing amid Carey's vaunted career. 'If they had given me even two days,' she said, 'I would have gotten up, gone to the video shoot and made the video... as we've seen in this entertainment industry, it happens. In 2020 Carey alleged her sister Allison (pictured) who she described as 'troubled and traumatized... tried to sell [her] out to a pimp' In 2021 Alison sued Mariah for $1.25million, claiming her 2020 tell-all memoir The Meaning Of Mariah Carey caused 'immense emotional distress' 'People push artists to the edge and then they wonder why people are gone too soon.' Mariah and Alison's brother Morgan told Daily Mail Online from his home in Italy in 2016, that following the attack in April, Alison spent a short time at a mental hospital in New York after a bizarre episode in the street near her home. 'Because Mariah has not found it in her heart to help Alison get the care she requires there are times when Alison forgets or is unable to take her medication and this sometimes precipitates problematic behavior.' He said: 'Alison was institutionalized for observation after being found wandering in the street barefoot and partially dressed, causing the police to be concerned. 'Her behavior was caused as a result of damage done in the attack and her having missed the medications she was taking.' Morgan says that due to the severe brain damage, Alison suffers from memory loss, seizures, and occasional periods loss of consciousness. 'Alison's brain scans show severe damage,' he explains. Alison was released from the mental health facility after a few weeks. Morgan added: 'The worst is yet to come and Mariah has it in her power to at least ensure a soft landing and avoid a life time of regret about missing this opportunity to forgive and help her only sister.' 'I would be hopeful, although I am not encouraged by the past, that Mariah would step up because she's in a position to step up. 'We're talking about small change to these people, her fiancé is a billionaire. 'The least they could do is put Alison in a good hospital and make sure she gets the care she needs. 'Mariah is the one person in the family who could actually make a real meaningful difference to Alison's life.' Morgan says he flew from Maui last August to be at his sister's bedside when she took a turn for the worse, but Alison's mother and sister didn't show. It was then that he took a video of her in the hospital. 'It was painful for her to speak, you could hear the raspiness in her breath, she had had a tube down her throat for so long. 'She looked like she had been beaten down by this whole experience, her eyes were foggy, her skin jaundice and she had very little motor control. In 2016 Mariah's brother Morgan (C) said he hasn't spoke to his sister 'properly' for two decades 'Every effort, every movement was very labored and painful and difficult – but she was very much alive. 'I wanted to be able to prove that she was lucid, that she understood who she was, where she was, what was going on around her. 'I wanted people to see that she was a human being and that someone else shouldn't have the decision to decide whether she live or die.' Despite coming close to death Alison pulled through and made a miraculous recovery. Morgan was successful in having the 'do not resuscitate order' dropped and claims he is now his sister's medical proxy. In a third video taken on September 23, 2015 and viewed by Daily Mail Online, Alison is lucid as she is interviewed by a member of the staff of a New York hospital. She clearing states her name, date of birth and names Morgan Carey as her health care proxy. She also confirms that she wants the DNR be removed from her file. Alison recently left hospital and is being cared for by a Patient Advocate and staying at the advocate's home in New York. Morgan said: 'She is alive and is out of hospital, which is very positive. 'But she is being scheduled for surgery on her spine and she has faces more surgery on her brain, which is going to be tough. 'She's also going to drug addiction meetings and visiting with her sponsor which is good. Morgan said in the past 12 months, following the alleged attack by a home invader at her New York home in April last year, Alison had several brain surgeries, an operation on her spleen, a hip replacement and periods of physical rehabilitation. 'She was a train wreck,' Morgan recalls. 'And right now she's on several different medications to keep her seizures under control, she's fallen down several times and had bad injuries to her head because of her seizures. 'She also taking her HIV meds and anti-inflammatory meds and whatever else she's on. So yes she's on the mend, but still needs a lot of help.' The biggest problem, Morgan says, is the mounting medical bills. He says he'd love to be able to pay them but he can't afford to cover them all. 'It's been a constant battle, the insurance would run out, the Medicare would run out, we are always fighting that fight to just get these bills paid by Medicare,' he said. Alison has four children but while they have tried to help Morgan says they have always had a difficult relationship with their mother due to her drug addiction and prostitution past. Alison revealed she worked as a prostitute in New York as a young woman to clothe and feed her family before Mariah found fame. He said: 'It has to be real hard growing up knowing your mother is an addict and a prostitute, I can't even imagine putting myself in their shoes. 'But Alison did the best she could for her kids, was her best great, no, but she did the best she could.' Morgan says Alison inherited $1.6million from her father Alfred Carey, when he died in 2002, and she set up trust funds for her children. The rest of the money she has squandered on her drug addiction. He says he understands that Mariah - who hasn't spoken to her sister properly since they had a huge argument in 1994 - may not want to hand money to a drug addict through fear it will simply enable her. But he adds: 'Look me personally I'm not going to hand my sister Alison a penny directly, but if I can give money to the person giving her care, I'm going to do it. 'Is there a way of setting up a medical fund? You don't put cash in an addict's hands but you can make sure that their basic medical care is met, it's that simple. 'Mariah can easily manage this and still keep her distance. 'If she wants to hold her grudge, then let her hold her grudge.' He added: 'We just want to make Alison as comfortable as possible and to enjoy some kind of quality of life, I'm trying to do my best to help her.' In 2021 Alison sued Mariah for $1.25million, claiming her 2020 tell-all memoir The Meaning Of Mariah Carey caused 'immense emotional distress.' Alison said that Mariah lied about her older sibling drugging her and her older brother Morgan abusing her as a child in the book. The elder Ms. Carey - who described herself as 'profoundly damaged' - said that the Butterfly singer fabricated the stories 'to promote sales of her book' and offered no 'evidence to substantiate' her claims, according to legal documents obtained by TMZ. Mariah recalls her troubled childhood in the chapter 'Dandelion Tea,' claiming Alison 'gave her Valium, tried to pimp her out and threw a cup of boiling hot tea on her causing third-degree burns' at 12-years-old, according to Alison's Manhattan Supreme Court summons filed Monday. Alison, who is representing herself in the case, says the Honey songstress made the untrue claims despite knowing the damage it would cause her, given her personal trauma and health troubles. She cited trauma stemming from the alleged 'satanic' abuse she suffered at the hands of their mother Patricia, which are the subject of another suit Alison Carey filed against her mom last year, per Page Six. She also said Mariah was aware her sister was suffering from spine and digestive disorders and a traumatic brain injury, short term memory problems and vision problems after being attacked in 2015 in an 'unsolved home invasion.' Alison - who is HIV+ has been arrested for soliciting prostitution in the past - also said she was struggling with alcohol abuse after having been sober for 'a long time.' With this in mind, Alison says her famous sister maliciously 'used her status as a public figure to attack her penniless sister, generating sensational headlines describing lurid claims to promote sales of her book.' The elder Ms. Carey is asking for restitution for 'intentional infliction of immense emotional distress caused by defendant's heartless, vicious, vindictive, despicable and totally unnecessary public humiliation of defendant's already profoundly damaged older sister.' She said she sent Mariah's legal team an offer to settle on January 8th but never heard back, according to the court docs. Morgan said he planned to sue during a November 2020 conversation with The Sun, calling his sister's recollections 'delusional.' In the book she also claims Morgan was hired to kill someone for $30,000, but never went through with the job. 'It’s heartbreaking to witness my little sister’s descent into this hatefully delusional revisionist rant because it is so reminiscent of her unhinged behavior during her first breakdown,' he said. 'The so-called \"memoir\" is laden with lies, distortions and gross revisionism from beginning to end, and I can prove it. Mariah's parents divorced when she was only three years old and the relationship with her father Alfred (pictured) was reduced to spending Sundays together. Alfred Roy Carey passed away from cancer in 2002 at the age of 72 'When I reveal the truth, the facts and supporting evidence, it will be a very harsh pill for she and her publishers to swallow and rest assured I will be filing a lawsuit.' Mariah was similarly chilly while talking about her relationship with her siblings during a profile with Vulture last August, saying: 'Here's the thing: They have been ruthlessly just heartless in terms of dealing with me as a human being for most of my life. I never would have spoken about my family at all had they not done it first.' 'I have forgiveness in my heart, and so I forgive them, but I am not trying to invite anybody to come hang out over here. I think they're very broken, and I feel sad for them.' Mariah says it 'took a lifetime' for her to be brave enough to write the book, which was 'incredibly hard' for her. In the foreword, she writes: 'This book is composed of my memories and my mishaps, my struggles, my survival... I went deep into my childhood and gave the scared little girl inside of me a big voice.'

Liam teased the iconic Britpop band's reunion during his headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday, before he and his older sibling, 57, suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 8.00am after a cryptic and identical post was shared to their social media accounts. According to The Sun the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows . Telling the publication: 'They will announce four shows at Wembley Stadium today, along with a load more dates across the whole of the UK, including in Manchester which will be incredibly poignant for them'. 'Once the announcement is made and their fans are rushing out to buy the tickets, the hard work will start as they get ready to start performing together again. Oasis' rumoured reunion will reportledy see the once feuding Gallagher brothers perform four huge gigs at Wembley before touring the UK next summer (L-R Noel and Liam pictured 2008) According to reports the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows (Wembley Stadium pictured) 'It is something so many people never thought would happen. But now the brakes have been taken off -and it's going to be mad.' MailOnline have contacted Noel and Liam's reps for comment. During his headline slot at Reading Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis, Noel and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen. It then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. According to The Sun the plans are well and truly in motion, with the pair already having reunited for a 'top secret' photoshoot to promote the comeback shows (pictured 2001) During his headline slot at Reading Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary before he and his older sibling suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 8.00am after a cryptic and identical post was shared to their social media accounts Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion. The eye-watering sum is said to have convinced warring brothers Noel, 57, and Liam to bury the hatchet 15 years after they last appeared on stage together. A music industry source previously said that the band's reported ten nights at Wembley Stadium next summer, surpassing the eight-gig record recently set by Taylor Swift, would be a 'tough ask' at this stage of the year with bookings at the iconic London venue already at a near maximum. Read More The late-night phone calls that ended 15-year Oasis feud: Liam Gallagher dedicates Reading headline track to 'greatest songwriter' Noel - then teases more news TOMORROW as £50million reunion tour looks like it's definitely (maybe) ON 'There will be a run of dates at Wembley if the Oasis tour goes ahead, but it's a bit late to confirm a run of 10 dates now,' said a music industry source. 'Instead the tour is likely to take in other big stadiums in London, and in Manchester. Heaton Park is another possibility up there, as is a repeat of Liam Gallagher's more recent gigs at Knebworth.' 10 gigs at Wembley in 2025 would break Taylor Swift's recent record at the venue. The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at the north London venue to delighted crowds in June and August - making her the first solo artist to play the stadium that many times. She told the screaming audience: 'You have made me the first solo artist to play Wembley eight times on a single tour!' Their fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel leaving the band. In recent years, Liam has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform the iconic Britpop band, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion (pictured together 2008) The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at Wembley to delighted crowds in June and August But after Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country. Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front'. He later told his 3.6m followers on the platform: 'I never did like that word FORMER'. Despite the thawing in their relations, the younger Gallagher couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up'.

According to the 58-page brief filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, Smith accused Cannon of having \"erred\" when she tossed the case after ruling the special counsel had been unlawfully appointed. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges related to holding classified documents from the White House at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. Cannon ruled in July that Smith's prosecution of Trump was illegitimate because it violated the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Cannon argued Smith was unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland because he was never confirmed to his position by the U.S. Senate. While Monday's filing does not call for Cannon to be removed from the case, Smith claimed Cannon's ruling \"conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the Attorney General has such authority, and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government.\" Challenges to special counsel authority have failed in court since the 1974 Supreme Court ruling addressing the investigation into former President Richard Nixon. \"The district court deviated from binding Supreme Court precedent, misconstrued the statutes that authorized the special counsel's appointment and took inadequate account of the longstanding history of Attorney General appointments of special counsels,\" Smith's team wrote Monday. Prosecutors also wrote that \"every court to consider the question has concluded that the Supreme Court's determination that those statutes authorized the Attorney General to appoint the Watergate Special Prosecutor was necessary to the decision that a justiciable controversy existed and therefore constitutes a holding that binds lower courts.\" If the Appeals court reverses Cannon's ruling, it could ask the judge to recuse herself from the case.

Smith was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.Prosecutors, however, pointed in the brief to four statutes that they argued give the U.S. attorney general full authority to name special counsels, which they said have been backed by courts when challenged.\"The district court's contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the attorney general has such authority\" to appoint a special prosecutor, they argued.In addition, Cannon's ruling \"is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government,\" the filing emphasized.Smith's team pointed in particular to the Supreme Court case United States v. Nixon, which found that the attorney general had the statutory power to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration in the early 1970s.They warned that Cannon's refusal to recognize the validity of the manner in which Smith was appointed could \"call into question hundreds of appointments throughout the executive branch.\" That \"could jeopardize the longstanding operation of the Justice Department,\" they added.Trump was charged over a year ago with illegally retaining classified documents when he left the White House, haphazardly storing them a Mar-a-Lago, then obstructing authorities' efforts to retrieve them.The expected continuing lengthy legal battle will likely end in the U.S. Supreme Court with no conclusion before the presidential election.There was no immediate reaction to the appeal from Trump or his campaign.","summary":"Prosecutors argued that controversial district Judge Aileen Cannon erred when she ruled Jack Smith's appointment was not legal by ignoring laws and decades of procedure","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/jack-smiths-team-appeals-dismissal-classified-documents-case-against-trump-3740872","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4478278/former-president-donald-trump-special-counsel-jack-smith.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:40:06","author":"Mary Papenfuss","authors":["Mary Papenfuss"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":254983238,"title":"'He says it four times': Experts point out proof Trump 'doesn’t care about free speech'","text":"Donald Trump is the only American president to be impeached twice. This time, he stands accused in a single article of impeachment of \"incitement of insurrection\" for delivering an incendiary speech on January 6 to an angry mob of supporters, sparking them to storm the U.S. Capitol building to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. Trump will now be tried in the Senate. There, he will be given the opportunity to defend his shameless rhetoric and behavior. Among other claims, he will likely mount a defense under the First Amendment and argue that his speech was constitutionally protected by the Supreme Court's landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio. The Senate can be expected to consider Trump's position carefully and fully. But at the end of the proceeding, no matter who leads his legal team, any impeachment defense based on Brandenburg and the First Amendment will be—to put it in the vernacular—complete and utter garbage. Clarence Brandenburg was a small-time bigot who owned a television repair shop in the Village of Arlington Heights, a tiny hamlet roughly 11 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio. He was also a Ku Klux Klan leader. On June 28, 1964, at Brandenburg's invitation, a reporter and a cameraperson from a Cincinnati TV station attended a Klan rally held on a nearby farm. Footage from the rally showed 12 hooded figures gathered around a burning cross, shouting various epithets, including: \"This is what we are going to do to the niggers,\" \"Send the Jews back to Israel,\" \"Save America,\" \"Bury the niggers,\" \"Give us our state [sic] rights,\" and \"Freedom for the whites.\" Brandenburg was also filmed, saying: \"The Klan has more members in the State of Ohio than does any other organization. We're not a revengent [sic] organization, but if our President, our Congress, our Supreme Court, continues [sic] to suppress the white, Caucasian race, it's possible that there might have to be some revengeance [sic] taken.\"\"We are marching on Congress July the Fourth, four hundred thousand strong. From there, we are dividing into two groups, one group to march on St. Augustine, Florida, the other group to march into Mississippi. Thank you.\" Brandenburg was subsequently arrested and convicted of violating Ohio's criminal syndicalism law, which made it a crime to advocate violence as a means of achieving political reform. He was fined and sentenced to prison. Five years later, the Supreme Court reversed his conviction. In its decision, the court articulated a new test for determining the constitutionality of subversive speech, holding that the First Amendment protects advocating the use of force or lawbreaking \"except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" As should be obvious to anyone this side of Rudy Giuliani, Brandenburg's prosecution was entirely different from the incitement case against Trump, both on the facts and the law. Unlike Trump, Brandenburg never threatened imminent action of any kind. His diatribes were racist and repugnant, but also the stuff of addlebrained, semi-grammatical fantasy. Brandenburg had no minions at his command, let alone the 400,000 he had conjured in his speech. He posed no immediate danger to anyone. Trump, by contrast, has millions of dedicated supporters at his disposal. In the first presidential debate in September, he told the Proud Boys to \"stand back, and stand by.\" Starting in December, he began to urge his supporters to come to Washington on January 6, tweeting on December 19 that there would be a \"[b]ig protest,\" and inviting them to \"Be there, will be wild!\" Referring to the protest again at a rally in Georgia on January 4, he pledged, \"We're going to take what they did to us on November 3. We're going to take it back.\" The MAGA zealots, white nationalists, and neofascists who showed up to hear Trump on January 6 were ready, willing and able to do his bidding. They were treated to a rambling speech filled with violent imagery, as the sitting president of the United States urged his supporters to march down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and to \"fight like hell\" to \"stop the steal\" of the election. He even falsely promised to march alongside them, proclaiming, \"I'll be there with you.\" While Trump never mentioned specific acts of violence and only once, in a single brief mention, did he tell his supporters \"to peacefully… make your voices heard,\" the speech as a whole was a call to imminent lawless action, as many in the mob construed it. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times have reported that some of the Capitol marauders actually thought they were acting on direct orders from Trump. In inciting the mob, Trump arguably violated two federal statutes that prohibit insurrection and rebellion against the United States as well as seditious conspiracy. Whether or not Trump is ever criminally prosecuted, he without question committed an impeachable offense. The history of American impeachment clearly establishes that such offenses may encompass both criminal and noncriminal conduct. According to the House of Representatives' procedural practice manual, \"Less than one-third of all the articles [of impeachment] the House has adopted have explicitly charged the violation of a criminal statute or used the word 'criminal' or 'crime' to describe the conduct alleged.\" In Federalist Paper No. 65, Alexander Hamilton described impeachable offenses as \"those… which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.\" [emphasis in original] The First Amendment cannot be invoked to save Trump from an abuse of power so egregious and deadly. To do so would be to turn the amendment on its head. As Joshua Matz and Norm Eisen argued in a January 13 op-ed in Politico, \"the Free Speech Clause exists to protect private citizens from the government, not to protect government officials from accountability for their own abusive statements.\" It's now up to the Senate to sit in judgment on Trump's defilement of the Constitution. To borrow a line from the Broadway musical Hamilton, each and every senator should know, \"History has its eyes on you.\"","summary":"Political experts are criticizing Donald Trump after the ex-president doubled down on a proposal he made last week, saying that people who burn the American flag should be jailed. \n\nMSNBC's Jordan Rubin noted in an article last week: \n\nThe legal problem with that proposal is that it violates the First Amendment.

[+] Technology Raceway. (Photo by David Allio/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Months of negotiations between IndyCar and its teams have created a proposed Charter system and a formal agreement is in the hands of each IndyCar Series team owner, the next step of the process before it is approved and implemented. To break it down in its simplest form, the key numbers to remember are 25, 3, 22, 27. The 25 represents the total number of Charters. No IndyCar Series team owner can have more than three Charters. Of those 25, those entrants will compete for the 22 Leaders Circle positions – a payment worth over $1 million to each entry in the top 22 in points that competes in every event of the season. The 27 indicates the total number of cars that can compete in each race, except for the Indianapolis 500 and its traditional 33-car starting lineup. That doesn’t mean IndyCar is discouraging new teams from participating in its races. If two “Open” cars show up for a race (outside of the top 25 that have Charters), the 25 would be in the race along with the two extra cars. If four “Open” cars show up for a race, then the 25 Charters would be in the race and the four non-Charter entries would have to qualify for the two positions in the starting grid. Two of those four would go home if they were not fast enough to make the field.

Photo by Joe Skibinski | IMS Photo) IndyCar Photo by Joe Skibinski Penske Entertainment CEO Mark Miles explained the details of IndyCar’s Charter system recently and why it is important to the team owners who have been lobbying for such a plan for years. Penske Entertainment is part of the Penske Corporation, owners of IndyCar, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500. “The importance of a Charter is the teams now have a valuation of their operation,” Miles told me. “They own an asset that's this Charter, this agreement, which, at the moment looks like it will be for seven years.” The Charters must be applied for, and approved, by IndyCar. Teams will not need to pay IndyCar for the Charter. If a team wants to sell its Charters to a new team that wants to join the series, then the team that holds the Charter will have equity in what they have accumulated and built over the years. It’s pretty much the same in NASCAR, which also has a Charter System. In other professional sports, a franchise system is used. If a city such as Charlotte, North Carolina or Nashville, Tennessee wants a Major League Baseball team, it can’t just start one up and take the field against the New York Yankees or Los Angeles Dodgers. It would have to gain approval from other MLB team owners for an expansion franchise with a hefty fee or purchase an existing MLB team based in another city and relocate that team to its city. In the past, IndyCar Series team owners have built their operations, competed on the track, acquired a tremendous amount of resources, but when the team owner wants to get out of the series, the team does not have a set value. “There are any number of scenarios,” Miles explained. “For example, if Ed Carpenter has two Charters and wants a third and somebody wants to sell one, an existing team could buy a third. “But it could be a new team. But all of this requires approval when there's one sold.” By contrast, team owner Chip Ganassi has field five full-time entries in 2024. Once the Charter System is approved, he can own only three Charters. The other two cars would not be eligible for Charter consideration. A new team owner could start a team and participate for the same value (outside of the Leaders Circle payments) as the team looking to leave the series or sell one of its Charters.

[+] for SiriusXM) Getty Images for SiriusXM “This is my number one thing out all of racing right now,” team owner Michael Shank of the two-car Meyer Shank Racing told me. “We have got to get this done for the IndyCar ownership groups. “It is a tough, tough deal here. It is not NASCAR. We do not have a kind of the valuation that NASCAR does today. We need this for everybody that has invested heavily in IndyCar. “We're not signed yet, but we're right there. We all have copies of it. We're all going through it right now. “I look forward to signing here momentarily and getting on with our life here.” Miles believes the implementation of the Charter systems is another sign of IndyCar’s growth, and how it protects those teams that have invested in the series. “The other thing that's important about Charters is it's only the 25 Charter cars that can compete to be annually compete to be in the Leaders Circle,” Miles explained. “The Leaders Circle will continue to pay the top 22. Twenty-five will compete for the 22 Leaders Circle payouts. “Those that don’t make the Leaders Circle will still have an asset they can sell and annually, or they can try to get in the Leader's Circle. And they also are straight in, on the grid for all the races except for the Indianapolis 500.” There were some team owners that thought it was important to their sponsors to be locked into the Indianapolis 500. That was very unpopular with race fans, saying it was no different than when the Indy Racing League created the 25-and-8 Rule in 1995 that began with the 1996 Indianapolis 500. The more established teams in CART at that time objected and began its boycott of the Indianapolis 500 that didn’t end until both sides unified in February 2008. As for the documents that have been presented to each team owner for formal approval, Miles indicated it’s an important part of the legal process. The actual concepts have been agreed upon. “We asked the team owners if they could give us the first step, which is sort of some registration information about details of who owns what amounts of which teams,” Miles explained. “And then they'll have to designate kind of the official representative to us and some of that sort of registration stuff by the end of August. “But we haven't set a deadline. We're getting comments. I called most of the team owners this past week and seems like they got to get through it it's. There is some legalese in I, but it seems like it's well received.” Could it be announced by the final race of the season at Nashville Superspeedway on September 15? “I don't know,” Miles said. “We don't have a deadline for ourselves. When it is ready and we are ready to execute, we will announce it. “It’s conceivable to announce it at Nashville.” Roger Penske is the owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the Indianapolis 500 and IndyCar. ...

Globally, 35 million workers identify as such, and 43% of them are self-employed. If you’re considering packing your bag and laptop and spending some time living in another country, you’ve got a lot to think about. First, does the country offer a digital nomad visa? Some countries like Estonia have had their digital nomad visas available for several years, while others, like Italy, are just now coming onboard the digital nomad train. Next, you’ll need to consider your work setup. To be a digital nomad, you’ve got to be able to work 100% remotely. Do you need equipment to do so? Maybe you'll need a video camera so you can attend virtual calls, or a Wi-Fi hotspot if you plan to live somewhere remote. And then you’ll need to consider how you’ll get paid as a digital nomad and how to manage your finances and taxes. That’s what we’ll address in this article. Money management for digital nomads MORE FOR YOU iPhone 16 Release: Apple Confirms Special Event, On A Surprise New Date ‘Exciting Updates’—New Details Of Donald Trump’s Mystery Crypto Project Spark Wild Bitcoin Rival Speculation Trump Signals He May Skip ABC News Debate After Bashing Network Consider the currency If you have established clients in the United States, they likely pay you in dollars. Are you planning to continue to work with American clients or are you planning to make a more permanent move, which would mean you might seek clients in your new country? Also, consider whether you will continue to have American expenses. I’m an expat living in Italy, but I’m still paying for my son’s college education in the States, and I still use an American credit card, so having dollars is still useful. You might strike a balance between dollars and your new currency. I use Bill.com to invoice one client, and I set that up so that when they pay me, it converts to euros that are deposited into my Italian bank account. My other clients pay me in dollars through ACH. Open the right account(s) If you plan to stay long-term in your new country, you’ll want to open a local bank account. This makes it easy to pay your rent and utilities, as well as get cash out of an ATM without fees. And if, like me, you will continue to have American expenses, leave your American bank account open. Now you’ll need an account to connect the two. Many expats and digital nomads use Wise. And while I have a Wise account that I rarely use, I prefer Revolut. I have two accounts there: one in dollars and one in euros. When I need to exchange money, I transfer dollars into my account from my American checking account; exchange my dollars for euros, minus a surprisingly low fee; and then transfer the euros to my Italian bank account. Gone are the days when your only option was a $25 wire transfer! More articles from AllBusiness: How Wordle and Other Games Can Improve Your Leadership Skills How to Grow Your Small Business: 5 Action Items to Try Now Keep the right credit card If you have an American credit card you’re reluctant to get rid of because it gives you rewards like cash back or travel points, check to see if there are foreign transaction fees, because they can really add up. I use the Capital One Venture X card because it has great travel perks (allowing me to fly back to the U.S. to visit family without paying full price when I redeem points) and because there are no foreign transaction fees. I use the card for both American expenses and for Italian expenses. Understand your tax situation You will need to find out what the requirements are for foreigners in the country you're in. In some countries, you also may be required to pay taxes locally, or at least file taxes. Some countries, like Italy where I am, have an agreement with the United States that prevents expats from being double taxed. Your best bet is to find a local accountant who understands how to file taxes for foreigners, specifically Americans. Trust me: start your search for this magical individual early, because there aren’t a lot of financial professionals who understand our unique situation as digital nomads! You also will still need to continue paying self-employment taxes in the United States for Medicare and Social Security. And if you still have ties to a state in the U.S., such as owning property there, you’ll have to file state taxes as well. You can use tax software to file your American taxes like you always have. When you start the filing process, the software will ask where you live, and you can indicate the country and when you moved there. When it comes to Social Security, see what the agreement is between the United States and your new home. Here in Italy, I had to provide a certificate of coverage from the Social Security office to show that I’m paying into American Social Security and will receive it when I retire. Otherwise, I would have to pay the equivalent in Italy. Get your finances in order before you go Figuring out how to get paid and manage your finances as a digital nomad isn’t overly complicated, but you will want to start thinking about these details before you uproot yourself from America!

Kennedy Jr.’s suspension of his campaign and endorsement of Donald Trump on Friday are a testament to why Trump has maintained his longevity in politics despite his controversial persona, crippling legal attacks, and endless bad press. Contrary to media narratives, Trump’s unanticipated rise to popularity does not stem from a far-right threat to democracy, but rather from genuine grassroots concerns related to the direction of America under the rule of increasingly illiberal forces on the left. Kennedy’s commitment to speaking truths unpopular in mass media and Democratic circles led CNN to cut away from its live coverage of his speech. Kennedy focused the defense of his endorsement on the grounds common to many who begrudgingly support Trump’s presidency. This includes his interests in alleviating the suffering of the poor and his commitment to core American values diametrically opposed by the modern iteration of the Democratic Party. The structure of tyranny Kennedy credibly bolsters his position by understanding tyranny. Instead of focusing on rhetoric, he sharpens his analysis on how power truly operates, observing that the consolidation of power — not mean tweets — creates fertile ground for tyrannical rule. This endorsement was a repudiation of the Democratic Party and what RFK Jr. described as the “consolidation of corporate and econ power,” a consolidation he believes would be “complete” should the Democratic Party have another four years of power over the United States. And it is the Democratic Party, not Donald Trump, that possesses the institutional backing capable of ushering in the tyranny Democrats rhetorically decry. The lack of actual democratic processes and procedures within the Democratic Party is not lost on Kennedy, who accurately described his former party as cynically saving democracy by systematically dismantling it. Kennedy spoke Friday of high stakes and focused on the structural reality of how democracy is destroyed. At its core, his message was equally uplifting and depressing. It was inspiring because he spoke to the American people as a true statesman, someone interested in the well-being of the country rather than pandering to create a perception popular among the powerful and well connected. Still, his words were tainted with pain. Kennedy grew up immersed in Democratic politics, and he never intended to break with his family's party. However, he chose to place principle over party or power, setting an example of virtue for the public. Despite this, his commitment to speaking truths that are unpopular in mass media and Democratic circles led CNN to cut away from its live coverage of his speech. Censorship serves Democratic Party power This incident only reinforces one of Kennedy’s main critiques of the current Democratic Party: It is a party of elites who maintain their grip on power through anti-democratic means. These methods include the weaponization of government agencies and, crucially, the propaganda spread by the party’s “mouthpieces” and “stenographers” in corporate newsrooms. His challenge of the media as “organs” of the Democratic Party is integral to his understanding of the party as an existential threat to the American way of life. He diagnoses the problems associated with the near-monopoly the Democratic Party has on mainstream outlets, stating the truth, not lies, is censored by those in power. RFK’s alarm over the “resort to censorship and media control” highlights the dire state of America’s current political life. A sitting U.S. president’s ability to use the bully pulpit to collude with or coerce media companies into censoring political speech represents an overt attack on “the most sacred right of free expression,” which lies at the heart of the American experiment in self-governance. Kennedy’s sincerity and courage serve as a bittersweet reminder of what was once revered in American politics. He now stands as a traitor to a party that abandoned its principles in pursuit of power. Despite his family’s statement denouncing his endorsement of Trump, Kennedy placed his principles above power, popularity, and convenience. In a sea of imposters and charlatans jockeying for power, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains a man who places people before partisan politics. He may prove to be the nation’s last true Democrat.","summary":"Robert F.

County election boards are also required to hold a meeting to verify their vote count on the Friday after election day, which is before the ballot return deadline for voters overseas and in the military. The three right-wing members - Janelle King, Rick Jeffares and Janice Johnston - were recently praised by Donald Trump for championing new rules. The former president called them “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory.” Trump has beem charged in Fulton County, Georgia, alongside his former attorney Rudy Giuliani and others with election interference charges. Trump has claimed that he lost Georgia to President Joe Biden due to widespread election fraud - which there is no evidence of. Representative Lucy McBath, a Democrat, called the board’s new rules a “concerted effort to subvert democracy and move us backward.” “With passing this new rule, they are creating barriers to counting votes and certifying the elections so Donald Trump can once again attempt to throw our country into chaos,” she said. The Democratic Party has sued to challenge the rules, arguing that they could delay certification and lead to disputes over the vote. Kamala Harris’s campaign endorsed the lawsuit, according to the Journal-Constitution. “Certifying an election is not a choice, it’s the law,” Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign, said. “A few unelected extremists can’t just decide not to count your vote.” At least 19 election officials across Georgia have refused to verify various election results since 2020. King, one of the three right-wing board members who advocated for the new rules, dismissed criticisms against them. “I’m going to continue to do what’s right and let the Democrats play the political games,” King told the Atlanta newspaper. “There’s nothing we’re doing that will impact certification. If they have the proper information needed to certify, you won’t see them even attempt to delay certification.” Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon also said the rule changes are “common sense rules that ensure election integrity,” according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “In no way do these rule changes interfere with anyone’s right to vote or cause undue burdens on election workers, but these steps will ensure transparency, accountability, accurate reporting and reconciliation,” McKoon added. The Independent has contacted King, Jeffares and Johnston for comment.","summary":"Donald Trump recently praised the right-wing coalition on the Georgia state election board","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-election-trump-brian-kemp-b2602111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/26/23/GettyImages-2158908857.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZWpfCk0H-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:28:47","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":254982570,"title":"Donald Trump's Electricity Plan Is Popular With Democrats","text":"Nearly half of Democrats surveyed in one poll are in favor of expanding nuclear energy throughout America, an idea recently touted by former president Donald Trump.Nuclear energy's favorability has increased in recent years as more people recognize it as a clean energy source and alternative to fossil fuels, the use of which can exacerbate climate change. Trump spoke in favor of expanding nuclear energy across America, specifically in regard to how he sees nuclear power as an avenue to increase the nation's energy supply needed for artificial intelligence (AI), in a discussion with Shawn Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contractor, that aired on Monday.\"For AI you will need...more electricity than we have right now,\" Trump said. \"You'll need double the energy that we produce right now just for that one industry if we're going to be the big player.\"\"President Trump has said he wants to utilize all forms of energy, while Comrade Kamala wants to demonize energy producers as she peddles her Green New Scam,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung told Newsweek. Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign by email for comment.However, current federal rules and regulations—many of which were passed decades ago to protect the environment but now slow infrastructure projects needed to meet the U.S. government's environmental goals from occurring at the needed pace—make it difficult to construct nuclear power plants on an efficient timeline.\"So we have to produce massive electricity that we don't have, but the environmental impact statements won't allow us to do that,\" Trump said. \"The rules and regulations that we currently have won't allow us to do any of it, not even a tiny fraction of it. But if I'm president, we'll be able to do it.\"Trump's plan to build more nuclear power plants is one that could prove agreeable among Democrats, according to a poll completed in May and updated in August by the Pew Research Center. The poll surveyed 8,638 randomly selected U.S. adults and found that 49 percent of Democrats said they were in favor of expanding nuclear energy sources across the U.S.Democrats are more likely to support clean energy like wind or solar, with 88 percent and 91 percent of poll-takers voicing their support for each source respectively, but neither energy source is completely innocent in its impact on the environment, particularly with regards to harming wildlife. Far more Democrats support nuclear energy than energy acquired from offshore oil or gas drilling, hydraulic fracturing or coal mining.\"Nuclear now has become very good, very safe,\" Trump said in the Ryan interview.It's also one of the cleanest forms of energy available, which helps bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans, although the latter are more inclined to support the expansion of nuclear power plants. However, the Democrats voicing their support for expanding America's nuclear energy profile has increased by 12 points since 2020, Pew Research Center reported.","summary":"Donald Trump recently spoke in favor of expanding nuclear energy around the U.S., a plan supported by 49 percent of Democrats.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-nuclear-energy-popular-democrats-1944649","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2458239/donald-trumps-nuclear-energy-plan-popular-democrats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:27:32","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":254983172,"title":"Debating points: Trump, Harris trade shots over September showdown","text":"The campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are arguing in advance of their high-stakes Sept. 10 debate over whether microphones should be muted except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, and even whether the showdown will occur. While it’s common for campaigns to quibble beforehand over debate mechanics, both Harris and Trump are under pressure to deliver a strong performance next month in Philadelphia. The first debate during this campaign led to President Joe Biden’s departure from the race. Trump on Sunday night raised the possibility that he might not show up on ABC, posting on his Truth Social network that he had watched the network’s Sunday show with a “so-called Panel of Trump Haters” and posited, “why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?” and urging followers to “Stay tuned!!” The current dispute centers on the muting of microphones when a candidate isn’t speaking, a condition both Biden and Trump accepted for their June debate hosted by CNN. Both sides are accusing the other of gaming the system to protect their candidate. Biden’s campaign team made microphone muting a condition of its decision to accept any debates this year, and some aides now regret the decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump’s outbursts during the debate. That move likely would not have helped the incumbent Democrat’s disastrous performance. The Harris campaign now wants microphones to be live all the time, according to Harris spokesman Brian Fallon, who issued a statement needling Trump. “Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,” Fallon said. Harris “is ready to deal with Trump’s constant lies and interruptions in real time. Trump should stop hiding behind the mute button.” Trump spokesman Jason Miller retorted that the Republican nominee had “accepted the ABC debate under the exact same terms as the CNN debate.” He alleged Harris’ representatives sought “a seated debate, with notes, and opening statements.” Miller then took a shot at Harris not sitting for an interview or holding a news conference since Biden ended his reelection and endorsed her, arguing her campaign now wants “to give her a cheat sheet for the debate.” The Harris campaign denied Miller’s claim that she wanted notes or to be seated during the debate. “I’d rather have it probably on,” Trump said Monday during a stop in the Washington area, when asked if he wanted microphones muted. “I didn’t like it the last time, but it worked out fine,” he added, in terms of the policy during his debate with Biden. “We agreed to the same rules — same rules, same specifications,” Trump noted, for his Sept. 10 debate with Harris. “And I think that’s probably what it should be.” Asked how he was preparing for the debate, Trump responded, “I’m not. … I think my whole life I’ve been preparing for a debate.” Complicating the negotiations this year is that debates are being orchestrated on an ad hoc basis by host networks, as opposed to the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, through which debate rules were negotiated privately. Microphones have been unmuted for both candidates for most of televised presidential debate history. The debate commission announced that its October 2020 debate would have microphones muted when candidates were not recognized to speak after the first Biden-Trump contest descended into a shouting match. The second 2020 debate with the microphone muting rules was widely celebrated for being more substantive than the earlier matchup.","summary":"Trump on Sunday night raised the possibility that he might not show up on ABC, posting on his Truth Social network that he had watched the network's Sunday show with a \"so-called Panel of Trump Haters\" and posited, \"why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?\" and urging followers to \"Stay tuned!!\"","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/26/debating-points-trump-harris-trade-shots-over-september-showdown/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24239697707455.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:27:20","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":254982454,"title":"Aaron Judge: Not On Fire, But Having The Best Stretch Of All-Time","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin NEW YORK, NEW YORK - AUGUST 23: Aaron Judge #99 of the New York Yankees celebrates after hitting a ... [+] sixth inning home run against the Colorado Rockies at Yankee Stadium on August 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) Getty Images Aaron Judge did the most amazing thing Saturday, when he did nothing in front of a crowd of 40,438 at Yankee Stadium. (Nothing here means going hitless with a walk and a hit by pitch in four plate appearances, which is still a pretty good day, all things considered) Judge did the second-most amazing thing Sunday, when he treated the crowd of 41,324 to exactly what it expected — witnessing Judge join some of the most select company in sports by hitting not only his 50th homer but also his 51st in the Yankees’ 10-3 win over the Rockies. This is what it’s come to for Judge: It’s almost as newsworthy when he DOESN’T meet the almost impossibly high expectations he’s set for himself as it is when he performs like a video game cheat code. “There’s no better guy for that moment and the opportunity every night — and that’s the point,” Giancarlo Stanton said Friday night. “He’s on the biggest stage. You don’t shy away from the biggest moments on the biggest stage.” Becoming just the fifth player ever with at least three 50-homer seasons — joining Babe Ruth, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa (four apiece) and Alex Rodriguez — almost pales in comparison to what Judge is doing this year and since May 3 in particular.

Only four players not named Barry Bonds have posted an on-base percentage of .465 or higher over a full season this century — Jason Giambi twice and Chipper Jones, Carlos Delgado and Todd Helton once apiece. (Juan Soto finished with a .490 on-base percentage during the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign). Only three players have recorded a .736 slugging percentage or better in a full season since World War II — Bonds (three times), McGwire and Sosa. Jeff Bagwell had a .750 slugging percentage in 1994, when he suffered a broken left hand two days before the strike ended the season. Judge has as many homers through the Yankees’ first 131 games as he did in 2022, when he hit 62 homers to break the team and AL mark set by Roger Maris in 1961. Only Sosa and McGwire have hit 60 homers in a season more than once. Just imagine how good Judge would be if he hadn’t spent the first 33 games — a smidge more than 20 percent of the season — mired in a deep slump. Judge was hitting .197 with six homers, 18 RBIs and a .725 OPS (a .331 on-base percentage and a .393 slugging percentage) through May 2. Since then, Judge is hitting an incomprehensible .383 with 45 homers, 104 RBIs and a 1.373 OPS (a .512 on-base percentage and an .861 slugging percentage) in 96 games. Those figures over a full season would be remarkable for even the most decorated of Hall of Famers. Only 31 Hall of Famers have put together at least one season with at least 45 homers and 104 RBIs. Since Ted Williams became the most recent .400 hitter in 1941, only four players — Williams in 1957, Rod Carew in 1977, George Brett Brett in 1980 and Tony Gwynn in 1994 — have hit better than .383 while qualifying for the batting title in a season lasting at least 100 games. Just six players have posted a slugging percentage of .512 or better in a season lasting at least 100 games: Babe Ruth (five times), Bonds (four times), Williams (twice), John McGraw (twice), Billy Hamilton and Mickey Mantle Mantle . The only player to record a slugging percentage of .861 or better in a season lasting at least 100 games is Bonds, who had an .863 mark when he hit his record 73 homers in 2001. And the only players to post an OPS of 1.373 or greater in a season lasting at least 100 games are Ruth and Bonds. But those icons did it over a full season. Judge, once again, has done this over 96 games, which puts him on a 162-game pace for 77 homers and 175 RBIs. The 77 homers would break Bonds’ single-season mark while the 175 RBIs would be tied for the fourth-most all-time and the most since Jimmie Foxx had 175 RBIs in 1938. This is, by any stretch, the greatest single-season 96-game stretch anyone has ever enjoyed. That’s the highest of high praise, especially for those of us who remember Eric Davis’ 1987 season (when, for the record, he was hitting .318 with 32 homers, 87 RBIs and 39 stolen bases to go with a .414 on-base percentage and a .668 slugging percentage for a 1.081 OPS in his first 96 games). “It doesn’t even feel like he’s on fire to me or anything like that,” manager Aaron Boone said. “He’s just that good.” Alas, there’s no chance in getting Judge to join the rest of us in marveling over what is taking place. For better or for worse, Judge has not only succeeded Derek Jeter as the Yankees’ captain, he’s also echoing Jeter’s championship-or-misery mantra and mimicking his inscrutable public persona. So any acknowledgment of his feats will probably have to wait many years, perhaps until Judge is standing on stage at the Clark Sports Center in Cooperstown sometime in the late 2030s. Still, Judge’s poker face cracked ever so slightly when he grinned upon being told Boone didn’t think he was on fire. “I agree,” Judge said. “Once we get locked in, I’ll let you guys know. There’s always work to be done.” And history to be made. Follow me on Twitter.

The agency scheduled a hearing on the proposed rule change for December 2, according to a report from cannabis news outlet Marijuana Moment. The proposed rule is the result of a review of U.S. cannabis policy that was ordered by President Joseph Biden in October 2022. At the same time, the president pardoned thousands of individuals with federal convictions for simple cannabis possession, a move that was expanded a year later to include thousands more Americans with convictions under federal drug laws.

In the review, researchers with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that credible evidence shows that marijuana has legitimate medical uses and fits the criteria for rescheduling under the CSA. In April 2024, the DEA indicated it would approve the effort to reschedule marijuana, later issuing a proposed rule to facilitate the change under federal law. “This is a positive step forward for federal cannabis policy, however it is a rather modest step given the strong support among American voters for comprehensive cannabis reform,” Matthew Schweich, executive director of the cannabis policy reform group Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement after the DEA’s decision to reschedule cannabis. “It is important to acknowledge that this rescheduling would not affect the criminalization of medical cannabis patients and cannabis consumers under state laws – so we must continue the work of enacting sensible and fair cannabis legalization and medical cannabis laws through state legislatures and ballot initiatives.” DEA Hears Input On Rule Change After announcing it had agreed to reschedule cannabis, the DEA opened a 60-day public comment period on May 21, 2024, giving Americans interested in the proposal an opportunity to weigh in on the anticipated change to federal drug policy. Many groups and individuals submitted comments during this period, including supporters and opponents of cannabis reform, medical professionals, researchers, law enforcement officials, and state governments. The public comment period ended on July 22 with 43,000 comments submitted, nearly 10 times the number for a typical comment period.

Among those calling for marijuana to be rescheduled, nearly 62% noted that they prefer that cannabis be descheduled completely and 38% advocated for a classification less strict than Schedule III. Several of those who commented on the proposed rule change asked the DEA to schedule a hearing on the matter. According to a notice signed by DEA Administrator Anne Milgram and published in the Federal Register on Monday, such a hearing has been scheduled for December 2.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told The Dispatch last week when asked if the Harris campaign has voiced its support for legislation he proposed last October that would dramatically overhaul the high court. Under Whitehouse’s bill, Supreme Court appointments would be “regularized,” with the president appointing a new justice biennially. Only the nine most recently appointed justices would sit for “appellate jurisdiction” cases, which are typically the most high-profile cases with far-reaching effects, such as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization and former President Donald Trump’s immunity case. The newly-appointed jurists would spend 18 years participating in appellate jurisdiction cases, after which they would be limited to hearing the court’s small number of “original jurisdiction” cases, such as those involving disputes between states. President Biden and Harris announced their support for a revamped Supreme Court system last month in which a justice would be appointed every two years and spend 18 years in active service. The proposal, however, was light on details and did not mention whether the reforms would be sought through congressional legislation, a constitutional amendment or executive action. Whitehouse, at an event on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention last week, further revealed that Democratic lawmakers are “virtually certain” to ram through a package of controversial legislative reforms – including the court-packing bill – if they win a controlling majority of the government in November. “To get around the filibuster, we’re going to have to have a process that allows very substantial debate from the Senate minority,” Whitehouse said at an event hosted by the Brennan Center for Justice, according to The Dispatch. “We are not going to want to give the Republicans multiple stalls, multiple filibusters on this.” “So the bill that gets around the filibuster will be virtually certain to include permanent reproductive rights, permanent restored voting rights, getting rid of corrupting billionaire dark money, and Supreme Court reform.” Whitehouse predicted that a bill of that magnitude would have “spectacular tailwinds behind it” in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer confirmed to reporters at the DNC that doing away with the upper chamber’s traditional three-fifths majority requirement to pass legislation is at the top of his agenda if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump and Democrats take control of both the House and the Senate. Schumer noted that he did not have majority support for ending the filibuster after the 2022 midterm election cycle because of opposition from independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia – who are both leaving the Senate next year.

The issue has been hotly debated by the Pentagon, congressional legislators, and state governors, turning it into what has been dubbed a “political lightning rod.” At a campaign stop in Detroit Monday, Trump told members of the National Guard Association that one of his “proudest achievements” in office was the creation of the Space Force. “It’s a big deal,” the Republican presidential nominee told the attendees. Trump, who is floundering as Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris surges in the polls, said the “time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force.” He told the crowd that Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who Trump denigrated during the 2016 primaries as “Little Marco,” was a big supporter of a Space National Guard, supposedly telling the 45th president: “I love this, I love it, I love it.” “So, we’re going to do that,” Trump went on. “Space Force has been very important. Very, very important. When I did that, the, the people came in, they wanted to end it, and they were just hammered, because people realized how important we were getting, just, destroyed in space.” The existing National Guard presently has space-centric units in seven states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, New York, and Ohio — and Guam. The concept of a separate Space National Guard has been floating around since 2019, when Trump established the Space Force. National Guard leaders have come out in favor of such a plan. However, many experts have criticized any such initiative as one that would create unnecessary bureaucracy, complications, and costs. “Creating a Space National Guard would effectively tie the service’s hands in managing its personnel and create wasteful overhead and duplication that drain funding and leadership attention away from higher priorities,” American Enterprise Institute defense analyst Todd Harrison wrote in May. “Congress should keep the Space Force lean and agile and give it the authority it is requesting to manage its personnel as one unified component.” Last month, retiring National Guard Bureau boss Gen. Daniel Hokanson warned that transferring Air National Guard units into the Space Force could rob states of important resources and lead to unintended consequences if it were to come to pass. Almost every governor is against the idea of transferring Air National Guard units to the Space Force, which has been proposed by the Biden administration instead of a fully separate Space National Guard. Others, like West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who in May left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent, have come out in favor of an independent Space National Guard. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would cost at least $120 million to stand up a Space National Guard consisting of 1,500 “Guardians.”","summary":"‘The time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force,’ Trump says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-space-force-national-guard-b2602110.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/26/22/fc34ca26dd5040ffb12e062c42ee7c6c.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qlrnkHK3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:17:35","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":254983088,"title":"Appeals Court Turns Down RFK Jr. Bid for Injunction Against Google","text":"A federal appeals court on Aug. 26 declined to block Google from removing Robert F. Kennedy’s videos, ruling that Kennedy has not shown that the California-based company was a state actor when taking down the videos. Kennedy’s lawyers said in a request for a preliminary injunction that Google was acting on advice from government officials when it removed multiple videos for allegedly violating the company’s medical misinformation policy. The lawyers requested an injunction blocking Google from removing additional videos from Kennedy’s YouTube page. “Americans may agree with Mr. Kennedy’s views. They may disagree with them. They may vote for Kennedy or reject him at the ballot box. Whatever the case, our Constitution requires that voters have an unfettered chance to hear Mr. Kennedy speak. That is the only way they can make an educated decision when exercising their right to vote,” they said in their motion. Google said it was merely applying its own policy and urged the court to deny the request. U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in 2023 sided with Google, finding that Kennedy had not established Google as a state actor and, therefore, rights from the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment have not been implicated. Private entities can be treated as a state actor if shown to have acted under “coercive power” or “significant encouragement” from government officials, under court precedent. “Google asserts that it is a private entity with its own First Amendment rights and that it removed Kennedy’s videos on its own volition pursuant to its own misinformation policy and not at the behest of the federal government. Kennedy has not rebutted Google’s claim that it exercised its independent editorial choice in removing his videos,” a three-judge panel said in the unanimous decision. “Nor has Kennedy identified any specific communications from a federal official to Google concerning the removed Kennedy videos, or identified any threatening or coercive communication, veiled or otherwise, from a federal official to Google concerning Kennedy. As Kennedy has not shown that Google acted as a state actor in removing his videos, his invocation of First Amendment rights is misplaced,” the judges added. U.S. Circuit Judges Consuelo M. Callahan and Gabriel P. Sanchez were part of the panel with U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt, who was sitting by designation. Google did not respond to a request for comment. A lawyer representing Kennedy said the ruling fell short. “This unpublished opinion leaves much to be desired. It contains no analysis, much less meaningful discussion of the important First Amendment issues raised in the case,” Scott James Street told The Epoch Times in an email. “Given the lack of meaningful analysis, we plan to move the case forward, both in the trial court and, if necessary, in the Supreme Court.” Kennedy, an independent, suspended his campaign this month and announced his support for former President Donald Trump.","summary":"Robert F.

In a brief filed with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Monday, Smith argued that Cannon's decision to end the Trump case because the prosecutors' office lacked constitutional authority was \"novel\" and \"lack[ed] merit.\" Cannon had ruled the Justice Department didn't have the ability to appoint or fund special counsels like Smith. Smith's team also cast the decision from Cannon as not just affecting other special counsel prosecutions - of which there are several ongoing in other courts, against Trump and Hunter Biden, among others - but also as potentially affecting the power of leaders across the federal government, as reported by CNN. \"If the Attorney General lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the Department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office, other than the few that are specifically identified by statute,\" Smith's office wrote in the 81-page filing. \"The district court's rationale would likewise raise questions about hundreds of appointments throughout the Executive Branch, including in the Departments of Defence, State, Treasury, and Labor,\" the prosecutors added. Trump was charged last summer with several counts of mishandling sensitive government documents taken from his White House at the end of the presidency. The Republican presidential nominee also faces several obstruction charges for alleged efforts to hinder the federal probe into the materials. The former president and his two co-defendants - Trump employees also accused of obstruction - have pleaded not guilty. The 11th Circuit is reviewing the determinations by Cannon that Smith's appointment as special counsel was unconstitutional and that his office was being unlawfully funded, as reported by CNN. Notably, though other courts have upheld the use of special counsels, Cannon said that Congress had not given the Justice Department the authority to make such an appointment, while also concluding that the funding for Smith's office had not been properly appropriated by lawmakers.

Yet, the real breakthrough for iOS that will make an immediate difference to Apple’s community will come from a more practical source… your MacBook Pro. Remember that the first release of iOS 18 will not feature the backronymed Apple Intelligence features—that will hopefully come in October— but it will launch alongside this year's macOS release. 2024’s edition is named Sonoma, and among the usual bug fixes and security updates, you will find a new feature in iPhone Mirroring. Once connected and authenticated, you will see your iPhone’s display in its window on your Mac. From here, you can use your keyboard, mouse and trackpad to work with your iPhone. That includes all of the first- and third-party applications you have on your iPhone, as well as your notifications. The iPhone Mirroring feature requires both iOS 18 and macOS Sonoma. This means you should be able to run this on any iPhone going back to the iPhone XR or second-generation iPhone SE and any Mac or MacBook running any Apple Silicon chipset. Curiously, any Intel-based Mac that supports the t2 security chipset will also offer the feature—a rare new feature for non-ARM laptops. While this may be a new feature to macOS and iOS, it’s something familiar to many Android users, with several manufacturers heavily promoting the capability to share their phone and laptop; both Samsung and Honor have featured linking to Windows desktops and laptops as part of a connected lifestyle. It looks like Tim Cook and his team are ready to catch up with the competition in more ways than one with the iPhone 16, 16 Pro, and iOS 18.

By Sydney Kashiwagi The Minnesota Star Tribune August 26, 2024 at 11:07PM Joe Teirab speaks during a congressional candidate forum at Farmfest in Morgan, Minn., on Tuesday, Aug. 6. (Shari L. Gross/The Associated Press) Republicans in the competitive Second Congressional District will decide Tuesday evening whether to throw their support behind primary winner Joe Teirab to challenge DFL Rep. Angie Craig in November. The former federal prosecutor won the GOP primary two weeks ago, but did so without the backing of his local Republican party, which had endorsed grassroot conservative candidate Tayler Rahm. Rahm suspended his campaign in July to work as Trump’s senior advisor in Minnesota, a move that upset some of his supporters who had campaigned for him. After he dropped out, his mailers and lawn signs could be seen throughout the district, even after Teirab won former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Rahm won 24% of the primary vote without campaigning. Second Congressional District GOP Chairman Joe Ditto said he thinks the full committee vote on Tuesday is going to be a toss up. “I’d say they’re pretty split,” Ditto said. “A lot of them want to unite behind the winner of the primary and others are still bitter about the way things went down.” Without the party’s backing, Teirab cannot receive resources from them and they can’t help him campaign. Tuesday’s meeting comes after the committee decided before the primary to not hold an endorsement convention after Rahm dropped out of the race. “I don’t entirely know what to expect,” said Will Beck, deputy chair of the Second Congressional District Republican Party. Beck said he voted for Rahm in the primary but would not say how he will vote Tuesday, although he plans to support Teirab in November against Craig. “I guess we’ll have to wait and see. I know people are upset with what happened and many are still not keen on supporting Teirab,” Beck continued. Some Rahm supporters have been reluctant or have refused to back Teirab because he didn’t follow through on his pledge to drop out of the race if he did not get the party’s endorsement. Some view Teirab as an establishment candidate, and point to Rep. Tom Emmer’s joint fundraising committee backing Teirab as evidence of the majority whip and Washington’s influence in the high-stakes race. Related Coverage Elections Joe Teirab wins in competitive Second District GOP primary Teirab said in an interview ahead of the vote that he feels confident about his chances heading into Tuesday. “I’ve talked to so many people that supported my primary opponent, who I think is a great American and made a tough decision, but I think we’re all on the same page and unified against Angie Craig,” Teirab said. Rahm did not throw his support behind Teirab after he left the race. When asked if he has heard from Rahm since his primary victory, Teirab would not say. “Our campaign’s been been in contact with him and his team, and so I’m excited about continuing that conversation and working with him and the Trump team to make sure we we flip CD2,” Teirab said. After the primary, Craig, who is seeking her fourth term, criticized Teirab as the candidate of Washington Republicans and said she would soon see him on the debate stage.","summary":"Teirab is running in one of the most closely watched House races this cycle, but so far he’s been doing it without the local party’s backing.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/cd2-gop-to-decide-whether-to-back-joe-teirab-post-primary/601131896","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/startribunemedia/ADOTG75PPNGLLPLXAEY7WJ7WMY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:07:41","author":"Sydney Kashiwagi","authors":["Sydney Kashiwagi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.713},{"id":254981976,"title":"Trump can win on character, no green tears over spilled oil and other commentary","text":"From the right: Trump Can Win on Character Friendly advice that Donald Trump should focus on the economy or “concentrate more on the issues in this campaign” is “ insufficient to making the case against Kamala Harris,” argues Rich Lowry at The New York Times: Character matters, meaning “the attributes that play into the question of whether someone is suited to the presidency.” Make the case that “Harris is weak, a phony, and doesn’t truly care about the country or the middle class.” Shift “scattershot” attacks to focus “on these character attributes.” Thus: “She is too weak to hold open town-hall events or do extensive — or, at the moment, any — sit-down media interviews,” and “she is a shape-shifting opportunist who can and will change on almost anything when politically convenient.” There’s “plenty of room for Mr. Trump, as he insists he must, to do it his way” and still “make a root-and-branch argument that she shouldn’t be — can’t be — president.” Mideast Watch: No Green Tears Over Spilled Oil As the “kidnapping, humanitarian-aid-obstructing, cholera-exacerbating Islamists who carried out a ‘partial and limited reintroduction of slavery’ are reenacting the Exxon Valdez spill” in the Red Sea, thunders National Review’s Jim Geraghty, “you barely hear a peep from the green crowd.” A State Department spokesman lamely calls “on the Houthis to cease these actions immediately.” Where are the folks who’re “supposed to create and carry out policies deterring and punishing these sorts of reckless attacks”? President Biden “has not made any substantive remarks about the threat from the Houthis since January.” And one of his “first actions was to remove the Iranian-backed Houthis from the US list of global terrorist organizations.” If he’s staying in office ’til Jan. 20, “is it too much to ask that he comes out and talk about these sorts of things once in a while?” DNC beat: Dems’ Plan To Spread Poverty While lots of “celebrities, labor leaders and politicians” spoke at last week’s Democratic National Convention, notes The Wall Street Journal’s Allysia Finley, missing were “entrepreneurs who generate middle-class jobs.” Democrats “took turns whacking ‘oligarchs’ and ‘corporate monopolists,’”; by the time Harris took the stage, “the pinatas’ pickings had been splattered around.” This is “what Democrats plan to do if they win: destroy wealth creators so they can spread the booty among their own.” They call for “taxing success so government can hand out money” and grow itself. “As long as we look to legislation to cure poverty, or to abolish special privilege,” warned Henry Ford, we’ll see “poverty spread and special privilege grow.” That, sighs Finley, is “the joyous future Americans can expect during a Harris presidency.” Conservative: Dems Pushed RFK Jr. To Trump Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s endorsement of Donald Trump “sent shockwaves throughout the Democrat establishment,” writes the American Thinker’s Earick Ward. “This was surely not an easy decision for RFK,” but “he believed” there are issues “ that needed to be addressed . . . that mattered to the Democrat electorate,” and the Democratic Party “kicked him to the curb.” “It is reported that RFK reached out to the Kamala Harris campaign a couple weeks ago” and said “he’d be willing to drop out of the race, if he could be considered for a cabinet post,” and he “was rebuffed.” “What was he supposed to do?” Eye on the economy: A Looming Inflation-Hiker With inflation still a “top concern,” warns Diana Furchtgott-Roth at The Hill, “it appears more price hikes and supply-chain problems are coming.” With East Coast labor contracts expiring Sept. 30, “the International Longshoremen’s Association is threatening to strike.” The union wants a 32% pay hike and no more automation at ports. Per one expert, “a one-day strike would take five days to clear,” while “a two-week strike wouldn’t be cleared until 2025.” This could mean “driving up inflation and shutting down the nation’s economy.” Hmm: “Railroad and airline crews cannot simply decide to stop working”; that port workers can is something “Congress should take another look at.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Friendly advice that Donald Trump should focus on the economy or “concentrate more on the issues in this campaign” is “ insufficient to making the case against Kamala Harris,” argues Rich Lowry at The New York Times.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/opinion/trump-can-win-on-character-no-green-tears-over-spilled-oil-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2024-detroit-michigan-michigans-importance-88338750-e1724711730767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:04:14","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":254981968,"title":"Harris, Trump chase union workers in 2024 election battleground states","text":"Harris, Trump chase union workers in 2024 election battleground states Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are focusing their efforts in several battleground states to court union workers who may help sway the 2024 presidential election.

The lawsuit claims that the board intended to give local election officials a broad license to “hunt for purported election irregularities of any kind, potentially delaying certification and displacing longstanding (and court-supervised) processes for addressing fraud.” The lawsuit was filed in state court by local election officials, political candidates, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia with support from Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign. The move comes weeks after the state election board voted 3-2 to pass rules to give election officials authority to conduct “reasonable inquiry” into elections before certification and to require that county election officials be given “all election related documentation” before certification. Both rules, the lawsuit argues, create the impression that local election officials have discretionary power over certifying election results. The political spotlight has pivoted back to Georgia in recent weeks, since President Biden withdrew from the presidential race and polls have shown Ms. Harris closing the gap with former President Donald J. Trump in the critical swing state. The increasingly close nature of the race there has thrust the actions of the state election board to center stage.","summary":"The board recently passed new rules aimed at altering the process for certifying elections.

But what if third-party and independent candidates played a spoiler role? Robert F. Kennedy Jr. mounted his own independent bid for the presidency this election cycle, as did celebrity scholar Cornel West. Both men fought battles to get on state ballots for the election, with mixed degrees of success — Arizona rejected West's efforts, while New York rebuffed several attempts by Kennedy. It's hard work: Kennedy finally dropped out of the race in late August and endorsed Donald Trump. There have been lots of attempts to disrupt the two-party system since Democrats and Republicans emerged as the main rivalry in the mid-19th century. None of them have lasted over the long term — or won a presidential election — but a few notable efforts have left their imprint on American politics and history.

Sign up American Independent Party The notorious segregationist George Wallace formed the American Independent Party in 1968 in order to run for president. (He had failed in his effort to win the Democratic Party nomination from President Lyndon Johnson four years earlier.) Curtis LeMay, the former Air Force general who urged President Kennedy to bomb Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, was his running mate. Wallace didn't think he could win the presidency outright — but he did think he could game the system and play kingmaker. PBS' American Experience described the strategy in its history of the 1968 campaign: Although Wallace campaigned \"as though he believed he were a viable candidate for president,\" the real goal was to sap enough votes from Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey, the Republican and Democratic nominees, to deny both men an electoral college victory, and thus throw the election to the House of Representatives. \"There, Wallace could demand that the other candidates support him on his issues before he would deliver the presidency,\" said PBS. Here's the crazy thing: it nearly worked. Wallace carried five states — Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia — and came close to Nixon in North Carolina and Tennessee. Nixon barely beat Humphrey in the national popular vote, eking out a 1% win, but claimed 301 electoral votes, which were more than needed to spoil Wallace's dream of spoiling his election. Wallace's consolation: He was the last third-party candidate to win electoral votes. He tried again in 1972 but was shot and paralyzed on the campaign trail. Reform Party Like the American Independent Party, the Reform Party started out as a vehicle for one man's outsized presidential ambitions. Ross Perot, the billionaire Texas businessman, had made a splashy, on-again, off-again run for president as an independent candidate in 1992 — and performed respectably, capturing nearly 19% of the popular vote. (Bill Clinton won that election, and many Republicans have long blamed Perot for spoiling George H.W. Bush's re-election in that campaign.) In 1995, he decided to make it formal, announcing the launch of the Reform Party, and predicting it would eventually replace either the Democratic Party or GOP. \"One of those two parties is going to disappear,\" Perot told an interviewer, \"one of those special interest parties is going to melt down.\" Unsurprisingly, Perot was the Reform Party's first nominee for president in 1996. But he didn't do as well as his first run — he earned just 8.4% of the popular vote. (For what it's worth, that was just about the margin of Clinton's victory over GOP nominee Bob Dole.) That was good enough that, under federal law, the Federal Election Commission in 2000 provided $12.6 million in matching funds to the party's 2000 nominee, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. But the Reform Party has never again made quite the impact it did during Perot's first runs for the presidency. Instead, its legacy might be best remembered for two things. In 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura won the Minnesota governorship under the Reform Party banner — albeit with 37% of the vote. And in 2000, another celebrity businessman in the tradition of Ross Perot made a brief, aborted run for the party's presidential nomination. You might have heard of him: His name was Donald Trump. Green Party No discussion of modern third parties is complete, of course, without the Green Party. It originally formed in the 1980s with an emphasis on environmental justice, but it really came to prominence in 2000 when consumer crusader Ralph Nader won the party's nomination and made a bid for lefty voters who had become disenchanted with the Democratic Party's \"third way\" neoliberalism under Bill Clinton. Nader won just 2.74% of the vote. That might not be worth mentioning — except, of course, that was the year George W. Bush lost the popular vote and won the electoral vote, barely. The race between Bush and Al Gore came down to Florida, which ended up infamously mired in a weeks-long haze of hanging chads amidst a recount of the votes to see who would win the state's electoral votes, and thus the presidency. Officially, Bush won the state by 537 votes, after a controversial Supreme Court ruling that stopped the recount. Nader received more than 97,000 votes in the state. And Democrats have blamed him ever since for costing the party the White House. \"Lots of factors can be blamed for such a paper-thin defeat,\" Bill Scher said for Real Clear Politics. But if Nader had \"chosen not to embark on an obviously quixotic campaign, Al Gore would have been elected president.\" Nader has always denied culpability for Gore's loss. \"The two-party tyranny is spoiled to the core,\" Nader wrote in 2016 for the Los Angeles Times. \"The least-worst choices are getting worse every four years.\" Forward and No Labels The 2024 election brought several new groups into the fray. In 2022, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and one-time presidential candidate Andrew Yang — who came to prominence as a Republican and Democrat, respectively — announced the formation of Forward, a centrist party designed to appeal to Americans frustrated with the country's two dominant political factions. \"Some call third parties 'spoilers,'\" the pair said in a Washington Post op-ed, \"but the system is already spoiled.\" There are skeptics. \"The Forward Party is making a dangerous miscalculation,\" Mary Anna Mancuso said for Politico. \"It is betting that what a party opposes is more important than what it stands for.\" The party didn't end up nominating a presidential candidate in 2024, but it is working on several state-level races. It is No Labels, though — a coalition of Republicans, Democrats and independents that was formed to fight partisanship — that has drawn the most attention and criticism. The group was seen by critics as a means of attracting centrist votes that might otherwise go to the Democratic ticket, and thus assisting Donald Trump's election efforts. In April, though, No Labels announced it would not nominate a presidential candidate. \"No Labels has always said we would only offer our ballot line to a ticket if we could identify candidates with a credible path to winning the White House,\" the group said in a statement. \"No such candidates emerged, so the responsible course of action is for us to stand down.\" Explore More Election In Depth 2024 Presidential Election World News Us News To continue reading this article...

Do San Franciscans really get 14 times the benefit from their city workers that residents of Cupertino receive? And it is even more astonishing to learn that an “Electric Crew Foreperson” received $852,000 in compensation in 2023. Silly me.

Since 1980 every Republican president increased the deficit (Reagan 94%, George H.W. Bush 67%, George W. Bush 1,204%, Donald Trump 317%). Democratic Presidents have done far better. Bill Clinton decreased the deficit by 150% and had a budget surplus by the time he left office. Barack Obama decreased the deficit by 53%. Biden decreased the deficit by 50% in his first full budget year. And these vastly different performances are not limited just to the budget deficit. By most other standard economic measures (unemployment, job growth, inflation, etc.), America has usually done better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents over the past 50 years.

I'm not being unreasonable.\" \"Come out, come out, wherever you are and talk to the press!\" he demanded. Harris has gone over five weeks without giving specifics to voters about her policy positions, holding formal news conferences or sitting for major interviews since becoming the Democrats' presidential nominee. Despite ignoring the press, the vice president's campaign has benefited from positive media coverage since President Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. One study from a conservative organization found that Harris had received 84% positive coverage on ABC, CBS, and NBC's evening newscasts since announcing her presidential bid. \"Outnumbered\" co-host Emily Compagno said that the media had \"absolutely operated\" as a surrogacy for the Biden-Harris administration and now the Harris campaign. HOW LONG WILL THE KAMALA HARRIS HONEYMOON IN THE POLLS AGAINST DONALD TRUMP LAST? The panel discussed a heated interview between ABC anchor Jonathan Karl and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Sunday as an example of the press working on Harris' behalf. Karl vigorously defended Harris after Cotton brought up her past commitment to abolish private health insurance as part of her presidential campaign in 2019. \"That's not her position now,\" Karl said in the back-and-forth with Cotton, insisting that Harris had moved to the middle on this policy. \"Is Jonathan Karl a Kamala Harris campaign surrogate?\" co-host Kayleigh McEnany reacted to the clip on \"Outnumbered.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Compagno gave other examples to argue that the press's coverage had benefited Harris. \"The whole point is that the media has absolutely operated as a surrogacy for Kamala Harris this entire time or the Biden-Harris administration. And now that apparently goes to policies,\" she said. Former President Trump also slammed the ABC interview as an example of media bias toward his campaign. \"When I watched this interview of Tom Cotton… and the round table after that, I said, the hostility is crazy,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. The GOP candidate said he was \"thinking about\" skipping the September 10 debate after his campaign said the Harris campaign was trying to change the previously agreed upon debate rules.

In a filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, the prosecutors argued that the judge, Aileen Cannon, erred last month when she handed down a bombshell ruling that dismissed the case on the grounds that Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought it, had been appointed to his job illegally. The ruling by Cannon, who was placed on the bench by Trump, stunned many legal experts for the way that it upended 25 years of Justice Department practice and flew in the face of previous court decisions about the appointments of special prosecutors reaching back to the Watergate era. Issued on the first day of the Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted his party’s presidential nomination, Cannon’s ruling also gave him a major legal victory at an auspicious political moment. Smith’s appellate brief today was merely the start of a legal battle that may end up at the Supreme Court and is likely to drag on until well after the election in November. Should Trump win the election, he would have the power to fire Smith and could order the Justice Department to drop the appeal. Should he lose, the appeals process will determine whether he can still go to trial on the charges. In their filing, Smith’s deputies told a three-judge panel of the appeals court that Cannon had committed an error when she ruled that no specific federal statute authorized the appointment of special counsels such as Smith or gave them the “prosecutorial power” that they have wielded for 25 years. The prosecutors pointed to four current statutes that they believe give the attorney general the authority to name special counsels. “The district court’s contrary view conflicts with an otherwise unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the attorney general has such authority,” the prosecutors wrote, “and it is at odds with widespread and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and across the government.” The classified documents case, which was being heard in U.S. District Court in Fort Pierce, Florida, before Cannon threw it out, had once seemed to be the most straightforward of the four criminal prosecutions Trump has faced in the past two years. He was charged in June of last year with illegally holding on to a trove of classified national security materials after leaving office and then obstructing government efforts to retrieve them along with two co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who worked for him at Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence in Florida. Since 1999, the appointment of special counsels has been governed by internal Justice Department regulations traditionally believed to have been based on at least four federal laws laying out the structure of the department and the powers of the attorney general. That practice was adopted after Congress permitted the Independent Counsel Act, a law that specifically authorized and governed a different type of independent prosecutor, to lapse after the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton. But Cannon rejected that tradition, ruling that none of the statutes governing the conduct of attorneys general actually gave them the authority to appoint special prosecutors such as Smith. She also found that Smith’s appointment was illegal because he had not been named by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Prosecutors with some measure of independence from the federal officials who appoint them have long been used to conduct sensitive political investigations. The practice reaches back to the days when Confederate leader Jefferson Davis was charged with seditious conspiracy after the Civil War, Smith’s deputies reminded the appeals court. The prosecutors claimed that Cannon had “erroneously disregarded this history as ‘spotty’ or ‘ad hoc’” and paid too much attention to the minor iterations in the rules that have governed independent prosecutors over the decades. Smith’s team also expressed concern that Cannon’s refusal to recognize the validity of the way in which he got his job could “call into question hundreds of appointments throughout the executive branch.” And that, they wrote, “could jeopardize the longstanding operation of the Justice Department.” Cannon based her decision to toss out the documents case on the appointments clause of the Constitution. The clause requires presidential nomination and Senate confirmation for all principal officers of the government but allows so-called “inferior officers” to be put in place by leaders of federal departments, including the attorney general, under the guidance of specific laws. Smith’s deputies told the appeals court that Cannon had made a mistake when she found that there were no laws that specifically authorized Attorney General Merrick Garland to name Smith to the post of special counsel in November 2022. Smith was given the job of investigating allegations that Trump had illegally held on to classified documents after leaving office and separate accusations that he had plotted to overturn the 2020 election. In seeking to persuade the appeals court, Smith’s team pointed primarily to a Supreme Court case, United States v. Nixon, which found that the attorney general had the statutory power to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. In her dismissal order, Cannon took the position that the Supreme Court’s finding about the Watergate special counsel was a “nonbinding” aspect of the ruling, which largely focused on the separate issue of whether President Richard Nixon had to comply with a subpoena in the broader inquiry. While the appellate brief by Smith’s team was chiefly designed to bring back the criminal charges against Trump, it also looked beyond the classified documents case to the long-term health of the Justice Department. Prosecutors worried that there could be devastating consequences to the department if Cannon’s findings were left unchallenged. “If the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers,” they wrote, “that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office, other than the few that are specifically identified in statute.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"Federal prosecutors began their bid to resurrect the moribund classified documents case against former President Donald Trump today, telling an appeals court in Atlanta that the trial judge had improperly thrown out the charges.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/26/breaking-news/prosecutors-appeal-dismissal-of-trump-documents-case/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_20240826_jsm01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-26 23:00:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":254981792,"title":"How To Make AI Your Secret Weapon For Achieving Your Fitness Goals","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin AI and wearables are providing a more holistic view of a person’s health and wellness. getty People who are interested in their personal fitness continually look for ways to improve in all areas that impact their wellness – from better nutrition, better sleep, practicing mindfulness and meditation, to improved insights on their overall health. It comes as little surprise then that the fitness and wellness industry is a massive global market, with AI not surprisingly aiming to make a similarly big impact. According to a study from McKinsey the global wellness market is estimated to be at more than $1.5 trillion, with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. Technology has long played a role in the fitness industry. However, existing non-cognitive technology approaches such as basic calorie trackers or step counters can only provide so much personalized insights. With the help of AI people can now get the personalized insights they seek to improve the results of their fitness and wellness efforts. From AI-powered fitness apps that provide customized workouts, to wearable devices that monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep to provide personalized recommendations, AI is enhancing the way people approach health and wellness. The use of AI for fitness and wellness is enhancing existing technology and providing new applications for health to provide data-driven insights like never before. Wearable devices allow additional monitoring Wearable technology is becoming an integral part of people’s modern fitness and wellness journeys. It’s not uncommon to see people regularly wear smartwatches, necklaces, rings, and other wearable devices that capture a variety of data on their personal health throughout the day. Now, with the help of AI, the data gathered from these devices is even more valuable. Wearables help provide a more holistic view of a person’s health. AI-enabled wearables provide real-time stats throughout the day including how active they are, track their heart rate, calories burned, and even sleep data. This real-time feedback helps better understand their overall health and allows users to actively track their health journey over time. For example, smartwatches such as the Apple watch use AI to provide highly personalized health insights, track fitness activities, and monitor heart rate. The Oura ring is a smart ring that uses AI to track sleep and daily activity. The ring analyzes patterns of the wearer over time to provide personalized health insights and recommendations to help improve sleep and overall health.

For example, a wearable device might detect that a user’s running form is deteriorating as they increase their mileage and prompt the runner to adjust their posture or slow down to avoid injury. AI-powered wearables can now play a crucial role in helping users achieve their fitness goals by offering precise and actionable feedback. Personalized Programs to stay on track While no one has the same exact fitness goals, traditional training programs are general enough such that they appeal to a broad range of people. In the past, providing personalized training plans was both time consuming and potentially cost prohibitive. Now, AI is assisting in delivering customized experiences to users. AI-driven fitness apps are creating tailored workout plans based on an individual’s data such as age, fitness level, goals, and even daily activity patterns. Digital fitness app Aaptiv leverages AI to deliver personalized fitness routines. It takes into account the person’s workout preferences, fitness goals, as well as their current fitness level and adapts the plan over time. This data-driven approach to fitness helps users both gain insights into their health while also doing workouts they enjoy. MyFitnessPal, a popular calorie tracker app, is using AI to help people stay on track with nutrition goals. Tracking calories can be a very helpful practice to keep someone on track with their nutrition goals, however it can also be time consuming and difficult to do when you don’t always have access to nutrition information such as when eating out at a restaurant or enjoying a home cooked meal at a friend’s house. With the help of AI and computer vision technology, a user is now able to take a picture of their meal and the app recognizes foods in the image to suggest verified foods from their database to help user’s accurately track meals and stay on track with their nutrition and diet. Meditation and mindfulness has grown in popularity in recent years as a way for people to pause, focus on their breath, and regroup in a world where people are always on the go. There are a number of apps that have emerged to help guide users in their mindfulness journey and assist them in meditations. Headspace, a popular mindfulness and meditation app, is using AI to analyze a user's past sessions in the app, personal preferences, and behavior and then recommend content such as different meditation sessions, mindfulness exercises, or sleep content that align to the individual’s current needs. The app also uses AI to adapt to user feedback. It’s able to adjust the difficulty or focus of meditation sessions based on how users rate their experiences and help adjust mindfulness goals accordingly. AI is making significant strides in the fitness industry providing personalized training programs, enhancing wearable technology, and helping people better track their diets and sleep. These innovations are not only making fitness more accessible and effective but AI can be your secret weapon to help you achieve fitness and wellness goals. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The shooter, identified by the FBI as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crook, was shot and killed by the Secret Service. A rally attendee, 50-year-old former firefighter Corey Comperatore, was killed during the incident.Federal law enforcement, such as the Secret Service, has faced new scrutiny following the shooting, which has been investigated as an assassination attempt against the former president. Congress has set up a committee to investigate the shooting.On Monday, a group of Trump-aligned conservative lawmakers, separate from the official committee set up by House Speaker Mike Johnson, held a forum into the shooting featuring testimony from Bongino, a former agent who is now a conservative radio personality.During his testimony, Bongino said a \"direct source\" told him about the denial of the request from Trump's team.Newsweek was unable to verify this claim, and it remained publicly unclear who the \"direct source\" was.

Before the convention, Walz had a 39 percent favorability rating, according to Morning Consult's polling.The four-day-long convention did not give Vice President Kamala Harris a polling boost among national voters, however. Morning Consult's polling found that the Democrats' presidential nominee still leads Donald Trump by 4 percentage points, which is the same lead she held according to polling a week before the convention.In Morning Consult's latest polling, which includes the responses of 7,818 registered voters surveyed between August 23 and 25, Harris is leading the Republican nominee 48 percent to 44 percent. The survey has a margin of error of 1 percent.Morning Consult said in its report on the presidential election, which was released Monday, that Harris has not trailed Trump in a \"daily tracking survey\" since the company began tracking head-to-head matchups between the two candidates in late July, when she entered the 2024 race.Newsweek reached out to both Harris and Trump's campaigns via email Monday for comment.Harris formally accepted her party's presidential nomination last Thursday, following a week of speeches from Democratic leaders and delegates who emphasized a message of \"freedom\" and hope. Harris contrasted her positions and policies with Trump's on multiple occasions throughout her nomination acceptance speech and called on voters to \"fight\" for democracy and \"the ideals we cherish.\"Other polling has shown that the vice president received a boost among voters nationwide after last week's convention.

The You're Beautiful singer rocked a blue floral short sleeved shirt as he beamed for a snap with Noel during a holiday. James joked: 'IT’S ON - The reunion the world has been waiting for…' James and Noel have known each other for years and back in 2006, the Don’t Look Back In Anger singer lashed out at him when he was planning to buy a house in Ibiza next to him. At the time, Noel announced he would be selling his holiday home as he didn't want to stay next door to James knowing he would be making 'terrible music'. However, James claims to have had the last laugh as he claims property prices increased once Noel left the area. James Blunt has shared a photo with pal Noel Gallagher on Instagram on Monday ahead of Oasis' highly-anticipated reunion announcement James said: 'IT’S ON - The reunion the world has been waiting for…' Speaking on the Where There’s A Will There’s A Wake podcast, James said: 'I do actually bump into Noel at various places and he only says these things behind your back. To your face he’s a coward. He said he couldn’t have me writing my s****y songs just down the road from him.' It comes hours after Noel broke his silence on the Oasis reunion as he shared a cryptic clip to X - formerly known as Twitter - on Sunday. The singer, 57, suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday 27, at 8:00am as he shared a short clip featuring the style of Oasis logo. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. Noel did not share a caption along with the post but fans were left hoping he will reunite with brother Liam. They wrote: 'This has potential to be the best week of all time; OMG its happening; Already in the queue for tickets!' It comes as Liam dedicated the Oasis track Half The World Away to his estranged brother Noel during his headline set at the Reading Festival on Sunday evening - after burying the hatchet during a late night phone call. Earlier in the day, the Mancunian rocker fuelled speculation he might reunite with Noel for a long-awaited Oasis comeback, despite their well documented estrangement.

During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday, Liam, 51, performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' Read More How late-night phone calls ended Oasis feud - as Liam praises Noel on stage and £50m reunion 'is ON' Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam also suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am as he shared the same short clip as Noel. A source told The Sun: 'Noel and Liam are never going to be the best of friends but they want to bring Oasis back for the fans. 'They aren’t getting any younger and the demand is huge. They decided it was now or never. Noel dug his heels in for a long time but has finally caved and agreed to return. 'He spoke to Liam on the phone and they are on the same page. They know this reunion will go down in music history.' Professor Jonathan Shalit OBE, chairman of talent agency InterTalent, told The Sun they could make more than £400million from the tour and any residual deals. He said: 'With tickets, sponsorship, merchandise and filming, I would predict an income for Noel and Liam of over £50million each. This is a tour that could easily gross over £400million.'

The eye-watering sum is said to have convinced warring brothers Noel and Liam to bury the hatchet 15 years after they last appeared on stage together. Their fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the band. In recent years, Liam has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform the iconic Britpop band, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. But after Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country. Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front'. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour, with Liam appearing to confirm the reunion It comes as Liam sent Oasis fans into frenzy, as he appeared to confirm the Don't Look Back In Anger singers would next year tour the country Asked on X, formerly Twitter, about the planned Oasis shows, Liam wrote: 'See you down the front' He later told his 3.6m followers on the platform: 'I never did like that word FORMER'. Despite the thawing in their relations, the younger Gallagher couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up'. Fans have speculated Liam could confirm the reunion whilst on stage for his solo headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday night. An account for the Oasis Podcast posted on X: 'Liam I’m off to see you in Reading can you dedicate Columbia to the oasis podcast it’s my favourite song'whilst another wrote: 'waiting for liam to bring noel out at reading and announce a oasis reunion.' Liam has been touring the UK this summer on his Definitely Maybe tour to celebrate the 30 years since its release in 1994. Noel has been notably absent from the concerts, but during a show in Cardiff Liam made a point of dedicating Half The World Away to his 'little brother', saying he is 'still playing hard to get'. Liam also played a host of Oasis hits during his headline performance at Reading's sister site Leeds Festival on Friday night The tweets came after reports that the warring brothers have finally put aside their differences with 2025 gigs lined up at Glastonbury, Heaton Park in Manchester, and a 10-day run at Wembley Stadium. After Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together Read More Fans go wild as Oasis look set to take over summer 2025 with comeback gigs The tour is expected to take in dates in the UK at the Glastonbury festival and stadiums including Wembley, Twickenham and the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, as well as a run of dates at Liam and Noel Gallagher's beloved Etihad Stadium, home to Manchester City football club. It is understood that two huge promoters - SJM Concerts and Live Nation - are in the running to land the tour, which would include dates across Europe and in America. As the Mail on Sunday revealed, Glastonbury have informed the band that a headline slot at next summer's festival has been 'left open' for Oasis in the increasingly likely event the band confirm a reunion. A music industry source said that a possible ten nights at Wembley Stadium next summer, surpassing the eight-gig record recently set by Taylor Swift, would be a 'tough ask' at this stage of the year with bookings at the iconic London venue already at a near maximum. 'There will be a run of dates at Wembley if the Oasis tour goes ahead, but it's a bit late to confirm a run of 10 dates now,' said a music industry source. 'Instead the tour is likely to take in other big stadiums in London, and in Manchester. Heaton Park is another possibility up there, as is a repeat of Liam Gallagher's more recent gigs at Knebworth.' 10 gigs at Wembley in 2025 would break Taylor Swift's recent record at the venue. The Cruel Summer songstress, 34, played eight shows at the north London venue to delighted crowds in June and August - making her the first solo artist to play the stadium that many times. She told the screaming audience: 'You have made me the first solo artist to play Wembley eight times on a single tour!' On Thursday, a video was released to mark the 30th anniversary of Definitely Maybe, Oasis's debut album. Despite the thawing in their relations, Liam couldn't resist a dig at his brother. When asked what he would say to Noel when they return to the stage, he said: 'Keep up' Liam and Noel Gallagher, Andy Bell and Gem Archer pictured together in February 2006 at the Bangkok 100 Rock Festival Fans have speculated Liam could confirm the reunion whilst on stage for his solo headline set at Reading Festival on Sunday night. Read More Inside Liam and Noel Gallagher's tumultuous sibling rivalry amid rumours Oasis are set for comeback In the video, Noel - who previously said 'I liked my Mum until she gave birth to Liam' - was unusually complimentary about his little brother. He said: 'When I would sing a song, it would sound good. When he sung it, it sounded great.' Noel added: 'I can't sing Cigarettes & Alcohol, Rock'n'Roll Star and all that. I don't have the same attitude as him.' 'My voice is half a Guinness on a Tuesday — it's all right. Liam's is ten shots of tequila on a Friday.' Fans were also surprised to hear Noel pay Liam a string of compliments. Reflecting on Liam's performance on a number of their hits, Noel said: 'It's the delivery or the tone of his voice and the attitude. 'I don't have the same attitude as him.' Next Wednesday will mark 15 years since Noel sensationally quit Oasis 'with great relief' following a backstage bust-up in Paris saying: 'I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.' The Paris bust up included a barrage of insults being traded and a guitar being 'wielded like an axe', to end a 15-year career which saw its fair share of Rock and roll antics from both siblings. Last year, Noel joked in an interview on Radio X that he would 'properly consider' getting Oasis back together if he was given £8 million. Asked whether it annoys him when people ask about a reunion, he said: 'It used to really annoy me when I first started and now it's just, it's just whatever... The band's break-up came after a backstage bust-up in Paris, including a barrage of insults being traded and a guitar being 'wielded like an axe' (The Gallaghers pictured in 2003) Fans couldn't be happier as they penned on X: 'Oasis reunion will be up there with the birth of my child' Read More EXCLUSIVE Oasis are set for a £50million payday amid Noel's £20million divorce 'I'm fascinated with people asking the same question and getting the same answer, but the thing that is ongoing and will never get old is how the music just keeps appealing to another generation of fans.' Formed in the 1990s, the Britpop group rose to fame with hits like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Stop Crying Your Heart Out. They went on to become arguably one of the biggest bands in British music history before their break-up in 2009. The brothers went on to have successful solo careers, with Noel fronting the group Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Fans said of the possible reunion on social media: 'Felt it's always been on the cards since Noel's divorce. I haven't been Glastonbury for two years (thanks Rowan) so go make a return when Oasis play it could be up there with Macca for me. Others said: 'Oasis reunion will be up there with the birth of my child.', 'I am very sceptical about the Oasis reunion rumours but something seems different this time. To see them live together in my lifetime would be amazing. Please...', 'Oasis Reunion announcement? @liamgallagher Come on; Oasis reunion is a done deal I'm hearing yus; Oasis reunion making a particular kind of white dude (me) make incredibly irresponsible financial decisions.'

One, she’s not a very strong candidate, not a good extemporaneous speaker. Why showcase her weakness? And two, staying away from the traditional venue for communication and scrutiny — that is, interactions with the press — has allowed Harris aides to float the idea that she has changed positions and moved to the center from her failed run for the Democratic nomination in 2019, when she was solidly in the progressive lane of the party. By using aides to float her new positions, she can put out words without putting her own face on them, leaving the impression that she has changed views without actually saying so. On Aug. 8, Harris was asked when she would do an interview. “I want us to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month,” she answered. Her answer had an odd feeling to it, as if she had deigned to take a few questions but not anytime soon. The campaign has not given any further information about the interview, although there aren’t that many days left in the month. Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue! You would think the press would be up in arms about this. Instead, many journalists have accepted Harris’s gambit at face value. News programs are filled with speculation about The Interview: When will it be? Who will Harris choose to do it? What will she say? On some news outlets, the conversation is more about a single, unannounced interview than it is about news conferences, multiple interviews, and daily access — what should be happening in a normal campaign. On the other part of Harris’s strategy, the obfuscation of policy, Harris has succeeded spectacularly. There is now a media consensus that Harris has moderated some of her most left-leaning positions of the past, even though Harris herself has not announced any specific change. It has all been done by anonymous aides. Does that carry the weight of a statement from the candidate herself? Of course it doesn’t. If Harris has really changed her views rather than send up a trial balloon via a campaign aide, she should tell the voters herself. An example of how this works took place on ABC’s This Week. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) told the moderator, ABC’s Jonathan Karl, that in the coming campaign, former President Donald Trump is “going to draw a sharp contrast with Kamala Harris, who has supported things like decriminalizing illegal immigration or giving taxpayer-funded health insurance to illegal aliens or taking away health insurance on the job for 170 million Americans, banning gas cars, confiscating firearms. These are all—” Karl interrupted, “What do you mean taking away health insurance? What are you talking about?” Cotton responded that Harris “said when she ran for president that she wants to eliminate private health insurance on the job of 170 million Americans.” Karl said, “I mean, that is not her position now.” “How do you know that’s not her position?” Cotton asked. “How do you know that’s not her position?” Karl answered that Harris has “said she no longer supports ‘Medicare for All.'” “She has not said that,” Cotton responded. “She has not said that. She has not said that. Maybe anonymous aides on a Friday night have said that.” Indeed, look at this article from Politico last week: “Harris co-sponsored Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation when she was a California senator and offered a modified plan as the centerpiece of her short-lived 2020 presidential bid. But a campaign official told Politico it is no longer part of Harris’s agenda.” That’s how it works. Harris purportedly backs down, by proxy, from her old position, and the press accept it. When Cotton noted that Harris had not said herself that she no longer supports Medicare for All, Karl responded that Harris is “clearly making an effort to move to the middle.” Karl appeared to credit Harris with moving toward the middle when Harris herself had said nothing to indicate that she was, in fact, moving toward the middle. Two weeks ago, in an appearance with Fox News’s Bret Baier, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley had some advice for Republicans. “Quit complaining that she’s [Harris] not giving an interview,” Haley said. “You don’t need an interview from Kamala Harris. I take her at her word.” Indeed, there is an extensive record, much of it on video, of Harris making her views clear on issues like taxes, healthcare, immigration, energy, and others. Since she has never renounced or changed those statements, don’t they remain her views, at least until she says otherwise?

Software development is crucial to the functionality of modern technology. It underpins the operation of everyday devices such as smartphones, smart home systems, household appliances, and digital communication tools. Not to mention, our near daily use of Uber, WhatsApp, Instagram, Netflix, and Spotify. Without software developers, these technologies would not exist or function and our daily conveniences go away. While discussions about AI's impact often focuses on functions and industries like sales, marketing, R&D, Media and Entertainment, its effect on the technology industry, more specifically the field of software development is immediate and significant. Andy Jassy shared in a LinkedIn post on Thursday that Amazon Q has been integrated into the company’s internal systems to streamline foundational software updates. According to Andy Jassy, Amazon’s CEO, their AI Assistant Amazon Q, has saved the company $260 million and 4,500 developer years (yes years). One may ask how this is possible? By drastically cutting down on software upgrade times for all businesses who use and run on Amazon. Andy Jassy stated “It’s been a game changer for us.” As an example, the average app upgrade to Java 17 used to take 50 development days, now it takes just a few hours. While many of us will never have to worry about building an app or upgrading a system, this is the daily life of a software developer and engineer. Their work requires precision code accuracy, manual and systematic checks, and meticulous planning. Andy Jassy further explains, the AI assistant's contribution extends far beyond financial savings for the company; it's revolutionizing the way teams collaborate and execute projects at Amazon. By providing a common knowledge base and standardized best practices, the AI assistant Amazon Q, is helping bridge gaps between teams and departments.
