What About This Time?","text":"“I am a true neutral.” Matthew Johnson, a short, energetic Texan, was talking politics as he showed off his spread on the south end of Bagley, Wisc., about a thousand feet from the Mississippi River. There was Abby, the miniature horse from the same sure-footed breed that once worked in the nearby lead mines; his father’s old gravestone protected by a working replica of an early 19th-century signal cannon; and, in a wooden crate, the traditional blacksmithing forge he built. Johnson breaks it out at fairs to reenact life on the American frontier. Politics, Johnson said, leads to division. People in Bagley try to avoid the subject. “We’ve got ultra-conservatives, ultra-liberals, and everybody knows that this is not the place to start your crap,” he told The Epoch Times. Behind him, a freight train screamed on its way through town. Two hundred sixty miles north of Bagley in the state’s Northwoods vacationland, Sawyer County also flipped in 2016. Voter turnout rose that year too. Once a presidential bellwether, Sawyer broke that streak in 2020 when it stuck with Trump. Jim Miller, a local Republican and Fourth Ward alderperson in Hayward, theorized that Sawyer’s Republican turn was “part of a national trend where rural counties have become more red and the large metro areas have become more blue.” “I think Wisconsin and the Midwest have gotten left behind,” Eric Wilson, who was a candidate in the Third District’s Democratic primary, told The Epoch Times when asked why the area trended GOP-ward. Joan Cervenka, treasurer of the Sawyer County & Lac Courte Oreilles Democrats, wasn’t about to write off her home. She told The Epoch Times that her party has stepped up its presence, participating in parades and, in her words, doing more to “[let] the community know we’re here.” The Democrats have a highly visible office in downtown Hayward. Local Republicans don’t. “We’re focusing our efforts on giving money directly to candidates, rather than just having a spot for people to get yard signs,” Miller said of the absence of a physical GOP headquarters. The Epoch Times traveled across Grant County, Sawyer County, and other parts of western Wisconsin to see just how competitive the region might be. It’s part of the invisible middle, afloat and sometimes thriving but hit hard by price increases and globalization. Much of the Midwest looks domesticated; the hills, if there are any, roll gently to the horizon, often under a layer of corn, wheat, or soybeans. But in the Driftless, so-called because of the lack of glacial drift, there’s terrain—rocky bluffs, tall trees, and cold-water streams wending their way to the Mississippi, America’s aorta. On Aug. 10, all-terrain and utility task vehicles (ATVs and UTVs), a common sight throughout the region, crested the hill above the Bagley Cemetery. Harley-Davidson motorcycles were ubiquitous. The company headquarters is in Wisconsin’s largest city—Milwaukee. Near Matthew Johnson’s property in Bagley, the Second Annual Ribfest had just ended. People were still drinking beer and listening to music on speakers. Carrie, who works at a Mobil station in Livingston, said she thinks the region is pretty evenly split, though perhaps more conservative in and around Bagley. “Older people, older community,” she mused. “People come here to unwind [and] get away from politics,” Bruce Allen told The Epoch Times. Allen, who manages a collision repair center, believes the area leans Republican—and he doesn’t think Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s place on the ticket will help Vice President Kamala Harris much in western Wisconsin. Many, though not everyone, in the region expressed that same view of Walz. As did Eric Hovde, the GOP U.S. Senate candidate for the state. “I don’t think her choice of Gov. Walz has been helpful at all,” Hovde said at the Madison Club on Aug. 14. As far as campaign resources go, western Wisconsin could be a mixed bag for the GOP—and down-ballot weakness could complicate things for Trump. Outside La Crosse, a mid-sized city on the Mississippi, the region isn’t a major focus for the conservative Turning Point Action’s voter turnout initiative, Chase the Vote. In May, Matthew Martinez, Chase the Vote’s field director, told The Epoch Times that his conservative organization was focused on driving up GOP turnout in higher-density areas of Wisconsin, even ones that aren’t competitive for the party. Much of the purple west is too rural to warrant attention, he said. Third District incumbent Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), a freshman who represents much of the territory that flipped to Trump from Obama, has a multi-million-dollar fundraising lead over Democrat Rebecca Cooke. Aidan Leddick, a student at the nearby university, said the city didn’t feel more conservative than his home, the liberal-leaning Twin Cities. The Minneapolis-St. Paul metroplex sprawls on the other side of the Minnesota state line from northwestern Wisconsin. The vibe was different in little Gratiot, Wisconsin, the closest spot on the map to the Illinois line in Lafayette County. Lafayette’s population was 16,611 as of 2020, according to Census data. Gratiot counted 224 residents that year, down from past years. Early in the evening on Aug. 9, much of Gratiot had squeezed into Rocks Pour House, an old-fashioned inn between Bridge Street (Wisconsin Highway 11) and the Cheese Country Trail. Gratiot’s fire chief, J.R. Kingery, was sitting at the bar next to his sister. Kingery told The Epoch Times that Lafayette was Trump territory. But as recently as 2012, it went for the Democrat—Obama. Kingery didn’t recall offhand the GOP nominee that year (former Massachusetts Gov. and current Utah Sen. Mitt Romney). “Ah—that’s why,” he said. Romney-style “country club conservatism” didn’t seem like a good fit also for nearby Darlington, Wisconsin, a town of about 2,500 half-encircled by the Pecatonica River. Conservative and Republican signage dominated, though at least one house was adorned with a rainbow flag and other totems of 2024. In the distance was a low, constant roar: the Lafayette County Speedway was hosting its season championship. Stock cars flew around the curves, kicking clumps of dirt through chain-link fencing. Families filled bleachers at a safe distance from any flying muck. Teenagers socialized under the stands. Cars filled the open fields nearby, but few bore political bumper stickers. Political signage was likewise hard to spot on the route from Darlington to Platteville, home to a branch of the University of Wisconsin, and the biggest thing around save Dubuque, Iowa, on the other side of the Mississippi. Two Amish men trudged along a busy state highway. Farther west, Kuhls Farm advertised its founding date—1864—on the side of a barn. “Everybody’s related one manner to the other,” Johnson said of people in nearby Bagley. At a half-empty bar in Platteville, bikers in leather got into a shouting match, the specifics impossible to hear over the music, before storming out into the street. The college town went for Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. But it is located in Trump-flipped Grant County. “The big problem that we have right now is that we are just a two-party system, which divide[s] us down the middle,” Mary Matteson, a volunteer at the Grant County Republican Party office, told The Epoch Times late on the morning of Aug. 10. “Right now, my heart says the best man for the job is Donald J. Trump and JD Vance,” Matteson said. She says that she feels the Democratic Party is currently “full of radicals.” She and another volunteer, Derek Bartels, were handing out literature and reminding people to register to vote ahead of the state’s Aug. 13 primary. The county Democrats’ office, just down the street, was closed. Matteson and Bartels doubt Walz’s Upper Midwestern connection will help Harris in the area. Matteson cited the 2020 riots in Minneapolis as a source of concern for voters. Like others who spoke to The Epoch Times, Bartels said Trump’s business background helped him win over voters in purple western Wisconsin. Across the street, at the public library, a flyer advertised a drag queen story hour at a bookstore in Mineral Point. Meanwhile, the Mining and Rollo Jamison Museums—a tribute to the region’s zinc and lead mining heritage—were hosting Mine Day. On a small stage in an open field, women sang a Carter Family bluegrass standard in close harmony: “It makes me homesick to hear your name and hold you dear in my arms again. I’m-a-gonna ride that old lonesome train.…” Not far away, Forrest Rische was picking at his bass under a tent. “I’m 100 percent all-American to the bone,” he told The Epoch Times. He said he believes freedom is “done” for the country if Trump isn’t elected. Dr. David Miller, who had been chatting with Rische about the gold standard, showed The Epoch Times a photo of himself dressed as Kaiser Wilhelm II. He said he isn’t terribly interested in the upcoming presidential election. “I’m a monarchist. I believe in the divine right of kings,” Miller said. Trump signs were thick on the road to Bagley, though the most eye-catching messages were spray-painted on a clutch of buildings under a big limestone cut: “America,” “No More Nice Guy,” “Welcome to Deliverance, Did You Bring Your Banjos,” and “Stay Behind the Gun Line.” The same railroad that slices through Bagley splits Prairie du Chien in two. One bar, Frazier’s Old Faithful Inn, sits just a few feet from the tracks. It sells t-shirts emblazoned with an image of the train that, much to everyone’s delight, drowns out conversations. Home to a prison and a 3M plant, Prairie du Chien narrowly favored Biden in 2020 and Clinton in 2016. It’s the seat of Crawford County, another county that flipped to Trump eight years ago. The city is also Van Orden’s home base; like Bagley and Gratiot, it has leached population in recent years. On the evening of Aug. 10—a Saturday—the county Democrats’ Blackhawk Avenue office was closed. A few doors down, Unicycle Michael, the Driftless Personality, was preparing to perform at The Tavern. Bluegrass, he said, had dug a deep groove into the Mississippi Valley. His sound, though, is a little different. “I kind of describe my style as between James Brown and the Grateful Dead,” said Unicycle Michael—real name Michael Zernia. He said he thinks there’s a mix of political views in the area, but that The Tavern isn’t really the place to talk politics. “We have a space where we can all get along,” he told The Epoch Times. “It just makes us human to enjoy music.” Come November, Fitch and other county clerks across the state will be administering the closely watched presidential election. “We try to keep our poll books clean,” Fitch said of Sawyer County’s records. In Hayward, anti-fentanyl signage lined the roads. The signs showed a beautiful young face: Cassidy Joy Metropulos, a Hayward High School graduate who died of an overdose at just 21. “I think that there’s a lot of people that are either related to or know of somebody that has had a significant impact from drugs,” Joan Cervenka, the local Democrat, told The Epoch Times. Hayward is growing, and the economy isn’t so bad. Fitch said the summer had been a good one for tourism, in line with recent trends. “We live in a beautiful part of the state, so recreation is really big,” Miller said, before adding a caveat about the region’s attractiveness to older Americans. “I love Donald Trump,” she told The Epoch Times on Aug. 12. She and her partner, Marv Newlun, were sitting in that party building in Juneau County—another former bellwether that turned to Trump in 2016 and never went back. Newlun said he thinks Trump flipped the county from Obama “on his own.” The New Lisbon City Council member told The Epoch Times that, in 2016, Democrats in the area would come up to him and say they were voting for the businessman. Turkington, whose three children served in the military, told The Epoch Times that the former president’s anti-war message resonated with her. “That’s our sons!” she said. In 2020, Trump strengthened his performance in the growing county, winning about 65 percent of the vote. The enthusiasm was evident elsewhere in New Lisbon on Aug. 13. At a gas pump on the outskirts of town, Stan Benson’s UTV displayed a “Trump 2024” flag. “If they object to it, they object,” he said when asked how he’d respond to someone who took issue with his flag. While Juneau is clearly Trump country, Biden’s 2020 performance was a little stronger in Mauston than in New Lisbon. On the road into town, parallel to another old train line, pro-Trump houses dueled with those decked in more liberal signage. In the realm of symbols, at least, Mauston looked to be at war with itself. “Once Trump came into the picture, it felt like there was a lot of hate that was released,” Diane Dahl told The Epoch Times. A song from Bob Dylan’s “Blood on the Tracks” played in the background. She owns the building housing the Juneau County Democrats. Their office adjoins her art gallery, “Oh! Arts.” The Democratic primary voter said she was harassed by pro-Trump locals in various ways, including through the regular placement of dead animals on her doorstep. She worries there could be “some kind of weird backlash” if Trump loses in November. “We can hope,” Dahl said when asked if she thinks the county could flip back to the Democrats. She said the replacement of Biden by Harris raised interest in the local party. Michele Baumel, a Republican and the owner of the Reel Inn restaurant and campground in nearby Necedah, Wisconsin, said she runs into many pro-Trump Americans who don’t bother to vote. “‘My vote doesn’t count,’ that’s what they say,” she said. “There were a lot more union jobs around here,” said her partner, Dennis Gerke, when asked why Juneau used to go for Democrats. He’s a Trump voter from a family of traditional union Democrats in Janesville, Wisconsin. “I know a lot of people who’ve changed from Democrat to Republican since 2020,” Gerke added, suggesting that this included many military and union families. The two didn’t know of anyone who went the other way. As recently as 2016, he liked what he heard from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)—“other than his socialist bullcrap.” During an Aug. 14 press conference, Eric Hovde predicted to The Epoch Times that the Trump campaign would step up its rallies in Wisconsin as his Democrat rivals intensify their campaigning in the state. Harris held a rally in Milwaukee on the second day of the Democratic National Convention, the latest of her large-scale Wisconsin campaign events. Trump, meanwhile, hosts a town hall in La Crosse, the heart of Van Orden’s district, on Aug. 29. The moderator: ex-Democrat former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. As Trump seeks to draw in independents and disaffected Democrats, deep purple, motorcycle- and ATV-loving western Wisconsin is worth watching.","summary":"Between the bluffs and the river, a divided land of American character—and characters.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/trump-flipped-these-western-wisconsin-counties-what-about-this-time-5714125","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/29/id5715327-Wisconsin-Counties-4-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-30 00:09:57","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":255232200,"title":"Nancy Mace: I Support Trump Because He Protects Rape Victims Like Me","text":"Rep.

Tim Walz, in their first major television interview of their presidential campaign. The interview with CNN’s Dana Bash gives Harris a chance to quell criticism that she has eschewed uncontrolled environments, while also giving her a fresh platform to define her campaign and test her political mettle ahead of an upcoming debate with former President Donald Trump set for Sept. 10. But it also carries risk as her team tries to build on momentum from the ticket shakeup following Joe Biden’s exit and last week’s Democratic National Convention. The full CNN interview is set to air at 9 p.m. EDT. It was taped at 1:45 p.m. at Kim’s Cafe, a local Black-owned restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, and excerpts were released Thursday afternoon. Harris was asked about changes in her policies over the years, specifically her reversals on fracking and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. “I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed,” Harris replied. Harris also brushed off Trump’s questioning of her racial identity after the former president said she “happened to turn Black.” Harris, who is of Black and South Asian heritage, said it was the “same old, tired playbook.” She also said she’d name a Republican to serve in her Cabinet if she were elected, though she didn’t have a name in mind. Joint interviews during an election year are a fixture in politics; Biden and Harris, Trump and Mike Pence, Barack Obama and Biden – all did them at a similar point in the race. The difference is those other candidates had all done solo interviews, too. Harris hasn’t yet done an in-depth interview since she became her party’s standard bearer five weeks ago, though she did sit for several while she was still Biden’s running mate. Harris and Walz are still introducing themselves to voters, unlike Trump and Biden, of whom people had near-universal awareness and opinion. They were in the midst of a two-day bus tour through southeast Georgia that culminated with an evening rally in Savannah. Harris campaign officials believe that in order to win the state over Trump in November, she must make inroads in GOP strongholds across the state. Democrats’ enthusiasm about their vote in November has surged over the past few months, according to polling from Gallup. About 8 in 10 Democrats now say they are more enthusiastic than usual about voting, compared with 55% in March. This gives them an enthusiasm edge they did not have earlier this year. Republicans’ enthusiasm has increased by much less over the same period, and about two-thirds of Republicans now say they are more enthusiastic than usual about voting. But at a packed arena on Thursday, Harris cast her nascent campaign as the underdog and encouraged the crowd to work hard to elect her in November. “We’re here to speak truth and one of the things that we know is that this is going to be a tight race to the end,” she said. Harris went through a list of Democratic concerns: that Trump will further restrict women’s rights after he appointed three judges to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn Roe, that he’d repeal the Affordable Care Act, and that given new immunity powers granted presidents by the U.S. Supreme Court, “imagine Donald Trump with no guard rails.” Her rally was briefly disrupted by demonstrators who were protesting the U.S. involvement in the Israel-Hamas war. During her time as vice president, Harris has done on-camera and print interviews with The Associated Press and many other outlets, a much more frequent pace than the president — except for Biden’s late-stage media blitz following his disastrous debate performance that touched off the end of his campaign. Harris’ lack of media access over the past month has become one of Republicans’ key attack lines. The Trump campaign has kept a tally of the days she has gone by as a candidate without giving an interview and have suggested she needs a “babysitter” and that’s why Walz will be there. “Dana Bash of CNN has a chance at greatness today. If she gave a fair but tough interview of Comrade Kamala Harris, she will expose her as being totally inept and ill suited for the job of President, much as I exposed Crooked Joe Biden during our now famous Debate,” Trump posted online Thursday. “How cool would that be for Dana and CNN???” Trump has largely steered toward conservative media outlets when granting interviews, though he has held more open press conferences in recent weeks as he sought to reclaim the spotlight that Harris’ elevation had claimed. After the CNN interview, Walz peeled off for other political events out of state, and Harris continued in Georgia, stopping in at Dottie’s Market in Savannah on Thursday, chatting with the owner’s mom as crowds watched from the street where she told voters she’d be rolling out “basically a tax credit for startups, for small businesses who are starting out.” “This is one of my singular priorities is to invest and grow our small businesses,” she said. She met with volunteers too. On Wednesday, Harris and Walz spent time with a high school marching band to the delight of students, and stopped by a Savannah barbecue restaurant. The campaign wants the events to motivate voters in GOP-leaning areas who don’t traditionally see the candidates, and hopes that the engagements drive viral moments that cut through crowded media coverage to reach voters across the country. Harris has another campaign blitz on Labor Day with Biden in Detroit and Pittsburgh with the election rapidly approaching. The first mail ballots get sent to voters in just two weeks.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris said “my values have not changed,” as she was questioned along with her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

Trump made the claim at his rally in Pottersville, Michigan on Thursday afternoon. The announcement served as his first real volley at the Democrats in response to months’ worth of attacks from the White House and the Harris, formerly Biden, campaign. It was a bold campaign pledge from the Republican candidate that would require legislation through Congress to enact - and one that would likely face opposition from conservatives if attempted. Democrats have sought to link Trump to the extremes of the anti-abortion right, given his fondness for taking credit for the Supreme Court’s decision in overturning Roe vs Wade, which affirmed the constitutional right to abortion care. In the wake of Roe’s fall, there has been repeated attacks on fertility care by conservatives. Earlier this year, a decision by the highest court in Alabama briefly put IVF treatments on hold in that state. Anti-abortion groups that Trump has courted during his three presidential runs have long opposed the practice. But at his Michigan rally on Thursday, Trump said: “I am announcing today that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment.” “We want more babies!” he added at the event, which was billed as an address primarily about energy prices and manufacturing. The former president made the same pledge in an interview with NBC News, recorded moments before he took the stage in Pottersville. But he appeared unclear on whether he’d seek the federal government or insurance companies to cover the costs. “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” he told NBC News. “We’re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.” In that interview, he also criticized Florida’s six-week ban on abortion, a clear attack on rival-turned-ally Ron DeSantis, the state’s governor. “I think the six week [ban] is too short, there has to be more time,” Trump told NBC. While Trump continues to proclaim himself an ally of IVF, and says he opposes an effort to ban abortion at the federal level, his allies continuously undermine his message. Republican House member Matt Rosendale called IVF “morally wrong” in June, while Senator Lindsey Graham is trying to get a national abortion ban passed in the upper chamber of Congress. Project 2025, the blueprint drawn up by a number of conservative groups tied to former Trump officials, has also complicated the Republican candidate’s efforts to distance himself from the furthest extremes of the anti-abortion movement. The plan calls for the abolition of FDA approval for over-the-counter sales of Mifepristone, an abortion drug, as well as restrictions on sending Mifepristone through the mail. Project 2025 also calls for efforts to track women who cross state lines to seek abortion care if leaving states where it is illegal to do so. Trump’s new IVF policy suggestion is somewhat out of whack with the free market-oriented mindset which has governed Republicans in Washington when it comes to healthcare. Fiscal conservatives opposed efforts by the Obama administration to force healthcare companies to offer coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions, and under the first Trump administration sought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats argued at the time that Republicans were willing to throw millions off of their insurance plans by allowing companies to once again drop Americans with pre-existing conditions. Trump’s 2024 campaign has made little to no mention of seeking another repeal of Obamacare, and if passed into law, Trump’s IVF plan would further expand the breadth of coverage that health insurance companies would be required to support.","summary":"Longshot campaign promise is ex-president’s response to Democrats linking him to far-right conservatives who oppose all abortion care and IVF","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-ivf-insurance-abortion-b2604192.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/29/23/GettyImages-2168341493.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VT51YucE-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:55:20","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":255232964,"title":"Foreign minister calls US ambassador to Budapest ‘a leading figure’ of Hungarian opposition","text":"At a press conference after an informal European Union foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels, Peter Szijjarto said in response to a question concerning Pressman’s criticism of Hungary’s “peace mission” that the US ambassador was “an opposition activist and one of the leading figures of the Hungarian opposition”. “His statements must be assessed accordingly,” Szijjarto said, according to a ministry statement. “And if I want to talk about the contents of his opposition activist statements, then I could say that interestingly, when the Italian prime minister went to China, and said that China was an essential partner for dialogue in the current fragile international situation, then the opposition activist did not activate himself.” “Or when President Zelensky called Donald Trump, he did not express any condemnation, or when the Ukrainian foreign minister recently visited China, we could not hear any criticism from him,” he added. “So it is obvious that his statements came from and were inspired by his opposition position,” he said. Commenting on criticism voiced by his Lithuanian counterpart, Szijjarto said Gabrielius Landsbergis was “one of the most pro-war politicians” in Europe. “He is competing for the title of most pro-war politician; he regularly criticises Hungary’s pro-peace position. I believe his assessment of the situation cannot be considered realistic in any aspect,” he added. Szijjarto slams EU foreign policy chief’s ‘dangerous’ Middle East proposals Peter Szijjarto on Thursday criticised what he called “dangerous and unreasonable proposals” put forward by European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell concerning the situation in the Middle East. Speaking at a press conference after an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Szijjarto said Borrell “has seemingly lost control” and was putting forward proposals “that are extremely dangerous for Europe”. Szijjarto criticised a proposal for the EU to impose sanctions on two Israeli ministers. “It’s an extremely dangerous and absolutely unreasonable proposal, because such a decision would raise major question marks in the Middle East, and would completely undermine the cooperation between the European Union and Israel,” Szijjarto said, according to a ministry statement. He praised Israel for its agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) on the launch of a polio vaccination campaign in Gaza. “This step must be appreciated,” he said. “They wanted to adopt a joint position here today that would have criticised Israel in spite of this agreement, so we asked that it be amended.” Szijjarto also welcomed Israel’s commitment to guaranteeing religious freedom on the Temple Mount and in the country’s holy places. “Certain steps in the recent period have raised concern among certain Israeli politicians and certain Christian communities,” he said. “And in this respect I believe the Israeli foreign minister’s and prime minister’s public commitment to maintaining the freedom to practise religion is significant.” Meanwhile, Szijjarto said Thursday’s meeting was also attended by Turkiye’s foreign minister, noting that there had not been such a high-level meeting between the EU and Turkiye in the last five years. He underscored the importance of preserving the EU and Turkiye’s cooperation on migration, saying he had asked his Turkish counterpart “not to let themselves be talked out of keeping migration at bay just because they see an EU member state being made to pay tens and hundreds of thousands of forints for protecting its borders”. Szijjarto said he and his Turkish counterpart did not hold bilateral talks this time because they could “do so at any time” and will talk on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting next month. The minister said Turkiye was “indispensable” when it came to responding to the challenges before the EU, whether it be energy security or migration. On another subject, he said the deadly stabbing in Germany last weekend had demonstrated “just how dangerous and unreasonable the pressure Brussels is trying to put on Hungary is”. “We don’t want a Solingen in Hungary, we don’t want stabbings in Hungary, we don’t want illegal migrants in Hungary, so it’s simply shocking and outrageous that while the number of crimes committed and the number of people killed by illegal migrants in Europe is rising, the European Union is punishing us because we protect ourselves and our border and don’t allow illegal immigrants into the country,” he said.","summary":"You must be logged into the site to view this content.","url":"https://www.budapesttimes.hu/diplomacy/foreign-minister-calls-us-ambassador-to-budapest-a-leading-figure-of-hungarian-opposition/","image":"https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pressman.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:53:52","author":"Attila Leitner","authors":["Attila Leitner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"hu","sentiment":0.039},{"id":255232242,"title":"Trump says IVF costs would be covered if he is elected","text":"WASHINGTON >> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Thursday he will require the government or insurance companies to pay for IVF fertility treatments if he is elected in November, a move aimed at appealing to women and suburban voters. “Your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment fertilization for women,” the former president told supporters at a campaign event in Potterville, Mich. Trump also said his administration would push for allowing new parents to deduct “major newborn expenses” from their taxes. “We want more babies,” Trump said. Trump will face Democrat Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday showed Vice President Harris picking up support among women voters. Not all states currently require insurance companies to cover IVF, which involves combining eggs and sperm in a laboratory dish to create an embryo for couples having difficulty conceiving. Even with coverage, IVF is an expensive process that can cost thousands of dollars in drugs and medical procedures. IVF has emerged as a hot-button issue in this election, as Republicans nationwide have scrambled to contain backlash from a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, which ruled in February that embryos were children.

Kennedy Jr. from the ballot. The board called the last-minute meeting on Thursday to consider removing the We the People party, which nominated Kennedy as its pick for the presidential election. The meeting was heated, with the board split down party lines. Chairman Alan Hirsch, and members Jeff Carmon and Siobhan Millan, all Democrats, voted against striking Kennedy from the ballot, while Kevin Lewis and Stacy Eggers, both Republicans, voted to approve. “The statutory deadline of Sept. 6 can’t be ignored just because of the capricious behavior of one party’s candidate, one party, one person,” Millan said in the meeting. “I’m just going to be real blunt and say I think this whole episode has been a farce, and I feel bad for anyone who’s been deceived.” The decision follows a summer of controversy for the board, which included multiple lawsuits and a federal investigation. In early July, the We the People party was first denied access to the ballot, a decision that was later reversed on July 16. Kennedy announced his decision to suspend his presidential campaign on Aug. 23, less than 24 hours after the Democratic National Convention wrapped. In the press conference, he blamed “shadowy DNC operatives” for fighting his campaign’s access to the ballot at every turn in states across the country. It took until Wednesday for the We the People party to officially request that Kennedy be removed from their ticket in North Carolina. Democrats on the board cited the “impracticality” of reprinting ballots as a key factor in their decision; mail-in ballots are supposed to be sent out in the state starting Sept. 6 and many counties have begun printing. “The decision was made for us when the party didn’t remove him weeks ago,” Carmon said. The Sept. 6 deadline makes North Carolina one of the first states in the nation to send out its ballots. Republicans on the board pointed to a provision that allows ballots to be sent out later if they are not yet ready. Following the vote, Lewis addressed Chairman Hirsch with his concerns. “Next time you refer to flexibility in the statutes, let’s call it what it is and say it’s situational flexibility,” he said. Kennedy has asked that his supporters vote for former President Donald Trump even if his name remains on the ballot. It remains to be seen how much this will affect the race in North Carolina, where Kennedy has been polling at an average of 3.2%.","summary":"The North Carolina State Board of Elections narrowly voted against a request to remove Robert F.

On CNN last night, Thursday August 29, 2024, the presidential flag bearer for the Democratic Party, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor, Tim Walz were interviewed. For all of its worth, it’s not the same value as having the candidates engage in a face-to-face debate! Such as what ABC News has proposed for next month on September 10 in Philadelphia between VP Harris and impeached former President Donald Trump. Debates by candidates seeking to lead are very important. Except for some regressive situations and countries where certain candidates duck and hide from speaking to voters to address the issues that are important to their constituents. Millions of people around the world can relate to the importance of these debates. You will, for example, agree with me that the first debate in this 2024 campaign ignited the events that led to incumbent President Joe Biden’s forced departure from the race. Without a doubt, fairly and objectively moderated debates without muting of the instant reactions and responses, will be the optimal and proper way to reach the voters and viewers assessments. I do know from experience that one of the key tests and unrehearsed exposures about a future or current leader of any country, international organization, state or community happens when microphones are turned on! Essentially, the microphones and video cameras connect the unmediated transmitting and broadcasting of some of masked, carefully controlled, hidden dynamics of the behavior and attitudinal swings of men and women in leadership. According to Trump, he’s concerned that the ABC News debate forum has a “panel of Trump haters.” Brian Fallon, the Harris campaign’s senior adviser for communication has stated that for the ABC News debate and any other“we believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast.” For public interest clash of ideas between candidates on how to move the country forward, there should be an open dialogue. There should always be open/live/hot mics. This way, I believe that the composite profiles, the multiple negatives, rudeness versus politeness factors, geniality and mannerisms of a leader can be in stark animation. Hopefully, this will be an important case for seriousness and focus on the things that matter. The realities of the Trump versus Harris battle for who will become President must take cognizance of the economic challenges of inflation, conflicts, climatic disasters, health crises, deaths caused by cancer, rapid and dizzying changes in the global financial markets and social transformations around the world. The Middle East, Sahelian Africa, Nigeria, Cameroon, parts of Asia and Latin America have grown to become increasingly violent areas. The Ukraine and Russia war leaves Europe at a knife’s edge.

Nancy Mace (R-SC) argued on Thursday that her desire for a president who will protect survivors of rape is why she’s voting for Donald Trump, who last year was found by a jury to have raped E. Jean Carroll. Asked in a Fox News interview how she feels about “the whole gender thing” factoring into the election, Mace replied, “I’m voting for Donald Trump because I am a woman.” She went on to mock Kamala Harris for sitting down with CNN alongside her running mate, adding, “Nothing says ‘I’m a woman, hear me roar,’ like having your first national interview sit-down with a man by your side.” Mace, herself a sexual assault survivor, said that she wanted to vote for a candidate who would protect “women like me, who are survivors of rape,” as well as victims of incest and single mothers. She gave a cursory rundown of Trump’s policies she believed would do that—“lowering taxes for the middle class, expanding the child care tax credit, looking at the spending of the federal government”—before dragging the conversation back into culture-war territory. “I’m voting for Donald Trump because I want to be sure that biological men aren’t in the locker room showering next to my underage daughter,” she insisted. “I want to make sure men aren’t stealing women’s achievements in sports or academics or their scholarships, and that’s why, as a woman, I support Donald Trump.” Last May, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll, with a jury determining that he’d assaulted her in a Manhattan department store decades prior. The former president’s legal team immediately jumped on the fact that the jury hadn’t used the word “rape” in its decision. “This was a rape claim, this was a rape case all along, and the jury rejected that—made other findings,” attorney Joe Tacopina told reporters outside the courthouse. But a judge, in rejecting the Trump team’s motion for a new trial, said the terms “rape” and “sexual abuse” did not differ in any material, real-world way. “The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was ‘raped’ within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump ‘raped’ her as many people commonly understand the word ‘rape,’” Judge Lewis A. Kaplan wrote. “Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.” At least 25 other women have publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct, ranging from groping to rape, over the last five decades. Mace has nevertheless repeatedly gone to bat for the former president, including as his trial was playing out in New York. In a March appearance on ABC’s This Week, the congresswoman grew increasingly combative as host George Stephanopoulos asked how she could support Trump in light of the Carroll case. Mace accused Stephanopoulos of trying to “shame” her with the question. “I will tell you that I was raped at the age of 16, and any rape victim will tell you I’ve lived for 30 years with an incredible amount of shame,” she spat. “I didn’t come forward because of that judgment and shame that I felt, and it’s a shame that you will never feel, George, and I’m not going to sit here on your show and be asked a question meant to shame me about another potential rape victim. I’m not going to do that.”","summary":"Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesRep.

Quaid also said he “didn’t have any qualms” about playing the late president, despite the political division in the country, noting that — like Kelly — he’s voted both Democrat and Republican in the past and was currently registered as an independent. Quaid, whose films include “Frequency,” “Enemy Mine,” and “Traffic,” previously played Democratic president Bill Clinton in the 2010 TV movie “The Special Arrangement.” The film, which took place between 1997 and 2001, portrayed the rapport between Clinton and England’s Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was played by Michael Sheen. As for his current political stance, Quaid recently said of GOP candidate Donald Trump, “He’s an a–hole, but he’s my a–hole.” In May, before Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, he told Piers Morgan, “I think I’m going to vote for [Trump].” The former “Right Stuff” began hosting the reality series “Top Combat Pilot” on Fox Nation in 2023 and recently signed to play a serial killer in the Paramount+ series “Happy Face.” TheWrap’s reviewer summed up “Reagan,” which was directed by Sean McNamara, as “embarrassing” as well as “fawning and superficial.” It’s based on the 2006 biography “The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism” by Paul Kengor. “Reagan”opens in theaters on Friday.","summary":"The 40th president was \"kind of a fading actor\" before getting into politics, Quaid tells Megyn Kelly\n\n\nThe post Dennis Quaid Says He Relates to Ronald Reagan Because He Never Got to ‘Where He Wanted to Be’ as an Actor | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/dennis-quaid-ronald-reagan-megyn-kelly-interview/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dennis-quaid-megyn-kelly.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:44:32","author":"Sharon Knolle","authors":["Sharon Knolle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.308},{"id":255231790,"title":"Trump suggests he’ll vote to overturn Florida’s six-week abortion ban: ‘Too short’ ","text":"Former President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that he’ll vote in favor of a Florida ballot measure aimed at overturning the state’s six week abortion ban. “I think the six week is too short. It has to be more time,” Trump told NBC News when asked how he intends to vote on the November referendum. “I want more weeks.” “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,” the former president added. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the ban — which allows exceptions to save the mother’s life — into law in April of last year. Trump, at the time, called DeSantis’ decision to sign the bill into law a “terrible mistake.” The so-called “heartbeat” law, which derives its name from when an unborn baby’s heartbeat is detectable, went into effect in May. Amendment 4, which is among six ballot questions Florida voters will take up in November, would provide a state constitutional right to abortion before viability, effectively killing the heartbeat law. The measure will require a threshold of at least 60% support to succeed. Trump has presented himself as being sympathetic to abortion rights advocates since the launch of his 2024 campaign. He announced earlier this year that he would not support a national ban on the procedure. Last week, Trump touted on Truth Social that, if elected, his administration would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” The Republican nominee for president indicated Thursday that he was fairly satisfied with the state of play as it relates to abortion. “Look, just so you understand, everybody wanted Roe v. Wade terminated for years, 52 years. I got it done,” Trump said. “They wanted to go back to the states.” “Exceptions are very important for me, for Ronald Reagan, for others that have navigated this very, very interesting and difficult path.” A poll from the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab released last month showed 69% of Sunshine State residents indicating that they would vote yes on Amendment 4 – which far out-polled support for Vice President Kamala Harris in the state. However, a Florida Atlantic University/Mainstreet USA poll released earlier this month found only 56% of Floridians supporting the proposed amendment – 4 points less than necessary for the amendment to become law.","summary":"“I think the six week is too short.

Trump, who is registered to vote in Florida, told NBC News on Thursday that he wants “more weeks.” If Florida voters approve Amendment 4 on their ballots this fall, the state’s constitution would be amended to state that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” That amendment would effectively overturn the state’s ban on abortion at six weeks of pregnancy - before most people know they are pregnant. When asked by NBC News how he plans to vote on the amendment, Trump said that “the six week is too short” and “there has to be more time.” “I’ve told them I want more weeks,” he said. “I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.” The Republican presidential nominee has failed to present a cohesive platform for reproductive healthcare, and his conflicting statements over the last 25 years have drawn criticism from both abortion rights supporters and his anti-abortion allies. At one point in 2015, Trump had “five positions on abortion in three days,” according to The Washington Post, while Kamala Harris and his Democratic rivals have warned that another Trump administration with a Republican-controlled Congress could advance a national abortion ban. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v Wade, which had affirmed a constitutional right to abortion care. The Trump-aligned Project 2025 document, that is designed to inform his administration, also proposes the application of a long-dormant obscenity law to block abortion drugs from the market. The Supreme Court dismissed a right-wing legal challenge to the government’s approval of a widely-used abortion drug, and Trump has said that “generally speaking” he does not support banning drugs like mifepristone under the Comstock Act. “It’s going to be available and it is now,” he recently told CBS News. “And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now.” Last week, he claimed on his Truth Social account that his administration “will be great for women and their reproductive rights.” Florida is among more than a dozen states that have outlawed all or most abortions in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which Trump supports. Since earlier this year, Florida’s six-week ban makes it a felony to perform or actively participate in an abortion in the state after roughly six weeks’ gestation, or about two weeks after a missed period. Voters in at least 10 states will vote on abortion rights measures this November, including measures that could enshrine a right to seek abortion care in their states’ constitutions.","summary":"‘I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks,’ Trump says when asked about Ballot Amendment 4 in Florida","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-abortion-florida-desantis-b2604178.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/29/23/6ee89d9ce55c474d8d545a304c799a88.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VT51YucE-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:31:24","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":255231392,"title":"Letters: Old complaints | Fremont mayor | Lafayette Council | Trump’s desperation | Petty candidate","text":"Complaints about young is domain of the elderly Re: “Today’s university students are too soft” (Page A6, Aug. 28).

Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian protests outside the arena further highlighted the lingering divides between the Democratic establishment and its constituents. Vice President Kamala Harris’s promotion as the party’s nominee has slightly eased tensions, but her reluctance to fully endorse a ceasefire has kept discontent alive. Arab and Muslim Americans have been central to elevating the Gaza War to the forefront of national politics. Yet despite increased attention to their political influence since October 7, 2023, their ability to sway presidential elections is still uncertain. These communities are largely concentrated in major cities and relatively small in numbers, with limited overlap. Roughly three-quarters of the 3.7 million Arab Americans are Christian, while Arab Muslims form about 15 percent of the 4.5 million Muslims in the country. Illinois has the highest per capita Muslim population in the U.S., yet they make up less than 4 percent of the state. Michigan’s Arab population, per capita the largest in the country, forms just over 2 percent. Support for Palestine, however, unites the Arab and Muslim populations, alongside progressives. Their fervent and organized opposition to Biden’s stance on the Gaza conflict casts doubt on whether Harris and the Democrats can regain their support before the election, particularly in must-win swing states. Yet while the Palestinian issue has amplified the visibility of these voters, their political activism extends to cities and congressional districts across the country. Friction with Democrats over several issues has created openings for Republicans, so far with mixed results. The fluidity of Muslim and Arab voters has been apparent for decades. As the American Muslim population grew into a substantial voting bloc in the 1980s, for example, neither political party consistently secured their loyalty. President George W. Bush won the Muslim vote comfortably over Al Gore in the 2000 election, but the War on Terror, Patriot Act, and surveillance and harassment of American Muslim communities after 9/11 drove it to the Democrats. By the 2020 election, Arab and Muslim American dissatisfaction with Democrats reignited some competition over their votes, though it remained lopsided. While 64 percent of Muslim Americans voted for Biden, 35 percent supported Donald Trump, up from 2016, and largely similar to the Arab American vote. Polling in the aftermath of October 7 revealed declining approval for both men, with Biden hit harder. A Council on American-Islamic Relations poll showed Muslim voters preferred Biden to Trump by 37 percent to 27 percent, while Pew Research found support nearly tied at 36 percent to 35 percent. The Arab American Institute found Trump leading Biden 32 percent to 18 percent among Arab Americans. Frustrated with their presidential choices, Muslim and Arab American leaders launched an #AbandonBiden campaign in late 2023 to back third-party candidates, largely on the left, supporting an unconditional ceasefire. Additionally, a push within the Democratic Party’s base to vote “uncommitted” in Michigan’s February 2024 primary in turn garnered 100,000 votes, just over 50,000 shy of Biden’s 2020 margin of victory in the state. “Uncommitted” volunteers expanded their effort to other states, with Minnesota’s tally reaching 20 percent of the total. Overall, protest votes averaged 13 percent in the Democratic primaries—double the historical average. Eyeing an opportunity, Trump has attempted to capitalize on the backlash to Biden. Lebanese-born businessman Massad Boulos, whose son married Trump’s daughter, Tiffany, has led outreach to Arab American voters. He began working closely with Bishara Bahbah, a former associate director of the Middle East Policy Institute at Harvard Kennedy School, who launched the group Arab Americans for Trump. Distrust toward Trump remains high among Muslim communities, however, limiting outreach opportunities. Kamala Harris’s stance on Gaza has remained carefully balanced since she became the presumptive nominee. The vice president skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in July (citing a scheduling conflict), but later met with him privately during his visit. Harris then appointed her aide Nasrina Bargzie in August to help build support among Arab and Muslim voters. Still, despite enthusiasm for Harris, concerns linger among Democrats. Leaders of the “uncommitted” campaign met with Harris and her vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, in August 2024 for discussions. The organization claimed Harris expressed support for a ceasefire and an openness to discussing an arms embargo, though a Harris aide quickly clarified that the latter was not agreed upon while emphasizing the need for more dialogue. Days later, the #AbandonBiden campaign rebranded to #AbandonHarris, while the Muslim Women for Harris group disbanded and withdrew support for her after Palestinian speakers were denied a speaking slot at the DNC. Arab and Muslim Americans have limited representation in Congress to push the issue. The first Arab-American congressman took office in 1959, and only a handful are currently serving. Keith Ellison became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2007, representing Minnesota’s 5th District, followed by Andre Carson in 2008, who served Indiana’s 7th District. Ilhan Omar succeeded Ellison in 2019 and was decisively reelected in August 2024. She has maintained strong advocacy for Palestine, alongside fellow Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who is both a Muslim and Arab American. The focus on building momentum in congressional districts and in cities has nonetheless positioned Muslim and Arab American communities for greater influence, amplified through cooperation with progressive groups like the Jewish Voice for Peace. Several city councils, such as Akron, Ohio, began passing legislation calling for a ceasefire weeks into the Gaza War. In March 2024, the “Listen to Michigan” group helped organize a town hall in Cleveland for congressional candidates to speak with Arab and Muslim communities, including Matthew Diemer, now the Democratic nominee for Ohio’s 7th District. The intensified efforts of Arab and Muslim groups and politicians have undoubtedly brought greater visibility to Gaza, especially given the Democratic Party’s need to consolidate its electoral coalition. Arab and Muslim Americans have become a significant focus for Republicans and Democrats in swing states like Michigan and Ohio, and an ability to organize on more local levels across the country has granted them growing political weight. Because the concerns of Arab and Muslim Americans are often narrowly tied to the Israel-Palestine conflict, the broader issues affecting these communities tend to be overshadowed, particularly in larger multicultural states. However, in smaller states and communities, friction with Democrats over several issues had led Republicans to sense outreach opportunities for years. The GOP’s strategy has been to appeal to the opposition many Arab and Muslim American communities have toward certain progressive social issues. Muslim and Coptic Christian parents protested the inclusion of LGBT criteria in education in Jersey City in 2020. A similar scenario occurred in Maryland’s Montgomery County in 2023, where hundreds of parents, supported by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, protested against LGBT-inclusive education. County councilwoman Kristin Mink’s claim that parents were on the same side as “white supremacists and outright bigots,” which she later apologized for, reflected the tension between mainstream Democrats and more socially conservative sections of Arab and Muslim American communities. Michigan, with its significant Arab and Muslim populations, has become a major political battleground over LGBT rights. In the city of Dearborn, where these communities are concentrated and where “uncommitted” voters outnumbered votes for Biden by 56 percent to 40 percent, the clash has been particularly notable. In 2022, hundreds of conservative Muslims and Christians united in protest against the inclusion of LGBT content in schools, including prominent Michigan Republicans and Moms for Liberty, a conservative Christian organization. Dearborn, the first Arab-majority city in the U.S., is part of Rashida Tlaib’s 12th District, where her strong support for LGBT rights has prompted Republicans to capitalize on the issue and undermine her support. Former Republican congressional candidate Steven Elliott participated in Dearborn school board meetings with Muslim parents discussing LGBT education, while Matthew DePerno, GOP nominee for Michigan attorney general, stated, “I am proud to stand with the parents of Dearborn,” during his campaign. Hamtramck, Michigan, remains the only Muslim-majority city in the country. Progressives expressed enthusiasm when the city elected the first Muslim-majority council in the U.S. in 2015, and a Muslim mayor in 2022. But in 2023, after the council voted to exclude LGBT flags from city property, local Democratic groups and residents organized protests against the decision, which received support from Republicans. Additionally, cooperation between foreign Muslim organizations and domestic conservative Christian groups has become less taboo. In December 2022, Saudi Arabia’s International Islamic Fiqh Academy expressed solidarity with Family Watch International, a Christian right organization based in Arizona. Representatives from the Organization for Islamic Cooperation then delivered statements at Family Watch International’s annual global policy forum weeks later. While Arab and Muslim Americans may not be flocking to Republicans over their approach to Gaza, Democrats have so far failed to distinguish themselves from the GOP on the issue. A sense of political abandonment, intensified since the Gaza War, has led to more fluid political identities within these communities. Issues such as the erosion of traditional values, support for law enforcement, and others have emerged or reemerged as potential avenues for greater cooperation with Republicans. However, a lack of faith in the GOP’s ability to manage the various issues facing Muslim and Arab American communities means that votes for “uncommitted”, as well as growing disillusionment and abstaining from voting altogether, are becoming more common. Republican leaders will need to more effectively address Muslim and Arab Americans’ concerns about the party’s stance on Israel and Gaza, as well as reverse lingering discontent among traditional Republican voters toward Muslims, if they intend to appeal to these communities. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party faces an uphill battle in convincing these communities to come back into the fold, which will require taking a stronger stance against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Politicians like pro-Palestinian Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, along with her Muslim vice presidential pick Rudolph Ware, could also help improve the chances of third parties by rallying Muslim and Arab American support in the 2024 election and future campaigns. As Muslim and Arab American populations continue to grow and establish themselves, their political influence will only increase. In 2017, three-quarters of American Muslims were immigrants and children of immigrants, and they are generally younger than the average American. Fast-growing Muslim communities in Texas’s Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, DC, and beyond are set to make a significant impact. With effective activism and growing populations, Arab and Muslim American communities are likely to influence both major parties to align more with their interests in the coming years—from foreign policy issues like Gaza to pivotal domestic initiatives. Failing to do so will drive more voters toward third parties, further disrupting the traditional balance of the two-party system.

The “again” was understood, since Trump had made America energy-independent in his first term, before the Harris-Biden crowd took over and sent costs soaring. He’ll “slash red tape,” ramp up approvals of new power plants, spur nuclear energy, and roll back Democrats’ fossil-fuel restrictions. Hear, hear! It’s the all-of-the-above strategy that led the nation to become in Trump’s first term. And it would once again yield huge gains not just for America, but the entire Free World. As former Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made clear on a campaign press call, such plans are vital to future prosperity. “Between soaring demand and retiring coal, we are facing a great [energy] capacity shortfall of at least 30% by 2032,” Bernhardt warned — arguing that Team Harris-Walz can’t make up the difference thanks to “their net zero vision.” Democrats are too obsessed with reducing carbon emissions, and so block not only new gas- and oil-drilling, but also new pipelines, refineries, fossil-fuel power plants (and cars and stoves and heating) and so on. Under Trump’s plan, Bernhardt predicted, “every manufacturing plant, every data center, every semiconductor facility and assembly line will want to be built in America — because America will be the place where the cost of energy is lower than anywhere else on Earth.” Those lower costs will help rein in inflation in America as well: After all, energy — electricity for manufacturing or oil for transportation — accounts for a hefty share of the cost of nearly every product. And energy prices have shot up under Harris-Biden: Gasoline, by 45%, for instance, and commercially used natural gas, as of May, by 43%. Kamala Harris has explicitly opposed fracking (though campaign aides anonymously say she doesn’t anymore) and wants to force every American to switch to electric vehicles. Trump, by contrast, would scrap Harris-Biden rules, lift the bans, help existing plants and boost nuclear power, particularly from “small modular reactors,” a new technology with great promise He’d also push back against EV mandates and pull out of the Paris Climate Accords (again). All of which would do much to shore up the nation’s supplies, stabilize the power grid and enable exports to aid allies in Europe now dependent on Russian energy. The fact is, Making America Great Again means restoring its energy might. That won’t happen in a Harris presidency. It’ll take a Trump victory in November to make the nation “powerful” once again.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump laid out broad plans to bolster the nation's energy supplies by rolling back Kamala Harris-Joe Biden rules, boosting power plants, tapping reserves and spurring nuclear power.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/opinion/trump-would-make-america-juiced-again-with-his-all-of-the-above-energy-plans/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-a8aloop9q-1724972622561.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724958272&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:28:54","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":255231548,"title":"Harris in Georgia, Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin","text":"Harris in Georgia, Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin Former President Donald Trump held campaign stops in Michigan and Wisconsin Thursday while Vice President Kamala Harris addressed voters in Savannah, Georgia.

On Wednesday night, the content creator and internet troll posted a video of what appeared to be him and the singer Grimes flipping off a Tesla while singing diss lyrics about Elon Musk. “Fuck a Tesla I like a Honda/And fuck an X, double entendre,” sings Grimes’ voice in the clip. Many users (and even Newsweek) fell for the troll immediately. Daniel’s plan had worked. “Everything that I do is generally so outrageous and stupid that it would make sense for me to do it, but I wanted to see how many people would believe it off the bat,” he tells Rolling Stone. “People will just kind of automatically assume it’s real.” The new video marks a return to the internet for Daniel after two years. The troll/creator/rapper — also known under the moniker Lil Phag — made headlines in 2013 when he petitioned for a Miley Cyrus song to become the national anthem (guess which one), and in 2016, when he tried throwing a two-foot pink dildo at Trump at a rally. He blew up on Vine at the time for his internet pranks and silly takes, and has since built a following on TikTok and Twitter. (Erm, X.) Daniel wrote the song, titled “Nuisance,” as a Musk troll several months ago, enlisting Grammy-nominated duo SMLE to produce the track. He originally meant to find another artist to feature on the song, until he discovered Grimes’ AI generator, Elf Tech, and decided to have the track double as a Musk diss and indirect commentary on the necessity of artificial intelligence regulation after Grimes unveiled the technology last April, writing on X, “Feel free to use my voice without penalty.” Daniel says that the song takes aim at “two of the biggest advocates of AI” by using Grimes’ voice to diss the tech billionaire. “If they want to respond, then they’re going to have to say AI needs regulation,” he says of Grimes and Musk. (The Tesla founder and musician have been in a heated custody battle over their three children for over a year, and Grimes posted in support of Musk’s trans daughter, following his transphobic remarks, back in July.) “If they don’t respond then I don’t know, maybe it’s just a song with Grimes dissing Elon Musk.” Daniel wrote his verse and Grimes’ fake verse, and put it through Elf Tech to see if people online would believe it was real. Daniel then enlisted a “blonde friend” to put on glasses and wear a hoodie to impersonate Grimes in a clip he posted to TikTok and X. It was quickly picked up by PopCrave and even earned a like on TikTok from Julia Fox. “I would love to say the majority of people are smart enough to not fall for AI misinformation, but they’re falling for human misinformation so I’m not sure adding a supercomputer behind it is going to help,” he says. Daniel says he’s not personally “anti-AI,” but thinks that regulations need to be set in place on its usage, pointing to Trump posting a fake image of “Swifties for Trump” and deepfake pornography rampant on Musk’s internet. “AI has its place in the world, it just needs to be regulated,” he says. “I think it’s going to become a problem fairly soon until it’s regulated.” “Nuisance” marks Daniel’s return online after grappling with a health scare and the death of his mother due to Covid-19 in late 2021. “I didn’t want to grieve her on the internet,” he says. Around the time away, he says he developed adult-onset epilepsy, which led to a car accident in which he shattered his foot and broke three ribs. Several months later, in May 2023, he says his epilepsy “got so bad it triggered a heart attack.” He’s since turned to fitness and focused on his health, and has found the right medication for his condition. “I came back specifically for the election year. There’s no way that I am going to stay away from the internet during an election year,” he says. “I’m doing really good now.” Before his step away from social media, Daniel was even profiled in the New York Times in 2020 for being an “agent of chaos” and released music as Lil Phag alongside Tana Mongeau, Bella Thorne, and CupcakKe. He wrote a parodic, erotic, gay fan-fiction inspired by Donald Trump called Trump Temptations ahead of the 2016 election, and was also detained at a Trump rally for his dildo incident. Daniel says he doesn’t plan to attack the former president with plastic phalluses anytime soon, but he’s excited to see young voters “amped” about President Kamala Harris. “The trolling will always continue,” he says. “[But] I don’t want to get on another no-fly list.”","summary":"“If they want to respond, then they’re going to have to say AI needs regulation,” Daniel says of the musician and Musk","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/elijah-daniel-grims-ai-elon-musk-1235091479/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/musk-Elijah-Daniel-grimes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:25:56","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":255232386,"title":"\"Fight Is For America's Future\": Kamala Harris At Georgia Rally","text":"Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday emphasised that the current presidential fight is for the future of the United States and asserted that the future is always worth fighting for. The remarks by Harris came while she addressed a rally in Georgia. Harris during the rally said that they are running as the underdog in the upcoming presidential elections in the country and expressed confidence that she will secure victory in the elections. \"68 days to go... We are here to speak the truth and one of the things that we know is that we are running as the underdog. And we have some hard work ahead of us. But we like hard work. Hard work is good work. And with your help, we are going to win this November,\" Harris said. She further said that during her entire career, she has always stood up for people. She said, \"I am no stranger to tough fights... I was a courtroom Prosecutor. So every day in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I spoke five words--Kamala Harris For The People. My entire career, I only had one client--the people. I stood for women and children against predators who used to abuse them... and for seniors facing abuse. I would tell you that those fights were not easy and neither were the elections that put me in those offices.\" She further said, \"But we never gave up because the future is always worth fighting for. And that is the fight we are in right now. A fight for America's future. We fight for the future with affordable childcare, paid leave and affordable healthcare.\" Earlier, Harris said that she intends to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the upcoming presidential elections, CNN reported. The remarks by the Vice President came in a joint interview with Walz on CNN. Harris pledged to serve as a president for all Americans. In the interview, she expressed her willingness to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if elected. However, she didn't specify a particular individual. \"I've got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse,\" she said. \"But I would, I think. I think it's really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican,\" according to CNN. Harris was nominated as the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden quit the presidential race amid mounting concerns over his age, particularly after his poor show in the debate with Donald Trump in June. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president.

Pennsylvania Republican US Rep. Mike Kelly, who chairs the panel, and Colorado Democratic US Rep. Mike Crow, who serves as ranking member, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service asking for interviews, communications and existing protocols that factored into the July 13 campaign rally shooting in Butler, Pa. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. have until Sept. 4 to comply with the request. Officials sent the letter two days after the task force revisited the Butler Farm Show grounds in southwestern Pennsylvania, Kelly’s home district. In an update posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, the congressman said the meetings with law enforcement “provided the Task Force with greater insight into the security failures of July 13.” “What we saw and heard underscored concerns about multiple security shortcomings and the lack of a common understanding among local law enforcement officials about exactly how the Secret Service intended to address a threat like the one [sic] that developed,” he said. Kelly was among several congressional and state lawmakers present at the rally when a gunman took aim at Trump, grazing his ear after the president turned his head to look at a projector screen behind him. The would-be assassin fired several more shots into the crowd, killing 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and severely wounding 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaven. U.S. Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle resigned after the shooting amid intense pressure from congressional lawmakers over the “stunning” security failures. Cheatle’s comments about reasons why law enforcement weren’t on the roof where the gunman staged himself ranged from blaming state and local police to the slight pitch of the roof itself being “too dangerous” to existing “overhead” support meant to identify threats. The conflicting excuses only fueled conspiracy theories – backed by some prominent congressional lawmakers – that pointed to a broader government conspiracy to kill Trump. Cheatle has categorically denied the accusation.","summary":"A bipartisan task force investigating the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump requested a trove of documents and interviews on Wednesday.

In a long and unusual statement, the Army noted the Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) staffer acted with ‘professionalism’ and said she was ‘abruptly pushed aside’ by Trump officials when she tried to enforce a federal law that forbids campaign activity at the cemetery. However, since the staffer is not going to press charges, the Army said they considered the matter ‘closed.’ It was a rare rebuke from the military about a former commander in chief. And it comes amid a deepening row between Trump and Gold Star Families about the incident. The families that invited the former president to join them at the cemetery have defended him, but other families who lost loved ones in service to U.S. have criticized Trump for posting photos and video of the visit to his campaign accounts. Arlington National Cemetery is considered hallowed ground in the U.S. military and is managed by the Army. Trump, who is running for a second term in the White House, was invited to visit on Monday with family members of the some of the soldiers killed three years ago when U.S. troops exited Afghanistan. He was there to help them mark the annivesary of the suicide bombing at Abbey Gate and honor the soldiers who died. His campaign said they had permission ahead of time to bring a photographer. And officials told Axios they are ‘weighing options’ about releasing their internal footage backing up their version of the story. They claim a staffer with the cemetery tried to ‘physically block’ members of Trump’s team during the visit and claimed the staffer had a ‘mental health episode.’ ‘The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony,’ Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. While at the cemetery on Monday, Trump laid three separate wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and then went with the families to Section 60. His campaign posted a video of both parts of the visit on its TikTok account. And several staffers posted photos to social media But the Army hit back, noting the campaign, ahead of the visit, was ‘made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds.’ ‘An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,’ an Army spokesperson said in the statement on Thursday. ‘Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was reported to the JBM-HH police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges. Therefore the Army considers the matter closed,’ the spokesperson noted. ‘This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked. ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation’s fallen deserve.’ Military officials told the New York Times that the cemetery staffer feared that pursuing the matter with the authorities at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Virginia, which has jurisdiction over the cemetery, could subject her to retaliation from Trump supporters. Pentagon officials were deeply concerned about Trump turning the visit into a campaign stop, but they also didn’t want to block him from coming, reported The Washington Post. The officials gave the campaign ‘ground rules’ in an attempt to keep politics out of visit. Ahead of the former president’s visit, Army officials told Trump’s team that he could come in his personal capacity and bring personal aides, but not campaign staff. Campaign staff went anyway. ‘If the campaign feels the need to defend their team’s actions — which include bullying and physically pushing out of the way a longtime public servant and member of the team at Arlington working to protect the sanctity of the sacred spaces — then that’s on them,’ a defense official told The Post. ‘The rules were made clear to participants, and these two chose to disregard those rules. End of story.’ Trump has been heavily critical of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, calling it ‘gross incompetence.’ The visit also allowed Trump to counter reports he doesn’t respect veterans and has previously referred to slain World War II soldiers as suckers and losers, reports Trump has denied. While at Arlington cemetery, the former president laid three wreaths at the tomb, two honoring Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover and Sgt. Nicole Gee – two Marines killed in the bombing – and another wreath dedicated to all 13 service members who were killed in the attack. He was joined by Marine Cpl. Kelsee Lainhart (Ret.) and Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas-Andrews, both of whom were injured at the Abbey Gate Bombing. Monday marked three years since the Aug. 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, which killed 13 American service members and more than 100 Afghans. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. After the wreath laying, Trump and the families went to Section 60, the final resting place for those who died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan – a place regularly visited by spouses and family members of the fallen. Media were not allowed to accompany the former president to that section of the cemetery. Trump posed for photos with the family and laid flowers at the tombs of some soldiers who died, according to images posted on social media by his team. While families often take photos at gravesites of loved ones, federal law prohibits any political activity in the cemetery. Sitting presidents have visited Section 60 but never as part of a political campaign. The families of the fallen said they had invited Trump and gave ‘our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever.’ But the family of a Green Beret who served eight combat tours and is buried in Section 60 expressed concern about Trump’s campaign filming his gravesite without permission. Relatives of Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano told the New York Times that Trump’s campaign had not followed the rules when it came to visits. Marckesano’s gravesite is adjacent to that of Staff Sergeant Darin Taylor Hoover, a Marine who was killed in Abbey Gate bombing. The Hoover family granted Trump’s team permission to film and take photographs at the gravesite but the Marckesano family did not. Marckesano’s grave was shown in photos from the visit that were published online. Marckesano’s sister Michele told the Times: ‘We fully support Staff Sergeant Darin Hoover’s family and the other families in their quest for answers and accountability regarding the Afghanistan withdrawal and the tragedy at Abbey Gate.’ ‘However,’ she added, ‘according to our conversation with Arlington National Cemetery, the Trump campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit to Staff Sergeant Hoover’s gravesite in Section 60, which lays directly next to my brother’s grave.’ She continued, ‘We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly.’ Arlington National Cemetery is the resting place for more than 400,000 service members, veterans and their families.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Army on Thursday defended a staff member at Arlington National Cemetery&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Army currently alleges that a staff member of Trump was involved in an incident with a worker at Arlington Cemetery, fueling a dispute regarding honoring Gold Star families affected by the Afghanistan conflict. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/army-currently-alleges-that-a-staff-member-of-trump-was-involved-in-an-incident-with-a-worker-at-arlington-cemetery-fueling-a-dispute-regarding-honoring-gold-star-families-affected-by-the-afghanistan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Army-now-claims-Trump-aide-pushed-Arlington.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:18:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.324},{"id":255231130,"title":"Jack White Threatens 'Fascist' Trump Campaign with Lawsuit","text":"The White Stripes' Jack White has threatened to sue the team of former President Donald Trump after an aide used the band's song \"Seven Nation Army\" in a campaign video.Trump's Deputy Director of Communications Margo Martin shared a video of the Republican nominee boarding a plane to campaign events on Thursday, with ten seconds of the famous bass-heavy intro to the White Stripes' song.White became aware of the video after it had already gained 65,000 views.

But when Biden dug in and vowed to stay in it amid sagging poll numbers, one of his closest allies told the president’s advisers he would support the reelection bid on one condition: that his brain function be assessed by a pair of independent neurologists who would then present their findings to the public at a news conference. According to an eye-popping report published Thursday by The New York Times, the information came from multiple people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. The ultimatum came from US Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and West Point graduate who heads up the Armed Services Committee, according to the newspaper. A spokesman told the outlet that Reed’s proposal was not meant as an “ultimatum,” per se, but “to impress upon Mr. Biden’s aides the need to be proactive and transparent in the best interest of the president. Rumblings about Biden’s age and ability to retain the Oval Office had been increasing in frequency and pitch since June’s disastrous debate against Trump. However, Biden held firm about his unwillingness to drop out. In early July, Senate Democrats convened at their weekly luncheon, where nine out of 12 spoke forcefully against Biden’s stubbornness about his candidacy, the Times reported. “It knocked my socks off how upset and angry people were, how the overwhelming majority got up and spoke really strongly,” Democratic Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said. A day earlier, an obstinate Biden had sent an open letter to Congress insisting that he was going to continue running for a second term as US president and angrily lashed out at the “elites” pushing for him to bow out of the race. This “fueled a sense of panic” among Democratic leaders, according to the Times, which said Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester, Democrats of Ohio and Montana, respectively, were particularly concerned about losing their seats if Biden continued apace. To try and force the issue, Schumer reportedly then arranged an emergency meeting with Biden’s top aides, arriving with a coterie of high-level Democratic legislators who insisted the president end his reelection campaign. To do otherwise could not only taint Biden’s legacy but would expose Americans to the possibility of a second Trump term, a wholly unacceptable outcome, according to the Times. Those who were there said the atmosphere was one of “affection and appreciation,” rather than one of anger or bitterness, the Times reported. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who recently left the Democratic Party to become an independent, “made the case that Democrats were acting out of affection for Mr. Biden, much as a family persuading an aging grandparent to surrender the car keys,” according to the Times. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, reportedly said he’d continue to support Biden and say publicly that the president was in fine shape. But if Biden’s mental acuity were to decline to a point at which his shortcomings were too obvious to ignore, it “would make a liar of him,” the Times report said. Biden’s advisers pooh-poohed concerns about the debate, but those gathered in the room said they “could not unsee what they had seen,” one attendee told the Times. When it emerged that Biden’s advisers hadn’t shared any details of the meeting with the president, Schumer called White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and “demanded” a face-to-face meeting with Biden. On July 13, Schumer met with Biden at the president’s beach house in Rehoboth, Delaware. A week later, Biden suspended his race for reelection. As of Thursday afternoon, according to nationwide polls, vice- president Kamala Harris was leading Trump by 3.5 percentage points.","summary":"Sen.

Harris was responding after being asked about changes she’s made on major policies. Harris also said in the past that she would block funding for a barrier at the U.S.–Mexico border. She said in 2020 that former President Donald Trump’s border wall “is a complete waste of taxpayer money and won’t make us any safer.” While giving a speech to the Democratic National Convention this month, Harris said she would sign a border bill crafted by senators that includes spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the barrier. Harris told CNN in the new interview that she still believes “the climate crisis is real” and that “it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding to deadlines around time.” She pointed out to the Inflation Reduction Act, which she and President Joe Biden supported. The act included money for companies to measure and lower greenhouse gas emissions, among other climate-related work. “We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension the globe, around when we should meet certain standards in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as an example,” Harris said. “That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed.” Harris later discussed reaching a consensus on issues. “I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems,” Harris added later, according to CNN. Harris also said she would appoint a Republican to her Cabinet if she wins the presidency, although she did not identify a specific individual. “I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences,” she said, CNN reported. “And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican.” CNN said it will air the full interview at 9 p.m. Eastern. The interview, which also included Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’s running mate, was pre-recorded.","summary":"Harris was speaking in her first interview since becoming the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-defends-changes-in-policy-stances-on-border-fracking-5715261","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/29/id5715263-GettyImages-2167257018-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:07:06","author":"Zachary Stieber","authors":["Zachary Stieber"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":255230896,"title":"Trump social media posts on jailing lawmakers, sexually explicit remark","text":"Trump social media posts on jailing lawmakers, sexually explicit remark Former President Donald Trump posted several messages online that included a call for jailing lawmakers and a sexually explicit remark.

Harris has moved more towards the centre on some issues from the time she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from US President Joe Biden as the Democrats’ choice to face Republican former president Donald Trump in the November 5 election. She has toughened her position on migration along the southern US border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one of a handful of swing states that could decide the election. “My value around what we need to do to secure our border – that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organisations, violations of American laws, regarding the illegal passage of guns, drugs and human beings across our border. My values have not changed,” she said. Harris’ conversation was aimed at showing her in command of the issues. Some critics suggested she may be less polished in unscripted settings after she led Democrats’ turnaround with a series of forceful campaign speeches. Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, also discussed the possibility of adding a Republican to her potential cabinet, saying she wanted a diversity of opinion. “I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican,” she said. The US vice-president has eschewed formal interviews and press conferences during her rapid rise to the top of the Democratic ticket. Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday, not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist since Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21 and endorsed her. Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Donald Trump and Biden that hastened the president’s departure from the race, conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz continued their bus tour of the battleground state. Harris’ lack of interviews has sparked criticism from opponents, and some concern among supporters, that she is less sharp in spontaneous settings than at rallies or speeches where she can use prepared remarks and a Teleprompter. Harris and Walz arrived at Kim’s Cafe, a Black-owned restaurant, in the early afternoon to tape the CNN interview. Before Harris picked him as her running mate, Walz did a string of interviews with major television networks. Trump frequently holds press conferences and offers interviews to conservative news outlets. He often uses them to criticise Harris and Biden rather than discuss his own policy aims in detail. On Thursday, Harris campaigned in Savannah, Georgia and told a crowd of 7,500 that “we have some hard work ahead of us”, to defeat her Republican rival Trump, but she was confident Georgia would vote Democratic again after a narrow win for Biden-Harris there in 2020. During the speech, Harris reiterated support for a deal to get a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza when her remarks were interrupted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators. Harris said she and Biden were working “around the clock” to get that deal. “Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard,” Harris said. “I am speaking now, but on the subject I will say this – the president and I are working around the clock.” As Harris’ bus caravan left her Savannah hotel on Thursday, several dozen Trump supporters with signs and banners braved torrential rain to line the streets. Harris and Walz kicked off their bus tour of Georgia on Tuesday.","summary":"In first formal interview since presidential nomination, Harris told CNN she had toughened her position on migration along US-Mexico border.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3276481/kamala-harris-defends-immigration-shift-says-she-could-name-republican-cabinet","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/30/183f47de-2fd6-4220-93ee-119f08221852_43948a74.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/08/07/web%20version%20walz%20china.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:01:52","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.154},{"id":255230408,"title":"Letters: Skewed salaries | Eurocentric views | Best measure | Clear-cut choice","text":"Carbon removal needs residents’ PR Startups around Silicon Valley know being a “trailblazer” isn’t easy.

Jenn Bulka Redwood City Public safety salaries skew city numbers Re: “City-worker costs have skyrocketed” (Page A1, Aug 23) Let’s put the data in perspective. Most of the highest-paid city workers are safety (police and firefighters). The article failed to break down salaries, overtime, benefits and pensions in reporting the “hard data.” Cops are paid a lot of overtime, their pensions are generous compared to other workers and they receive full salary up to one year if injured on duty. Most city workers do not come close to these levels and to attack all “government unions,” as some readers have, does a disservice to the bulk of our hardworking employees. The stark difference in pay is not new, if one looks back in time. City management shares some of the blame as do the rest of us when we value a safety worker more than other workers. Harry Oberhelman San Jose Lofgren, Eshoo must alter Eurocentric views Re: “Lofgren warns Council against supporting tribe” (Page A1, Aug. 9). Reps. Lofgren and Eshoo are out of step and stuck in a policy that must end: Eurocentric control of native peoples and their land use. The entire system created by the Bureau of Indian Affairs is awash with a history of oppression that even involves the justification of genocide, relocation to reservations, theft and cultural abuse of children, and now land use. There is no reason for Eshoo and Lofgren to believe that the old ways should continue without further harm to native tribes. Stop this role of master/subservience now. It’s ugly and no longer serves a useful moral purpose. Delorme Mckee-Stovall San Jose Debt is best measure of economic performance Re: “U.S. economy better off in Democrats’ hands” (Page A6, Aug. 27). Every president since 1929 has increased the U.S. debt. Comparing deficit reduction to debt reduction is just wrong. The accepted way of measuring debt accumulation is beginning Oct. 1 of a new president’s first year, the start of the U.S. fiscal year. There are always financial influences passed on to new administrations from previous laws enacted. Even Bill Maher, hardly a conservative, acknowledged this in his most recent show. Black Swan events also contribute to new debt. Wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics and financial crises all cause massive spending. Yes, the numbers say Democrats have better results, but it’s not that simple. Fun fact: The Biden administration is on track to exceed even Donald Trump’s debt increase (which includes $4.25 trillion in COVID spending), currently at $6.7 trillion with 13 months to go.

But her comment represents an olive branch to “Never Trumper” Republicans and independents at a time when the country is bitterly divided and the race between Harris and Donald Trump is a statistical dead heat. A number of Republicans have endorsed the Democratic candidate for president, including well over 200 former aides and officials who served former President George W. Bush, the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah. Among them is Larry Ellis, a retired four-star general. Several Republicans were hailed prominently at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week, including former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. “I’ve got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not putting the cart before the horse,” Harris told CNN in a snippet of the interview released Thursday afternoon, choosing not to speculate on names. “But I would. I think it’s really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion.” There is precedent for a Democrat naming a Republican to a presidential Cabinet. Barack Obama chose three Republicans to serve in his Cabinet: former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) as Commerce secretary; former Rep. Ray LaHood (R-IL) as secretary of Transportation and Robert Gates, who Obama kept on as Defense secretary. (Gates later harshly criticized Obama’s foreign policy handling.) The CNN interview with Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was taped Thursday afternoon at a cafe in Savannah, Georgia, and will air in its entirety Thursday at 9 p.m. ET. The long-anticipated media availability is being closely scrutinized by the media and the political world. Harris has come under fire for avoiding traditional media outlets, choosing instead to court social media influencers.

Tim Walz, are sitting for their first formal interview since she became the Democratic nominee during a CNN prime-time special airing Thursday at 9 PM ET.

Bash could take a more balanced approach, of course. But the media hasn’t acquitted itself too well when it comes to Harris’ candidacy. Look at how reporters were reacting when her campaign was a mere three weeks old and she had just picked Walz as her running mate. “The Beltway press is angry that Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t sat down with them to talk about things like policy,” wrote Daily Kos founder Markos Moulitsas. “In their warped, archaic minds, they are important to the political process as a way to inform readers about the candidates.” Harris already had a strong social media and internet presence and was communicating to the American people just fine, without the press serving as gatekeepers—and that’s probably what had the media’s knickers in a twist in the first place. Harris doesn’t need reporters in order to reach voters, and voters don’t need reporters to find out about her and her policies. Now that Harris has agreed to an interview, there’s grumbling about how she’s not doing it on her own, because running mate Walz will be by her side. USA Today wrote a whole pearl-clutching story about it. “Vice President Kamala Harris received criticism for not formally sitting down with the press since launching her presidential campaign,” wrote USA Today’s Savannah Kuchar. “Now, with her first interview lined up, she is facing new backlash for not doing the event alone.” There is a long tradition of team interviews, of course. Yes, they’re rarely conducted this late in the race, but given what the Harris campaign has had to accomplish in about 40 days, it’s not at all unreasonable. Meanwhile, Trump—or some ghostwriter on his campaign staff—has weighed in to try and work the refs. “Dana Bash of CNN has a chance at greatness today,” Trump (or an aide who knows how to use punctuation) posted on Truth Social. “If she gave a fair but tough interview of Comrade Kamala Harris, she will expose her as being totally inept and ill suited for the job of President, much as I exposed Crooked Joe Biden during our now famous Debate. How cool would that be for Dana and CNN???” All of this scrutiny makes Thursday’s interview as much a test for Bash and CNN as it is for Harris and Walz.

Newsom was among the prospective candidates after Biden dropped out of the race. But, Harris won. In his recent podcast interview, he mockingly said he's been \"told to say\" the party's nomination process was inclusive.

Good thing data doesn't lie in that over a million Californians have fled the state under him.\" @20MillionYears criticized, \"He's done nothing good for this State and its legal residents. That's All.\" @DeanPellegrino2 explained his point, \"Gavin is mad because they chose Harris over him. [The] problem with Gavin is everyone knows he destroyed California’s economy, safety, schools and companies are leaving out in groves.\" The 56-year-old appeared on the Pod Save America podcast on Friday, August 23, 2024, and took a jibe at the Vice President's presidential nomination for the November elections. He told the hosts, \"We went through a very open process, a very inclusive process. It was bottom-up, I don't know if you know that. That's what I've been told to say,\" per New York Post. POTUS Biden abruptly announced he was abandoning his re-election bid against Republican rival Donald Trump on July 21, 2024. The 81-year-old was under intense pressure from his party people and his critics to withdraw his campaign after his catastrophic performance at CNN's first presidential debate with Trump. While some questioned his mental acuity and declining health, his own people feared the Democratic party's future in politics. Although he initially refused to step down, he eventually let go of the race and endorsed his running mate Harris for president. The Democratic party didn't immediately back Biden's endorsement, they considered other candidates as well. Among other prospects was Newsom who was expected to take the responsibility forward. Emily Hoeven, an opinion columnist at the San Francisco Chronicle, said at the time, \"I think it's been clear that he's been waiting in the wings for some time. Now there is a far bigger opening for him than there ever has been,\" per The Guardian. But, since the DNC lent unifying support for Harris and her chosen VP Tim Walz's campaign, Newsom has made this controversial statement. Aside from social media critics, journalists like Glenn Greenwald commented on the viral clip on X, \"The Party of Democracy sits around guffawing at how anti-democratic and vote-free and secret was their process for choosing and then imposing the new Democratic presidential nominee on the country.\"","summary":"A user on X, formerly, Twitter, made a joke at Gavin Newsom&#39;s expense, &#34;Newsom thought he was going to be chosen [as president&#39;s nominee].&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/netizens-think-gavin-newsom-is-bitter-about-harris-nomination-with-his-snarky-inclusive-comment","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/713143/uploads/a51a9b10-65f2-11ef-b176-858dad6f1219_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 23:00:09","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":255230670,"title":"US Army scolds Trump campaign for ‘attacking and pushing cemetery guard aside’","text":"Caption: ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA – AUGUST 26: Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery on August 26, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia. Monday marks three years since the August 26, 2021, suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport, which killed 13 American service members. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Photographer: Anna Moneymaker(Picture: Getty Images) The US Army has issued a rare rebuke of ex-President Donald Trump’s campaign after an Arlington National Cemetery worker was allegedly ‘pushed aside’ during his visit. An Army spokesperson confirmed that a cemetery employee was ‘abruptly pushed aside’ on Monday when Trump visited the sacred burial grounds for a wreath-laying ceremony marking the third anniversary of the US’s Afghanistan War withdrawal. Two Trump campaign members had a verbal and physical altercation with the cemetery worker, NPR reported. The Army spokesperson did not name Trump or his campaign, but it was abundantly clear that they were the ones being referred to. ‘Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,’ stated the Army spokesperson on Thursday. ‘An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. ‘Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.’ The spokesperson said the incident was reported to police but that the employee decided against pressing charges. ‘It is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,’ the spokesperson stated. The statement came a day after Trump shared a TikTok video that included clips from the cemetery visit, and may violate federal law prohibiting the use of military burial grounds for political campaigning. In the 21-second clip captioned ‘should have never happened’, Trump lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and poses with Gold Star family members at their late loved ones’ gravestones. Some of the clips show him smiling and flashing a thumbs up. Trump defended his camp in the incident during a campaign event in Potterville, Michigan, on Thursday afternoon. The Republican nominee said that he went to the site because families of the fallen soldiers asked him to be there. ‘While we were there, they said, “Could you take pictures of the grave of my son, sister, brother? Could you take pictures with us, sir?” I said absolutely, I did,’ Trump said. ‘And last night I read that I was using the site to politic. That I used it to politic. This all goes out of Washington, just like all of these prosecutors come out of Washington… these are bad people we’re dealing with.’ Despite its statement criticizing the Trump campaign, the Army is considering the matter ‘closed’ since the employee is not pursuing charges.

The exclusive interview with Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is scheduled to air at 9 p.m. EDT. Ahead of the broadcast, CNN revealed that during the exchange, Harris said she would reach out to moderates and independents alienated by the \"extremism\" of GOP nominee Donald Trump by naming a Republican to her administration. \"I've got 68 days to go with this election, so I'm not putting the cart before the horse,\" she says in her first in-depth television interview since accepting the nomination. \"But I would. I think it's really important. I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it's important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. \"And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who was a Republican,\" she says. Harris and Walz are on a bus tour through the key swing state of Georgia as they attempt to build on their momentum coming out of last week's Democratic National Convention. Georgia, reliably a Republican stronghold with the GOP owning all the statewide elected offices, flipped to the Democrats in the presidential election under Joe Biden. Most polls either show Harris neck-and-neck or pulling slightly ahead of Trump in the state. On Thursday, the Harris-Walz campaign highlighted what it called growing GOP support, including an open letter signed by more than 200 Republicans who previously worked for either former President George W. Bush, the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., or Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah. \"While Donald Trump continues to attack moderates and independents, as well as Republicans he doesn't like, the Harris-Walz campaign has made clear that there is a place in our coalition for voters who reject the extremism of Donald Trump and want to put country over party,\" a campaign spokesperson said. Harris attended a solo rally in Savannah on Thursday, wrapping up the bus tour, before visiting the CNN studios in Atlanta with Walz. Before the airing the interview, the broadcaster also reported that Harris used the airtime to explain how her views on immigration and producing oil and gas via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have evolved since her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination four years ago. She came out against fracking as a climate change hazard in 2019, but by the time eventual Democratic nominee Joe Biden tapped her as his running mate, she had already altered her position and, in fact, later cast a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate to expand fracking leases. \"We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension, the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed,\" she said.","summary":"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris says in an interview to be broadcast Thursday night on CNN that, if elected, she will appoint a Republican to her Cabinet.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2024/08/29/CNN-interview-Harris-sappoint-Republican-cabinet/2571724968147/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2571724968147/2024/upi_com/fc876dbcc071fce2ae523b2027c2e040/v1.2/In-CNN-interview-Harris-says-she-will-appoint-Republican-to-Cabinet.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:55:28","author":"Don Jacobson","authors":["Don Jacobson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":255230472,"title":"Behind Trump's Wisconsin town hall","text":"Behind Trump's Wisconsin town hall Former President Donald Trump is in La Crosse, Wisconsin, for a town hall to give the presidential candidate a chance to discuss 2024 election issues.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump says that, if he wins a second term, he wants to make IVF treatment free for women, but did not detail how he would fund his plan or how it would work. “I’m announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” he said at an event in Michigan. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.” IVF treatments are notoriously expensive, and can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a single round. Many women require multiple rounds and there is no guarantee of success. The announcement comes as Trump has been under intense criticism from Democrats for his role in appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion in the country. The decision is expected to be a major motivator for Democrats this November, and was a major theme of the party’s national convention last week as well as Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech as she accepted her party’s nomination. In response, Trump has been trying to present himself as moderate on the issue, going as far as to declare himself as “very strong on women’s reproductive rights.” In an interview with NBC ahead of the event, Trump also suggested that he will vote to repeal Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which limits the procedure before many women even know they are pregnant. Trump, in the interview, did not explicitly say how he plans to vote on the ballot measure when he casts his vote this fall. But he repeated his past criticism that the measure, signed into law by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last year, is too restrictive. “I think the six weeks is too short. It has to be more time,’ he said. ”I am going to be voting that we need more than six weeks.” Trump had previously called DeSantis’ decision to sign the bill a “terrible mistake.” Trump has held multiple conflicting positions on abortion over the years. After he considered various potential national cutoff times, he decided earlier this year that regulating abortion should be left to the states. He has repeatedly taken credit for his role in overturning Roe and called it “a beautiful thing to watch” as states set their own restrictions. But he also came out in favor of IVF and pushed lawmakers in Alabama to protect access after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law, sparking national backlash. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said over the weekend that Trump would not support a national abortion ban if elected president and would veto such legislation if it landed on his desk. “I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said when asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” whether he could commit to Trump not imposing such a ban. “Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue.” The Ohio senator also insisted that Trump, the former president would veto such legislation if Congress passed it. “I mean, if you’re not supporting it as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,” he said in an interview that aired Sunday. An AP-NORC poll conducted in June found that more than 6 in 10 U.S. adults support protecting access to IVF, including more than half of Republicans. Only about 1 in 10 are opposed. In his speech, Trump also said that, if he wins, families will be able to deduct expenses for caring for newborns from their taxes. “We’re pro-family,” he said. Trump made the announcement while campaigning in Michigan and Wisconsin as he ramps up his battleground state travel heading into the traditional Labor Day turn toward the fall election. Trump is intensely focused on recapturing states he won in 2016 but lost narrowly in 2020 as he continues to adjust to the reality of his new race against Harris. Trump’s first stop was Potterville, Michigan, near the state capital of Lansing, where he railed against the Biden administration over inflation in the most dramatic terms, accusing Harris and President Joe Biden of having presided over “an economic reign of terror” and “committing one financial atrocity after another.” “Kamala has made middle class life unaffordable and unlivable and I’m going to make America affordable again,” he vowed to supporters at Alro Steel. It was his third visit to the state in the past nine days and second this week after a speech to the National Guard Association in Detroit on Monday. Later, he will visit La Crosse, Wisconsin, for a town hall moderated by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who endorsed him in Detroit. It will be Trump’s first visit to Wisconsin since the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which ended three days before Biden dropped out of the race and made way for Harris. Along with Pennsylvania, which Trump will visit on Friday, these three Midwestern states make up a northern industrial bloc Democrats carried for two decades before Trump won them in 2016. Biden recaptured them on his way to the White House in 2020. Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have blitzed the battleground states in recent weeks, with Vance in both states this week as well. Trump has struggled in recent weeks to pivot to his new race against Harris, whose candidacy has reinvigorated the Democratic Party. He complained yet again of the switch on Thursday, asking his crowd. “How would you like to be me?” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Swedish group have demanded that the campaign immediately remove videos featuring the “unauthorised” use of their hit songs including The Winner Takes It All and Dancing Queen at a recent rally – which were being shared online. They mark the latest in a list of music stars, including the Foo Fighters and Celine Dion, who have protested against Mr Trump using their catalogue as part of his campaign. A statement on behalf of Abba, given to the PA news agency, said: “Abba has recently discovered the unauthorised use of their music and videos at a Trump event through videos that appeared online. “As a result, Abba and its representative has promptly requested the removal and deletion of such content. “No request has been received; therefore, no permission or license has been granted.” It comes after US rockers the Foo Fighters said Mr Trump used their hit song My Hero during a rally last week. When asked on social media if they allowed Mr Trump to use their 1997 track at the event, the Foo Fighters simply replied: “No”. A spokesperson for the band later told the PA news agency: “Foo Fighters were not asked permission, and if they were they would not have granted it.” Meanwhile the team behind pop superstar Dion also condemned Mr Trump for playing her classic song My Heart Will Go On during a campaign rally earlier this month. Her management team released a statement on behalf of the Canadian artist and her record label saying the use of the song was “in no way” authorised, adding: “… And really, THAT song?” Earlier this year, Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr slammed Mr Trump after the band’s hit Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want was played at a rally. Responding to a video where the song could be heard playing in the background of a Trump rally, Marr wrote: “Ahh…right…OK. I never in a million years would’ve thought this could come to pass. Consider this shit shut right down right now.” In 2018, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith sent a letter to the then-president ordering him to stop playing the band’s songs at political rallies, after the band’s 1993 hit Livin’ On The Edge was played at a rally in Charleston, West Virginia. The singer had previously sent the Trump campaign two cease-and-desist letters in 2015 for its use of the band’s music. The estates of Prince and Tom Petty have also demanded Mr Trump refrain from using the music of the late musicians, while Rihanna issued a cease-and-desist letter after he played her 2007 hit Don’t Stop The Music at an event in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne sent a notice to Trump banning him from using Black Sabbath music in his campaign videos. Other artists who have taken action after Mr Trump used their music include the Rolling Stones and Neil Young, while Linkin Park issued a cease-and-desist order after the band’s song, In The End, appeared in a video supporting the then-president.","summary":"The Swedish group have demanded that the campaign immediately remove videos circulating online.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/abba-trump-celine-dion-swedish-foo-fighters-b1179103.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/08/29/23/29-d1e7625c9c7344eda9448f36a615fb47.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:46:26","author":"Ellie Iorizzo","authors":["Ellie Iorizzo"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.032},{"id":255230060,"title":"Harris eeks ahead of Trump nationally in post-DNC 2024 election poll  ","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris holds a slim lead over former President Donald Trump after an expected polling bump following last week’s Democratic National Convention, according to a survey released Thursday. The Wall Street Journal’s latest national poll showed Harris leading Trump by 1 percentage point. The Democratic nominee pulled 48% support in a head-to-head matchup compared to the Republican nominee’s 47% backing. When third-party candidates were included in the survey, Harris’ advantage grew to 2 points, 47% to 45%. Both results were within the poll’s 2.5 percentage point margin for error. The survey’s findings suggest that Trump, 78, would likely emerge victorious in the Electoral College race, since Democratic candidates typically poll higher than Republican ones in national polls. The Democratic presidential candidates usually need at least a 3 point lead nationally to signal that they are also ahead in the battleground states that will decide the election. In 2016, for example, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton topped Trump by 2.1 percentage points in the national popular vote but lost several swing states, handing Trump a decisive Electoral College victory. The poll marked the first time that Trump has trailed in the presidential race (head to head) since April of last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The vice president’s surge is likely a reflection of the four days of glowing praise showered upon Harris during the four day, nationally televised Democratic gathering in Chicago – a polling bump that often fades. The post-DNC poll found that Democratic voter enthusiasm for Harris (90%) topped GOP enthusiasm for Trump (82%), another likely side effect from the convention. However, Harris’ job approval rating as vice president remains underwater despite the positive vibes at the DNC, with 51% disapproving and 42% approving. On the issues, voters still trust Trump to handle the economy (by 8 points) and inflation (by 5 points) better than Harris. Trump was also viewed by voters as more equipped than the vice president to handle the Israel-Hamas war and threats from Russia and China. Harris made gains with Black voters but the poll found her 83% support among voters who were Black still lower than the 91% support Biden pulled in 2020 election exit polls. The Wall Street Journal poll surveyed 1,500 registered voters between Aug. 24-28.","summary":"The Wall Street Journal’s latest national poll showed Harris leading Trump by 1 percentage point. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/us-news/harris-eeks-ahead-of-trump-nationally-in-post-dnc-2024-election-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-ilz3v7pja-1724968994459.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724954674&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qq06kXKU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:43:16","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":255231474,"title":"Sen.

JD Vance was booed by some during an appearance at the Boston firefighters union convention on Thursday. It was a mixed reception for the Republican vice presidential nominee, who stopped to address those in the crowd who cheered and those who booed him as he took the stage. “Semper Fi, guys, sounds like we’ve got some fans and some haters and that’s OK,” he said. “Let’s listen to what I have to say, here, I’ll make my pitch.” Speaking to hundreds of union members, Vance said he believes the Republican ticket, led by former President Donald Trump, deserves their support in November. “This may come as a shock to you, but once upon a time, I wasn’t a Trump guy either,” Vance said, “But trust me, the president never lets me forget it,” adding that a firefighter from Ohio was who helped him come around on Trump. “President Trump and I want exactly what you want, more jobs, rising wages, a secure border, safe streets, and an affordable country, where every child and every family can achieve their dreams” he said. Union members had mixed reactions after the speech. “I love him,” one member said. “But I love Trump too, he’s awesome, he’s good for the economy.” Another said, “At the end of the day, talk is cheap. There’s one party that aligns with working class people like police officers and firefighters and teachers and that’s the Harris-Walz campaign.” It’s unclear when union leadership will announce who they’re endorsing. Four years ago the union endorsed President Joe Biden. (Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television. All Rights Reserved.

F Kennedy Jr. spoke with TMZ on Tuesday regarding several recent events involving his wife, actress Cheryl Hines, and defended her against attacks from fellow actor Bradley Whitford, who chastised her online for standing by her husband as he endorsed the GOP candidate. Kennedy’s presidential bid was beset with challenges from its inception, as he struggled to get his name on the ballot in all 50 states. Teams had been collecting the required signatures from the electorate nationwide but a lack of enthusiasm about his candidacy and the general thought that he’d play spoiler in November led to him suspending his campaign on Friday, just after the Democratic National convention closed. Kennedy was quick to endorse Trump and Whitford was quick to berate Hines for standing in silence as this all unfolded. “Hey @CherylHines, way to stay silent while your lunatic husband throws his support behind the adjudicated rapist who brags about stripping women of their fundamental rights,” Whitford wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Speaking with TMZ by phone on Wednesday, Kennedy called this language from Whitford a “template for bullying” after noting that Hines is no supporter of Trump and his third presidential bid. “I had to suppress some strong feelings about that, Kennedy said. “You know, it is a template for bullying. Here you have a guy, instead of challenging me, he’s attacking my wife. Who would do that? What kind of person, what kind of man would do that? Why wouldn’t he talk to me directly?” Hines, he said, attended a meeting between Trump and Kennedy just after the former president was shot at a Pennsylvania rally in June. Kennedy’s wife, known to many for portraying a fictionalized version of herself for 12 seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm, had encouraged the meeting with Trump out of sympathy and not as a supporter. “She urged me to do that, and she did that out of compassion. It was an emotional night for our country. It was an emotional night for everyone, and she made the right judgment,” he declared. “She’s a lifelong Democrat, and the idea of me supporting Donald Trump as president is something that she would have never imagined, that she never wanted in her life. That is, I think, causing her a lot of discomfort,” he added. “And, you know, I’m very grateful to her.” Kennedy was also asked to account for statements he had previously made about Trump before entering his good graces last week. The political legacy, whose father was slain Sen. Robert Kennedy, has said Trump is “a threat to democracy, a bully, that he appealed to bigotry, hatred and xenophobia and prejudice,”; Kennedy was also reminded that he’d said that Trump “was a terrible president.” Facing his past remarks, Kennedy punted, telling TMZ that a 45-minute speech he’s previously given stated his evolution toward Trump’s ideas and policies. “That evolution is not something that I can distill or summarize in a minute,” Kennedy added. So far, Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump does not seem to be making a dent in polling numbers. According to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted from Aug. 22 to Aug. 26, Vice President Kamala Harris (46 percent) narrowly leads Trump (45 percent) among registered voters in a matchup that includes remaining third-party candidates.","summary":"Fresh off of drawing to a close his independent presidential run and joining forces with former President Donald Trump, Robert.

Harris spoke at a rally in Savannah as part of a swing through southern Georgia as she seeks to capitalize on the momentum she received after the Democratic National Convention and the fact she is closing the gap in multiple polls in Georgia and other swing states. Harris delivered her standard stump speech when protesters began to interrupt her. “Everyone has a right and should have their voices heard,” she told the audience. “I am speaking now, but on the subject, I will say this, the president and I are working around the clock. We've got to get a hostage deal done and get a ceasefire done now.” Harris has faced demonstrations from people critical of hers and President Joe Biden’s support for Israel during its war against Hamas in Gaza after the surprise attack on October 7, when the terror group killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. During a rally in Detroit earlier this month, Harris responded bluntly to hecklers who were chanting, “Kamala Kamala you can’t hide, we won’t vote for genocide.” “If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,” she told the demonstrators. Later, during a rally in Glendale, Arizona, she said the administration wanted a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. “Now is the time,” she said. “And the president and I are working around the clock every day to get that ceasefire deal done and bring the hostages home.” During the Democratic National Convention last week, many delegates who represented voters in Michigan, Minnesota and elsewhere who had voted “uncommitted” in the primaries pushed for Harris to call for a ceasefire and stop sending arms to Israel, which Harris did not agree to do. Later, pro-Gaza activists pushed for a Palestinian-American speaker at the convention, which did not happen. Harris mentioned Palestinian suffering in her speech when she accepted the Democratic nomination for president. “So many innocent lives lost,” she said in Chicago. “Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.” At the same time, Harris focused heavily on attacking Trump, who has also campaigned in Georgia and will hold a fundraiser with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, whom he had previously criticized. Harris will also conduct her first sit-down interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket tonight with her running mate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota.","summary":"Harris responded with her typical retort that ‘the president and I are working around the clock’ to get a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas done","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-gaza-protester-savannah-georgia-b2604167.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/29/22/h0xjr7r4-720.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tK4HGfy7-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:40:35","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":255229914,"title":"JD Vance Begs His Old Billionaire Boss Peter Thiel for Campaign Cash","text":"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is begging his billionaire former boss Peter Thiel to bankroll his bid for the White House.

Renewal of the US-China Science and Technology Agreement (STA), the first bilateral deal signed between the two countries in 1979, had been postponed twice since August 2023. The most recent six-month extension expired on Tuesday. A State Department official on Thursday said on background: “I don’t have anything additional to share at this time.” This followed word by the same official a day earlier that the two sides were “in communication” about the STA “including on the necessary guardrails around any such cooperation, strengthened provisions for transparency and scientific-data reciprocity”. “The United States remains committed to advancing and protecting US interests in science and technology,” the State Department official added. “We have nothing further to share about the status of the agreement at this time.” On Thursday, the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the lead-up to the deadline, the Chinese embassy in Washington told the Post that “China-US cooperation on science and technology is mutually beneficial”. “To my knowledge, the two sides have maintained communication about the renewal,” spokesman Liu Pengyu said last Thursday. Discussion of the treaty coincides with the US presidential race shifting into high gear ahead of the November 5 election. The race has seen Republicans accuse Democratic presidential nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, of being too close to Beijing. Just hours before the pact was about to expire on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy said it would “release related information at [an] appropriate time”. “China and the US side are keeping communication on this,” the embassy said late on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson said on background last Friday that the department was negotiating on behalf of the US government to “modernise” the agreement “to reflect the current status of the bilateral relationship”. “We are not prejudging the outcome,” the spokesperson. The discussion also comes amid simmering tensions on multiple fronts between the two economic superpowers This week National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met in Beijing with President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to stabilise bilateral relations tested by their differences over Taiwan, the South China Sea, tariffs and fentanyl. Originally signed by US President Jimmy Carter and Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping, the symbolically significant pact has been renewed every five years since it took effect, with the most recent renewal in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump. After August last year, when it was on the verge of lapsing, the two countries extended it twice, for six months each time, to negotiate renewal terms. In March, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved a bill to impose greater congressional scrutiny on future State Department efforts to enter, renew or extend any science and technology agreement with China. For decades, the existing agreement has fostered scientific collaboration by providing American and Chinese researchers financial, legal and political support. According to the Congressional Research Service, sub-agreements under the STA have encompassed research areas such as agriculture, energy, the environment, nuclear fusion and safety as well as earth, atmospheric, marine sciences and remote sensing. Its supporters contend the deal shields American researchers working in China and enables research in the US by granting access to crucial Chinese databases, especially in areas like health studies. But critics say China’s state supervision and control over local science and technology projects have allowed Beijing to exploit the STA. They claim Beijing can address scientific gaps, hone skills and capitalise on America’s decentralised academic landscape to predominate in sectors like electric vehicles and renewable energy. In June, the House select committee on China asked the Commerce department to provide information “to assess the damage already caused to US national security” caused by the STA. “We believe the US-PRC STA is a vector to give the PRC access to US dual-use research and presents a clear national security risk,” Republican lawmakers said in a letter. “The Biden administration must stop fuelling our own destruction and allow the STA to expire.” The agreement’s protracted renewal process after decades of uncontroversial renewals highlighted the complex new issues that have come between the two sides, according to Denis Simon of the Asian Pacific Studies Institute at Duke University. “Many of the central issues being discussed were simply not issues in 1979, such as data security and personal security,” said Simon. “The old STA had become almost obsolete, so renewal shifted to devising a new agreement that was more up to date and reflected the realities of 2024 and not the situation 40 years ago.” On Thursday, the US deputy assistant secretary for science and space at the State Department co-chaired a meeting with Japan’s ambassador for science and technology cooperation. They reviewed progress on cooperation in areas such as quantum, fusion and artificial intelligence and strengthened collaboration in emerging technologies including high-performance computing, according to the State Department.","summary":"Landmark deal dating to 1979 is said to shield American researchers working in mainland but critics say Beijing is exploiting its terms.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3276479/expiration-major-us-china-science-treaty-signals-deep-uncertainty-amid-high-tensions","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/30/676cdf07-676f-413f-a777-e130ebe16473_eed67d15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:37:22","author":"Holly Chik,Khushboo Razdan","authors":["Holly Chik","Khushboo Razdan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":255229812,"title":"ABBA Asks Donald Trump to Stop Using Their Songs, Trump Team Claims Permission","text":"NEW YORK – Swedish supergroup ABBA has asked Donald Trump to stop using their music at campaign rallies, but the Republican presidential nominee’s campaign says it has permission. “ABBA has recently discovered the unauthorized use of their music and videos at a Trump event through videos that appeared online,” said a statement to The Associated Press from the band, whose hits include “Waterloo,” “The Winner Takes It All” and “Money, Money, Money.” “As a result, ABBA and its representative has promptly requested the removal and deletion of such content. No request has been received; therefore, no permission or license has been granted.” A spokesman for the Trump campaign said it had obtained a license. “The campaign had a license to play ABBA music through our agreement with BMI and ASCAP,” the spokesperson told the AP. ABBA joins a long list of performers who’ve objected to Trump using their songs. Ahead of the 2020 election, that included Bruce Springsteen, Rihanna, Phil Collins, Pharrell, John Fogerty, Neil Young, Eddy Grant, Panic! at the Disco, R.E.M. and Guns N’ Roses. This cycle, Celine Dion has asked the candidate to stop using “My Heart Will Go On” and Beyoncé blocked Trump from using her song “Freedom” in a campaign video. In 2016, Adele asked Trump to quit playing her songs at political rallies. Campaigns don’t need an artist’s express permission to play their songs at rallies as long as the political organization or the venue has gotten what’s known as a blanket license from the performing rights organizations ASCAP and BMI. Swedish daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said its reporter in July attended a Trump rally in Minnesota where “The Winner Takes it All” was played. Universal Music in Sweden said videos had surfaced of ABBA’s music being played at at least one Trump event. ABBA, who have scored 20 songs in the Billboard Hot 100, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, released a comeback album, “Voyage,” in 2021.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – Swedish supergroup ABBA has asked Donald Trump to stop&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: ABBA Asks Donald Trump to Stop Using Their Songs, Trump Team Claims Permission first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/abba-asks-donald-trump-to-stop-using-their-songs-trump-team-claims-permission/","image":"https://www.ksat.com/resizer/Mh-9o6PnZD26I-V7jAVaWdo-Hkw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/A22EEGQ4L5CHVM44JK6V7PG6VU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 22:37:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.29}]}
