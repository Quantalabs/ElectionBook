What Trudeau did was prorogue parliament until March 4, which means it will not be in session, but will not be dissolved. During this period, the Liberal Party will select a new leader, after which Trudeau says he will finally depart from the scene, at least a couple of months from now. Yet Donald Trump wasted no time in commemorating his departure with — you guessed it — yet another call for Canada to become the 51st state of the United States of America.\n\nEarly on Monday afternoon, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State. The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned. If Canada merged with the U.S., there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them. Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!” \n\nAt this point, it’s hard to sustain the idea that Trump is just joking. This started out as a rhetorical jab, albeit one so sharp and stinging that it catapulted Trudeau into the downward spiral that culminated in his pending resignation, but now it looks increasingly as if he is serious. Fox News reported back in early December that during their first post-election meeting, Trump told Trudeau that “Canada has failed the U.S. border by allowing large amounts of drugs and people across the border, including illegal immigrants from over 70 different countries.” \n\nThe once-and-future president “became more animated when it came to the U.S. trade deficit with Canada, which he estimated to be more than $100 billion,” and told his vapid Canadian counterpart that “if Canada cannot fix the border issues and trade deficit, he will levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods on day one when he returns to office.” \n\nTrudeau immediately played the left’s only card: victimhood. He told Trump that he couldn’t impose such a tariff “because it would kill the Canadian economy completely.” To that, Trump shot back: “So your country can't survive unless it's ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion?” Trump “suggested to Trudeau that Canada become the 51st state, which caused the prime minister and others to laugh nervously.” Trump pushed on, telling Trudeau “that prime minister is a better title, though he could still be governor of the 51st state.”\n\nFox noted that “while sources say the exchange got many laughs, Trump delivered the message that he expected change by January 20.” Trudeau went away knowing very well that he wasn’t going to get away with playing the same game that he would have played with Obama or Biden. Neither of them would have threatened tariffs over the flow of illegal migrants and drugs into the United States in the first place, and if they had offered any criticism of Canadian policy at all, it would have been toothless rhetoric that would have been forgotten as soon as the meeting was over.\n\nSince then, Trump has repeated his call for Canada to become the 51st state several times. His Monday Truth Social post offered the fullest explanation yet of his rationale. Canada is a massive welfare case, and the U.S. can’t keep shelling out for it: “The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat.” If Canada is going to depend upon the U.S. for its very survival, then it should end the pretense and join the Union. \n\nTrump’s words will be again dismissed as the ravings of Bad Orange Man or a bad joke on Justin Trudeau that he insists, like your drunk uncle at Christmas dinner, on repeating over and over, but he has genuine considerations in mind. Whether by a formal merger or by means of economic hegemony, if the U.S. doesn’t get Canada, China likely will. The United States would be much stronger against the threat from China, and quell Chinese influence on its northern border, if Canada and the U.S. were to merge.\n\n Related: Canada, the Panama Canal, and Now Greenland. What’s Behind Trump’s Expansionist Rhetoric?\n\nThe same rationale underlies his oft-repeated calls for the acquisition of Greenland, which he also repeated on Monday, saying: “I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA.’ My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights. Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!” \n\nA United States plus Canada and Greenland would mean the end of Chinese adventurism in both areas. There is a method to Trump’s apparent madness. He is, as always, working with an eye toward doing what he has promised to do: making America great again.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/robert-spencer/2025/01/06/trump-reacts-to-trudeaus-resignation-and-yes-he-said-it-again-n4935729","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/273/8b6ffe39-8334-4d25-aec9-bcc9830fd930.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 01:07:13","author":"Robert Spencer","authors":["Robert Spencer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":278807444,"title":"U.S. Congress certifies Trump election victory for January 20 inauguration","text":"The U.S. Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's November election victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, clearing the way for him to be sworn in on January 20.\n\nThe certification of the election results on Monday (January 6, 2025) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia was accomplished in a brief, formal ceremony during a joint session of the House of Representatives and Senate. It was presided over by Ms. Harris, acting in her vice-presidential role as president of the Senate.\n\nThe quadrennial ritual stood in sharp contrast to four years ago when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-President Trump's 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nMr. Trump continues to falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud, and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harboured similar concerns until his November 5 defeat of Ms. Harris.\n\n\"Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. MAGA!\" Mr. Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday (January 6, 2025).\n\nThe joint session of Congress proceeded even as a winter storm hovered over the nation's capital, dropping about 15 cm of snow and snarling travel.\n\nThe final certification backed up preliminary findings that Mr. Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Ms. Harris's 226.\n\nRepublicans control White House, Congress\n\nRepublicans also captured a majority in the U.S. Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November's election, which will give Mr. Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nDemocrats did not try to block certification of Mr. Trump's victory on Monday (January 6, 2025).\n\n\"We must renew our commitment to safeguarding American democracy,\" No. 2 House Democrat Katherine Clark said in a statement earlier in the day. \"As elected leaders, our loyalty must be to the Constitution, first and always. We are here to honour the will of the people and the rule of law.\"\n\nSecurity inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Mr. Trump's swearing-in.\n\nThe Capitol grounds were ringed by metal fences hundreds of yards from the U.S. Capitol, and accessible only via checkpoints guarded by uniformed police officers.\n\nConvoys of black police vehicles were on hand, led by a 10-wheel Baltimore police mobile command centre. New York Police Department reinforcements were also patrolling the area.\n\nInside, extra teams of uniformed U.S. Capitol Police officers were checking IDs at entrance sites including doors and underground tunnels leading to the House and Senate chambers.\n\nMr. Trump has said he plans to pardon some of the more than 1,500 people charged with taking part in the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, when a mob fought with police, smashing its way in through windows and doors and chanting, \"Hang Mike Pence,\" referring to Mr. Trump's then-Vice President, in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Mr. Biden's victory.\n\nIn the 2021 melee at the Capitol, rioters surged past police barricades, assaulting about 140 officers and causing more than $2.8 million in damage. Multiple police officers who battled protesters died in the weeks that followed, some by suicide.\n\nAs a result of that day's violence, Congress passed legislation late in 2022 bolstering guardrails to ensure that the certification process is administered in a legal manner.\n\nMany of these changes were directly in response to Trump's actions leading up to and including January 6, 2021. For example, the new law asserts that the vice president's role is largely ceremonial.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-congress-certifies-trump-election-victory-for-january-20-inauguration/article69069919.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ova6tp/article69069921.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Congress_Electoral_College_66696.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 01:07:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.022},{"id":278807414,"title":"Canada’s Trudeau resigns as Liberal Party leader, spelling end to time in power","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday (January 6, 2025) announced his resignation in the face of rising discontent over his leadership, and after the abrupt departure of his finance minister signaled growing turmoil within his government.\n\nMr. Trudeau said it had become clear to him that he cannot “be the leader during the next elections due to internal battles.” He planned to stay on as Prime Minister until a new leader of the Liberal Party is chosen.\n\n“I don’t easily back down faced with a fight, especially a very important one for our party and the country. But I do this job because the interests of Canadians and the well being of democracy is something that I hold dear,” he said.\n\nAn official familiar with the matter said Parliament, which had been due to resume Jan. 27, will be suspended until March 24. The timing will allow for a Liberal Party leadership race. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.\n\nAll three main opposition parties have said they plan to topple the Liberal Party in a no-confidence vote when Parliament resumes, so a spring election to pick a permanent replacement was almost assured.\n\n“The Liberal Party of Canada is an important institution in the history of our great country and democracy. A new prime minister and leader of the Liberal Party will carry its values and ideals into that next election,” Mr. Trudeau said. “I am excited to see that process unfold in the months ahead.”\n\nMr. Trudeau came to power in 2015 after 10 years of Conservative Party rule, and had initially been hailed for returning the country to its liberal past. But the 53-year-old scion of one of Canada’s most famous prime ministers became deeply unpopular with voters in recent years over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing, and surging immigration.\n\nThe political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada internationally. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. — even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.\n\nCanada is a major exporter of oil and natural gas to the U.S., which also relies on its northern neighbor for steel, aluminum and autos.\n\nMr. Trudeau has kept publicly mum in recent weeks, despite intensifying pressure for him to step down.\n\n“His long silence following this political drama speaks volumes about the weakness of his current position,” said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nCanada’s former Finance Minister, Chrystia Freeland, announced her resignation from Trudeau’s Cabinet on Dec. 16., criticizing some of Trudeau’s economic priorities in the face of Trump’s threats. The move, which came shortly after the housing minister quit, stunned the country and raised questions about how much longer the increasingly unpopular Trudeau could stay in his job.\n\nMs. Freeland and Mr. Trudeau had disagreed about two recently announced policies: a temporary sales tax holiday on goods ranging from children’s clothes to beer, and plans to send every citizen a check for $250 Canadian ($174). Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Canada could not afford “costly political gimmicks” in the face of the tariffs threat.\n\n“Our country is facing a grave challenge,” Ms. Freeland wrote in her resignation letter. “That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.”\n\nMr. Trudeau had been planning to run for a fourth term in next year’s election, even in the face of rising discontent among Liberal Party members. The party recently suffered upsets in special elections in two districts in Toronto and Montreal that it has held for years. No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.\n\nAnd based on the latest polls, Mr. Trudeau’s chances for success looked slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the Conservatives 47% to 21%.\n\nOver nearly a decade in power, Mr. Trudeau embraced an array of causes favored by his liberal base. He spoke in favor of immigration at a time other countries were trying to tighten their borders. He championed diversity and gender equality, appointing a Cabinet that was equal parts men and women. He legalized cannabis.\n\nHis efforts to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental protection were criticized by both the right and left. He levied a tax on carbon emissions and rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get more of Alberta’s oil to international markets.\n\nFewer people died from COVID-19 in Canada than elsewhere and his government provided massive financial support. But animosity grew among those opposed to vaccine mandates. Flags with Mr. Trudeau’s name and expletives became a common sight in rural parts.\n\nA combination of scandal and unpopular policies damaged his prospects over time.\n\nMr. Trudeau’s father swept to power in 1968, and led Canada for almost 16 years, becoming a storied name in the country’s history, most notably by opening its doors wide to immigrants. Pierre Trudeau was often compared to John F. Kennedy and remains one of the few Canadian politicians who are recognized in America.\n\nTall and trim, with movie-star looks, Justin Trudeau channeled the star power — if not quite the political heft — of his father.\n\nHe became the second-youngest Prime Minister in Canada’s history, and rivals said his age was a liability when he first sought office. But he won a sweeping mandate in a come-from-behind victory in 2015.\n\nMr. Trudeau is a former teacher, nightclub bouncer and snowboard instructor who has three children with his now estranged wife, a former model and TV host.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/canadas-trudeau-announces-decision-to-resign-as-liberal-party-leader-spelling-end-to-time-in-power/article69069539.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/z6zqci/article69069704.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-01-06T161518Z_2084869554_RC2B4CAUT1W0_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-POLITICS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 01:07:13","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.04},{"id":278807402,"title":"U.S. to remove Indian entities from restricted lists: Jake Sullivan","text":"The United States will soon remove Indian scientific and nuclear entities from the “restricted lists” in order to “fully realise” the potential of the India-U.S. nuclear deal that was signed between Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush, visiting United States National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Monday (January 6, 2025). Speaking at the Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, Mr. Sullivan who paid his last visit to India before the swearing-in of President Donald Trump, presented the space and nuclear sectors as arenas of greater cooperation between the two sides.\n\n“So today I can announce that the U.S. is now finalising the necessary steps to remove long-standing regulations that have prevented civil nuclear cooperation between India’s leading nuclear entities and U.S. companies. The formal paper wok will be done soon,” said Mr. Sullivan declaring the initiative in a speech. He described the move by the Biden administration as an “an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for the Indian entities that have been on the restricted list of the United States”. He called upon the U.S. private sector and scientists and technologists to collaborate with Indian entities to “move civil nuclear cooperation” between the two countries.\n\n“Although former President Bush and former Prime Minister Singh laid out a vision of civil nuclear cooperation nearly twenty years ago, we are yet to fully realise it,” said Mr. Sullivan pitching for closer scientific collaboration between the two sides. Mr. Sullivan met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit. Following the meeting, Mr. Modi remarked, “The India-U.S. Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership has scaled new heights, including in the areas of technology, defence, space, biotechnology and Artificial Intelligence. Look forward to building upon this momentum in ties between our two democracies for the benefit of our people and global good.”\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs in a statement announced that Mr. Sullivan met his Indian counterpart, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and briefed him about the “updates brought out by the Biden administration to U.S. missile export control policies under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) that will boost U.S. commercial space cooperation with India.”\n\n“Reflecting the progress the United States and India have made – and will continue to make – as strategic partners and countries with a shared commitment to peaceful nuclear cooperation, NSA Sullivan announced U.S. efforts to finalize necessary steps to delist Indian nuclear entities, which will promote civil nuclear cooperation and resilient clean energy supply chains,” said the Ministry in its statement.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-finalising-necessary-steps-to-remove-barriers-in-indo-us-civil-nuclear-cooperation-says-jake-sullivan/article69068006.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ljqxdk/article69068142.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Screenshot%20905.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 01:07:13","author":"Kallol Bhattacherj","authors":["Kallol Bhattacherj"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.325},{"id":278806290,"title":"About That Video of Deb Fischer's Husband and Kamala Harris That's Circulating on Social Media","text":"Social media platforms can be bowls of dumb on any given day (that goes double for BlueSky), and Monday was no exception, with the certification of Donald Trump's November election victory bringing out some fresh cray-cray from Democrats and their media allies.\n\nThough the President-Elect certainly does bring out the worst in his critics, it wasn't Trump himself some of them had in mind when they began circulating a video on social media of Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) at the ceremonial swearing-in event from Friday, being sworn into office for her third term by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIt wasn't Fischer herself who was the object of their ire. It was her husband, Bruce, who was with her for the ceremony.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kamala Harris Takes Nasty Swipe at Bernie Sanders While Swearing Him in - He Claps Back\n\nVideo from the moment showed Harris extending her hand out to shake Bruce Fischer's and him not taking it, and also that he only briefly looked her in the eye as he said \"thank you.\"\n\nSoon after the clip began making the rounds, \"news\" outlets like Newsweek, The Grio, and HuffPost pounced and seized, with The Grio predictably suggesting racism and sexism were at play and Newsweek and HuffPost declaring, also without evidence, that Mr. Fischer \"refused\" to shake the twice-failed Democrat presidential candidate's hand.\n\nIt prompted reactions from leftists and NeverTrump sellouts like disgraced Lincoln Project senior advisor Stuart Stevens, who declared that \"The correct term for this is 'trash.' That is the essence of MAGA. Anger, resentment, bitterness. Graciousness and civility is a foreign land never visited.\"\n\nWhat did the critics leave out, though? The fact that Bruce Fischer was holding a Bible with one hand, and a cane with the other. In fact, if you look closely, it's in the very video that is circulating courtesy of a guy with an incredibly ironic Twitter/X name considering the subject matter:\n\nImages from their meeting make it even clearer:\n\nWe anxiously await apologies from those who rushed to judgment:\n\nI saw some folks suggest that Fischer could have shaken her hand after he gave the Bible back to the Senator. But the full video clip shows that Mr. Fischer looked a little unsteady on his feet and was watching the floor, perhaps to make sure he didn't fall:\n\nSpeaking from my role as a caregiver, I watched my dad constantly look down when he used his cane over the years and then later his walker, terrified he was going to fall.

Sentencing","text":"Manhattan Judge Juan Merchan denied President-elect Donald Trump’s request on Monday to halt the sentencing in his hush-money case. Trump's legal team filed a motion, called an Article 78 motion, earlier in the day to delay his sentencing, which is currently scheduled for January 10 at 9:30 a.m.—just ten days before he is inaugurated as the 47th president on January 20.\n\n“Defendant's motion for a stay of these proceedings, including the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, is hereby DENIED,\" Merchan wrote in his decision. “This Court has considered Defendant's arguments in support of his motion and finds that they are for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past. Further, this Court finds that the authorities relied upon in the instant motion by the Defendant are for the most part, factually distinguishable from the actual record or legally inapplicable.” \n\nThe order was issued after Trump filed a lawsuit against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Judge Juan Merchan, challenging the judge's rejection of his motions for presidential immunity. In the lawsuit, the president-elect’s legal team contended that Judge Merchan overstepped his authority by rejecting Trump’s claim of presidential immunity in his ruling last week. The attorneys also objected to the judge’s order requiring Trump to appear for sentencing—either in person or virtually—on January 10, following his conviction in May.\n\nDefense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove reacted to the news, saying “forcing a President to continue to defend a criminal case -- potentially through trial or, even more dramatically here, through sentencing and judgment -- while the appellate courts are still grappling with his claim of immunity would, in fact, force that President 'to answer for his conduct in court' before his claim of immunity is finally adjudicated.” \n\nTrump spokesperson and incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital demanded an “immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and all of the remaining Witch Hunts.”","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2025/01/06/judge-merchan-denies-trumps-request-to-delay-sentencing-n2650120","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/351/abe10333-78a0-4f97-ac8b-1812b636064c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:55:13","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":278805542,"title":"New York judge finds Giuliani in civil contempt in 2020 election workers' case","text":"NEW YORK--A judge on Monday found Rudy Giuliani to be in civil contempt of court in a case brought by two Georgia election workers that the former New York City Mayor falsely accused of trying to help steal the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nU.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation judgment.\n\n\"The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance,\" Liman said.\n\nThe contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once known as \"America's Mayor\" for his response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying that they tried to help steal the 2020 election.\n\nGiuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes.Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020 election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona that he aided Trump's failed attempt to overturn his loss.\n\nIn July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic records to the two election workers. A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment.\n\nLiman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment Giuliani would face for contempt. But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he owns.\n\nLiman said he would presume Giuliani's lack of response suggested the answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could be turned over.\n\nLawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment, title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is still pending.","url":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/people/new-york-judge-finds-giuliani-in-civil-contempt-in-2020-election-workers-case","image":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/images/2025/01/06/giuliani_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:53:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sx","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":278805538,"title":"Justin Trudeau to resign as PM after nine years, blames party infighting","text":"OTTAWA--Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he would step down in the coming months after nine years in power, bowing to pressure from lawmakers alarmed by his Liberal Party's miserable showing in pre-election polls.\n\nA subdued Trudeau, among the most prominent progressive leaders in the world, told a press conference that he would stay on both as prime minister and Liberal leader until the party chooses a new chief within months.\n\n\"This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,\" Trudeau said.\n\nHe also announced parliament would be prorogued, or suspended, until March 24. That means an election is unlikely before May at the earliest, so Trudeau will remain in charge - at least initially - of dealing with the threat of crippling tariffs once U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nThe next election must be held by Oct. 20 and polls show voters angry over high prices and a shortage of affordable housing will elect the opposition Conservatives and hand the Liberals a resounding defeat, no matter who leads the party.In recent weeks unhappy Liberal lawmakers openly called on Trudeau to quit after his finance minister resigned and accused him of \"political gimmicks\" to win back voters.\n\n\"I am not someone who backs away from a fight, particularly when a fight is as important as this one is,\" Trudeau told reporters outside his residence as temperatures dipped to minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit).\"But I have always been driven by my love for Canada ... and it has become obvious to me with the internal battles that I cannot be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election.\"\n\nTrudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 with a message of hope and \"sunny ways\" and won reelection twice, becoming one of Canada's longest-serving prime ministers and winning plaudits from progressives for his focus on gender parity policies.But his popularity started dipping two years ago as prices of groceries and housing rose in the post-COVID period, and his fortunes never recovered.\n\nAn Ipsos Canada poll released on Dec. 22 showed the Conservatives had 45% support among decided voters, with the Liberals and the left-leaning New Democrats on 20% each. Such a result on election day would mean a huge Conservative victory.\n\nParliament was originally due to resume on Jan. 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down Trudeau's minority government as soon as they could. But with parliament returning only on March 24, the earliest they could present a non-confidence motion would be some time in May.\n\nTrudeau said he had asked the Liberal Party to set in motion a leadership contest but did not say how long it would take. A new party leader would become prime minister immediately, and lead the Liberals into the next election.\n\nShachi Kurl, president of pollster Angus Reid, said that while a new leader might be able to stem losses, the Liberal party was still in trouble.\"There is a fatigue factor. This is a government in its 10th year - at some point the milk just expires,\" Kurl said in a phone interview. \"I think the milk has turned pretty sour.\"\n\nAlthough proroguing parliament would allow the Liberals to choose a leader without worrying about an election derailing the process, the move could still hurt them with voters, said Philippe Lagasse, an associate professor and constitutional expert at Ottawa's Carleton University.\"I think people are ready for an election. They want to move on - this is just delaying it,\" he said.","url":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/international/justin-trudeau-to-resign-as-pm-after-nine-years-blames-party-infighting","image":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/images/2025/01/06/trudeau_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:53:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sx","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":278805540,"title":"US port labour talks resume with spotlight on automation","text":"NEW YORK--Contract talks covering 45,000 dockworkers on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are set to restart on Tuesday in a labour dispute that will help set the pace of automation at ports stretching from Maine to Texas.\n\nThe International Longshoremen's Association wants to eliminate past labour contract concessions on automation - notably the use of semi-automated cranes that stack containers on docks - arguing they pose a threat to jobs.\n\nThe United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) employer group, meanwhile, argues those rail-mounted gantry cranes are key to remaining competitive as ports, most notably in China, lead the way on automation.\n\nIf the two sides do not reach a deal by Jan. 15, workers at container ports that handle more than half of U.S. ocean imports could start a strike just days before President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A three-day strike by the ILA last October triggered a spike in shipping prices and cargo backlogs at the 36 affected ports. \n\nThe union and employers, which have issued dueling statements in recent weeks, did not comment separately for this article.\n\nNearly two decades ago, port employers convinced an earlier group of ILA leaders that using semi-automated cranes at what is now known as Norfolk International Terminals would eventually help create thousands of new jobs, the union said.Those cranes replaced equipment like specialized human-operated forklifts known as top loaders, and have been introduced at a handful of other U.S. port terminals since.\n\nThe cranes can handle bigger container stacks than traditional equipment, expanding capacity on the dock, and can work overnight arranging containers for pickup the next day, with little human involvement. Placing containers on the trailers of trucks waiting to whisk them away is still handled by joystick-wielding human operators.\n\n\"What seemed like a win for one port turned out to be the project that is becoming the model for automation that could potentially chip away at many jobs at almost every other terminal along the East and Gulf Coasts,\" Dennis Daggett, the ILA's executive vice president, said in December.\n\nUnion President Harold Daggett, Dennis Daggett's father, has called for \"absolute airtight\" contract language stating that there will be no automation or semi-automation at port terminals.\n\nEmployers, who recently battled the ILA over the installation of automated truck entry gates, say the nation's economic growth relies on faster and more efficient ports. \"Modern technology is proven to dramatically increase the amount of cargo that can be moved through a port,\" the maritime employers group said in December. \"This can, and will, be done in a way that not only protects jobs, but adds new jobs as our operations expand.\"\n\nThe group includes terminal operators like APM, owned by Danish container carrier Maersk, as well as the U.S. arms of other major carriers like China's COSCO Shipping and Switzerland's MSC.They agreed to a 62% wage increase over the next six years to end the October strike and underscored that the pay rise is contingent on finalizing all outstanding issues - including automation.\n\nU.S. port executives and unions say there are many other ways to boost port efficiency, including by sharing incoming cargo data to match staffing with demand, and installing cranes that can pluck two containers off a ship at a time instead of one. While automation has increased productivity in factories that turn out cars and other goods, early results suggest that benefits to seaports could be much more limited.\n\nMajor export ports in China have relatively stable cargo flows that are more suited to automation, but top U.S. ports in Los Angeles/Long Beach and New York/New Jersey have big swings in volume.Fixed automated systems cannot expand and contract with cargo flows like human crews and may not reduce labour costs enough to justify hefty equipment costs, authors of a 2021 report from the International Transport Forum at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.\n\nThere are just 53 container port terminals around the world, or about 4% of global capacity, with some form of automation, they said. \"Automated ports are generally not more productive than their conventional counterparts.\"","url":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/business/us-port-labour-talks-resume-with-spotlight-on-automation","image":"https://www.thedailyherald.sx/images/2025/01/06/usa ports labor_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:53:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sx","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":278806872,"title":"Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn reflects on Jan. 6 four years later","text":"Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn reflects on Jan. 6 four years later\n On Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol Hill police officers were on the front lines as supporters of then-President Donald Trump breached the Capitol building.

She said their mission was “to discuss whether such an inclusive political process is possible and whether human rights can truly be guaranteed”.\n\n“The entire question of lifting sanctions is tied to this,” she said.\n\nWestern sanctions were part of an effort to pressure al-Assad to change his actions, and Western policymakers argue that they will be necessary to do the same with the new administration. But many Syrians believe that the sanctions threaten to doom Syria’s political transition as it struggles to recover from years of destruction and isolation.\n\nThis is all you need to know about Western sanctions and how they affect Syria.\n\nHow many times has Syria been sanctioned?\n\nIn 1979, the US designated Syria as a state sponsor of “terrorism” while al-Assad’s father, Hafez, was in power. The regime was hit with additional targeted sanctions in 2004 for its prolonged occupation in Lebanon and for what Washington termed its support of “terrorism”.\n\nShortly after mass protests erupted against Bashar al-Assad in 2011, the US and EU imposed targeted sanctions against a handful of government officials in response to the brutal repression of the opposition.\n\nThe US and EU applied more sprawling sanctions as Syria slid deeper into turmoil, hitting the central bank and electricity and energy sectors.\n\nThese sanctions prevented the government from buying or trading money to stabilise its currency, keeping the lights on in much of the country and importing almost any form of technology.\n\nThe US then passed the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act in 2019, which effectively banned states and private businesses from doing business with al-Assad’s government.\n\nIn addition, the US, EU and the United Nations Security Council have designated HTS a “terrorist” group due to its former links to al-Qaeda, which continue to make Western powers nervous about lifting sanctions.\n\nDo these sanctions still apply?\n\nThe Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act and HTS’s “terrorist” designation are the most debilitating, according to Jerome Drevon, an expert on Syria with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nThe former, he said, indirectly impacted all layers of Syria’s economy by effectively stopping the country from exporting or importing goods and raw materials.\n\nThe “terrorist” designation on HTS has a similar effect, he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Any transaction or investment in the country linked to the government [of HTS] … can be seen through the lens of supporting terrorism,” explained Drevon.\n\nDo the sanctions harm aid operations?\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch (HRW), the US and the EU have issued a number of exemptions in order to sustain relief operations, yet sanctions still have a profound impact on aid groups.\n\nAid groups often have to navigate costly bureaucratic hurdles to ensure banks and exporters are not violating US or EU sanctions, which carry steep fines and the risk of jail terms.\n\nThese obstacles often lead to prolonged delays of aid deliveries inside Syria. Even worse, the perceived risk of violating sanctions – even if there is an exemption – has a chilling effect that acutely limits the aid response.\n\nMany banks and private companies prefer not to cooperate with aid agencies even when they are reassured they won’t be violating US and EU sanctions, said HRW.\n\n“Primate parties and financial institutions often avoid dealing, directly or indirectly, with Syrian individuals or entities even in non-sanctioned sectors,” HRW wrote in a report published last year.\n\nShould sanctions be removed?\n\nThe new Syrian administration has urged the US and others to lift sanctions, saying that the move would be vital to allowing Syria to rebuild itself.\n\nDrevon argued that most of the sanctions should be removed.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that the vast majority of the sanctions Syria is inheriting today were imposed to punish the al-Assad regime.\n\nThose sanctions should be lifted, he said, now that the regime is gone.\n\nThe sanctions risk isolating Syria and forcing more civilians to pick up arms and tap into the illicit economy if viable alternatives are not available, warned Drevon.\n\n“Sanctions threaten the destabilisation of the country in the mid-term,” he told Al Jazeera. “And, indeed, we have to imagine to what extent armed groups could pop up in different areas of the country and get involved in smuggling and the black market to make a living out of it.”\n\nIs it too late to lift sanctions?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nThe US has made a move to issue waivers to allow aid groups and private entities to work around the sanctions and scale up relief efforts in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAn advocate who did not wish to be named told Al Jazeera that based on conversations held with members of the US administration, the suspension of sanctions would be “broad” and effectively permit direct transactions with the current authorities.\n\nDrevon, from ICG, believes the suspension of sanctions would also effectively enable a number of business transactions to be conducted with the government.\n\nThe suspension will last for about six months, and then the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump will decide whether or not to keep or lift sanctions on Syria.\n\nDrevon said the US move is a good first step, yet more needs to be done to stabilise Syria throughout its delicate transition.\n\n“You can suspend sanctions, but it won’t necessarily incentivise the private sector to invest,” Drevon told Al Jazeera.“To what extent can anyone make long-term investments if nobody knows whether the suspension will last a long time?”","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/how-are-western-sanctions-affecting-syrias-post-assad-transition/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/01/AFP__20250103__36RX8GV__v5__HighRes__TopshotSyriaFranceGermanyPoliticsDiplomacy-1735919689-Thaco6.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07

the United States has found Rudy Giuliani, an ally of President-elect Donald Trump, in contempt of court for his failure to fully respond to requests about his assets.\n\nMonday was the second day of Giuliani’s contempt hearing, and US District Judge Lewis J Liman ultimately ruled that he “willfully violated a clear and unambiguous order of this court”.\n\nIt was the latest chapter in an ongoing civil case that saw Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, liable for defamation over allegations made after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn December 2023, a jury in Washington, DC, determined that Giuliani should pay $73m in compensation and $75m as punishment to two election workers he falsely accused of tampering with the vote.\n\nGiuliani had echoed Trump’s own unfounded claims that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread election fraud.\n\nAccording to lawyers, Giuliani’s allegations made the two election workers, mother Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, the target of repeated harassment and death threats.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Liman said Giuliani “blew past” a deadline on December 20 to provide details about his condominium in Palm Beach, Florida, that could be used as an asset to pay the penalties.\n\nLawyers for Moss and Freeman have also accused Giuliani of ignoring their requests for information as they attempt to collect the money owed.\n\nFor example, they said that Giuliani had indeed turned over a Mercedes-Benz car to authorities, as well as a New York apartment, but that he failed to provide the documents needed to monetise them.\n\nThey also alleged that Giuliani had not handed over sport memorabilia, watches and money from his “nonexempt cash accounts” that could be used to pay the multimillion-dollar penalty.\n\nMonday’s decision centred in large part on the Palm Beach condo, which Giuliani has claimed as his primary residence, in an attempt to protect it from seizure.\n\nBut Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the mother-daughter election workers, has accused Giuliani of withholding documentation that could show Palm Beach was not his permanent home — thereby making it another possible source of assets for the penalty.\n\nHowever, Giuliani’s lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, argued that the timeframe was too tight to deliver all the information needed — though he emphasised that Giuliani did try.\n\n“There’s been substantial compliance,” Cammarata said. “There is no defiance to the court.”\n\nGiuliani himself acknowledged he was hesitant to turn over some documents, fearing the requests were too broad or even a legal “trap”.\n\nHe also cited the heavy toll exacted by the numerous legal cases he faces.\n\nIn Georgia, for instance, Giuliani is part of a stalled but ongoing criminal case, accusing Trump and his allies of leading a criminal enterprise to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, the former mayor is part of another criminal indictment, likewise for spreading false election claims.\n\nThe 80-year-old Giuliani estimated that the competing demands made it “impossible to function in an official way” a third of the time. He said he had not “willfully disobeyed” any court orders.\n\nBut Judge Liman appeared to dismiss the argument that Giuliani was simply overburdened.\n\n“The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance,” Liman said.","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/ex-new-york-mayor-and-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-found-in-contempt-of-court/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/01/2024-09-08T031811Z_1452344555_RC2G49AGCUI4_RTRMADP_3_VENEZUELA-ELECTION-1725768696-SusjFp.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:41:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":278804048,"title":"Justin Trudeau announces resignation, pauses Parliament","text":"Following more than a year of plummeting poll numbers and surging pressure from within his own caucus to step aside, Justin Trudeau told Canadians Monday that he will resign as Liberal leader and prime minister as soon as a new leader is chosen.\n\n“This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,” a teary-eyed Trudeau said outside his official residence in Ottawa Monday morning.\n\nTrudeau said he had reflected on his political future over the holidays and told his kids about his decision over dinner Sunday.\n\nHe also said he met with Gov. Gen. Mary Simon on Monday morning and that she has agreed to his request to prorogue Parliament until March 24.\n\nCalls for him to step aside have been gaining steam for months but internal pressure from his own caucus rose to new heights after Chrystia Freeland quit as minister of finance and deputy prime minister on Dec. 16 after Trudeau had informed her he was going to move her out of the finance portfolio.\n\nHer departure, hours before she was to table the fall economic statement in the House of Commons sent shock waves through the government and the party.\n\nIt’s the first time the prime minister has taken questions from media since Freeland stepped down from cabinet last month, although he has limited his public appearances throughout the past year as pressure mounted against him.\n\nQuestions about Trudeau’s future have been swirling since support for his party began to tumble in 2023. The Liberals have trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points for more than a year now.\n\nHe said he asked for Parliament to be prorogued because the House of Commons has been paralyzed for months through obstruction and needs a reset. Proroguing Parliament will put the legislature on pause for two months and wipe clear the current slate of legislation and delay opportunities for non-confidence votes that could trigger an election.\n\n“It’s time for the temperature to come down, for people to have a fresh start in parliament to be able to navigate through these complex times domestically and internationally,” he said. “Removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal party should also decrease the level of polarization we’re seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics.”\n\nThe House of Commons had been scheduled to return Jan. 27 but the Conservatives intended to begin pushing a new non-confidence vote in a committee as early as this week.\n\nIn the meantime, Trudeau said he asked Liberal party president Sachit Mehra Sunday night to immediately launch a leadership race ahead of the next election.\n\nMehra said in a statement Monday that he will call a national board meeting this week to begin the “nation-wide democratic process of selecting a new leader of the party.”\n\nThe next election has to be held by October of this year, but an earlier vote appears much more likely.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre sought to immediately cast this as a desperate political move by a sputtering Liberal party, whose MPs stood by their leader right up until he cratered in the polls and was no longer a viable candidate.\n\n“Their only objection is that he is no longer popular enough to win an election and keep them in power,” Poilievre said in a statement. “They want to protect their pensions and paycheques by sweeping their hated leader under the rug months before an election to trick you, and then do it all over again.”\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also said this move changes nothing in the political landscape as Canadians struggle with the high cost of living the government has failed to fix.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who leads the Liberals,” Singh said in a statement. “They don’t deserve another chance.”\n\n\r\n@todayinbc BREAKING NEWS: Justin Trudeau has announced he will resign as prime minister and Liberal party leader following a leadership contest. Speaking outside his residence in Ottawa, Trudeau confirmed Governor General Mary Simon has agreed to prorogue Parliament until March 24. He has asked Liberal party president Sachit Mehra to launch a leadership race immediately. Trudeau stated Canadians deserve a real choice in the next election.

The date hasn’t been set but Trudeau also prorogued Parliament until March 24.\n\nTrump reiterated his rhetoric about Canada joining the U.S., claiming there’d be no tariffs, lower taxes and more security. He posted, “Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!”\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, described Trudeau as a “stalwart friend” to the United States.\n\nSpokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force 1 Monday that President Joe Biden was grateful for Trudeau’s partnership and “commitment to defending North America from the geopolitical threats of the 21st century.”\n\nTrump’s response is in keeping with his efforts to troll Trudeau and Canada since winning the election in November.\n\nThe president-elect has called Trudeau “governor” and repeated the 51st-state dig since the prime minister travelled to have dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in November.\n\n“Trump will take credit for anything and will spin anything into an opportunity to make himself look better,” said Laura Dawson, an expert on Canada-U. S. relations and the executive director of the Future Borders Coalition.\n\nBut experts says the change in Canadian leadership could not come at a worse moment for the bilateral relationship with the U.S.\n\nTrudeau’s decision, while not unexpected after weeks of growing pressure from his own caucus, brings instability to Ottawa just as Canada is trying to tamp down Trump’s threat of devastating tariffs.\n\n“To be blunt, I don’t think a leadership change could come at a worse moment in our bilateral relationship,” said Fen Osler Hampson, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa and co-chair of the Expert Group on Canada-U.S. Relations.\n\n“We are staring down the barrel of a gun with Donald Trump’s threats to impose 25 per cent tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The key question obviously is: Who speaks for Canada?”\n\nThe date hasn’t been set for a leadership race but Trudeau also prorogued Parliament until March 24, and many expect a new Liberal leader to be in place before then.\n\nTrudeau said he would step aside because the internal conflict within his party over his leadership had become a distraction and Canadians deserve a clear choice in the next election.\n\nTrump’s apparent jokes aside, the president-elect’s actions could have real consequences for Canada. Trump threatened to implement damaging tariffs against America’s closest neighbours on Day 1 of his administration unless the two countries stop the flow of migrants and illegal drugs into the U.S.\n\nCanada subsequently announced a series of measures to beef up the border with a $1.3-billion package in response to the threat. But Trump has not said if he will pause the tariffs.\n\nThe Republican has also indicated his intention to make changes to the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement. It’s likely that work will begin sometime this year, ahead of the official trade pact review in 2026.\n\nTrudeau attended a meeting Monday of the cabinet committee he re-established immediately after Trump’s re-election. Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who chairs that committee, has travelled to Florida twice in recent months to meet with Trump and his team.\n\nTrudeau said the Liberal government will remain focused on fighting for Canadian interests during a leadership race that could include cabinet ministers who have been working on the Canada-U.S. file. LeBlanc and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly are both considered possibilities to run.\n\n“I can assure you that the tools and the need to stand up for Canadians, to protect Canadians in their interests and continue to fight for the economy, is something everyone in this government will be singularly focused on,” Trudeau said outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa.\n\nDawson was less optimistic. Ottawa was already lagging in its response to concerns over the relationship with Canada’s largest trading partner, she said. More than 77 per cent of Canadian exports go to the U.S.\n\n“Now having Ottawa going from moving very slow to what looks like a full stall until March (2025), we really can’t afford to have this gap in leadership that lasts for so long,” Dawson said.\n\nObservers also say Trump only negotiates with people who have power and Trudeau is essentially a lame-duck leader. Hampson said Trump will not “waste his time with Ottawa.”\n\nThat means, Hampson said, premiers are in a position where they will have to carry more of the bilateral burden, and a unified approach is critical.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have already made the rounds on American news stations, facing some criticism for going against the messages Ottawa would have preferred to send.\n\nOn Monday, Smith called on federal parties to force an election at the first available opportunity. She posted on social media that Canadians deserve a prime minister and federal government with a clear mandate “to negotiate with the incoming U.S. president and his administration on one of the most important international negotiations we have ever faced as a country.”\n\nFord said he still wants to sit down with Trudeau and the rest of the country’s premiers to strategize on the tariff threat, describing the moment as “all hands on deck.”\n\n“We need the prime minister to continue doing his job — prorogation doesn’t mean vacation,” Ford said Monday.","url":"https://www.saanichnews.com/national-news/trump-says-trudeau-resigned-over-tariff-threat-takes-another-51st-state-shot-7743030","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2025/01/web1_20250106130112-2025010613014-7756dd71256199dcdcc851abc1c91b829298de8a7ae511e3dc31d0b870a18a39.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:41:12","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":278803892,"title":"Biden bans offshore drilling across vast area of US","text":"US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of America’s coastline, weeks before Donald Trump takes office.\n\nThe ban covers the entire Atlantic coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific coast off California, Oregon and Washington and a section of the Bering Sea off Alaska.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of last-minute climate policy actions by the Biden administration ahead of Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to “unleash” domestic fossil fuel production in a bid to lower gas costs, despite the US already seeing record high extraction rates.\n\nBiden said in a statement: “My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs.\n\n“It is not worth the risks.”\n\nTrump has pledged to reverse Biden’s conservation and climate change policies when he takes office later this month. However, the new ban does not have an end date and could be difficult for the Republican to overturn.\n\nBiden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling.\n\nThe law, however, does not grant them the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling.\n\nTrump – despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line “Drill, baby, drill” during campaigning – has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020.\n\nAt the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden’s decision will protect the same area with no expiry date.\n\nThe new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters.\n\nAfter it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump’s incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it “a disgraceful decision”.\n\nShe said the move was “designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices”.\n\nEnvironmental groups, however, welcomed the move.\n\nJoseph Gordon, from conservation organisation Oceana, said: “This is an epic ocean victory.\n\n“Our treasured coastal communities are now safeguarded for future generations.”\n\nAn oil and gas industry trade group said Biden’s decision would harm American energy security and should be reversed by Congress.\n\nMike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said: “We urge policymakers to use every tool at their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.”\n\nIn 2017, during his first term in office, Trump tried to reverse former President Barack Obama’s protection of 125 million acres (50.6 million hectares) of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.\n\nTwo years later, a US District Court ruled that the act did not allow a president to reverse decisions of previous administrations – meaning Trump could not revoke Obama’s protections.\n\nIt is expected that Trump – whose inauguration ceremony takes place on 20 January – will still seek to challenge Biden’s move. A final legal decision could be made by the Supreme Court, which currently has a majority of Republican judges.\n\nEnvironmentalists and Democrats had been calling on Biden to introduce the ban because of concerns that any new drilling would threaten US ambitions to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change.\n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that global oil and gas demand needs to fall by 5% annually to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to help avoid the most damaging impacts.

He said he had not “willfully disobeyed” any court orders.\n\nBut Judge Liman appeared to dismiss the argument that Giuliani was simply overburdened.\n\n“The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance,” Liman said.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/ex-new-york-mayor-and-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-found-in-contempt-of-court/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2024/12/2024-10-14T213131Z_358278554_RC2LKAAKJ6KH_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-CANADA-1733697980-Z9PrsA.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:41:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":278806876,"title":"2024 election certification goes smoothly without violence or disruption","text":"2024 election certification goes smoothly without violence or disruption\n Congress certified President-elect Donald Trump as the winner of the 2024 presidential election on Monday.

All sought damages under a little-used federal law, the Anti-Terrorism Act, that allows American victims of foreign terror groups to seize the assets of their victimizers.\n\nThe latest lawsuit alleges that security officials under the command of Maduro subjected the men to a pattern of torture — waterboarding, electrocution, threats of rape with a nightstick, mind-altering medications and the repeated use of a cramped cell nicknamed “El Tigrito” — that is also being looked at by prosecutors from the International Criminal Court.\n\n“The kidnapping, torture and ransoming of American citizens was part of a continuous and systematic scheme to coerce the United States government into policy concessions, the end of an oil embargo, and prisoner swaps,” attorneys for Heath and Khan argue in the 87-page complaint.\n\nAmong the other 17 named defendants are Maduro’s defense minister, attorney general and interior minister as well as state-run oil and gold-mining companies.\n\nHeath, a former U.S. Marine corporal from Tennessee and onetime U.S. security consultant in Afghanistan, was arrested in 2020 at a roadblock in Venezuela. Authorities charged him with terrorism after allegedly finding weapons and a satellite phone in his possession. Maduro said he was in the country surveilling oil refineries as a spy for then-President Donald Trump.\n\nHeath’s family said he was stuck in Colombia when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down air travel, leaving him stranded. He crossed the border into Venezuela in the hope of taking a short boat ride to Aruba, where a trawler he fixed up to start a chartering business was docked, according to the complaint.\n\nKhan was working in Colombia after graduating from college in Florida when he fell in love with a Venezuelan woman who invited him to meet her family. He was detained in January 2022 while crossing the border with his girlfriend and her father on a motorized canoe as instructed by the woman’s brother, a Venezuelan national guardsman. He was later charged with crimes including terrorism and human trafficking.\n\nThe U.S. government determined both men were wrongfully detained on false charges. Heath and Khan were released — after being held 752 and 259 days respectively — in October 2022 along with five U.S. oil executives in exchange for two nephews of first lady Cilia Flores jailed in the U.S. on narcotics convictions.\n\nVenezuela’s government did not immediately comment on the lawsuit when contacted by The Associated Press but has long denied it targets Americans for imprisonment.\n\nOther Americans who have been imprisoned in Venezuela have won major judgments against Maduro and his inner circle on similar legal grounds.\n\nIn 2022, a federal judge in Miami awarded $73 million in damages to the family of a prominent opponent of Maduro who died while in custody after inexplicably falling from the 10th floor of a building belonging to the SEBIN political police. And last year an exiled Venezuelan lawyer won $153 million after he was lured back home because his father had been kidnapped, only to end up imprisoned himself on trumped-up charges of working as a “financial terrorist.”\n\nAs in the earlier cases, Heath and Khan in their lawsuit accused Maduro of controlling the “Cartel of the Suns,” a purported drug-smuggling ring involving top Venezuelan officials and guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia allegedly flooding the U.S. with cocaine.\n\nBut collecting those large rewards has proven daunting. Neither Maduro nor any of his close aides are known to have properties or bank accounts in the U.S. under their name. Whatever wealth officials have stolen is more likely to be held by a myriad of front men whose assets are hard to trace and seize.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Zuckerberg is among the tech titans who have dined with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago since the election. Last week Meta named Joel Kaplan, a veteran company executive and Republican who once worked in George W. Bush's White House, its head of global policy.\n\nWhite is a longtime friend of Trump who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer and appeared in Trump's first TikTok video. On election night, White joined Trump on stage at his victory party, thanking many of the podcasters and online influencers who, along with UFC, have been credited with boosting the president-elect's appeal among young men.\n\nWhite and Zuckerberg, who has trained as a mixed martial arts fighter, have also become friendly. Zuckerberg praised White for building UFC into \"one of the most valuable, fastest growing, and most popular sports enterprises in the world\" in a Facebook post on Monday. \"I've admired him as an entrepreneur and his ability to build such a beloved brand,\" Zuckerberg continued.\n\n\"I've never been interested in joining a board of directors until I got the offer to join Meta's board.

Trump’s support for a single bill is set to energize the president-elect’s backers with his ambitious proposed measures to shut down the open southern border, lower energy prices, and tackle the downtrodden economy.\n\nTrump’s post effectively endorses the no-holds-barred plan of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo. Smith expressed concern this past week that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass two reconciliation bills, given their slim majority in the House.\n\n“We have a smaller margin than what the United States Senate does. It is harder to pass bills in the House than in the Senate,” he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo. A single bill would mitigate the risk of Republican waffling. \n\nRep. Barry Moore, R-Ala., told The Daily Signal that he supported Trump’s single budget proposal. “I trust the process that President Trump is spearheading. One of his top priorities is securing our southern border and protecting American families,” he said, adding:\n\n“House Republicans are united in our commitment to delivering results for the American people. We are confident in navigating the reconciliation process to pass legislation that prioritizes our core objectives, including border security, energy independence, and economic growth.”\n\nSome Republicans have expressed concern that a single reconciliation bill would take much longer to pass than two separate bills, putting the securing of the border in jeopardy. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who now leads the Senate Budget Committee, told Bartiromo, “I’m very worried that if we don’t put [the] border first, and get it done, it’s going to be a nightmare for our national security. We’ve got millions of illegal immigrants that President Trump has promised to deport, and he should. Why are we doing mass deportation? Because we had mass illegal immigration.” \n\nGraham noted some of Republicans’ plans for shoring up the border including increasing the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and finishing the border wall, and that the collective border security measures would cost around $100 billion. “There’s no way in hell Democrats are going to give us $100 billion for mass deportation,” Graham told Bartiromo. “Every day we delay is a dangerous day for America.”\n\nA second Trump administration would likely unshackle the American economy by emphasizing natural gas drilling and making it easier to approve permits for pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals. Trump would also probably expand drilling on federal lands, which President Joe Biden restricted during his term.\n\nAs it stands now, the United States also needs to provide more natural gas to its allies in Europe, who have faced a shortage of the resource since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The United States also helps reduce carbon emissions in Asia by providing natural gas as an alternative to coal for countries as disparate as South Korea and India. \n\nMoore, the Alabama Republican, told The Daily Signal that “Reestablishing American energy independence is critical. We need to immediately expand natural gas drilling, reopen the Keystone Pipeline, and cut unnecessary regulations on our energy sector. These steps are going to lower costs for American families and bring back our dominance in global energy markets.” \n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also said he supports increasing drilling. “We will end the offshore drilling ban and renew key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, making them bigger and bolder.”\n\nIn 2017, Congress passed the signature legislation of the pro-economic growth Trump agenda, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Trump tax cuts, as they came to be known, are set to expire in December, which would result in the single largest tax hike for Americans since World War II.\n\nThe tax cuts were a signature part of the Trump economy that delivered to Americans an unemployment rate at a 50-year low, significant growth in median real wages, and a decline in inflation. They also were a pro-family policy, a doubling the child tax credit. Because income gains were the largest among minorities, the tax cuts also triggered a decline in income inequality.\n\nAdditionally, the tax cuts likely enabled the amelioration of the current financial downturn through the repatriation of more than $1 trillion in foreign earnings. Moore expressed support for making the Trump tax cuts permanent to The Daily Signal.\n\nVital to Trump’s campaign promises of uplifting working-class Americans is putting more money in their pockets, and the president-elect reiterated in his X post to do just that by exempting tips from taxation. Cruz has already introduced legislation that would allow “a deduction from gross income (above-the-line tax deduction) for cash tips received by a taxpayer.” Cruz added, “I’ve been leading the fight to eliminate Biden’s natural gas tax and advance President Trump’s No Tax on Tips proposal, and I’m optimistic these priorities will be included.” \n\nSuch a change in the tax law would likely be well-received by Americans. According to an August poll by Ipsos, nearly 3 out of 4 Americans among both Republicans and Democrats support ending the federal income tax on tips. A variation on the proposal was also recently proposed by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, in his budget announcement.\n\n“Hardworking Americans, especially in the service industry, deserve relief. Exempting tips from federal income tax is a commonsense measure that puts more money in the pockets of millions of workers who keep our economy running.” Moore said.\n\nTrump also outlined that he would use tariffs to make up the revenue lost from the “no tax on tips.” In the past, he has threatened to use tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China in order to foster more cooperation in dealing with the illegal immigration and drug-trafficking crises at the American border.","summary":"The American people delivered President-elect Donald Trump’s sweeping agenda a mandate in November’s presidential election, and with Republicans in control of the House, Senate, and...

Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!,\" he posted on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's statement came after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday (local time) that he would resign as the leader of the Liberal Party and as Prime Minister as soon as a new candidate is found for the post. Trudeau said that he had spoken to the Liberal Party President to start looking for a new Prime Ministerial candidate.\n\n\"I intend to resign as party leader and as Prime Minister after the party choses next leader.

Canadian resilience motivates me to serve. I am a fighter. Every bone in my body has always told me to fight because I care deeply about Canadians, I care deeply about this country and I will always be motivated by what is in the best interest of Canadians. The fact is despite best efforts to work through it, Parliament has been paralysed for months after what has been the longest session of a minority Parliament in Canadian history. That's why this morning, I advised the Governor General that we need a new session of Parliament. She has granted this request and the House will now be prorogued until March 24,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"Over the holidays, I have also had a chance to reflect and to have long talks with my family about our future. Throughout the course of my career, any success I have personally achieved has been because of their support, their encouragement. So, last night over dinner I told my kids about the decision that I am sharing with you today. I intend to resign as party leader, as Prime Minister after the party selects its next leader...Last night I asked the president of the Liberal Party to begin that process.\n\nThis country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that I am having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,\" he added.\n\nTrudeau said that he will not put forth his candidature as a potential Prime Minister.\n\n\"I will not be putting my candidature. Liberal Party is an important institution in our country. We were elected for 3rd time in 2021 to advance Canada's stand in the world. I never bow down when faced with a fight but I do this job because of the interest of Canadians and the interest of democracy that I hold dear. And it is clear I can't be that candidate due to internal battles,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking about Canada's former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Trudeau said that he expected her to continue as the Deputy Prime Minister. \"Chrystia (Freeland) has been a political partner for many years. I had hoped she would continue as deputy pm but she chose otherwise,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau added that Pierre Pollivere of the Conservative Party was not right for the country. \"Pierre Pollivere's vision is not right for this country,\" he said.

Walmart, John Deere, Harley-Davidson and others rolled back their DEI initiatives last year.\n\nMcDonald's said Monday it will retire specific goals for achieving diversity at senior leadership levels. It also intends to end a program that encourages its suppliers to develop diversity training and to increase the number of minority group members represented within their own leadership ranks.\n\nMcDonald's said it will also pause \"external surveys.\" The burger giant didn't elaborate, but several other companies, including Lowe's and Ford Motor Co., suspended their participation in an annual survey by the Human Rights Campaign that measures workplace inclusion for LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nMcDonald's, which has its headquarters in Chicago, rolled out a series of diversity initiatives in 2021 after a spate of sexual harassment lawsuits filed by employees and a lawsuit alleging discrimination brought by a group of Black former McDonald's franchise owners.\n\n\"As a world-leading brand that considers inclusion one of our core values, we will accept nothing less than real, measurable progress in our efforts to lead with empathy, treat people with dignity and respect, and seek out diverse points of view to drive better decision-making,\" McDonald's Chairman and CEO Chris Kempczinski wrote in a LinkedIn post at the time.\n\nSEE ALSO: DEI: What does it mean and what is its purpose?\n\nBut McDonald's said Monday that the \"shifting legal landscape\" after the Supreme Court decision and the actions of other corporations caused it to take a hard look at its own policies.\n\nA shifting political landscape may also have played a role. President-elect Donald Trump is a vocal opponent of diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Trump tapped Stephen Miller, a former adviser who leads a group called America First Legal that has aggressively challenged corporate DEI policies,as his incoming deputy chief of policy.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance introduced a bill in the Senate last summer to end such programs in the federal government.\n\nRobby Starbuck, a conservative political commentator who has threatened consumer boycotts of prominent consumer brands that don't retreat from their diversity programs, said Monday on X that he recently told McDonald's he would be doing a story on its \"woke policies.\"\n\nMcDonald's said it had been considering updates to its policies for several months and planned to time the announcement to the start of this year.\n\nIn an open letter to employees and franchisees, McDonald's senior leadership team said it remains committed to inclusion and believes a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. The company said 30% of its U.S. leaders are members of underrepresented groups, up from 29% in 2021. McDonald's previously committed to reaching 35% by the end of this year.\n\nMcDonald's said it has achieved one of the goals it announced in 2021: gender pay equity at all levels of the company.

In another, he called for Starmer’s safeguarding minister, Jess Philips, to be imprisoned, calling her “pure evil” and “a wicked creature.” On Monday, he also said Starmer should be in prison.\n\nStarmer said he enjoys “the cut-and-thrust of politics,” but said these debates must “be based on facts and truth, not on lies.”\n\nHe also criticized Conservative politicians – some of whom were in government during the grooming scandal – for “jumping on the bandwagon” and being “so desperate for attention that they’re prepared to debase themselves and their country.”\n\nBritish lawmaker Ed Davey urged the UK government on Monday to summon the US ambassador over Musk’s comments.\n\n“People have had enough of Elon Musk interfering with our country’s democracy when he clearly knows nothing about Britain. It’s time to summon the US ambassador to ask why an incoming US official is suggesting the UK government should be overthrown,” Davey, who serves as the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the third largest party in the UK, said in a post on X.\n\nDavey stated that the American ambassador should convey to the US government that those at a senior level need to be “very careful about how they comment on UK affairs, whether they’re the richest man in the world or anyone else.”\n\nMusk has accused Starmer of being “complicit in the rape of Britain” for failing to thwart grooming gangs while he was director of public prosecutions (DPP). Starmer staunchly defended his record as head of the DPP on Monday, saying he changed “the entire approach” that had stopped victims from being heard, and had “the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record.”\n\nIn a 2014 report, it was revealed that about 1,400 children had been abused by gangs of men in the northern English town of Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. The far-right has long capitalized on the scandal, pointing to the South Asian ethnicities of the majority of the gangs’ perpetrators.\n\nStarmer’s government recently rejected a national inquiry into the gangs, citing a string of existing inquiries into the issue and a 2022 report, the findings of which are still being implemented.\n\nFollowing his success in helping to re-elect Donald Trump in the United States, Musk has increasingly inserted himself into the political discourse of other countries.\n\nLast month, Musk endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, ahead of federal elections to be held in February. As well as a string of posts on social media, Musk penned a weekend op-ed for a major German newspaper, explaining his support for the party, which has been accused of resurrecting Nazi-era ideology and slogans.\n\nIn response, the German government accused Musk of “trying to influence” the election. Asked how to respond to Musk’s posts, Olaf Scholz, the embattled German chancellor, told German media: “Don’t feed the troll.”\n\nMusk has also called insistently for new elections in the UK, despite the fact the last election was held just six months ago. He has backed the populist party Reform UK and on Sunday called for its leader Nigel Farage to step down, saying he “does not have what it takes” to lead.\n\nAlthough Musk did not immediately endorse another candidate, he has previously pushed for the release of Tommy Robinson, an imprisoned far-right agitator. Robinson has previously led far-right parties in the UK and has a swelling social media following.\n\nSpeaking Monday, Starmer slammed those “cheerleading” Robinson, who was jailed for 18 months in October after he admitted to being in contempt of court by repeating false accusations about a Syrian refugee.\n\n“They’re supporting a man who went to prison for nearly collapsing a grooming case,” Starmer said of Robinson’s supporters. He said this showed that “they’re not interested in victims, they’re interested in themselves.”\n\nOther European leaders have become increasingly troubled by Musk’s meddling in the politics of other countries. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Monday called this a “worrying” development.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also expressed disbelief at Musk’s conduct.\n\n“If we had been told the owner of the largest social media network would support an international reactionary movement and directly intervene in elections, including Germany, who would have believed it? This is the world we live in and in which we have to conduct diplomacy,” Macron told French ambassadors in Paris on Monday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Here's how","text":"By Patricia Lopez\n\nAs Inauguration Day nears, it’s clear that President-elect Donald Trump believes he has a mandate to enact the largest deportation in U.S. history. What happens next could forever alter what it means to be an American.Immigration under President Joe Biden surged to levels unmatched in more than a century — an estimated net increase of 8 million migrants during his four years in office, with a majority crossing illegally, according to a Goldman Sachs report.Biden was determined to reverse the harsh Trump 1.0 policies that limited both legal and illegal immigration. But Biden never framed this important issue for average Americans. There never was a “Biden doctrine” to help the nation understand why he believed more immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers could prove a net benefit — or sufficient federal aid to help cities and states deal with the consequences. Finally, after Trump killed a bipartisan immigration reform bill, Biden unilaterally re-imposed tighter limits on the southern border — but it was too late to save his candidacy, or that of Vice President Kamala Harris.Now the U.S. finds itself with the highest foreign-born population in its history — over 15 percent — and a border better described as porous than secure. And the electorate has proven susceptible to Trump’s divisive, demonizing rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump is prepared to deliver on his top priority, expect the actions that follow to be swift and ugly. In particular, keep your eye on five things:\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798\n\nThere is a reason Trump and his acolytes on the campaign trail repeatedly described migrants as “invaders” and border crossings as an “invasion.” He has said he will use the Alien Enemies Act to “remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers or cartel members from the United States.”\n\nThe act so far has been used only in wartime, and Trump’s invocation would surely draw a legal challenge. But the Brennan Center for Justice has warned that the act’s language is so broad that “a president might be able to wield the authority in peacetime as an end run around the requirements of criminal and immigration law.”\n\nTrump also has pledged to use the military and local law enforcement if necessary. There are prohibitions against that as well, but it’s anyone’s guess whether a conservative court will uphold them.\n\nWorkplace raids\n\nTom Homan, Trump’s nominee for “border czar,” and a former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has pledged to bring back workplace raids. Once a staple of enforcement in earlier administrations, workplace raids were discontinued under Biden. The raids were disruptive to employers and sparked terror in immigrant communities, but Homan has said the message is one that needs to be sent.\n\nHe has said he will start in Chicago, a northern Mecca for immigrants that has declared itself a sanctuary city. Homan told a group in that city recently that, \"If your Chicago mayor doesn't want to help, he can step aside. But if he impedes us, if he knowingly harbors an illegal alien, I will prosecute him.\" Homan has already met with the far more cooperative New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former police officer, who later pledged his cooperation despite his city’s sanctuary laws.\n\nBirthright citizenship\n\nTrump has said that he intends to upend one of the most fundamental ideas about the U.S.: That no matter where in the world your parents come from, if you are born here, you are an American. It is a principle specifically enshrined in the 14th Amendment.\n\nNo president can override the Constitution with an executive order. But Trump could create havoc in the meantime by, as he has said he would, ordering the government to stop issuing Social Security numbers and passports to offspring of parents who cannot prove their legal status.\n\nRefugee programs\n\nBiden reduced illegal border crossings in part by expanding programs that allowed legal ones, including the policy of humanitarian parole. But the outgoing president has said he will not renew that authorization for the more than half-million immigrants who came from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba and Nicaragua during his term.Trump has called Biden’s version an “outrageous abuse of parole” and seeks to end it. He may also seek to end or severely restrict Temporary Protected Status, which shields more than 800,000 immigrants from specific countries against deportation.\n\nThe lone carrot Trump has held out to Democrats is possible action to protect Dreamers — those brought to this country illegally as children, many of whom have grown old waiting for more than temporary protection in the only homeland they’ve ever known. How genuine is that offer? That’s up to Trump, whose record is mixed. He also held out a similar promise in his first term, only to go back on it.\n\nHardliners in Congress have already expressed reservations about further protections for Dreamers, whose status rests on an Obama 2012 executive order called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The order provided a temporary shield from deportation and work permits. If Trump persists, expect him to extract maximum leverage from any deal.It should be clear even to the biggest doubters that Trump intends to follow through on what is now a decade-old pledge to crack down on immigration. But this time he has a team in place with the experience and knowledge to follow through, however brutal and a conservative Supreme Court. That could make all the difference.\n\nPatricia Lopez is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering politics and policy.

US foreign policy will largely be determined by Floridians for the next few years, starting with President-elect Donald Trump. Like many ageing Americans, Trump in 2019 made Florida his legal home. He said at the time that although he loved his home state of New York, he was \"treated very badly\" by political leaders there. In reality, he probably moved to Florida for the lower state income taxes, saving millions a year. In the past months, the president-elected announced that he would nominate senator Marco Rubio of Florida as his Secretary of State. He also named Mike Waltz, also of Florida, as his National Security Advisor. In congress, Brian Mast, who represents the area just north of Trump&apos;s Florida home, Mar-a-lago, won election as the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee. Mast is a combat veteran who lost his legs in Afghanistan. His colleagues elected him overwhelming after he vowed to align foreign aid programs with US national security interests. On the powerful House appropriations committee, Mario Diaz-Balart - who represents much of south Florida, chairs the panel that funds the State Department and all other international spending. Once thought of as \"God&apos;s Waiting Room,\" Florida was home to retired Americans, alligators and mangrove swamps. New Yorkers drove down Interstate 95 and settled in Fort Lauderdale and Miami on Florida&apos;s East Coast. Chicagoans and other Midwesterners headed south on Route 75 to retire in Tampa Bay, Sarasota or Fort Myers on Florida&apos;s West Coast. Today, however, Florida is bursting at the seams. Home to global culture powerhouse Disney, no state income tax, growing numbers of investment firms, cyber companies and crypto entrepreneurs, Florida is hot - and it&apos;s not just the weather. Florida&apos;s economy cooks along at about $1.7 trillion per year, making it just a little smaller than Australia&apos;s entire economy. With almost 23 million people, Florida is America&apos;s third most populous state, trailing only California and New York. Floridians are diverse as well - 27 per cent Hispanic, 17 per cent Black and nearly 21 per cent born outside the United States. With significant populations from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela, the City of Miami has become as internationally focused a city as New York or London. Politically, Florida is as American as you can get. It has sided with the winning presidential candidate in seven out of the last eight elections. In 2000, George W. Bush won Florida by 537 votes (out of almost 6 million cast), with the state taking weeks to finalize the count in the infamous \"hanging chads\" election. In 2024, Trump won Florida by over 13 per cent, a massive surge from his 1 per cent win in 2016. In other words, Florida is the leading edge of resurgent political conservatives in the United States. What does this mean for American foreign policy? Expect that the Western hemisphere will receive significantly more attention than it would have without the presence of the Florida contingent. The global competition between the US and China has been particularly acute in Latin America. China is now biggest trading partner in most of the continent. Much of the American pushback against Chinese economic predation will come from and through the Miami business community, and the Trump White House and GOP Congress will be deeply involved. Beyond Latin America, expect a tug of war between those who lean toward values, the idealists, and those who lean toward interests, the realists. On the values side, Marco Rubio is the son of Cuban exiles from Fidel Castro&apos;s communist regime and owes his interest in foreign policy (he is a senior member of the Senate foreign relations committee) to a deep-seated distain for dictators and totalitarians. READ MORE: In the Senate, Rubio has been an active voice for democracy and human rights across the globe. Mario Diaz-Balart shares many of these values. The realists, Waltz and Mast, are both combat veterans and share Trump&apos;s more flinty-eyed approach to global affairs. They are skeptical of foreign interventions but support a bigger defence budget: \"speak softly and carry a big stick.\" The Florida contingent will have consensus on isolating and sanctioning Iran, ramping up economic and security competition with China and pushing Congress for a big increase in defence spending. There will be division on the best way to deal with Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine and the value of investing in diplomacy and development programs. Rhetorically, this geographically unified group may be a little dissonant, alternating support for the principles of democracy one day and support for primacy of economic ties the next.

Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors ended lower on Monday, but communication services and tech stocks climbed 2.13 per cent and 1.44 per cent, respectively. \"What we&apos;re seeing is more of what happened last year, which is a rally concentrated on the largest stocks,\" said Michael Green, portfolio manager at Simplify Asset Management, adding that flows from 401(k) retirement plans are helping drive stocks higher.

Nvidia rose 3.43 per cent, Advanced Micro Devices gained 3.33 per cent and Micron Technology was up 10.45 per cent. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index jumped 2.84 per cent. Tech stocks rose despite benchmark 10-year Treasury yields reaching the highest since May. US stocks had rebounded sharply on Friday after a string of losses in December and the first few sessions of January, when concerns about high valuations, rising Treasury yields and thin liquidity saw traders pull back after a strong 2024 run. Automakers gained, with Ford rising 0.40 per cent and General Motors adding 3.40 per cent after a newspaper report said President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s incoming administration is focused on imposing tariffs on every country, but only certain sectors deemed critical to national or economic security. Trump later refuted the report. \"He did come out and say that he&apos;s not going to water down his tariff plan, but the seed has been planted that the Trump administration&apos;s tariff policies won&apos;t be quite as shocking as people originally feared,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. Car manufacturers are considered the most vulnerable to tariffs imposed on US trade partners, given their vast supply chains. Leading to Trump&apos;s January 20 inauguration, investors are seeking insights into his policies, which are broadly seen as beneficial for corporate America as well as the US economy. Citigroup moved 2.45 per cent higher after a bullish rating from Barclays. An index tracking banks rose 0.22 per cent. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, who has sought a range of strict rules on the nation&apos;s biggest banks, said he will resign. In a week packed with economic data and speeches from US Federal Reserve officials, investors will look for clues on the pace of monetary policy easing this year. Later in the week, the focus will be on a monthly payrolls report. While Trump&apos;s proposals could boost corporate profits and energise the economy, they also risk driving up inflation. Fed Governor Lisa Cook was the latest among a number of policymakers to caution that inflation risks remain in the new year. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.01-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted eight new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 39 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 17.36 billion shares, compared with the 12.37-billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Citing both presidential immunity and the demands of Trump&apos;s impending January 20 inauguration, his lawyers on Monday morning said Justice Juan Merchan&apos;s intention not to penalise Trump was \"of no moment\". \"Presidential immunity violations cannot be ignored in favour of a rushed pre-inauguration sentencing,\" the lawyers wrote in a court filing. In a written ruling later on Monday, Merchan said Trump&apos;s motion was mostly \"a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past\". The judge declined to push back Trump&apos;s January 10 sentencing, a date he had set just last week. In scheduling Trump&apos;s sentencing for Friday, the judge noted last week that he was not inclined to send Trump to jail. He wrote that a sentence of unconditional discharge, effectively putting a judgment of guilt on his record without a fine or probation, would be the most practical approach given Trump&apos;s looming inauguration. The judge said Trump, 78, may appear at his sentencing either in person or virtually. In their Monday filing, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove asked Merchan to hold off sentencing Trump while the appeals play out. Any delay would make it unlikely Trump would be sentenced before his January 20 inauguration. A Republican, Trump has long argued that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, brought the case to harm his re-election campaign. Bragg has said his office routinely brings felony falsification of business records charges - the charge Trump faced in the case. Prosecutors with Bragg&apos;s office had urged Merchan to deny Trump&apos;s bid to delay the sentencing. \"The balance of equities weighs heavily in the People&apos;s favor given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and the finality of criminal proceedings,\" the prosecutors wrote on Monday afternoon. The case stemmed from a $US130,000 payment Trump&apos;s former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about a sexual encounter she said she had with Trump, who denies it. After a six-week trial in state criminal court in Manhattan, a jury in May found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying records to mask the payment prior to the 2016 election. The hush money case made Trump the first US president - sitting or former - to be charged with and convicted of a crime. Since the verdict, his lawyers have made two unsuccessful attempts to have the case tossed. Merchan previously rejected their argument the US Supreme Court&apos;s July finding in a separate criminal case against Trump that presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts meant the hush money case must be dismissed. Merchan ruled that the hush money case concerned Trump&apos;s personal conduct. After Trump won re-election, his lawyers argued that having the case hang over him while president would impede his ability to govern. Merchan denied that bid, writing that overturning the jury&apos;s verdict would be an affront to the rule of law.

It was presided over by Harris, acting in her vice-presidential role as president of the Senate. The quadrennial ritual stood in sharp contrast to four years ago when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block the certification of then-president Trump&apos;s 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. Trump continues to claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud - despite his own attorney general, recounts and investigations finding no evidence of that - and had warned throughout his 2024 campaign that he harboured similar concerns until his November 5 defeat of Harris. \"Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history.

The joint session of Congress proceeded even as a winter storm hovered over the US capital, dropping about 15cm of snow and snarling travel. The final certification backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris&apos; 226. Republicans also captured a majority in the US Senate and held a narrow edge in the House in November&apos;s election, which will give Trump the party support he needs to implement his planned agenda of tax cuts and a crackdown on immigrants living in the country illegally. Democrats did not try to block certification of Trump&apos;s victory on Monday. \"We must renew our commitment to safeguarding American democracy,\" No 2 House Democrat Katherine Clark said in a statement earlier in the day. \"As elected leaders, our loyalty must be to the Constitution, first and always. We are here to honour the will of the people and the rule of law.\" Security inside and outside the Capitol was heightened in preparation for the certification and was expected to remain in place through Trump&apos;s swearing-in. The Capitol grounds were ringed by metal fences hundreds of metres from the US Capitol, and accessible only via checkpoints guarded by uniformed police officers. Convoys of black police vehicles were on hand, led by a 10-wheel Baltimore police mobile command centre. New York Police Department reinforcements were also patrolling the area. Inside, extra teams of uniformed US Capitol Police officers were checking IDs at entrance sites including doors and underground tunnels leading to the House and Senate chambers. Trump has said he plans to pardon some of the more than 1500 people charged with taking part in the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, when a mob fought with police, smashing its way in through windows and doors. Some chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" referring to Trump&apos;s then-vice president, in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden&apos;s victory. In the 2021 melee at the Capitol, rioters surged past police barricades, assaulting about 140 officers. Multiple police officers who battled protesters died in the weeks that followed, some by taking their own lives. As a result of that day&apos;s violence, Congress passed legislation late in 2022 bolstering guardrails to ensure that the certification process is administered in a legal manner. For example, the new law asserts that the vice president&apos;s role is largely ceremonial. with AP Australian Associated Press","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8860517/us-congress-certifies-trump-election-victory/?cs=14329","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/silverstone-feed-data/68ee3987-5880-4d15-bbe3-a07a0c2458b2.jpg/r0_0_800_600_w800_h600_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:28:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.001},{"id":278801916,"title":"Canberra transport alternatives: Light rail vs BRT - which is best?","text":"Re \"Light rail vindicated\" (Letters, January 4). Light rail has some benefits but there are many more downsides. Financials aside for later, the aim of any public transport system is to move travellers quickly to their destinations. Canberra has never been able to do that. Even replacing buses with light rail will not improve travel time. I&apos;ve compared travel time now to 20 years ago and travel times have not improved in 20 years. That&apos;s why only 7 per cent of the travelling public use it. Hardly marketable is it? We could have a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) like Brisbane Metro, which is a light rail lookalike or even the trackless tram. Using its own busway, it was faster than car by the same route. It is spacious and comfortable, will take 170 passengers, and runs for 21 kilometres. Its 21-kilometre route cost was $1.55 billion as compared to Stage 2A&apos;s 1.7 kilometres at $1.32 billion (and we expect the route to Woden to cost no less than $4 billion after digging up the route to Woden to allow for the geophysical issues along the route. I believe 2A and B should be abandoned like yesterday. They are too expensive, do nothing to reduce emissions, and divert much-needed funds from other significant needs in favour of BRT, trackless trams or electric buses, all with dedicated busways. Investing in projects that make money - e.g., the Convention Centre will earn $4 for every $1 invested, compared to our tram, which earns 49c for every dollar invested - makes sense. High-capacity electric buses or BRT could be delivered quickly with little disruption. One reason to thank Peter Dutton is that he has taken the Coalition on a credible path to victory. After the near wipeout in May 2022, the Liberals could have become like their counterparts in many of the states and territories - dispirited, disjointed and at war with themselves. In those cases, Labor dominated for many terms, unchecked and inflicted much lasting economic damage, witness Victoria and Queensland with the ACT not far behind. Instead, at the federal level, we have a united Coalition, ready for a fight on issues that matter to Australians. That is healthy for democracy, and win, lose or draw, Peter Dutton deserves much credit for his leadership of his team. In 1923, Bertrand Russell, a British philosopher, logician, mathematician and public intellectual, wrote: \"One of the peculiarities of the English-speaking world is its immense interest and belief in political parties. A very large percentage of English-speaking people really believe that the ills from which they suffer would be cured if a certain political party were in power. \"That is a reason for the swing of the pendulum. A man [sic] votes for one party and remains miserable; he concludes that it was the other party that was to bring the millennium. By the time he is disenchanted with all parties, he is an old man on the verge of death; his sons retain the belief of his youth, and the see-saw goes on.\" Very little has changed. Slowly, some of us seem to be waking up though. Let&apos;s hope that 2025 sees a more significant awakening. It is high time Australia had its own flag without foreign flags being portrayed therein. It is un-Australian to have a flag that only represents a portion of Australians. Similarly, it is offensive to some Australians to celebrate the dispossession of their land. It&apos;s time to celebrate a day of which all Australians can be proud and fly an Australian flag without the intrusion of foreign flags. Amanda Vanstone (January 2) warns of the chaos that will ensue if there is a minority government after the next election. This is somewhat ironic, given she was part of one for many years. It seems that, like many, she has forgotten the Coalition is just that, and not a party. In many parts of Australia, including Canberra, the National Party does not even have a representative on the ballot, yet they have had a significant influence over government decisions affecting us. One of her criticisms is that the independents try to negotiate a better deal for their constituents, which is apparently a sin. Perhaps voters prefer a representative who stands up for them, rather than someone who toes the party line, regardless of the impact on their electorate, in the hope of being rewarded with the spoils of office. Vanstone also complains about the horse-trading involved in getting majority support for a bill. Apparently, this is much worse for policy outcomes than the horse-trading that goes on behind closed doors between factions within parties or between the Liberals and the Nationals. Likewise, she seems to think the party committees are better informed than the parliamentary committees on the impact of policies, despite the latter soliciting advice from a wide range of experts and stakeholders - and again, in public, not in private. Finally, she states that \"the major parties can only say they will do something if the crossbench agrees\". This is blatantly untrue - if the major parties both support something then the crossbench has no influence. If good, stable government was really the goal of the major parties, and decisions were made on the basis of the best available expertise, this would be a common occurrence. It isn&apos;t, which says a lot. The Albanese government continues to scale new heights in inconsistency and hypocrisy in its relentless pursuit of geopolitical boot-licking and domestic political theatre it thinks will prevent oblivion at the upcoming election. Contrast the simultaneous news on captured Australian mercenary in Ukraine, Oscar Jenkins, and Australian family man Daniel Duggan. Anthony Albanese was characteristically performing on air about the former, saying \"This is concerning news. We are working through DFAT trying to provide support\". To a man the Russians are calling a mercenary? Isn&apos;t that foreign activity illegal for an Australian? Or is it not if the killing you do is in line with our geopolitical propaganda? Somehow, North Korean soldiers fighting in Ukraine are a shocking outrage, but Australians equally buying into the conflict aren&apos;t. Then Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus piously pontificated on humanitarian law for this prisoner, when no such applies to mercenaries. This is the same Dreyfus who had the very same day approved the extradition - to a customarily hegemonic, despotic and acrimonious America - of Daniel Duggan, an Australian citizen with a large Australian family here. This reprised the Australian government&apos;s contempt for its citizens that it showed Julian Assange. Unless they shoot Russians that is. The Australian Public Service is hampered in recruiting the best available talent by the requirement that all ongoing staff be Australian citizens (\"Frank has a PhD but struggled to get a job in Canberra\", January 6). Compare this position with the New Zealand government, which welcomes non-citizens, including many from Australia, to its public service. The Australian state and territory public services have also avoided this unnecessary restriction, setting a good example for the APS. Crispin Hull&apos;s Christmas bon bon (\"$200 billion leg-up for the wealthy\", December 24) revealed an uncomfortable truth about the Albanese-Chalmers team. If your name&apos;s \"Wealth &apos;n Privilege\" think twice about voting for team Dutton and Littleproud. They might not, by design or otherwise, be able to lubricate your lucre as effectively as the incumbents. As we&apos;ve already heard ad nauseam, a big question in election 2025 is: \"Are you better off now than you were three years ago?\" Chalmers is confident he&apos;s got the answers with endlessly recycled Treasury talking points about budget repair, inflation fighting, a million jobs, \"growing\" wages, cost-of-living relief, the housing accord, and a \"net zero transformation stream\". He seems to presume mulish voters won&apos;t get too distracted by vulgar hip-pocket concerns. Living standards are going nowhere, a million migrants, real wages are in free fall, rental distress and we have rock-solid housing unaffordability. By seeking to avenge its own cruel history Israel will ensure the Middle East is the worst powder keg on the planet. \"Bourbon Street carnage\" screamed the front page of The Canberra Times (January 3). Meanwhile, about 50 Gazans were killed by Israeli forces in 24 hours. No front-page coverage of this by The Canberra Times. This asymmetric reporting by Western media is one reason the \"rules-based international order\" is viewed with disdain by the global South. When Summernats spokesperson Andy Lopez was here he should, along with Andrew Barr and Yvette Berry, have advised on the state of discussions and planning for a new dragway at EPIC (as was reported in these pages by them quite some time ago). Once again, we experienced screaming cars, noisy parties and burnouts in the Kingston/Barton area over the four nights, and once again, the police appeared powerless to act. For how much longer do Canberra residents have to endure these morons? Why does the mainstream media rarely mention the climate crisis when reporting on the recent heatwaves? Reporting a particular year is the hottest since a specific year implies normality, and the crisis is downplayed. This suggests climate change mitigation is unimportant when, in fact, it is the exact opposite. Another bit of smug self-promotion that reminds us all \"I don&apos;t hold a hose, mate\" (\"Scott Morrison enters the New Year alongside Donald Trump\", January 1). I have been reading The Canberra Times since 1959; some 66 years. I have never previously read such utter balderdash as that written by Amanda Vanstone in \"This idea of diversity is bunkum\". She&apos;s the one who&apos;s crazy. Alex Wallesky (Letters, January 2) bemoans the way Labor is running the country. I have news for him. It won&apos;t get any better if it is run by an ex-Queenslander copper, weighted down with a nuclear energy policy thought bubble. No doubt Trump will now forget about deporting a million people a year. Like everything else, it was just a device to get him elected. Re \"Elon Musk calls for Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to quit\" (January 5). Please Mr Musk, call on Albo and Dutton to quit too. Governments have spent $450,000 on \"welcomes to country\" - invented in 1975 to welcome a Polynesian sporting team - when people are dying because they cannot get an ambulance, or afford medication and medical treatment. And let&apos;s not get started on the cost of the referendum.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8860285/canberra-transport-alternatives-light-rail-vs-brt-which-is-best/?cs=27763","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/LLBstgPA4H8EG9DTTGcXBL/8542cb12-04b0-47ad-bdcc-45b7b10b1e62.jpg/r0_0_3886_2591_w3886_h2591_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:28:12","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.113},{"id":278801872,"title":"Justin Trudeau blames party infighting as he steps down as Canadian PM","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he will step down in the coming months after nine years in power, bowing to pressure from MPs alarmed by his Liberal Party&apos;s miserable showing in pre-election polls.

He also announced parliament would be prorogued, or suspended, until March 24. That means an election is unlikely before May at the earliest, so Trudeau will remain in charge - at least initially - of dealing with the threat of crippling tariffs once US President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20. The next election must be held by late October and polls show voters angry over high prices and a shortage of affordable housing will elect the opposition Conservatives and hand the Liberals a resounding defeat, no matter who leads the party. In recent weeks unhappy Liberal MPs openly called on Trudeau to quit after his finance minister resigned and accused him of \"political gimmicks\" to win back voters. \"I am not someone who backs away from a fight, particularly when a fight is as important as this one is,\" Trudeau told reporters outside his residence as temperatures dipped to minus 15C. Trudeau, 53, took office in November 2015 with a message of hope and \"sunny ways\" and won reelection twice, becoming one of Canada&apos;s longest-serving prime ministers and winning plaudits from progressives for his focus on gender parity policies.

Parliament was originally due to resume on January 27 and opposition parties had vowed to bring down Trudeau&apos;s minority government as soon as they could.

Trudeau said he had asked the Liberal Party to set in motion a leadership contest but did not say how long it would take.

Liberal infighting has alarmed business groups and the premiers of the country&apos;s 10 provinces, who say Ottawa has to focus on possible tariffs from the Trump administration. Trudeau had until recently been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the poor showing in polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections last year. The Conservatives are led by Pierre Poilievre, a career politician who rose to prominence in early 2022 when he supported truck drivers who took over the centre of Ottawa as part of a protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates. \"While leaderless Liberals focus on saving their jobs and fighting each other for power, the country spirals out of control,\" Poilievre said in a statement, reiterating calls for an immediate election. Trump, speaking on Monday before Trudeau&apos;s announcement, said he was looking forward to working with Poilievre if he won the next Canadian election.

Zuckerberg also had meetings last year with White about the use of artificial intelligence on UFC fighter rankings, according to an interview White had with TNT Sports.

Trump was an early supporter of the UFC, offering up the Trump Taj Mahal as a venue for UFC 31 and UFC 32 back in 2001. White has said he \"does not give a [expletive]\n\n\" about mixing business and politics, according to the BBC, though he told The New Yorker not long after Trump’s election victory he wants “nothing to do with politics” following the 2024 election. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg has had a more spotty relationship with Trump and his allies, who have claimed Facebook’s content moderation policies favor Democrats. Zuckerberg, who called Trump “badass” in the wake of the assassination attempt on the president-elect, did not officially endorse Trump ahead of last year’s election. Meta did, however, donate $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, along with Amazon and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, as tech leaders seek to bolster relationships with Trump ahead of his presidency.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMeta Denies Zuckerberg Told Trump He Can’t Vote For A Democrat (Forbes)\n\nMark Zuckerberg Praises ‘Badass’ Trump Response After Assassination Attempt—But Doesn’t Endorse Him (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

For example, rejecting Trump’s argument that the crimes for which he was convicted are comparably not so grave, Merchan castigated Trump for the 'premeditated and continuous deception' that underlie his conviction on 34 counts of falsification of business records with the intent to defraud, including 'an intent to commit or conceal a conspiracy to promote a presidential election by unlawful means.'\n\nThe legal analyst also notes:\n\nThroughout the opinion, Merchan also bemoans Trump’s lack of remorse, noting his 'unrelenting and unsubstantiated attacks against the integrity and legitimacy of this process, individual prosecutors, witnesses and the Rule of Law' and observing that Trump has, on multiple occasions, 'pursu[ed] a claim with increasing indignation while simultaneously failing to acknowledge that this Court’s rulings on those subjects have been repeatedly upheld.'\n\nDo those words read as if Merchan understood, when calibrating his opinion, that because of Trump’s expected appellate efforts, this could be his last public statement in Trump’s case? They sure do.\n\nRubin added that \"focusing on who ultimately wins or loses ignores the bigger issue here,\" which is \"delay.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Dangerous rhetoric': Legal expert flags 'a twist' in judge's Trump sentencing filing\n\nShe concluded, \"All Trump needs is one or more judges of the Appellate Division, First Department — the applicable first-tier appeals court — to press pause on the sentencing until 12:01 p.m. on Jan. 20, when Trump becomes president once more.

Race war, Civil, Revolution? Bring it! I’m about as fed up as a man (American, Christian, White, Heterosexual) can get!”\n\nAn internal investigation later revealed a photo of Kinch pointing a handgun at a commemorative plate featuring the face of Barack Obama, allegedly taken at a party with other police present. A department official alerted the Secret Service to the photo, nearly prompting a federal raid.\n\nKinch remained on the force after the flare-ups. He later launched a discrimination case against the department, claiming he was retaliated against after testifying in a 2015 discrimination suit from a colleague.\n\nKinch later retired from the force in 2016.\n\nThe national Oath Keepers group claims tens of thousands of members, comprised of current and former military and police officials.\n\nThe group claims to defend constitutional liberties from federal over reach, and has regularly participated in armed standoffs and vigilante-style security patrols during protests.\n\nMultiple members of the group joined in the January 6 Capitol riot and were charged with seditious conspiracy. \n\nDonald Trump has suggested in recent weeks he will pardon nearly all of those charged with January 6-related offenses, beginning his first day in office.","summary":"Alleged role reportedly revealed after anti-militia infiltrator secretly captured evidence about Oath Keepers","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/oath-keepers-robert-kinch-police-b2674788.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/12/12/05/Capitol_Riot_Oath_Keepers_86210.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9QmHUyIS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-07 00:20:26","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.203},{"id":278802046,"title":"How Washington, D.C., is handling security concerns amid major events","text":"How Washington, D.C., is handling security concerns amid major events\n In the coming weeks, Washington, D.C., will host the 2024 election certification, former President Jimmy Carter's state funeral and President-elect Donald Trump's second inauguration.
