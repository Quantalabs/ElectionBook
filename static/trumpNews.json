According to a source familiar with the matter, who spoke to CNN, federal prosecutors will examine claims that members of the Obama administration deliberately manufactured intelligence suggesting Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nThe development follows a formal referral by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. In early July, Gabbard declassified several documents which she claims undermine the widely accepted conclusion that Russia sought to assist Donald Trump in defeating Hillary Clinton. In her referral to the DoJ, Gabbard called for an investigation into former President Barack Obama and senior officials in his administration, alleging an orchestrated effort to damage Trump’s credibility and legitimacy.\nIn a public statement issued after the declassification on July 17, Gabbard described the materials as evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” and a “years-long coup” against Trump. She accused Obama-era officials of attempting to subvert the outcome of the 2016 election by framing Trump as being in collusion with the Kremlin.\nAs part of the grand jury process now underway, subpoenas are expected to be issued to gather testimony and evidence regarding the alleged fabrication of intelligence. A spokesperson for the DoJ told Fox News that Attorney General Bondi is treating the referral “very seriously” and believes there is “clear cause for deep concern.” Further details on the scope and targets of the investigation remain undisclosed.\nIt is not yet clear which former officials might face charges. However, reports suggest that scrutiny could fall on several high-profile figures from the Obama intelligence community.\nAccording to Fox News, three former officials, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former FBI Director James Comey, are under increased examination due to their roles in shaping the intelligence narratives of the time.\nMeanwhile, Democrats have strongly rejected Gabbard’s allegations, citing the conclusions of a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, which found that Russia had indeed made efforts to influence the 2016 US election in Trump’s favour.","summary":"The development follows a formal referral by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/doj-launches-grand-jury-probe-into-alleged-2016-election-intelligence-fabrication-ws-l-9484574.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-6-2025-08-943a501c284d0643b0314d8cef4fcbc7.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 01:06:00","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":348181048,"title":"‘Cheat’: Donald Trump accused again as clip goes viral","text":"Donald Trump has been accused of golf cheating for the second time in days with video of an incident at his private golf club going viral. \n\nThe US president was on Sunday (AEST) crowned champion at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with the White House proudly spruiking the achievement on its social media channels.\n\nTrump is an avid golfer and has regularly made all sorts of claims about club championship victories and his overall ability on the course.\n\nThe 79-year-old was crowned the winner of the men’s seniors club championship with his scorecard showing he completed the 18 holes in a sizzling 69 strokes. \n\nHowever, the achievement has been called into question with new video appearing to show the Commander In Chief blatantly benefitting from an apparent ball drop from his caddie while on the green. \n\nIt comes just one week after he appeared to be exposed cheating during a round he played at the Trump Turnberry course and Trump International Golf Links in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. \n\nIn a viral video, a caddie was seen bending over and rather sheepishly dropping a ball onto the first cut of rough, a few feet short of a bunker and clear of the much thicker rough on the Scottish layout. \n\nThe President didn’t raise an eyelid as he calmly went and hit his next shot from the friendlier location.\n\nThe much maligned leader of the free world was accused of being a “shameless cheater” at the time — and now the new accusations are being fired from all directions.\n\nThe new footage of Trump taking advantage of having a caddie drop the ball onto the green in New Jersey is even more overt than his Scottish adventure.\n\nOne version of the clip shared on X has more than 3.4 million views.\n\nThe 47th POTUS was seen attempting to putt from where his caddie had dropped the ball, but then needed a further three or four taps to get the damned ball in the hole. \n\nOne attempt to backhand the ball into the cup is a particularly bad look. \n\nWhile it is commonplace for casual weekend hackers to pick their ball up and give it a taparoo when it comes to frustrating close-range putts, Trump’s apparent cheating occurred during an organised championship — which he supposedly won. \n\nFor those left cross-eyed trying to work out what the hell all of this means, it is a black and white rule violation for caddies to pick up the ball and perform a drop on the green.\n\nUnder the Rules of Golf — as determined by the United States Golf Association and The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews — balls must be placed in their original location (not dropped) if they need to be picked up for any reason on the green. \n\nUnder Rule 14.3 the ball must be dropped by the player and not the caddie in most relief situations. The green — which is free of hazards — is not a relief situation.\n\nIf a ball needs to be lifted and replaced in genuine situations, including for cleaning, interference, or after being accidentally moved, it must be replaced on its original spot, not dropped. Replacing means setting it down gently, not dropping it from height.\n\nIt is for these reasons golf commentators have been left convinced Trump cheated in broad daylight. \n\nRick Reilly, author of Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, has led the criticism. \n\nReilly has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and is known to have played a round of golf with the President in previous years. \n\n“So you know, it’s NEVER legal for your caddie to drop a ball,” Reilly posted on X.\n\n“YOU can drop one, but never on a green. And since this was a full-score event, its not legal for Trump to drag the ball into the hole. No, no, never. Our president is a f***ing golf cheat.”\n\nBefore the weekend’s action in Bedminster, Reilly predicted Trump was going to claim victory. \n\n“Tomorrow is the Senior Champ at Bedminster,” Reilly wrote on X. “Are you shameless enough to pretend you won it? Even after the whole planet saw you cheat in Scotland? Is your ego that sick?”\n\nAfter Trump’s win, Reilly wrote in a follow-up, “Guess we got our answer. What a child.”\n\nTrump previously raised eyebrows when he boasted he shot a round of 67 at the Bedminster course, which has a par score of 72.\n\nA score of five-under on most championship-level golf courses, which Trump National is, would please seasoned professionals.\n\nYou be the judge.","summary":"Donald Trump has been accused again with a viral video appearing to show the US President in a blatant illegal act.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/golf/cheat-donald-trump-accused-again-as-clip-goes-viral/news-story/a178d0ef1192b98753037764dcd0b982?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0059a6b3fab823857f37c84c5793c414","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 01:04:22","author":"Tyson Otto","authors":["Tyson Otto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":348180314,"title":"NASA planning nuclear reactor on the moon: reports","text":"US space agency NASA is planning to build a nuclear reactor on the surface of the moon, news outlet Politico reports, citing internal agency documents.\n\nThe space agency reportedly intends to solicit concrete proposals from industry within 60 days for a 100-kilowatt reactor set to go into operation by 2030.\n\nActing NASA administrator Sean Duffy is expected to announce the plans in the coming days, according to Monday's report.\n\nThe plan comes against the backdrop of intensifying competition with China, which is aiming to launch its first crewed moon mission around the same time.\n\nThe NASA document warns the first nation to deploy a working reactor could \"declare a keep-out zone which would significantly inhibit the United States,\" according to Politico.\n\nThe idea of a nuclear reactor on the moon is not new.

In his Instagram stories, Schulz reposted a Washington Post report headlined, \"Trump promised to mandate IVF care. The White House says there's no plans to do so.\" Alongside the headline, Schulz wrote, \"You don’t break your word. Your word breaks you.\" The comedian and podcaster famously interviewed Trump and voted for him in the November election, but has been increasingly critical in recent weeks over what he perceives as broken promises from the president. ANDREW SCHULZ TURNS ON TRUMP OVER BUDGET, WARS, EPSTEIN DOCUMENTS: ‘I VOTED FOR NONE OF THIS’ In his social media post, he blasted Trump for flip-flopping \"once again\" and directed his followers to a charity that helps pay for IVF services. \"For anyone that is looking for financial assistance with IVF (especially now that @realdonaldtrump flip-flopped once again on a campaign promise), please look into @babyquestgrants. It’s a wonderful charity that we are working with that specifically provides financial aid for fertility treatments,\" Schulz's post read. Roughly one year ago, Trump pledged that he would mandate free in vitro fertilization treatment for women if he won a second term. \"I'm announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,\" Trump told supporters during a campaign rally in Michigan last August. \"Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.\" 'PROMISES KEPT': TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO 'AGGRESSIVELY' MAKE IVF MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE In February, Trump signed an executive order expanding access to IVF and other fertility treatments through the reduction of out-of-pocket costs. The order directed the Domestic Policy Council to find ways to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable. The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Washington Post in response to its report that the president's work to expand IVF access was ongoing. \"President Trump pledged to expand access to fertility treatments for Americans who are struggling to start families,\" Jackson said in a statement. \"The Administration is committed like none before to using its authorities to deliver on this pledge.\" TRUMP'S IDEA TO MAKE AMERICANS HAVE BABIES AGAIN GETS MIXED REVIEWS FROM EXPERTS This is not the first time Schulz has taken aim at Trump. On a July 10 episode of his \"Flagrant\" podcast, Schulz complained about Trump, \"Everything he campaigned on, I believe he wanted to do, and now he’s doing the exact opposite thing of every single f---ing thing.\" Schulz specifically called out the president over increasing the national debt, funding foreign wars and the recent announcement that there was no Jeffrey Epstein \"client list.\" \"There’ll be people, they’ll DM and say, ‘You see what your boy’s doing? You voted for this.’ I’m like, ‘I voted for none of this!’ He’s doing the exact opposite of everything I’ve voted for!\" he said at the time. Fox News' Greg Wehner contributed to this report.

I immediately took to the Senate floor to set the record straight about how the Republicans’ “One Big, Beautiful” law strengthens Medicaid. \n\nHere’s what I said:\n\nI just heard the minority leader once again come to the United States Senate chamber and cry wolf. This time it’s about Medicaid reform.\n\nLet’s be very clear: We need to strengthen Medicaid, and we did that in the bill that we just passed and was signed into law. But the minority leader once again puts fear above the facts. \n\nHe’s upset because Republicans are asking able-bodied adults to work if they want to receive taxpayer-funded health care benefits. He also is upset because Republicans think that illegal immigrants should not receive Medicaid benefits. \n\nLet me set the record straight: Medicaid is for the vulnerable. It was never meant to cover able-bodied, working-age adults who refuse to work. Nor was it meant to cover illegal immigrants, which the Democrats continue to embrace. \n\nToday, there are more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants receiving Medicaid benefits. Today, there are 4.8 million able-bodied, working-age adults who refuse to work who are on Medicaid. That doesn’t strengthen Medicaid. It strains it. It weakens it. It makes it harder for the people who need Medicaid, those who Medicaid was designed for. \n\nIt also wastes taxpayer dollars. \n\nWork requirements are common sense. They used to be bipartisan. Democrat President Bill Clinton signed that into law in the 1990s. Democrat President Obama defended it in 2008. Obama said work must be the “centerpiece of any social policy.”\n\nDemocrats today don’t believe that. They think Clinton was wrong. They think Obama was wrong. They’re for laziness, and they’re for illegal immigrants. The Democrats today are defending dependency, rather than independence. That’s what they’re doing today. That’s what Schumer did on the floor of the United States Senate. \n\nRepublicans believe in a safety net—a safety net to help people reach their full potential, to get back up on their feet. We believe in hard work. We believe in work as part of somebody’s identity—their dignity, their self-worth, how they view themselves, a role model for their children. \n\nIf you’re healthy and refuse to work, it’s a choice you may want to make. But don’t expect the taxpayers to pay for it. No child, no pregnant woman, or disabled person will lose coverage. But what the Democrats want to do is remove work requirements and continue to fund Medicaid for illegal immigrants.

(AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\n\nThe monthly jobs report is already closely-watched on Wall Street and in Washington but has taken on a new importance after President Donald Trump on Friday fired the official who oversees it. Trump claimed that June's employment figures were \"RIGGED\" to make him and other Republicans \"look bad.\" Yet he provided no evidence and even the official Trump had appointed in his first term to oversee the report, William Beach, condemned the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics appointed by former President Joe Biden. The firing followed Friday's jobs report that showed hiring was weak in July and had come to nearly a standstill in May and June, right after Trump rolled out sweeping tariffs.

Yet Friday's revisions were unusually large - the largest, outside of a recession, in five decades. And the surveys used to compile the report are facing challenges from declining response rates, particularly since COVID, as fewer companies complete the surveys. Nonetheless, that hasn't led most economists to doubt them. \"The bottom line for me is, I wouldn't take the low collection rate as any evidence that the numbers are less reliable,\" Omair Sharif, founder and chief economist at Inflation Insights, a consulting firm, said.Live Events Many academics, statisticians and economists have warned for some time that declining budgets were straining the government's ability to gather economic data. There were several government commissions studying ways to improve things like survey response rates, but the Trump administration disbanded them earlier this year. Heather Boushey, a top economic adviser in the Biden White House, noted that without Trump's firing of McEntarfer, there would be more focus on last week's data, which points to a slowing economy. \"We're having this conversation about made-up issues to distract us from what the data is showing,\" Boushey said. \"Revisions of this magnitude in a negative direction may indicate bad things to come for the labor market.\" Here are some things to know about the jobs report: Economists and Wall Street trust the data Most economists say that the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a nonpolitical agency staffed by people obsessed with getting the numbers right. The only political appointee is the commissioner, who doesn't see the data until it's finalized, two days before it is issued to the public. Erica Groshen, the BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017, said she suggested different language in the report to \"liven it up\", but was shot down. She was told that if asked to describe a cup as half-empty or half-full, BLS says \"it is an eight ounce cup with four ounces of liquid.\" The revised jobs data that has attracted Trump's ire is actually more in line with other figures than before the revision. For example, payroll processor ADP uses data from its millions of clients to calculate its own jobs report, and it showed a sharp hiring slowdown in May and June that is closer to the revised BLS data. Trump and his White House have a long track record of celebrating the jobs numbers - when they are good. These are the figures Trump is attacking Trump has focused on the revisions to the May and June data, which on Friday were revised lower, with job gains in May reduced to 19,000 from 144,000, and for June to just 14,000 from 147,000. Every month's jobs data is revised in the following two months. Trump also repeated a largely inaccurate attack from the campaign about an annual revision last August, which reduced total employment in the United States by 818,000, or about 0.5%. The government also revises employment figures every year. Trump charged the annual revision was released before the 2024 presidential election to \"boost\" Vice President Kamala Harris's \"chances of Victory,\" yet it was two months before the election and widely reported at the time that the revision lowered hiring during the Biden-Harris administration and pointed to a weaker economy. Here's why the government revises the data The monthly revisions occur because many companies that respond to the government's surveys send their data in late, or correct the figures they've already submitted. The proportion of companies sending in their data later has risen in the past decade. Every year, the BLS does an additional revision based on actual job counts that are derived from state unemployment insurance records. Those figures cover 95% of U.S. businesses and aren't derived from a survey but are not available in real time. These are the factors that cause revisions Figuring out how many new jobs have been added or lost each month is more complicated than it may sound. For example, if one person takes a second job, should you focus on the number of jobs, which has increased, or the number of employed people, which hasn't? (The government measures both: The unemployment rate is based on how many people either have or don't have jobs, while the number of jobs added or lost is counted separately). Each month, the government surveys about 121,000 businesses and government agencies at over 630,000 locations - including multiple locations for the same business - covering about one-third of all workers. Still, the government also has to make estimates: What if a company goes out of business? It likely won't fill out any forms showing the jobs lost. And what about new businesses? They can take a while to get on the government's radar. The BLS seeks to capture these trends by estimating their impact on employment. Those estimates can be wrong, of course, until they are fixed by the annual revisions. The revisions are often larger around turning points in the economy. For example, when the economy is growing, there may be more startups than the government expects, so revisions will be higher. If the economy is slowing or slipping into a recession, the revisions may be larger on the downside. Here's why the May and June revisions may have been so large Ernie Tedeschi, an economic adviser to the Biden administration, points to the current dynamics of the labor market: Both hiring and firing have sharply declined, and fewer Americans are quitting their jobs to take other work. As a result, most of the job gains or losses each month are probably occurring at new companies, or those going out of business. And those are the ones the government uses models to estimate, which can make them more volatile. Groshen also points out that since the pandemic there has been a surge of new start-up companies, after many Americans lost their jobs or sought more independence. Yet they may not have created as many jobs as startups did pre-COVID, which throws off the government's models. Revisions seem to be getting bigger The revisions to May and June's job totals, which reduced hiring by a total of 258,000, were the largest - outside recessions - since 1967, according to economists at Goldman Sachs. Kevin Hassett, Trump's top economic adviser, went on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday and said, \"What we've seen over the last few years is massive revisions to the jobs numbers.\" Hassett blamed a sharp drop in response rates to the government's surveys during and after the pandemic: \"When COVID happened, because response rates went down a lot, then revision rates skyrocketed.\" Yet calculations by Tedeschi show that while revisions spiked after the pandemic, they have since declined and are much smaller than in the 1960s and 1970s. Other concerns about the government's data Many economists and statisticians have sounded the alarm about things like declining response rates for years. A decade ago, about 60% of companies surveyed by BLS responded. Now, only about 40% do. The decline has been an international phenomenon, particularly since COVID. The United Kingdom has even suspended publication of an official unemployment rate because of falling responses. And earlier this year the BLS said that it was cutting back on its collection of inflation data because of the Trump administration's hiring freeze, raising concerns about the robustness of price data just as economists are trying to gauge the impact of tariffs on inflation. U.S. government statistical agencies have seen an inflation-adjusted 16% drop in funding since 2009, according to a July report from the American Statistical Association. \"We are at an inflection point,\" the report said. \"To meet current and future challenges requires thoughtful, well-planned investment ...

National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard claimed at a White House news conference last month that top Obama administration officials carried out a “treasonous conspiracy” against Donald Trump. Gabbard said she was sending criminal referrals to the Justice Department. A former senior Justice Department official condemned the move as “a dangerous political stunt.” And a former senior national security official pointed out that multiple past reviews, including ones conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes. \"There’s no logical, rational basis for this,\" said the official, who asked not to be named. The senior Trump administration official said that there is no exact timetable for when the grand jury will meet and that it could take months for the proceeding to begin. Fox News first reported Bondi's letter. The official said a letter signed by Bondi instructs an unnamed federal prosecutor to begin presenting evidence to a grand jury to secure potential federal indictments. But the letter does not say what the charges would be, whom the grand jury will investigate or where it will meet. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of seeking to distract attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case. Conservative media and influencers have criticized how the administration has handled the case and demand the release of more documents and information. Trump, Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have all been criticized by conservative media and influencers over their handling of the Epstein investigation and material related to it. A 2020 bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review contradicted the idea that there was a conspiracy by the Obama administration officials against Trump, finding significant evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Then-Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the acting chair of the committee at the time, signed off on the report. The plans for a grand jury investigation are the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration designed to rewrite the history of the 2016 election and seek retribution against those whom Trump accuses of trying to sabotage his first term in the White House. Democratic lawmakers and former senior officials say Trump and his deputies have used the tools of government authority to try to “rewrite” the history of the 2016 election, seeking to reverse an eight-year-old assessment that Russia waged an information war to boost Trump’s candidacy. Trump and his supporters have long claimed that intelligence and law enforcement officials sought to undermine his first term by overstating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and investigating Trump’s aides over their possible contacts with Moscow. They have accused former FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan of using the probes to undermine Trump. A lawyer for Comey did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Comey and Brennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC News and MSNBC, have denied wrongdoing. The intelligence community’s analysis of the 2016 election and subsequent government investigations failed to satisfy the far-right and far-left sides of the American political divide. A probe by special counsel Robert Mueller found that Russia intervened in 2016 to undercut Hillary Clinton. But it did not find evidence that the Trump team colluded with the Kremlin, as some voices on the left had suggested. At the same time, the special counsel Trump appointed in his first term, John Durham, disappointed far-right activists with his three-year investigation. Durham found no criminal conspiracy among Obama administration officials to fabricate intelligence about Russia’s actions in 2016. He also filed no charges against the intelligence officers who oversaw a 2017 assessment that found Russia had tried to skew the election outcome in Trump’s favor. Trump, as president and candidate, has depicted former President Barack Obama and other former administration officials in prison garb and called for their imprisonments. He has also posted an artificial intelligence video of himself smiling as a fake depiction of Obama is arrested by FBI agents and put into jail.","summary":"Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed DOJ prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia's actions during the 2016 election.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/pam-bondi-orders-grand-jury-probe-obama-admin-review-2016-election-rcna223016","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250803-pam-bondi-ew-648p-cf5575.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 00:32:25","author":"Dan de Luce,David Rohde,Michael Kosnar,Vaughn Hillyard","authors":["Dan de Luce","David Rohde","Michael Kosnar","Vaughn Hillyard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":348175356,"title":"Wayne Gretzky, Matthew Tkachuk to join Donald Trump's new Initiative alongside Triple H, NFL commissioner, and other sports pros","text":"Florida Panthers star Matthew Tkachuk and NHL legend Wayne Gretzky will be among the high-profile professional athletes to join US President Donald Trump’s President’s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.In an executive order signed on July 31, President Trump ordered the revocation of previous iterations of the council and the creation of a new one, which would align with the administration’s health agenda.Among the numerous athletes invited to join, Matthew Tkachuk and Wayne Gretzky join other elite-level athletes like wrestler Triple H, Harrison Butker, Jack Nicklaus, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Requests for feedback submission will soon go out to all central ministries, autonomous bodies as well as state governments, officials at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said.Unveiled in October 2023, the first IndiaAI report had laid out the full fulcrum of India's AI aspirations, with detailed inputs from seven working groups. These had recommended the setting up of 3 AI centres of excellence, development of large, multimodal AI foundation models trained on Indian languages and datasets, and driving cross-sector development in areas like health, agriculture, education and governance through AI.\"The previous report had laid out the foundational strategy and roadmap for India's national approach to artificial intelligence. The next one is planned to build on it to further fine tune targets to meet the goals under the Viksit Bharat 2047 initiative,\" an official said.With the approval of the IndiaAI Mission, the government had allocated Rs 10,300 crore over five years beginning March 2024 to strengthen AI capabilities. The upcoming report may call for augmenting that amount considering the central position that AI has acquired in innovation and governance since then, he said.The government wants solutions to emerge for large-scale re-skilling of the technological workforce, much of which in India's IT industry remains anxious of retrenchments due to AI. Similar to last time, senior executives from the private sector and academicians are expected to be part of the working groups that will give recommendations for the report.Establishing computing power would also be a key focus, people in the know said. While the government had initially targeted the development of a high-end common computing facility equipped with 10,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), India has successfully overshot the mark by empanelling 34,333 GPUs through the IndiaAI Compute platform. But the government is wary of export controls on critical hardware being placed by foreign governments, specifically the US.Under the previous Joe Biden administration's Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Framework, the US had placed India among Tier-2 countries with a volume cap of 50,000 H100-equivalent GPUs through 2027. Under Donald Trump, US’ new AI policy has called for exporting the full US AI technology stack to 'allied nations' willing to join America’s AI alliance, but also stresses on denying foreign adversaries access to US compute power citing geostrategic competition and national security. These two categories are not defined, and India would need to quickly find its feet, an official said.\"This and other geopolitical challenges such as the rapidly evolving AI power dynamics beyond nations have pushed the government to hold the summit in India next year,” this official said. “It will build on the 2025 AI Action Summit in Paris co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The stock is up less than 2% through July 31. Contrast this to digital advertising and AI rival Meta Platforms, which saw shares jump over 30% in that time.\n\nHowever, after its second-quarter earnings report beat Wall Street expectations, Alphabet stock began to climb and is hovering not far from the 52-week high of $207.05 set in February. The recent resurgence could signal a turning point.\n\nAs a result, now is a good time to evaluate whether an investment in Alphabet makes sense. Doing so requires digging into where the tech giant stands today.\n\nAlphabet's recent performance\n\nExcellent second-quarter results understandably boosted its stock. Revenue was up a strong 14% year over year to $96.4 billion. Net income rose to $28.2 billion, a 19% increase compared to 2024.\n\nConsequently, diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 22% year over year to $2.31, exceeding Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.18. While this growth is impressive, a key reason to consider investing in Alphabet is its success in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to CEO Sundar Pichai, Google's search traffic is growing year over year, \"and our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage.\" AI's boost to Google is noteworthy, since the search engine accounted for $54.2 billion of Alphabet's $96.4 billion in second-quarter sales.\n\nAI is also benefiting Alphabet's other businesses, such as Google Cloud. That division saw second-quarter revenue rise an impressive 32% year over year to $13.6 billion as customers were drawn to Google Cloud's AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence also plays a crucial role in (literally) driving Alphabet's autonomous car service, Waymo. With that technology behind the wheel, it delivers over a quarter-million passenger trips every week.\n\nThe company is slowly expanding Waymo to more cities. Atlanta is the latest location, initiated in June, adding to places such as Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.\n\nWaymo also signed a multiyear deal with Avis in July, as the rental car company expands into ride-hailing services, providing Waymo with operational support, including vehicle maintenance.\n\nFactors to consider with an Alphabet investment\n\nThe company is determined to be a leader in AI. That's why it has made prodigious capital expenditures (capex) to boost its AI infrastructure. The second quarter's $22.4 billion in capex represented the highest sum yet in any given quarter over the past four, and far above the $13.2 billion spent in the prior year's second quarter.\n\nIts huge spending left the company with $5.3 billion in second-quarter free cash flow (FCF). While that amount is down from the previous year's $13.2 billion, a single quarter's dip is not a concern. Alphabet has exceptional ability to generate FCF, producing a princely sum of $66.7 billion over the trailing 12 months.\n\nThe larger issue is that Alphabet was found guilty of antitrust violations in its digital advertising and Google Search businesses. This has been a factor in the tepid performance of its stock.\n\nThe courts have yet to announce the company's punishment, but once it's made public, the shares are likely to be affected to some degree, depending on the consequences to its business.\n\nManagement is appealing the rulings, and this could cause the antitrust cases to drag on for years, according to Pichai.\n\nAs a result, the threat to Alphabet's business isn't immediate. And ultimately, the legal challenges could be resolved with minimal impact, as was the result in a similar antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which concluded in a settlement.\n\nTo buy or not to buy Alphabet shares\n\nIn weighing whether to invest in Alphabet, one factor to consider is share price valuation. This can be assessed using its stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, especially in comparison to competitors Microsoft and Meta. Both compete with Alphabet in digital advertising, while Microsoft is also a rival in cloud computing.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nThe chart above shows that Alphabet's P/E multiple is the lowest compared to Meta and Microsoft, suggesting its stock is the best value versus the competition. This is underscored by the fact the company's earnings multiple is lower than it's been over the past year, up until President Donald Trump's announcement of tariff policy changes in April sank the entire stock market.\n\nAlthough the antitrust cases present short-term uncertainty, the company's deep pockets and commitment to battling the court rulings can help it navigate these challenges. With strong financials, successful AI initiatives, and an attractive valuation, now is a good time to consider buying shares in Alphabet.","summary":"Alphabet's AI-driven sales growth may be signaling a turning point for the company's beleaguered stock.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/04/is-now-the-time-to-buy-alphabet-googl-stock/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F827010%2Fai-robot-predicting-stock-performance_gettyimages-1150684716-1200x675-c2b5ff2.png&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 00:30:00","author":"Robert Izquierdo","authors":["Robert Izquierdo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":348183886,"title":"Trump to sign executive order establishing Olympics task force ahead of 2028 Los Angeles Games","text":"President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to create a White House Olympics task force for security purposes and other issues ahead of the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.

History Says It's Unlikely, but 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks It Can Happen","text":"The S&P 500 has been on a wild, nearly three-year bull run. Sure, the benchmark index has experienced its ups and downs, most notably in early April when President Donald Trump's initial tariff announcements sent stocks plunging. But it only took a few months for the S&P 500 to recover, and it's now up 6% this year, as of this writing.\n\nThis follows strong showings in 2023 and 2024, when the index rose 24% and 23%, respectively. With the market continuing to inch higher and about five months to go in 2025, can the S&P 500 do the unthinkable and rise over 20% for three consecutive years? History says it's unlikely, but one Wall Street strategist thinks it will happen.\n\nIt's only happened one other time in nearly 100 years\n\nThe stock market's performance in 2023 and 2024 was incredible, but if the S&P 500 somehow manages to claw another 13% higher from here, it would be nearly unprecedented. Looking back nearly a century, such a winning streak has only happened one other time.\n\nThirty years ago, in the run-up to the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 delivered more than 20% annual price gains from 1995 through 1998, and it was less than half a percentage point shy of doing so in 1999.\n\nSome believe the stock market is currently on a similar trajectory to what it experienced in the 1990s. During that time, the internet boom created tremendous enthusiasm as investors rightly predicted the new technology would go on to transform society. What they missed is that technological disruptions rarely move in a straight line, and the late 1990s was also a time of low interest rates.\n\nToday, the stock market is being powered by the artificial intelligence boom, which has sent a small group of companies to meteoric valuations. Some now have multitrillion-dollar market caps. Interest rates aren't exactly low, although one could argue the market may still be riding high from a decade of zero interest rate policy and lots of quantitative easing.\n\nThis Wall Street analyst sees a back-half surge in 2025\n\nRecently, Oppenheimer strategist John Stoltzfus put out a research note, predicting the S&P 500 would hit 7,100 by the end of the year, implying a roughly 21% move in 2025. \n\nPart of Stoltzfus' call has to do with progress the Trump administration is making on trade negotiations. Deals have begun to come in and the agreements between Japan and the European Union are enough to provide clarity to investors and remove the uncertainty that has prevented the market from moving even higher, according to Stoltzfus. As part of the deals, the U.S. will impose 15% tariffs on goods from Japan and the E.U., and both will also make hundreds of billions of investments in the U.S.\n\n\"Fundamentals are improving. Look at the [3%] GDP print today. It ain't perfect, but it's certainly a lot better than the crew that was thinking we were going into a recession was thinking [...] in addition to that, you've got earnings expectations not only meeting but beyond expectations another quarter so far,\" Stoltzfus said on a recent interview with Yahoo! Finance.\n\nTrump has just imposed new higher tariff rates on some countries as of this writing. However, the situation remains fluid, so the higher rates may not be final.\n\nThere's still near-term risk\n\nI would agree with Stoltzfus that a recession seems unlikely, at least in the near term when you consider recent economic data. However, there has also been data suggesting that macro conditions are beginning to deteriorate. \n\nThere's also another big risk if inflation does not fall to the Federal Reserve's preferred 2% target. After all, the strong second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) report suggests that economic activity is quite robust. Tariff rates are also still coming in higher than expected, with most at 15% or above, and it's very possible this will create a one-time surge in inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will not cut rates this year if he doesn't believe inflation is under control, unless there is a real downturn in the job market. If rate cuts don't materialize this year, that could take some of the wind out of the market's sails.\n\nUltimately, the S&P 500 could manage to eke out a solid year, but delivering another 20%-plus gain is more of a bull-case scenario than a base case, as things stand now.","summary":"The S&P 500 is coming off strong years in 2023 and 2024.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/04/will-the-sp-500-index-do-the-unthinkable-and-rise/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F827584%2Fperson-computer-1.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 00:15:00","author":"Bram Berkowitz","authors":["Bram Berkowitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":348178492,"title":"India News | Shiv Sena Appoints Shaina NC as National Spokesperson of Party","text":"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], August 5 (ANI): Shiv Sena appointed Shaina NC as its national spokesperson on Monday, the ruling party said in a release.\nIn a post on X, Shaina NC thanked the people of Mumbaidevi for their support.\nAlso Read | India Responds to US President Donald Trump's 'Hefty Tariffs' Threats Over Russian Oil Purchase, Calls It 'Unjustified and Unreasonable'.\nhttps://x.com/ShainaNC/status/1860545597260091443 \"I thank the people of Mumbadevi for their support by giving me 40,146 votes, the highest ever a Shiv Sena- BJP candidate has got in the assembly election in Mumbadevi.

But the authors – Charlie Savage and Adam Goldman – misdirected their readers' attention from the start to a non-issue, with the help of a literally false headline claiming Durham found certain documents in the Annex to have been \"faked\" by Russian intelligence. That’s the basis upon which the Times, Washington Post, Politico, network news, and other legacy media have myopically focused their reporting on the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation of President Trump – which we know was \"faked\" by the FBI, CIA, and Obama White House. JONATHAN TURLEY: DEMOCRATS PULLED THE GREATEST POLITICAL CON JOB EVER ON AMERICANS. IT'S FINALLY UNRAVELING Part of Durham’s investigation looked into why the FBI did NOTHING – literally – after first receiving the Russian intelligence information in late July 2016, as contrasted with how the FBI reacted to information nearly 60 days old received from an Australian diplomat about a meeting in a London bar. The Annex includes previously classified information on the receipt of \"Special Intelligence\" throughout the first part of 2016 from a friendly foreign government, showing Russia’s seemingly real-time knowledge of the inner machinations of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The Annex is a document authored by Durham’s team. Since the source documents upon which the Russian memos were based were not provided – or at least not made public – the accuracy of Russian memos’ paraphrasing/referencing to the source documents is unknown. All those qualifiers go to the work of \"analysis\" – what is this document, where does it originate, what does it say, what does it rely upon, can it be corroborated separately, what is our level of confidence in accepting the contents as accurate at face value, etc.? Two items that have attracted the most attention, and which the Times' stories focus on, are \"emails\" purportedly written by Leonard Bernardo, dated July 25 and July 27, 2016. Bernardo worked for a George Soros-related entity. His emails were hacked, and he had communications with senior Clinton campaign officials. The Annex does not have actual \"emails\" as you might find them on Bernardo’s computer or a recipient’s computer – they have none of the typical email formatting. What they appear to be are \"retyped\" versions of the text in the body of emails into a Russian language memo, the Russian memo was translated into English, with Durham \"cutting & pasting\" the English translation into his report. The July 25 \"email\" includes the allegation that Hillary Clinton approved a plan conceived by a \"foreign policy adviser\" to \"vilify\" then-candidate Donald Trump by falsely linking him to Russia Pres. Putin. As for the Russian language memo – we don’t know the date -- Durham provides an English translation that includes the following: \"According to data from the election campaign headquarters of Hillary Clinton, obtained via the U.S. Soros Foundation, on July 26, 2016, Clinton approved a plan by her policy advisor Juliana Smith … to smear Donald Trump by magnifying the scandal tied to the intrusion Russian special services in the pre-election process to benefit the Republican candidate.\" The Russian memo says next \"As envisioned by Smith….\" This suggests that maybe among the documents supporting the memo is a description of Smith’s plan either by Smith herself or someone else familiar enough with the details to describe it. \"As envisioned by Smith, raising the theme of 'Putin’s support for Trump' to the level of the Olympic scandal would divert constituents’ attention from the investigation of Clinton’s compromised electronic correspondence.\" The Russian memo, which had to have been written after July 27 since it had contents from a July 27 email in it, describes precisely what followed over the next 100 days leading up to the election – establishing \"Putin’s support for Trump\" was the goal of the supposed \"plan.\" The Russian memo goes on: \"…by subsequently steering public opinion towards the notion that it [the public] needs to equate ‘Putin’s efforts’ to influence political processes in the United States via cyberspace to acts against critically important infrastructure (resembling a national power supply network) would force the White House [read \"OBAMA\"] to use more confrontational scenarios vis-à-vis Moscow….\" The memo says the Clinton campaign will seek to blow up the significance of Russian election interference – which happens in every election – by equating it to an attack on vital national infrastructure, and link Putin and Trump together in the effort, i.e., any election interference by Putin is really a proxy for an attack on democracy by Trump. FBI'S CONTROVERSIAL TRUMP-RUSSIA ACTIONS PREDICTED WITH 'ALARMING SPECIFICITY' BY FOREIGN ACTORS: SOURCES Either the Russian intelligence services are clairvoyant and should be playing the lottery every week, or they wandered into a trove of correspondence between people associated with the Clinton campaign describing precisely the game plan executed by the campaign, and White House, CIA, and FBI on its behalf. The July 27 email attributed to Bernardo is also relatively short in terms of what Durham sets forth as the verbatim text taken from the Russian memo, and it confirms that Clinton approved \"Julia’s idea.\" The Times' authors falsely reported that Durham called the two Bernardo emails \"fake\" – and said that they were \"concocted\" by Russian intelligence. Hence, according to the Times, all the controversy surrounding the release of Annex materials was made irrelevant by that finding. But Durham didn’t conclude the emails were fake. What did he conclude? His team’s \"best assessment\" was that they were \"composites\" – some portion of the text of each was taken from other sources and combined into the text that appeared under Bernardo’s name as an \"email.\" It is clear that Bernardo did not write them, i.e., they are not \"authentic.\" But it is also clear that some amount of the content in each was accurate – and predicted events that would unfold over the next 100 days. Durham reached that conclusion only after a long and involved process designed to understand both what the emails were, and how much of the content of the Special Intelligence was accurate. Everything – and I mean everything -- Durham did to answer those questions were things the FBI chose to NOT DO in or after August 2016. Durham asked intelligence analysts – FBI and CIA presumably – if the emails appeared authentic. Most said that they did. Some noted that Bernardo was, in fact, a victim of hacking by the Russians, so it would not be surprising if his emails were in the Russians’ hands. It was noted by some that the Russians could have fabricated or altered the original information taken from the source documents. Just the fact that some analysts believed the emails appeared to be authentic should have been enough to push the FBI into action. But it did nothing. Durham interviewed Bernardo and showed him the emails. The FBI never did that. Bernardo said he did not recognize them, and there was language in them that he would not have used -- specifically the sentence \"Later the FBI will put more oil into the fire.\" Judging intelligence translated from a foreign language is tricky. Bernardo denied using that phrase, but how far off is that from a very similar phrase more commonly used by a native English speaker – \"Pour gas onto the fire\"? Bernardo’s original document would have been in English – then translated to Russian – then the Russian version translated back to English. That’s how \"gas onto the fire\" ends up as \"oil into the fire.\" Bernardo also said he did not know who \"Julie\" was as referenced in the July 25 email. But he noted that the final sentence in the July 25 email – that \"things are ghastly for US-Russian relations\" was phrased as something that he would write. Durham gathered documents with grand jury subpoenas and search warrants. He looked for the documents obtained by Russian hackers. As for the July 25 and July 27 emails, Durham did not find those among the emails of the Soros Foundation. But he found other emails – either emails or attachments to emails sent by people other than Bernardo – with language identical to Bernardo. Specifically, a passage in the July 25 email was taken directly from an email written by Tim Mauer, who worked for the Carnegie Endowment as a cyber expert. Mauer had never seen the Bernardo emails but agreed that one passage was taken from an email he had sent to colleagues at Carnegie – also hacked by the Russians. Durham also interviewed Julianne Smith, who was a Clinton campaign foreign policy advisor, and who did involve herself in efforts to amplify the threat of the Putin-Trump relationship to U.S. national security. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It is noteworthy that Durham begins this portion as follows: \"Smith stated she did not specifically remember proposing a plan to Clinton or other Campaign leadership to try to tie Trump to Putin and Russia.\" That phrasing is never accidental – \"did not specifically remember\" leaves much room to extricate oneself if a document emerges later that says what it is you claim to not remember. Agents are trained to note such phrases exactly as stated by the person being interviewed. Smith did say \"it was possible\" she had proposed ideas to campaign leadership \"who may have approved those ideas.\" Again – Durham is showing her emails about a \"Clinton Plan\" she supposedly hatched, and she cannot be confident what other documents he might have that he isn’t showing her. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While she didn’t remember much of anything about anything, the one thing she was certain of is that she would never have made a proposal that had as part of its execution the involvement of the FBI in furtherance of the effort. Prior to Durham, the FBI did none of this – and has never offered an explanation for why. THAT was the point made by Durham’s Annex.

Whether you intend to live on this income or reinvest it to bolster your portfolio's overall growth, there are several great dividend-paying options out there right now. Here's a closer look at three of your best bets at this time, not despite each stock's recent turbulence and mostly bearish drama but because of it.\n\nUnited Parcel Service\n\nYou probably already know that United Parcel Service's (UPS 0.50%) revenue dwindled after soaring during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking a similar toll on the bottom line. Indeed, the delivery giant's business has been stagnant -- at best -- since 2022. Its second-quarter sales and income both fell on the order of 1% year over year, extending its anemic results in the meantime. The amount of business and pricing power that was in place just four years ago simply isn't there anymore.\n\nUPS stock's 63% pullback from its 2022 peak to yet another new multiyear low reached earlier this month, however, is overdone at the exact wrong time to price in such pessimism.\n\nNot every investor will immediately agree with this assessment. The threat of a lingering tariff war continues to threaten United Parcel Service's business following its post-pandemic slowdown. The company isn't exactly helping its stock either, opting not to offer any guidance with its recently released Q2 report, after which CEO Carol Tomé lamented during the quarterly earnings call that \"for our sector, this remains a very unsettling time.\"\n\nThere's an argument to be made, however, that all the worst-case scenario is now priced in at a time when things are on the verge of turning around. The decision to make fewer but more profitable deliveries has already been enacted, for instance. And the company has already cut $3.5 billion worth of annual overhead, with total yearly savings of $6 billion being targeted further down the road. It's just going to take a little more time to make and see the adjustment to such changes. The backdrop is still quite bullish in the meantime, though.\n\nAn outlook from Mordor Intelligence suggests the global parcel delivery market is set to grow at an average annual pace of just over 5% through 2030, jibing with expectations from Global Market Insights. That's better growth than we've seen at any point since the wind-down of the coronavirus contagion.\n\nNewcomers will not only be plugging into UPS while its forward-looking yield stands at 7.4%, but while the stock's priced dirt cheap -- at only 13 times this year's analyst-expected per-share earnings of $6.64. It's not going to get much cheaper than that.\n\nIt's a tough time to be excited about owning any pharmaceutical stocks, but especially Pfizer (PFE 0.32%). Not only is the federal government looking to force drugmakers to offer better prices to its Medicare program, but Pfizer still hasn't restored the revenue it lost once the need for its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment evaporated in 2023.\n\nThat's the chief reason shares have been more than halved since late 2021. Well, that and the fact that the company is technically dishing out more in dividends than it's earning while it's facing a handful of patent expirations in the foreseeable future.\n\nJust don't lose perspective here. On any of it.\n\nTake its underfunded dividend as an example. It's not actually underfunded. Last year's reported per-share earnings of $1.41 were less than the full-year dividend payout of $1.68 per share, but that figure reflected a one-time accounting charge. Stripping this expense out of the equation reinflates earnings to a more normalized figure of $3.11 per share, easily covering its dividend.\n\nPfizer also has replacements in the works for all its COVID drugs that are less needed, as well as its drugs with patents set to expire in the foreseeable future. Vepdegestrant (for ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer) and sigvotatug vedotin (for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer) are both in late-stage trials now, for instance, as part of a developmental pipeline that consists of around 50 oncology drugs.\n\nAlthough none of these drugs are going to be approved and marketed in the immediate future, the company is aiming to launch at least eight new cancer drugs by 2030. The market could begin rewarding their eventual success much sooner, though.\n\nThe company's also looking to enter the multibillion-dollar weight-loss market with its own GLP-1 receptor agonist, which is based on the same basic science as well-known semaglutide.\n\nAnd as for the threat of lower drug prices for Medicare-covered patients, don't read too much into it. This threat remains in permanent circulation and rarely causes as much trouble as feared. As BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan David Seigerman noted back in May, when President Donald Trump first ramped up his rhetoric on the matter, his plan \"could be more rhetoric than actual implementable policy.\" In other words, it's more bark than bite.\n\nDon't be surprised to see Pfizer shares start climbing again once more investors start connecting all these dots, particularly given how their weakness has inflated the stock's forward-looking dividend yield to 7.2%.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nFinally, add defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.70%) to your list of dividend stocks to buy with bigger amounts of capital while its forward-looking dividend yield is a respectable 3.1%.\n\nIt's yet another victim of federal budget cuts...both real and feared. In June, for instance, the U.S. Department of Defense halved its previous order of F-35 fighter jets (which account for more than one-fourth of Lockheed's annual revenue) for the government's fiscal year beginning in October. That followed March's news that the DoD chose Boeing rather than Lockheed to manufacture the next-generation F-47 fighter plane... a contract that could have been worth hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of many, many years. Meanwhile, support for Ukraine in its conflict against Russia appears to be waning, potentially crimping deliveries of new weaponry to the region. All told, Lockheed Martin shares are down more than 30% from October's peak and still testing new 52-week lows on these worries. .\n\nOnce again, though, don't lose perspective. The U.S. military may not need as many F-35 fighter planes as it thought it would in the year ahead, nor does it want Lockheed-Martin to manufacture its next generation of fighter jets. It still needs much of Lockheed's weapons and military hardware, though, like its newly unveiled artificial intelligence-powered synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that facilitates airborne maritime surveillance or its new magnetic anomaly detection technology (capable of finding submerged submarines) for its Sikorsky MH-60R \"Seahawk\" maritime helicopters. And just last month, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency added another $2 billion to an $8.3 billion contract with Lockheed to provide it with terminal high-altitude area defense (THAAD) interceptor missiles.\n\nSure, investors would love to see strong and sustained demand for the F-35, which generates maintenance revenue long after the purchase of the aircraft is completed. Shareholders would have also been thrilled to see the company win the F-47 contract to the same reason. Lockheed Martin still has a range of ways to monetize its military hardware know-how for the long haul, though.\n\nLet's also not forget that one of the few things the United States' two major political parties agree on is the need to fully fund the nation's ability to defend itself and its interests. Even in the face of economic uncertainty, the U.S. Senate's overseeing panel recently approved a defense budget of $852 billion for the upcoming year, up just a bit from this year's figure and extending a multiyear growth trend that isn't apt to slow anytime soon.\n\nAdmittedly, Lockheed stock's 3.1% yield isn't huge. It's based on a dividend; however, that's now been raised for 22 consecutive years. So close to becoming dividend royalty, it's unlikely the company's going to stop raising its annual dividend payments now.","summary":"Thanks to some misguided short-term setbacks, investors can scoop up a trio of dividend-paying bargains here.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/04/the-smartest-dividend-stocks-to-buy-with-10000-rig/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F827800%2Fthinking-man-at-a-desk-reviewing-paperwork.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 00:05:00","author":"James Brumley","authors":["James Brumley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":348182832,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Virginia Giuffre's Mar-a-Lago Secrets — Epstein Sex Slave Revealed Details About Meeting Pedo At Trump's Compound In Unpublished Memoir...After Prez Claimed She Was 'Stolen' From His Staff","text":"Virginia Giuffre’s unpublished memoir reveals explosive new details about how she was lured into Jeffrey Epstein’s world, and it all started at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago, RadarOnline.com can reveal.A Life Ruining Meeting At Mar-A-LagoIn her unpublished manuscript Billionaire’s Playboy Club, Giuffre described being approached by Ghislaine Maxwell while working at the spa at Trump’s exclusive Palm Beach club. \n\nThe socialite offered to introduce her to a \"wealthy man\" looking for massage therapists.

I think she worked in the spa, I think so. I think that was one of the people – yeah, he stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know. None whatsoever,” Trump said in the stunning interview.He continued: \"People that work in the spa, I have a great spa, one of the best spas in the world at Mar-a-Lago, and people were taken out of the spa, hired by him… And other people would come and complain, ‘This guy is taking people from the spa.’ I didn’t know that.\n\n\"And then when I heard about it, I told him. I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our people.’ Whether it was spa or not spa, I don’t want him taking people.

It also prohibited hostile acts such as the launch of leaflet balloons.\n\nHowever, the framework began to unravel in November 2023, when the Constitutional Court struck down the provision that had effectively banned leaflets from being flown across the border.\nThen president Yoon Suk-yeol’s administration also resumed reconnaissance flights in response to North Korea’s military satellite launch. Pyongyang retaliated with blaring broadcasts of jarring sounds and waves of garbage-filled balloons floated across the border – psychological tactics observers said were intended to provoke and unsettle the South.\nSouth Korea reinstalled its loudspeakers last June and resumed border broadcasts for the first time in six years, responding directly to the North’s balloon campaign. The loudspeaker broadcasts had only previously been used intermittently, particularly following North Korea’s last nuclear test in 2016.\nSince taking office in early June, President Lee has moved swiftly to cool tensions, reversing his predecessor’s confrontational policies, halting the broadcasts, urging civic groups to stop launching anti-regime leaflets and expressing hope that these gestures might reopen channels for engagement.\n\nPyongyang responded by ceasing its own broadcasts and balloon launches, but has maintained that it has no intention of re-engaging with Seoul.\nStill, North Korea has signalled it may be open to talks with the United States, but only if Washington recognises it as a nuclear-armed state, a demand unchanged since the collapse of Kim Jong-un’s 2019 summit with President Donald Trump.\nSuspicions in Pyongyang about Seoul’s intentions may have deepened following Yoon’s brief martial law decree in December, according to Hong Min of the Korea Institute for National Unification.\nYoon has been accused of seeking to provoke North Korean military action to justify the measure.\n\nLast week, South Korea’s new Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said he would recommend to President Lee that this year’s joint US-South Korea military drills be scaled back to support efforts to stabilise the peninsula.\nYet Hong cautioned that such suggestions might be poorly timed. “Adjustments to the scale of these drills would need to have been finalised months in advance,” he said. “Publicly floating such proposals now risks signalling internal policy divisions to the North.”\nSecurity cooperation, along with recently concluded tariff negotiations, is expected to top the agenda when Lee meets Trump for the first time in Washington, Hong added – possibly as early as this month.","summary":"South Korean soldiers on Monday began quietly dismantling towering propaganda loudspeakers that used to blare propaganda across the border, marking the most tangible step yet in President Lee Jae-myung’s drive to de-escalate tensions and revive the prospect of inter-Korean dialogue.\nThe move came despite a sharp rebuke from Kim Yo-jong, the powerful and influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who last week dismissed Seoul’s outreach efforts as “sentimental words” and insisted that...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3320699/south-korea-removes-border-loudspeakers-push-peace","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/04/cebc8f7e-7808-48a1-b513-9d040dd82b94_29cdfad0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-05 00:00:07","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":348179106,"title":"US restricts sports visas for transgender women as Trump government’s crackdown on immigration continues; check key policy update here","text":"APUS restricts sports visas for transgender women as Trump government’s crackdown on immigration continues.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Monday (August 4, 2025) that it has updated its immigration policy to restrict visa eligibility for transgender women seeking to compete in women's sports.

On August 4, the former Brazilian president was placed under strict house arrest by the country’s Supreme Court for violating legal orders tied to an alleged coup attempt. But the drama doesn’t stop there. U.S. President Donald Trump, who had already slapped Brazil with heavy 50% tariffs in support of Bolsonaro, is now considering even tougher sanctions. Meanwhile, President Lula is standing firm, openly defying U.S. pressure as he backs Brazil’s judiciary.\n\nJair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president, has officially been placed under house arrest by the Brazil Supreme Court, marking a dramatic turning point in the country’s deepening political crisis. The arrest order, issued on August 4, 2025, comes as part of a sweeping investigation into Bolsonaro’s alleged role in trying to overturn the 2022 election results. But beyond Brazil’s borders, the decision has triggered international tensions — particularly with the United States, where President Donald Trump has already imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods and is now signaling even tougher sanctions may be on the way.Productivity ToolZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guideBy Metla Sudha SekharFinanceIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy Dinesh NagpalFinanceFinancial Literacy i e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy CA Rahul GuptaDigital MarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Neil PatelBy Neil PatelFinanceTechnical Analysis Demystified- A Complete Guide to TradingBy Kunal PatelProductivity ToolExcel Essentials to Expert: Your Complete GuideBy Study at homeArtificial IntelligenceAI For Business Professionals Batch 2By Ansh Mehra Why is Bolsonaro under house arrest? The house arrest order was issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a key figure in Brazil’s top court. Bolsonaro, who lost the 2022 election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is under investigation for allegedly attempting to stage a coup and incite unrest in an effort to overturn the results. According to the court, Bolsonaro violated multiple court-imposed conditions: Refused to wear an electronic ankle monitor Maintained indirect contact with allies under investigation Continued influencing supporters through social media intermediaries and public appearances The court also ordered that all communication devices in his residence be seized and restricted visits to only lawyers and court-authorized individuals.Live Events How has Trump responded to Bolsonaro’s arrest? Even before this house arrest, Donald Trump had taken Brazil’s legal actions against Bolsonaro personally. Earlier in 2025, Trump’s administration imposed a sweeping 50% tariff on major Brazilian exports like steel, soy, and meat, claiming the actions against Bolsonaro were “political persecution.” Now, following the house arrest, the White House is reportedly reviewing options to hit Brazil with additional penalties—from financial restrictions to potential blacklisting of more officials involved in the case. Trump has repeatedly voiced support for Bolsonaro, calling him “a patriot” and warning Brazil not to “abandon democracy in the name of revenge.” Why Lula is standing firm despite U.S. pressure President Lula da Silva, who returned to office in 2023, has strongly defended the independence of Brazil’s judiciary. He has pushed back against Trump’s claims and refused to interfere in the court’s decision. In recent remarks, Lula stated: “No nation, no leader, has the right to dictate how we uphold justice in Brazil.” Despite the economic risks, Lula has so far defied U.S. pressure, choosing to support the court’s process rather than bow to Trump’s political demands. His government has also been working with European Union diplomats to build new trade partnerships that could offset some of the U.S. pressure. Could Trump now hit Brazil with even tougher sanctions? With Bolsonaro’s house arrest now official, there is growing speculation in Washington and Brasília that Trump may move beyond tariffs. Potential escalations include: Cutting access to U.S. financing or investment deals Suspending diplomatic exchanges Blocking joint defense projects or trade agreements Some insiders say Trump is considering a full suspension of Brazil’s trade privileges, depending on how the situation develops in the coming weeks. This could deepen the rift between the two major economies and reshape the future of U.S.–Brazil relations. What this means for Brazil’s future and global alliances At home, Bolsonaro’s house arrest has sparked mixed reactions. His supporters have begun staging protests, claiming political persecution. On the other hand, many Brazilians — including lawmakers and civil society leaders — are applauding the move as a step toward protecting democracy and ensuring that no leader is above the law. Internationally, the growing U.S.–Brazil standoff is likely to push Lula closer to new strategic partners like China, Russia, and the BRICS alliance, where he may find more sympathetic allies. If Trump continues to apply pressure, Brazil could pivot away from traditional Western alliances in search of economic independence and political leverage. Bolsonaro’s legal team has already confirmed plans to appeal the house arrest order, but the case itself is still moving forward. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face decades in prison and be permanently barred from holding office again. For now, the former president remains at his residence under strict legal supervision, as Brazil enters one of the most consequential chapters in its modern democratic history.FAQs: Q1: Why is Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest in Brazil?

It was the latest event of the Jubilee 2025, which is expected to bring about 32 million people to Rome to pray and celebrate the Catholic faith. \n\nThe new pope’s address follows in a long line of papal exhortations. In 2000, Pope John Paul II delivered an address in the very same field located in an outer part of the ancient Italian city.\n\nThe comments of the Catholic leader come as Christians around the world face persistent persecution. Last month, Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a congressional resolution that encouraged President Donald Trump to “prioritize the protection of persecuted Christians in United States foreign policy.” The Open Doors’ World Watch List 2025 concluded that more than 380,000,000 Christians around the world face significant levels of persecution because of their Christian beliefs. \n\n“We are with the young people of Gaza. We are with the young people of Ukraine, with those of every land bloodied by war,” the church leader proclaimed. The war between Russia and Ukraine has taken the lives of tens of thousands of people and cost billions of dollars.\n\nThe head of the Roman Catholic Church added that young people should strive for excellence. \n\n“Aspire to great things, to holiness, wherever you are,” the pope explained. “Do not settle for less. You will then see the light of the Gospel growing every day, in you and around you.”\n\nLeo also encouraged those gathered to spread their “enthusiasm and the witness of your faith.”\n\nThe pope had previously discussed the challenges facing modern Christian witness. \n\n“Even today, there are many settings in which the Christian faith is considered absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure. These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised, or at best tolerated and pitied,” the new pontiff said in his first homily as the vicar of Christ. \n\nThe new Bishop of Rome speaks from experience, having been elected supreme pontiff at the relatively young age of 69 and as the first American to ever occupy the chair of Saint Peter. Leo is also the first member of the Order of St. Augustine to hold the highest office in the church. \n\n“My young brothers and sisters, you are the sign that a different world is possible. A world of fraternity and friendship, where conflicts are not resolved with weapons, but with dialogue,” the pope said.","summary":"Pope Leo XIV drew the attention of the world in a bold homily Sunday that sought to inspire and comfort the more than 1 million...

Gary Peters of Michigan, providing an answer could determine their political futures.\n\nAt least one already has: Abdul El-Sayed argued on Monday that his party ran away from its voters — not towards them.\n\nPolling within the margin of error against Rep. Haley Stevens, El-Sayed, 40, is very well positioned to pull off the historic feat of becoming the first-ever Muslim member of the United States Senate. \n\nA poll conducted by the NSRC, the GOP’s Senate campaign arm, put him two points behind Stevens, a Democratic congresswoman and reportedly the Democratic party establishment’s favorite to win the seat. Mallory McMorrow, a state senator, trailed both but was nearing striking distance.\n\n“Democrats still haven't learned this lesson,” El-Sayed insisted on Monday. “It's frustrating because these people made a calculated decision about who they needed and who they didn't. And it turns out that that decision was way off.”\n\nEl-Sayed spoke to The Independent two days before he was set to visit a Yemeni coffeeshop in Dearborn Heights for a meet-and-greet with voters, an area of Michigan that saw one of the sharpest drop offs among Democratic-leaning voters last year.\n\nAcross the state, El-Sayed is running the exact opposite kind of campaign as an increasingly frail Joe Biden ran in 2024. In some ways, his strategy contrasts with Harris,’ too, in ways which clearly didn’t sit well with the former Detroit health commisioner. \n\nOn a recent interview with Twitch streamer Hasan Piker (HasanAbi), the two discussed the Israel-Hamas war and starvation crisis in Gaza, which El-Sayed labels a genocide. But in the hourlong conversation — the likes of which Harris avoided to some dismay from Democrats — the two also bro’d out, chatting about fitness as well as the YouTube and Twitter “shorts” seemingly consuming social media and transforming it into slop.\n\n“I watched this campaign actively run away from certain groups of voters because they did not want to take questions that would expose the inconsistency of their values,” said El-Sayed. “Whether that was Joe Rogan's audience, whether that was Hasan’s audience, there are just groups of people that Democrats have said, ‘you know what? We're going to give up on you, because we don't think we need you to win an election. \n\n“That's not how you do politics,” he continued. “Your job is not about just trying to architect a winning coalition. Your job is about trying to identify the issues that all people need, and then being able to be clear, specific and direct about how you solve them in an effort to win an election, because your agenda would deliver for the most people in the ways that they need.”\n\nHe pinned much of the blame for the party’s stiffness in 2024, exemplified in both Biden and Harris’ campaigns, on a steady stream of donor money the two-time Bernie Sanders-backed candidate argued was poisoning the party. Democratic policies were being winnowed down through a narrow lens of what would be palatable to both the party’s base and their corporate-backed financiers, El-Sayed argued.\n\nThe devastation in Gaza and the Democratic Party’s complicity in not pressuring Israel over it under Biden highlighted a gulf between those two groups he argued was growing for years. The man who could very well be the Democratic Party’s champion in a crucial Senate race spared no criticism for those Democratic elites he argued were responsible for the mess within which the DNC was now mired.\n\n\"Joe Biden's handling of Gaza was indicative of a general failure to be able to do the job,” El-Sayed told The Independent. \n\n\"I wasn't in those rooms,” said El-Sayed. “What I can tell you is what I watched, and what I think the American public watched, [which] is an American president who was struggling to give a coherent statement, to get through a debate, [and] ... to manage a extremely complicated situation in Gaza.”\n\n“I also know that there was this effort to silence those voices who were willing to state what was obvious before our eyes,” he added.\n\nA disrupting voice in the party, El-Sayed is pledging to shake up the geriatric halls of the Senate as well should he become his party’s nominee. He’s hoping that a phenomenon which manifested to propel Zohran Mamdani to victory in the New York City mayoral primary election can be duplicated in the Rust Belt.\n\n“There was an inversion of the demographics of the electorate in that primary, young people came out in droves,” said El-Sayed.\n\n“And here in Michigan, we've got young people who have been sick and tired of the system for a very long time, and our job is to go and talk about the challenges that they're facing in their lives,” he continued, offering an example of the complaints he’s heard: “’I don't know that I'm going to be able to get a job, even though I've done everything you told me to do. I did it all. I'm stuck with $60,000 in debt, and AI is about to take the job I was supposed to have. I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to buy a home. I'm worried about the fact that I'm watching a smokestack corrupt our climate. I'm watching as oil pipelines are flowing through our Great Lakes, and I'm asking what's going to be left for me.”\n\nAs senator, El-Sayed says he’d back leveraging Democratic votes on legislation to fund the government: the kind of shutdown politics Chuck Schumer refused to play earlier in 2025. He also supports ending the filibuster, according to a staffer. El-Sayed also would not commit to supporting Schumer for another term as leader of the caucus, telling The Independent he wanted to look at his options as 2027 came into view.\n\nFirst he’ll have to win the 2026 primary as well as a general election against Mike Rogers, the Republican Trump-supporting congressman on a path to be crowned the GOP nominee. With a unified Republican Party backing Rogers, El-Sayed is well aware that his Muslim background and stance on Gaza could be weaponized by Republicans in an attempt to overshadow a Zohran Mamdani-like focus on affordability and Michiganders' financial stability.\n\nRepublicans see Michigan as a path to expanding a majority and giving Donald Trump the breathing room he needs to further his legislative agenda in 2027. The loss of Michigan would be a massive blow for a battle-weary DSCC, and a pro-Israel site has already attacked El-Sayed over his sitdown with Hasan Piker.\n\nEl-Sayed argued that the momentum was on his side, and that Democrats needed to be ready to brawl.\n\n“I think we need to stop being afraid,” he said. “I just think we need to punch back harder, right? They want to come after us on this issue, punch back harder.\n\n“I don't back down, I don't pull my punches, and I am more than happy to go at this issue or any other issue with lying MAGA types,” El-Sayed continued. “ I think we can win the American public, but we gotta stop being afraid of our own shadow.”","summary":"‘These people made a calculated decision about who they needed and who they didn't,’ says Democrat Abdul El-Sayed, who is running to win back those voters his party lost in 2024","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-biden-abdul-michigan-democrats-b2801860.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/04/21/23/Abdul-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a98vGseh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-04 23:40:13","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":348179286,"title":"Charlamagne slams ‘The View’ for not featuring any conservative guests","text":"“The Breakfast Club” host Charlamagne tha God slammed “The View” on Monday for lacking conservative voices on the show.\n\n“Thank you, Lara Trump, for having me on ‘My View.’ I enjoyed the conversation.
