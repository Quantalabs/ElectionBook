Cunning. Not for the country. For himself. For family. He never christened some extra special anything else for anybody else. Always the No. 2 guy. Never the brains. Not really sweating. Just glad-handing. We’re talking smiling. Surviving. Taking bows. Photos. Making friends. Connections. Learning how everything operates. But for him. Accomplishing for any other guy — zilch. When it comes to him, he’s savvy. The way he operates is it’s permanently his ass he’s saving. The man always knew how to hang on. If looking for accomplishments, try Biden’s son. Or Joe’s wife’s hairdresser. Or certain business people who operate his home state of Delaware, which is smaller than my Raisin Bran box. Now, kindly pay attention: This is exactly absolutely completely why he picked Kamala for veep. Certainly not for her ability to strategize. Or speak. Or actually accomplish anything. She suited him. Helped get him elected. Not that she’d in any way helped the country. Not that she’d dredged up any creativity. She had no plan. No idea. No help. Useless. It’s just that who she was and how she got born was helpful. To him. Him. Only to Him. Help him get elected. She alone embodied the things he needed to grab the White House. So now the USA’s got her. However, few voters in the United States of America are maniacally enthusiastic about her. Yes, she’ll draw females. Also black voters, plus deluded Democrats. Plus Bernie Sanders — may his tripe decrease. Also uninvited migrants — but voters? Please! Ever hear her attempt a speech? My Yorkie — when he needs to pee — comes off better. So the Godblessus great country that we love — land of the free, home of the craven, leader of the free world — bounces downward. From Biden the nothing to Kamala the zero. I do not say she isn’t attractive. I do not say she doesn’t have supporters. I only say in the words of Marie Antoinette: “Listen, guys, I think you’re making a mistake.” I heard Kamala on TV speak a sentence like: “I can match the record of Donald Trump.” Yeah? I mean, yeah? And wouldn’t the civilized world be deeply interested in her presidential sit-down with Putin who would probably have to spend weeks studying up before he faced her? Or a one-on-one with the guy running Iran? In anticipation, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is already quaking in his kimchi. High hopes but low appraisals. Presidential roast Midtown, Saturday night at Arno’s, stuffing myself on Italian goodies, manager Carlos Pereira seated me between teens and tweens and another table of mommas and poppas. The mommas and poppas were sticking their forks into Kamala. Since we are all created equal, it has been said, repeated and written that every one of us still has a chance to become president in the United States of America. Yeah, good, great, OK — but why now? Only in the USA, kids, Only in the USA.","summary":"Kamala Harris suited Joe Biden. Helped get him elected. Not that she’d in any way helped the country.

We’re up against a machine,” says Vivek Ramaswamy","text":"WASHINGTON, Jul 23: Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy, who had predicted President Joe Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee for the November election, has said the country is not running against a candidate but an unelected managerial class machine. The Indian-American businessman-turned-politician said on Monday that the speed at which the ruling Democratic Party moved to replace incumbent President Joe Biden with Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible candidate for the November 5 polls raises lots of questions. “We’re not actually running against a candidate here. We’re running against a machine. That’s a deep understanding of what’s going on that requires rejecting some of the things you might otherwise think,” Ramaswamy said in a 15-minute long video posted on various social media platforms. During the Republican presidential debate last November, Ramaswamy, 38, had predicted that Biden would not be the Democratic presidential nominee, a claim dismissed as a ‘conspiracy theory’ by much of the mainstream media at that time. On Sunday, Biden shocked the nation by announcing that he is backing out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who, as of now, is the only Democratic Party leader in the race. “It’s not Biden that we were up against at all. His cognitive deficits, and I would argue Kamala Harris’s cognitive deficits, they’re not a bug to the people who control them. Those cognitive deficits are a feature. It is a wheel of the managerial class crushing the will of everyday citizens, not just in the Republican Party, but even in the Democratic Party,” he said. He said that the Democrats may not agree with everything that Donald Trump or the Republican Party says today, and that’s fine. No two Americans agree on 100 per cent of policies. That’s a rarity, Ramaswamy, who in January suspended his Republican presidential campaign and endorsed former president Donald Trump, said. But you do deserve a president and a party that at least tells you the truth, not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard and when it’s uncomfortable, he said. “Beyond just this individual game, whether it’s Joe or whether it’s Kamala, we got to realise the thing that we’re actually solving for is defeating that machine, the rise of that managerial class, bigger than any other individual, it embodies the philosophy of what the modern left is really about,” he said in the video that went viral on social media. “It’s not about individual agency. It’s that collective will. That’s what this machine really is about…. That’s really what we’re running against. That’s what we’re running to defeat. That’s the system we’re running to break. That’s what the deep state is really about,” Ramaswamy said. “This is about the unelected managerial, you could call them elites, you could call them bureaucrats, you could call them monarchs, who have no accountability to the people, but whose decisions are actually most impactful on how citizens live their lives,” he said and urged the Democrats to put their best possible nominee for the elections. Ramaswamy alleged that this is a party and a movement on the Democrat side that has made it its core reason for existence to keep former president Trump out of office. “They’ve tried every way to stop him within the legal system and extra-legally as well.” But all their efforts to keep him from the ballot have not just failed but backfired making Trump and the Republican Party more popular, he added.

Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris told a congressional committee that two Butler County Emergency Services Unit officers were stationed at a second-floor window in the complex of buildings that form AGR International Inc. They spotted Thomas Matthew Crooks acting suspiciously on the ground and left their post to go look for him along with other law enforcement officers, he said. Paris said he didn’t know whether officers would have been able to see Crooks climbing onto the roof of an adjacent building had they remained at the window. A video taken by a lawmaker who visited the shooting site on Monday shows a second-story window of the building had a clear view of the roof where Crooks opened fire; it was unclear if the video showed the window where the officers had been stationed. The Pennsylvania State Police commissioner’s testimony before the House Homeland Security Committee provides new insight into security preparations for the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, but raises further questions about law enforcement’s decisions before Crooks opened fire. Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger, who oversees the emergency services unit, didn’t immediately respond to a text message Tuesday from The Associated Press. A Secret Service spokesperson didn’t respond to questions from the AP, including who gave the command for those officers to leave their post. The revelation comes amid growing questions about a multitude of security failures that allowed the 20-year-old gunman to get onto the roof and fire eight shots with an AR-style rifle into the crowd shortly after Trump began speaking. One spectator was killed and two others were injured. Trump suffered an ear injury but was not seriously hurt. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned earlier Tuesday, a day after she was berated for hours by Democrats and Republicans over the agency’s failure to protect the Republican presidential nominee. Cheatle told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee on Monday that the assassination attempt was the Secret Service’s “most significant operational failure” in decades. The Homeland Security Committee also had asked Cheatle to testify but lawmakers said she refused. Cheatle’s name was on a card on a table in front of an empty chair during the hearing, which began shortly before her decision to step down became public. Several investigations into the shooting by the Biden administration and lawmakers are underway. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday they are supporting a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempt on Trump’s life. The House could vote as soon as Wednesday to establish the task force, which will be comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats. Local law enforcement began to search for Crooks after they noticed him acting strangely and saw him with a rangefinder, a small device resembling binoculars that hunters use to measure distance from a target. Law enforcement went to look for him but didn’t find him around the building and a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. The gunman turned and pointed his rifle at him. The officer did not — or could not — fire a single shot. Crooks opened fire toward the former president seconds later, officials have said. Authorities have been hunting for clues into what motivated Crooks but have not found any ideological bent that could help explain his actions. Investigators who searched his phone found photos of Trump, Biden and other senior government officials and found that he had looked up the dates for the Democratic National Conventional as well as Trump’s appearances. He also searched for information about major depressive disorder. Lauer reported from Philadelphia. Associated Press reporters Michael R. Sisak in New York and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed.","summary":"Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned earlier Tuesday, a day after she was berated for hours by Democrats and Republicans over the agency's failure to protect the Republican presidential nominee.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/23/state-police-officers-were-looking-for-trump-gunman-before-shooting/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sjm-24-Trump-Shooting_200336486.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:58:06","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":252468006,"title":"Arizona lawmakers visit Mexico amid border crisis, transition to new president","text":"Some members of the Arizona congressional delegation visited Mexico City last week as the presidency transitions in the country. Eleven lawmakers, including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Greg Stanton, met with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador as well as President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum for discussions that involved trade, the economy as well as border and immigration issues, according to a news release. “At a moment of change in Mexico as they prepare to inaugurate their first woman president, this visit was valuable to deepen cooperation on issues like migration, security, trade, and economic development that are critically intertwined with the United States,” Kelly said in a statement. “Mexico is one of our most important economic partners, and we see it every day in Arizona with cross-border commerce and travel along our ports of entry that we are working to upgrade. I look forward to partnering with President-elect Sheinbaum and her cabinet to address our shared challenges as we continue strengthening the historic relationship between both of our nations,” he continued. As Arizona is a border state, the relationship with Mexico places a critical role in both immigration and trade policy, whether its at the state or federal government level. The Tucson Sector is has dealt with nearly 430,000 migrant encounters on its land border with Mexico in fiscal year 2024 alone, with people coming from all over the world. The Grand Canyon State’s largest international trade partner is Mexico, with $8 billion in exports to the country as of 2023, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The state and the United States’ relationship with the country could be at a turning point with the change of presidency in October for Mexico and again in the U.S. in January. As President Joe Biden will no longer seek re-election, there will be a new leader at the helm in 2025 regardless, and the influx of migrants into the country is bound to continue to be a top issue. Former President Donald Trump has previously said he would bring back the “Remain in Mexico” policy for asylum seekers awaiting legal proceedings in the United States if he is brought back to the White House, Fox News reported.","summary":"Some members of the Arizona congressional delegation visited Mexico City last week as the presidency transitions in the country.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/us-news/arizona-lawmakers-visit-mexico-amid-border-crisis-transition-to-new-president/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/000-miles-gulf-mexico-pacific-85886775.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ydvg05wb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:57:25","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.395},{"id":252467964,"title":"Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign raises USD 81 million in first 24 hours","text":"WASHINGTON, Jul 23 : US Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign has raised USD 81 million in the first 24-hour period since incumbent President Joe Biden stepped aside from the presidential race and endorsed his deputy as the Democratic Party’s new nominee. Biden’s decision to nominate Harris (59) follows weeks of intense pressure from fellow Democrats after his disastrous presidential debate performance against his Republican rival and former US President Donald Trump last month. Kevin Munoz, the spokesperson for Harris’ campaign, said, “There is a groundswell behind Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is terrified because he knows his divisive and unpopular agenda can’t stand up to the vice president’s record and vision for the American people.” “Team Harris raised USD 81 million in its first 24 hours, adding to the near quarter-of-a-billion dollar war chest already amassed this election cycle. This haul reflects money raised across the campaign, Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees,” a media release said. Over 8,88,000 grassroots donors made donations in the past 24 hours, 60 per cent of whom made their first contribution of the 2024 cycle, it said, adding, “Team Harris’ 24-hour raise is the highest 24-hour raise of any candidate in history.” “In the last 24 hours, Team Harris has added 43,000 new recurring donors, with over half of these recurring donors signing up for weekly donations. A call on Sunday evening hosted by Win with Black Women raised approximately USD 1.6 million in grassroots contributions alone. And Harris for President’s official social media, @KamalaHQ, doubled its following overnight,” the campaign said in a statement. Reacting to the support for the campaign, Munoz said, “The historic outpour of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections.” “Already, we are seeing a broad and diverse coalition come together to support our critical work of talking to the voters that will decide this election,” he added. Though Biden’s endorsement almost seals Harris’ position as the presidential nominee of her party, she still needs to get elected by the party’s delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22. Biden has won 3,896 delegates as against 1,976 required to win the party’s presidential nomination. In a move that would give her access to the campaign funds, the Biden-Harris campaign amended filings with the Federal Election Commission to rename its principal committee and declare Harris a candidate for president. Following Biden’s decision, Harris, who has been serving as the US’ first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president since 2021, immediately secured the endorsement of former president Bill Clinton, thus making it a bit easier for her to win the delegate battle during the party convention. An “overwhelming majority” of state Democratic Party chairs have announced their support for Vice President Harris as their nominee for president, the Association of State Democratic Committees (ASDC) said in a statement.

Reproductive rights are likely to be a hot issue in the election season. In April, the Associated Press reported that Trump said he believed abortion limits should be left to the states, outlining his position in a video in which he declined to endorse a national ban after months of mixed messages and speculation. “Many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights,” Trump said in the video posted on his Truth Social site. “My view is now that we have an abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land — in this case, the law of the state.” Trump, in the video, did not say when in pregnancy he believed abortion should be banned — declining to endorse a national cutoff that would have been used as a cudgel by Democrats ahead of the November election. Harris also rolled out some of the issues she would be committed to if elected, including addressing gun violence. “Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” she said as she highlighted other issues, including workers’ freedom to join a union, affordable health care, affordable child care, paid family leave, retirement with dignity, every American’s right to vote, safety from gun violence: red flag laws, and universal background checks and assault weapons bans. On Tuesday, Trump said Harris would be “easier” to beat in the November election than President Joe Biden. “She’s far more radical than he (Biden) is, so I think she should be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much,” Trump said on a call with reporters. According to AFP, Trump, who is running to return to the White House, pledged to take part in at least one presidential debate with Harris. “Oh, yes, absolutely. I want to. I think it’s important,” he said on the call, adding that “I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” Meanwhile, Trump said on Tuesday his presumptive Democratic opponent Kamala Harris would be “easier” to beat in November’s election than President Joe Biden. “She’s far more radical than he (Biden) is, so I think she should be easier than Biden because he was slightly more mainstream, but not much,” Trump said on a call with reporters. According to AFP, Trump, who is running to return to the White House, pledged to take part in at least one presidential debate with Harris. “Oh, yes, absolutely. I want to. I think it’s important,” he said on the call, adding that “I would be willing to do more than one debate, actually.” Harris hit the US campaign trail on Tuesday after effectively clinching the Democratic presidential nomination, heading to the battleground state of Wisconsin to address citizens. The vice president took just 36 hours to secure enough delegates to be nominated, moving with lightning speed after President Joe Biden’s exit from the race triggered one of the largest election upheavals in modern US history. Top Democratic congressional chiefs – Senator Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries – threw their weight behind her in a press conference. Hollywood star George Clooney – who made waves earlier this month as one of the first high-profile Democratic activists to urge Biden to drop his reelection bid – also said he was now behind 59-year-old Harris’s campaign to face Trump in November. Biden stunned the world by dropping his reelection bid on Sunday, bowing to weeks of pressure after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Having made the announcement in a social media post while recovering from Covid at his Delaware beach house, Biden has yet to speak at length about his decision. AFP reports that Biden was due back at the White House Tuesday after his doctor said he was now all clear from Covid. Biden announced he would deliver a primetime speech from the Oval Office on Wednesday about “what lies ahead.”","summary":"United States Vice President, Kamala Harris, on Tuesday, vowed to put a stop to the abortion ban and help restore reproductive freedoms. “And we who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump’s extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what \n\n\n \n Read More","url":"https://punchng.com/kamala-harris-begins-campaign-vows-to-stop-abortion-ban/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/26194236/Kamala-Harris-e1650994956773.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:56:06","author":"Gbenga Oloniniran","authors":["Gbenga Oloniniran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":252468306,"title":"Rays SS Taylor Walls says gesture wasn’t meant as Trump endorsement and he likely won’t do it again","text":"TORONTO (AP) — Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Taylor Walls said Tuesday that his Donald Trump-inspired celebration of a hit Sunday was not intended as an endorsement of the Republican presidential candidate and added he was unlikely to do it again. Walls pumped his fist and shouted “Fight! Fight! Fight!” after hitting a double against the New York Yankees on Sunday, mimicking Trump’s reaction after a bullet hit his ear during a campaign event in Pennsylvania on July 13. “I think it’s pretty inspirational when any person, in the blink of an eye, their life could be taken from them,” Walls said before the Rays faced the Toronto Blue Jays. “They don’t really know what’s going on in the heat of the moment. “To immediately stand up and show strength, to me, speaks pretty loudly,” Walls added. “Anyone in that situation or that type of event, when it happens, it’s strong. It kind of represents character to me, and something that similarly I feel like I’ve faced those challenges in baseball, but on a much suppressed level.” The fifth-inning double off right-hander Marcus Stroman was Walls’ first hit since the shooting. He has five hits in 33 at-bats this month, including four singles. Still, Walls said he isn’t likely to make the gesture again. “That was kind of more of a joke that we have with guys in the locker room,” he said. “Joke may not be the right word. It was kind of just something that we had together that we thought was kind of funny, that we thought would be all right. I don’t really see that going much further than that. I don’t foresee myself doing it again.” Walls declined to say who he intended to vote for in November, referencing President Joe Biden’s recent decision not to seek reelection.

Too quickly, arguably: Both she and the country would be better served by a brief, contested nomination process that tested her skills as a presidential campaigner and sparked discussion about where the next generation of Democratic leaders should take the party. The party seems to have made up its mind, though. So now it’s the nation’s turn. Fate has presented Ms. Harris the rarest of political opportunities: to start a presidential campaign in the summer of an election year as a fresh, all-but-anointed candidate free to present her vision to all voters, not just to her own party. Though many Americans might already have feelings about their vice president, they are listening now. To a country that could use reassurance — indeed, to those Americans who like much of Mr. Biden’s record — Ms. Harris could start by explaining how much of a reset she would represent. A clean break from Bidenism would be a mistake. When Ms. Harris sought the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, she tried to play down her record as a tough-on-crime California prosecutor and embrace the progressive left of the Democratic Party, backing policies that lacked broad appeal, such as Medicare-for-all. She did not make it out of 2019 before folding her campaign. Mr. Biden prevailed, in both the primaries and the general, after declining to court the passionate minority to whom candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) appealed. Amid much activist mockery of his refusal to give up on bipartisanship or on a return to civility in politics — indeed, on the broad middle of the country — Mr. Biden built a coalition of liberals, voters of color, moderates and ex-Republicans. In the White House, Mr. Biden’s approach helped get substantial bipartisan bills over the finish line, investing in national infrastructure and critical semiconductor manufacturing. He also signed a bill that should have been bipartisan: the nation’s most ambitious climate change policy to date. Ms. Harris should both resist activist demands that would push her to the left and ignore the social media micro-rebellion that will follow. Ms. Harris’s pick of running mate could be a revealing early indicator, too. Tapping a politician likely to appeal to the median voter would serve her — and the country — best. Ms. Harris appears to be showing due respect for Mr. Biden. Speaking Monday at the White House to college athletes who won national championships this school year, she signaled that she intends to run on Mr. Biden’s record. “In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms,” she said. She traveled in the afternoon to Wilmington, Del., to deliver a pep talk to Biden campaign staffers, who now all work for her. This is not to say that Mr. Biden has made no mistakes, or that Ms. Harris should run as a Biden clone. The president has sometimes tried to pander to voters with policies such as widespread student debt cancellation or, more recently, nationwide rent stabilization. Mr. Biden has generally picked smart, competent staff — but not always — and Ms. Harris could say which of them she might keep. More to the point, Mr. Biden’s approval rating has been mired in the 30s. Majorities disapprove of the Biden administration’s handling of several issues that voters care about most, including inflation and immigration. Ms. Harris might look at those numbers, and the complexity of the issues, and be tempted to ride a glide path to the nomination, taking few risks between now and when delegates vote in August. She should do the opposite. She could deliver a detailed national address and take substantive questions from journalists, hold a televised town hall to engage directly with voters and give interviews after rallies in battleground states. She could even take part in forums with fellow Democrats to showcase that the party is more than any one individual. The goal is to emerge from vice-presidential muddiness to presidential sharpness. A change in messenger might help convince people that, say, the president’s handling of the Ukraine war has actually been strong, or that the economy is, in fact, humming. It also allows the Democratic ticket to sketch its vision. The pen is in Ms. Harris’s hand. ONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-dnc-biden-differences/ ___ July 19 The New York Times on Russia silencing journalism, Evan Gershkovich The only surprise in the guilty verdict against Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal correspondent who was arrested in Russia last year on phony charges of espionage, was that it came so quickly. The charge itself was a farce. No evidence was ever made public, the hearings were held in secret, and Mr. Gershkovich’s lawyers were barred from saying anything in public about the case. Mr. Gershkovich’s arrest, trial and conviction all serve President Vladimir Putin’s goal of silencing any honest reporting from inside Russia about the invasion of Ukraine and of making Russians even warier of speaking with any foreigner about the war. Independent Russian news outlets have been almost entirely shut down and their journalists imprisoned or forced to leave the country, so foreign correspondents are among the few remaining sources of independent reporting from inside Russia. Mr. Gershkovich’s last published article before his arrest, on March 29, 2023, was headlined “ Russia’s Economy Is Starting to Come Undone ” — just the sort of vital independent journalism that challenges Mr. Putin’s claims of a strong and vibrant Russia fighting a just war. Russian prosecutors claimed that Mr. Gershkovich, acting on instructions from Washington, used “painstaking conspiratorial methods” to obtain “secret information” about Uralvagonzavod, a Russian weapons factory near Yekaterinburg, where he was arrested and tried. The existence of this massive industrial complex is well known, but the charge of espionage allowed Russian prosecutors to keep the entire proceeding secret while fueling Mr. Putin’s propaganda about efforts by the United States and Europe to destabilize Russia. Mr. Putin’s crackdown on free expression, especially about the war in Ukraine, is unrelenting. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Russia is the world’s fourth-worst jailer of journalists, with at least 22 in detention, including Mr. Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva, a U.S.-Russian dual citizen and an editor with the U.S.-government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Over the past few weeks, the Kremlin has banned 81 European Union media outlets, including Der Spiegel and Politico, for “systematically disseminating false information about the progress of the special military operation” — the only legal way to refer to the war against Ukraine. Russian authorities have also designated The Moscow Times, an English-language publication that now publishes from outside Russia, an “ undesirable organization,” making it dangerous for anyone in Russia to have any contact with it. Masha Gessen, a Times Opinion columnist, was tried in absentia and sentenced to eight years in prison this week for criticizing the Russian military. Just as important to Mr. Putin’s political aims: He has been able to use Mr. Gershkovich as a hostage, as he did with the American basketball player Brittney Griner, who was freed in 2022 after 10 months in prison in exchange for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer imprisoned in the United States. There is a sliver of good news here. This trial could have dragged on for years if Mr. Putin had so desired. That it ended just hours after closing arguments strongly suggests that a deal has been reached on swapping the American reporter for a Russian imprisoned in the West. On Wednesday the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said that the United States and Russia were holding talks on a possible swap. The most likely candidate is believed to be Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin serving a life sentence in Germany for the murder of an exiled Chechen commander in Berlin. If a swap happens, we welcome the possibility that Mr. Gershkovich could be quickly released and returned to his family in the United States. But Mr. Gershkovich has already spent 16 months in detention in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, and the conviction means he would have to serve his sentence in a high-security penal colony. Several other Americans are also being held in Russia, and one or more of them could also be released as part of a deal. Any celebration over Mr. Gershkovich’s potential release is overshadowed by the utter cynicism of Russian authorities’ decision to detain him in the first place. Mr. Putin’s police state has made a habit of seizing hostages any time one of its agents is caught. And yet the determination of reporters like Mr. Gershkovich, and the many Russians who are risking their freedom to describe the realities behind Mr. Putin’s elaborate myths, has not been crushed. They have no illusions about the risks, but they understand the critical importance of puncturing Mr. Putin’s lies. That is journalism, not espionage, and it deserves the unwavering support of the United States and the world. ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/opinion/evan-gershkovich-russia-journalist.html ___ July 22 The Wall Street Journal on the Secret Service, the attempted assassination of Trump Everyone with a video screen knows about the failure to protect Donald Trump from a would-be assassin in Butler, Pa. But don’t look to Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle for answers because she doesn’t have any. That was the bottom line from a House Oversight Committee hearing on Monday. Ms. Cheatle said the agency failed in protecting the former President—no kidding—but did little to explain the staggering operational mistakes. She couldn’t illuminate even basic facts about how a young shooter, apparently acting alone, was able to get an AR-15 style rifle within a few hundred feet of the former President. We know law enforcement noticed the alleged gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, before the rally began and designated him as suspicious. Local police alerted the Secret Service because of the man’s behavior near the magnetometers. Around 5:30 p.m. the shooter was spotted again looking through a rangefinder, a device shooters use to calculate distance to a target. Those moments should have been enough to transform Crooks from a “person of interest” to an active threat. But that didn’t happen, and Ms. Cheatle deflected lawmakers’ questions with a bureaucratic defense. “I think we’re conflating the difference between the term ‘threat’ and ‘suspicious,’” she said. “An individual with a backpack is not a threat. . . . An individual with a range finder is not a threat.” She was wrong about that. Instead of law enforcement questioning and searching him, the gunman continued his amateurish plan unmolested. About 10 minutes before Mr. Trump took the stage, Crooks had climbed atop a building a few hundred yards away with an unobstructed view of Mr. Trump’s podium. The Secret Service has said the building where the shooter perched was outside its security perimeter for the event, but why? When Oversight Chairman James Comer (R., Ken.) asked about responsibility for the roof, Ms. Cheatle said there was “a plan in place to provide overwatch” but didn’t provide details. The Secret Service has acknowledged that its agents should have been in control of the building rather than relying on local law enforcement. This alone is a huge failure. Police provide additional security, but the Secret Service is the protection detail. Agents should be clearing all areas and keeping eyes on risky corners with drones or other surveillance. In the minutes before he tried to kill Mr. Trump, the shooter was spotted by rally attendees who pointed and shouted to alert law enforcement. Why wasn’t the gunman taken out by snipers before he fired into the crowd. Why was Mr. Trump even allowed on stage? Ms. Cheatle failed to answer those questions, telling lawmakers she needed to wait until the internal investigation is done in some 60 days, Her non-answers managed the rare feat of uniting Democrats and Republicans in calls for her resignation. Mr. Comer and ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin (D., Md.) both say she should go. At the hearing, progressive Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) asked Ms. Cheatle if she knew what Secret Service director Stuart Knight did after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. “He remained on duty,” Ms. Cheatle said. Mr. Khanna replied, “He resigned.” ONLINE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/clueless-at-the-secret-service-279e0d04?mod=editorials_article_pos8 ___ July 18 The Los Angeles Times on the GOP and abortion rights It’s not surprising that the Republican Party took out of its platform, after decades, support of a national abortion ban. Not that Donald Trump and his new vice presidential running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, have had some epiphany and renounced their long-standing opposition to reproductive rights. It’s more likely that party leaders realized the stance risks alienating the millions of voters in conservative and swing states who support reproductive rights. States that voted for Trump in 2020, such as Ohio and Kansas, more recently voted to enshrine abortion rights into their state constitutions or rejected measures that would prohibit doing so after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in 2022. So instead, the party slipped a seemingly innocuous statement into its platform, which delegates approved this week at the Republican National Convention, about standing for “families and Life.” That sounds reasonable, but it’s much more sinister than it seems. The statement continues with the observation that the 14th Amendment “guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.” It then proclaims, “After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” This is a reference to the Supreme Court taking away the federal right to abortion. It may be subtle, but it is clearly signaling that the party hasn’t changed its values. It’s a call for more fetal personhood laws, which can be much more extreme and wide-reaching than abortion bans. These laws confer all the same rights on fetuses in a uterus — and sometimes just fertilized eggs — of any person walking around. More significantly, the fetus’ rights supersede those of the pregnant woman. It’s outrageous that anyone would support laws that take away personhood rights from pregnant women while bestowing that status on their fetuses. As with all antiabortion statutes, they turn the pregnant person into little more than an incubator. There are already 18 states with some kind of fetal personhood law or fetal personhood protection established by court decisions, according to Pregnancy Justice, an organization that advocates for the rights of pregnant people. Depending on how they are interpreted, personhood laws could affect access to abortion, in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures and certain types of contraception such as IUDs because they occasionally act after fertilization. Personhood statutes were kept in check by Roe vs. Wade. Now that Roe is overturned it’s possible these laws could be used to ban abortion. For example, just days after the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs case, abortion services stopped in Arizona because it has a law on the books granting personhood to fetuses, embryos and fertilized eggs. Advocates successfully got part of the law blocked in federal court. There are likely more legal fights ahead here and in other states with similar laws. But the reason to worry about these laws is that they could be used not just to stop a person from getting an abortion but criminalize a pregnant person for falling down a flight of stairs, using even legal drugs or having a miscarriage. “You are making that person a walking crime scene,” says Karen Thompson, the legal director of Pregnancy Justice. Fetal personhood laws may also end up stopping IVF procedures. The Alabama Supreme Court decision this year that frozen embryos have the same rights as children provoked a national uproar and caused IVF clinics in the state to suddenly stop services. (Alabama then passed a law protecting IVF providers from civil and criminal liability for loss of embryos during the treatments.) Interestingly, the GOP platform also specifically states the party supports IVF. Trump continues to take credit for putting three justices on the Supreme Court who were instrumental in overturning Roe vs. Wade. Even as he tries to disown his past support for a national ban, he refused to tell Time magazine in April if he would veto such a ban if he becomes president. His running mate opposed the Ohio ballot measure last year enshrining abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution. He signed a letter from a group of Republican senators and Congress members last year calling on Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland to enforce part of a moribund 19th century vice law, the Comstock Act, that could be used to ban the mailing of abortion pills. This new statement in the platform is just a change in language, not values. The GOP will not protect a woman’s right to control her own body. And voters should not think otherwise. ONLINE: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-18/rnc-platform-personhood-abortion-gop ___ July 21 The Houston Chronicle on the Trump shooting, gun violence in the U.S. For Texas youngsters not too many years ago — usually boys, occasionally girls — a gun represented a more common rite of passage. Graduating at a tender age from leather-holstered cap pistols and backyard shoot-outs with black-hatted bad guys astride broomstick horses, a kid anticipated the next step: a long, narrow package under the Christmas tree signaling that Santa had dropped in with a Daisy Red Ryder BB rifle in his gift arsenal. Daisy was, and is, the BB gun manufacturer. Red Ryder was a popular comic strip character, who, with his Native American sidekick Little Beaver, rode the range and kept the peace in the 1890s, Red astride his mighty steed Thunder, Little Beaver trying to keep up on a pony called Papoose. Back then, a few years firing BBs at tin cans or birds (or another kid’s rear end) might lead during the early teen years to a real gun — a .410 shotgun for dove or quail hunting with dad, maybe at some point a .22 rifle for deer hunting, almost always accompanied by strict instructions about gun safety. The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump by a young man barely out of his teens is the latest horrific example that things have changed drastically in this country since Red Ryder and his pal rode off into the sunset. Too many youngsters around the country seem to be skipping the BB guns phase and, with various levels of parental acquiescence, graduating to weapons of war designed not just to kill human beings, but to pulverize them. These days, birds and squirrels are relatively safe; humans are the hunted. We live with that fatalistic reality, a reality so disturbing that U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a first-ever advisory last month declaring gun violence a national public health crisis. Murthy recommended that we start taking firearm violence as seriously as the alarming statistics: Since 2020, for example, firearm-related injury has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and adolescents, ages 1 to 19. Here’s another statistic that underscores how our national gun obsession warps everyday life: In 2021,gun deaths hit a three-decade high, driven by increases in homicides and suicides. The 20-year-old shooter at the Trump rally July 13 used an AR-15 his father had bought a dozen or so years ago and apparently kept around the house. Firing his military weapon from about 450 feet away, the shooter reportedly came within a quarter of an inch of killing a once and perhaps future president. Incidentally, USA Today reported that the brand of the rifle, DPMS, is now owned by the parent of South Carolina-based Palmetto State armory, which Trump visited just last year on the campaign trail, snapping photos with the owner and admiring the grip of a Glock engraved with his face. Although the would-be assassin’s weapon of choice has been used to destroy human beings in schools, movie theaters, churches and grocery stores, it had never been used to try to assassinate a former president. Until that Saturday. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump on Thursday told a Republican National Convention crowd that stood riveted, some in tears, as he recounted the shooting. “Yes you are!” the crowd chanted back. “Thank you, but I’m not,” Trump responded. “And I’ll tell you, I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God.” One of the rally attendees didn’t survive. Corey Comperatore, a small-town firefighter and engineer, died trying to shield his family. Two other people suffered critical injuries but Trump said they were on the mend. The Pennsylvania shooter, shot and killed by law enforcement after he fired at Trump, appears to have taken advantage of family inattention or irresponsibility in obtaining his father’s weapon. He’s not the first. An uncle, perhaps unwittingly, drove the18-year-old Uvalde shooter to the gun store to buy the AR-15 he used to slaughter 19 schoolchildren and two teachers in May 2022. After a 19-year-old fatally shot seven people at a Fourth of July parade in suburban Chicago, also in 2022, his father, Robert Crimo Jr, initially faced several felony counts of reckless conduct. Prosecutors said he helped his son acquire the guns despite warnings that he could be a public safety risk. As far back as 2012, Nancy Lanza, the mother of a 21-year-old who killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, collected powerful weapons and began taking her deeply troubled son to shooting ranges to practice using her guns together. Her son used her .22-caliber Savage Mark II rifle to kill her first. Earlier this year, Jennifer and James Crumbley of Michigan became the first parents convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting. They were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for ignoring signs that their 15-year-old son was a danger to himself and others. For Christmas one year, his parents had bought him a Sig Sauer 9mm handgun. In 2021, he took the gun to school and murdered four of his classmates, injuring seven more. So, this is the world we live in — or, rather, this is the nation we live in, a nation where approximately 400 million guns are in circulation, including some 20 million of the AR-15 military-style rifles; where more than 1,500 school shootings have occurred since 1997, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Tens of thousands of gun deaths every year are a uniquely American phenomenon. Other nations have dealt with outbursts of gun violence by taking swift and effective action; Australia and New Zealand come to mind. In this country, courts, Congress and state legislatures, not to mention well-funded lobbying organizations, make it almost impossible to take sensible action. We choose to live with the threat, or, more precisely, to die with it. Just last week, a federal appeals court ruled that Minnesota’s ban preventing residents ages 18 to 20 from carrying handguns in public is unconstitutional. It was merely the latest of numerous gun laws overturned after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision last month that said gun laws must align with “history and tradition.” If Trump returns to the White House, sensible gun-safety measures will likely become history (despite his own brush with dying at the hands of a shooter). If a nation has to acquiesce to gun ubiquity, there has to be another way to protect ourselves. Surgeon General Murthy’s recommendation is a long-range proposal designed to support research and apply science to the gun-violence crisis. Under the rubric “national crisis,” institutions and experts will collect data, develop and test prevention strategies and endorse programs found to be effective. (We might find out, for example, whether holding parents responsible for their children’s actions is an effective technique.) Declaring gun violence a public-health crisis, Murthy hopes, will lead eventually to reforms similar to those that brought about drastic reductions in deaths and injuries from tobacco and from motor-vehicle crashes. “I want people to understand the full impact of firearm violence in our country, and I want them to see it as a public health issue,” Murthy said in a Washington Post interview. “I know it’s been polarizing, and I know it’s been politicized, but if we can see it as a public health issue, we can come together and implement a public health solution.” Once upon a time, Americans smoked on airplanes and in restaurants and theaters; smokers some years back died of cancer at alarming levels. Once upon a time, motorists entrusted their lives to vehicles “unsafe at any speed.” Over time, we managed to implement life-saving reforms. In the face of our gun obsession, those efforts seem almost as quaint as Red Ryder and his buddy, Little Beaver (who, by the way, relied on a bow and arrow to help subdue the bad guys). Gun-safety advocates may feel like they’re astride Little Beaver’s pony Papoose in their daunting battle with the gun lobby, but they must not surrender. Labeling gun violence a crisis is the least they can do — and, these days, probably the most.

She had faced calls from both Democrats and Republicans to step down after a contentious House Committee hearing on Monday on the incident. The lawmakers became increasingly frustrated when she refused to answer questions about the shooting at Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this month. In her resignation letter, Ms Cheatle said she had always “put the needs of the agency first” and it was “with a heavy heart” that she made her decision. “The scrutiny over the last week has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases,” she said. “I do not want my calls for resignation to be a distraction from the great work each and every one of you do towards our vital mission,” she said. President Joe Biden said in a statement that he was grateful for her decades of public service. “The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again,” he said. For now, the Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas has appointed Ronald Rowe as acting director of the agency as President Biden prepares to appoint a new director soon. Rowe, a 24-year Secret Service veteran, has held the position of deputy director since April 2023. The president appointed Cheatle to head the Secret Service – which oversees the protection of current and former presidents and other officials – in 2022.

She later went on to become supervisor of Biden’s protective detail when he was vice-president, before she became the deputy assistant director of protective operations.

So when actor Owen Wilson compared the Anger Management actor to the Republican leader in his 2017 interview with the Daily Beast, titled \"Donald Trump Is the Charlie Sheen of Politics,\" Sheen responded with a witty jab. \"Dear O. Wilson they took your comment out of context! I'm honored! Thank you! If Trump will [have] me, I'd be his VP in a heartbeat!\" he wrote on X. Wilson had used the analogy to explain why Trump's brazen remarks were helping him 'win' the media game. “You can’t help but get a kick out of him, and I think part of it is we’re so used to politicians on both sides sounding like actors at press junkets – it’s sort of by rote, and they say all the right things,” the Fool's Gold actor said. “Here’s somebody who’s not following the script. It’s like when Charlie Sheen was doing that stuff – like, wow! He’s answering a question completely honestly and in an entertaining way. You sort of feel he could be a character from ‘Network.’” Wilson further opined, “I don’t know if I’m not taking [Trump] as seriously as I should, but when he said he was going down to the border, and he showed up at a press conference and said, ‘Now I’m going out to the border, and I hope I’ll see you later’ — sort of suggesting that it was so dangerous that ‘who knows if I’ll see you later’…I don’t know, it was just funny to me. The guy is a showman. You have to sort of get a kick out of the guy. It is entertaining, for sure. That’s why people are tuning in.” According to The Hollywood Reporter, months prior to Wilson's remark, Sheen had criticized Trump with a set of controversial tweets that he later deleted. “Hey Trump, ‘A farce or comedy is best played; a tragedy is best read at home’ Abe Lincoln,” he wrote while quoting the 16th President of the United States. (The late President Lincoln is said to have made the statement after witnessing a play of Shakespeare's A Merchant of Venice, as per The Washington Examiner). “America please Wake Up! #AnyonebutTrump,\" Sheen penned back then. Likewise in July 2015, the Brothers in Arms actor tweeted, then deleted, “Trump you’re a sad and silly homunculus. Your words are as poignant as a sack of cat farts. You’re a shame pile of idiocy.” In 2016, while appearing on The Graham Norton Show, Sheen narrated a personal incident that made him dislike Trump. “I was at a dinner with my ex-wife Brooke [Mueller] and her family, and about halfway through I noticed Donald staring at my watch,” Sheen recounted. “He says, ‘I want to give you an early wedding gift as a gesture from me and Melania’ — and she doesn’t say a word...she’s very sweet and very pretty but she just kind of sits there. Anyhow, so he says ‘These are platinum diamond Harry Winston’ and he pulls off his cufflinks and he gives them to me.” As per EW, he continued, “Smash cut to about six months later, I had some jewelry getting appraised at the house... She took the loop, spent about four seconds, and kind of recoiled from it — much like people do from Trump — and says, ‘In their finest moment, this is cheap pewter and bad zirconias.’ And they’re stamped ‘Trump,’ and I just thought, ‘What does this really say about the man, that he said, ‘Here’s a great wedding gift,’ and it’s just a bag of dog sh–?’”","summary":"In 2016, while appearing on &#39;The Graham Norton Show,&#39; Sheen narrated a personal incident that made him dislike Trump.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/what-prompted-charlie-sheen-to-once-say-if-trump-will-have-me-id-be-his-vp-in-a-heartbeat","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706638/uploads/3e7b6460-48b1-11ef-9d55-0549e1601611_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:31:11","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":252467254,"title":"Graphic new video shows Trump gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks dead on roof moments after assassination attempt, confirms Secret Service was warned","text":"Shocking new footage shows local cops and a Secret Service agent standing over the dead body of would-be Donald Trump assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks as they appeared to confirm the 20-year sniper was identified as a suspicious person before he opened fire.

The Hill reported he is in insolation at his Rehoboth Beach, Del., home. He will be returning to the White House Tuesday afternoon before his public address to the country. Biden’s trip to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library to remark on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act has been rescheduled for Monday, according to the White House. It has been a reckoning for this Biden/Harris campaign after his debate with former President Donald Trump. Trump’s attempted assassination may have ever contributed to the dwindling faith in the President. After pressure from Democrats, Biden announced Sunday that he would not seek election., endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee. Support for Harris among Democrats has begun to consolidate, with enough delegates onboard for her to become the nominee, according to The Hill.

Harris has enlisted the law firm of Eric Holder, the former attorney general, to vet possible running mates, sources told Reuters. These are some of the top people being discussed, according to people familiar with internal policy discussions. ANDY BESHEAR, GOVERNOR, KENTUCKY Kentucky’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, has carved a successful political career in a heavily Republican state that voted for Republican Donald Trump by a margin of more than 25 percentage points in 2020. Beshear has touted his record of bringing jobs to Kentucky, supporting public education and expanding health care access. As governor, he has vetoed legislation banning abortions and gender-affirming care for transgender youth, although the vetoes were overridden by the Republican-dominated legislature. Beshear endorsed Harris on Monday, saying she could help the country “move on to something better” for America. Asked if he would consider the vice presidency, he told MSNBC that he loved serving his state but added: “The only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.” PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg built a strong fan base among Democratic Party voters during his 2020 primary run against both Biden and Harris, winning the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucus. Seen as a polished defender of Biden policies, Buttigieg later endorsed Biden and was picked to join the incoming administration’s Cabinet in 2021. The former South Bend, Indiana, mayor also has ties in Michigan, a critical state for Democrats in November. On Sunday, Buttigieg backed Harris’ candidacy, saying “Harris is now the right person to take up the torch, defeat Donald Trump and succeed Joe Biden … I will do all that I can to help her win.” ROY COOPER, GOVERNOR, NORTH CAROLINA North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has won praise from Democrats for his strong focus on economic development and his ability to win relatively strong approval ratings in a politically competitive state that leans Republican and voted for Republican candidate Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. “If you want a nominee who can put Donald Trump’s destruction of Roe at center stage, if you want a nominee who actually prosecuted criminals like Donald Trump, and if you want a nominee who can put Trump’s age and fitness in the forefront, Kamala Harris is the person,” Cooper told MSNBC on Monday, one day after speaking with Harris and announcing his endorsement. MARK KELLY, U.S. SENATOR, ARIZONA U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly is liked among Democratic Party elites for striking a relatively moderate tone in a hotly contested state that traditionally has favored Republicans, but which Biden won in 2020. A former U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, Kelly is also the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting. Gun violence is a major campaign issue for Democrats. “I couldn’t be more confident that Vice President @KamalaHarris is the right person to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country into the future. She has my support for the nomination, and Gabby and I will do everything we can to elect her President of the United States,” Kelly wrote in an X post on Sunday, referring to his wife. JOSH SHAPIRO, GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania’s governor, took office just last year but is already seen as a rising star for the party nationally. Trained as a lawyer, Shapiro served as the state’s attorney general, a legal background that is similar to Harris’ own as a prosecutor. He has a long history of winning elections against Republicans in a state that Democrats believe they must win to secure the election in November. Shapiro and Harris spoke on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the matter. “I’ve known Kamala Harris for nearly two decades — we’ve both been prosecutors, we’ve both stood up for the rule of law, we’ve both fought for the people and delivered results. Kamala Harris is a patriot worthy of our support,” he said in a statement on Sunday, adding that she would “perfect our union, protect democracy and advance real freedom.” J.B. PRITZKER, GOVERNOR, ILLINOIS Billionaire Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has proven a major force in the party, tapping his own financial resources linked to Hyatt Hotels to help Biden’s campaign effort and to stand up the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. While Illinois leans heavily Democratic, neighboring Wisconsin is one of the biggest prizes in the 2024 election. Endorsing Harris on Monday, Pritzker said the two had spoken and that he felt it was important for the U.S. to elect a woman as president. “Harris has proven, at every point in her career, that she possesses the skills, strength, and character to lead this country and the vision to better the lives of all Americans… she represents our party’s best chance to defeat Donald Trump,” he said. TIM WALZ, GOVERNOR, MINNESOTA Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, also would bring to the presidential ticket a record of defeating Republicans in a Midwestern state. A veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard, Walz previously represented a vast, rural and Republican-leaning district that borders the competitive state of Wisconsin in Congress. “Thanks for the call, @KamalaHarris,” he said on social media on Monday. “You have my full support.” GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOVERNOR, MICHIGAN Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has built a strong base in the closely contested state of Michigan, running on a platform of straight talk and kitchen-table issues. She attracted Biden’s attention in 2020, being vetted as a possible running mate before Biden picked Harris. She was a top supporter of and spokesperson for Biden’s reelection bid. A Harris-Whitmer ticket would be the first all-woman ticket for a major U.S. political party — a potential bonus in an election where women’s reproductive rights are a top issue, if such a pairing could surmount any sexism. Whitmer endorsed Harris in a post on X on Monday and said she will serve as co-chair of Harris’ campaign. She told CBS affiliate WLNS that she would not take the vice presidential post if offered it, saying “I am not leaving Michigan.” Harris will focus on lowering costs for Michigan voters, “restoring their freedoms, bringing jobs and supply chains back home from overseas, and building an economy that works for working people,” Whitmer said in a separate statement. “We cannot let Donald Trump anywhere near the White House.

He is one of the youngest governors in the nation and has previously served as Kentucky attorney-general. When asked if he was interested in being VP, he told the Associated Press that he loved his job and planned to serve out his second term. Pete Buttigieg Age: 42 Current position: US secretary of transportation Mr Buttigieg rose to prominence when he ran against Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries. He was mayor of his hometown, South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020 and served seven years as an officer in the US Navy Reserve. The 42-year-old has been described as the party's \"best communicator\" and his age has been discussed as a potential asset to counter the 39-year-old Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance. During the 2020 presidential race, Mr Buttigieg helped Harris prepare for vice-presidential debates by playing her Republican rival, Mike Pence. He is the first openly gay person to serve in a US president's cabinet. Roy Cooper Age: 67 Current position: Governor of North Carolina Mr Cooper is currently serving his second term as North Carolina governor, having previously served as attorney-general for 16 years. He is known for appointing the most diverse cabinet in North Carolina history and for vetoing several anti-abortion bills in his state. The 67-year-old and Ms Harris have known each other for 12 years, since they both served as attorneys-general in their respective states. Mark Kelly Age: 60 Current position: Senator for Arizona As a former astronaut and navy veteran, Mr Kelly has one of the most interesting backgrounds of those in the race to be Ms Harris's running mate. He was first elected to the US Senate in a 2020 special election and was later re-elected to a full term in 2022. Mr Kelly has built a high profile as a gun-control advocate alongside his wife, former representative Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. While he usually toes the party line, Mr Kelly has previously broken rank to describe the entry of undocumented migrants across the southern border as a \"crisis\". Wes Moore Age: 45 Current position: Governor of Maryland Mr Moore is Maryland’s first African American governor and is considered a rising star of the Democratic Party. The former Rhodes scholar has served in the US Army, worked as an investment banker and published five books. The governor's name may be familiar from headlines earlier this year when a cargo ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland, killing six. He has told media he is content being Maryland's governor and wouldn't want the VP job. Gavin Newsom Age: 56 Current position: Governor of California He's been the Californian governor since 2019 and has previously served as mayor of San Francisco. Mr Newsom has built a name for himself in recent years by taking on prominent Republican politicians, including in a debate against Ron DeSantis last year. A potential Harris-Newsom ticket could be difficult, though. The pair both hail from California, which brings up a hurdle under the 12th amendment, which requires electors to \"vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the state with themselves\". Essentially, a Harris-Newsom ticket would have to forgo all of California's 54 electoral college votes. JB Pritzker Age: 59 Current position: Governor of Illinois One of Mr Pritzker's major strengths is his ability to fund his own campaign due to being a member of the wealthy family that founded the Hyatt hotel chain. He is currently serving his second term as Illinois governor and had previously been active in Democratic fundraising circles. Mr Pritzker's non-profit organisation, Think Big America, has funded abortion rights efforts across the US. The governor has become known as a bit of a bulldog for the Democrats for his attacks on Donald Trump. He has fuelled speculation about his political future on social media by replying to a suggestion he \"would be running for something\" with: \"You think I just fell out of a coconut tree?\" That's a reference to a viral clip of Harris. Josh Shapiro Age: 51 Current position: Governor of Pennsylvania Mr Shapiro has been the popular first-term governor of Pennsylvania since 2023. Prior to that, he served as the state's attorney-general for two terms, from 2016 to 2022. During that time, he drew national interest for his investigation into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and successfully fighting Trump's voter fraud claims in the 2020 election. He has been vocal about protecting abortion access in Pennsylvania after the overturning of Roe v Wade. Mr Shapiro, who is Jewish, has aggressively confronted what he has viewed as anti-Semitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations, and he has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas. Gretchen Whitmer Age: 52 Current position: Governor of Michigan Ms Whitmer's name has been bandied about a fair bit in recent weeks, with political commentators first suggesting she was in contention for the party’s presidential nomination. As the governor of a must-win state for Democrats, Ms Whitmer has been one of the Biden campaign's most prominent politicians. With Ms Harris's name likely to be at the top of the ticket, discussions have turned to whether Ms Whitmer could receive the vice-presidential nomination. Former New York mayor Bill de Blasio has suggested on social media a Harris-Whitmer match-up is \"a team we can win with\". But Ms Whitmer has shot down these suggestions, telling media she's \"not going anywhere\" when asked whether she if she's prepared to take the vice-presidency if it is offered.","summary":"With Kamala Harris the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the biggest question looming for the party is who could be her running mate.

Valentina Gomez posted the video on Tuesday afternoon, which was filmed on the iconic balcony looking over Washington, DC connected to Speaker Mike Johnson’s office in the US House of Representatives. “I am at the Speaker’s Balcony, and they don’t like me here, and neither in Jefferson City. But I don’t give a f***,” Gomez said in the video. “I speak the truth, catch pedophiles, and I will be Missouri’s 41st Secretary of State.” The video went on to show a photo of Gomez holding a gun, followed by a campaign graphic. The House Ethics Manual says using House buildings or offices for campaign or political activities is prohibited. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, a representative’s scheduler may coordinate with a campaign scheduler. A representative’s press secretary may also “answer occasional questions on political matters.” The Independent has contacted Johnson for comment. When reached for comment, Gomez told The Independent she wants critics to “stop the hypocrisy” and re-affirmed her support for Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance. “For all of those crying about a 15 second video. Be upset about the 20 million illegals the Biden-Harris Administration allowed into the United States that are raping and killing American women, or the billions sent to Ukraine’s useless war where brave men and women in uniform are being killed, or the J6’rs that are being persecuted and prosecuted, or the grandmas jailed for praying outside of an abortion clinic,” Gomez wrote. There is no evidence to support the claim that 20 million undocumented immigrants have committed violent crimes. Peer-reviewed studies also indicate that undocumented immigrants are less likely than people born in America to commit violent, drug and property crimes. In addition, Gomez’s claim that “grandmas” were “jailed” for “praying outside of an abortion clinic” appears to be a reference to the arrest of 75-year-old Paulette Harlow, who was convicted of federal civil rights offenses after she participated in a blockade of an abortion clinic. Her case has been widely misrepresented online, the Associated Press reports, with many falsely claiming she was arrested for praying. This isn’t the first time Gomez has come under fire for a campaign video. Last month, Gomez posted a video calling Juneteenth, the national holiday that commemorates the end of slavery in the US following the Civil War, the “most rachet” of holidays. “Reparations from slavery and Black victimization is about to be shoved down our throats for the most ratchet holiday in America,” she said. Then, in May, Gomez posted a video of her running with a bulletproof vest, telling viewers, “Don’t be weak and gay.” The video was widely criticized on social media. “So refreshing to see a female GOP candidate who never served in the military doing the whole veteran cosplay, stolen valor, bigotry as a substitute for strength routine as well as any man,” former Missouri Secretary of State and veteran Jason Kander wrote. “‘Don’t be weak and gay’ supremely underestimates the strength required to coexist with idiots like this every day,” Brandon Wolf, national press secretary for the Human Rights Coalition, wrote on X. Gomez also posted a video of her using a flamethrower to burn LGBTQ-themed books earlier this year. X restricted the video soon afterward, stating it “may violate X’s rules against Hateful Conduct.” The candidate has also vowed to “blow up” the “corrupt voting machines” she claims are enabling voter fraud, echoing untrue claims untrue and unsubstantiated claims from Donald Trump and other GOP allies that he lost the 2020 election due to widespread voter fraud.","summary":"The House Ethics Manual prohibits using US House buildings and offices for campaign purposes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/valentina-gomez-speakers-balcony-video-b2584753.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/23/22/Screenshot-2024-07-23-at-5.38.04%E2%80%AFPM.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rmpHwpmK-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:07:03","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":252467854,"title":"Can Memes Really Win Elections?","text":"In some corners of the internet, Kamala Harris is the main character. Will her viral moment serve her? First, here are four new stories from The Atlantic: A Fine Line On Sunday, some of the most notable people in the world were posting some of the most consequential statements of modern American history on social media. But there was one post from a lesser-known figure that none of the frenzied political reporting of recent weeks prepared me for: “kamala IS brat,” the pop singer Charli XCX declared. With three words, XCX, a pop diva of the summer, validated the likely Democratic presidential nominee (to be clear, being “brat”—the title and central concept of her latest album—is a good thing). The internet, to paraphrase another XCX lyric, went crazy. Fans of XCX, who has dominated dance-music charts and captured a young and very online corner of the internet this summer, shared a slew of video edits of Harris with XCX’s songs in the background. Harris’s own rapid-response account on X quickly updated its banner image to “kamala hq” in the font and color scheme of Brat. Sunday was a banner day for Harris online (and, you know, in real life). The internet was ready for her: Over the past month, a steady stream of clips and memes of her zaniest moments, including her widely shared quote from her mother, “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?,” have been getting traction. Harris has long had an energetic online fan base—the so-called #KHive rallied behind her in 2020—but she herself does not often post beyond standard politician fare. That may be part of why the flickers of engagement from her campaign’s account over the past few days—and the clips positioning the candidate as a fun pop-cultural figure—have delighted her fans so. The posts are fun, but they may not hold much value for Harris beyond that. Harris’s team should “keep in mind that the ‘extremely online’ population doesn’t necessarily represent the demographics or worldview of the rest of the country,” Caitlin Chin-Rothmann, a fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me in an email. For all the people excited about the recent memes, many are baffled at, or simply uninterested in, the Brat and coconut-tree discourse. (XCX, although beloved by her fans, is also more of a niche cultural figure than a mainstream pop star.) If Harris indeed becomes the Democratic nominee, she will want, to state the obvious, to earn as many votes as possible. Getting the age group likeliest to be on TikTok and listen to XCX to vote for her could only help. “The youth vote is not large—they’re one of the lowest-turnout groups in the country—but they’ve leaned strongly Democratic in recent cycles,” Seth Masket, the director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver, said in an email. “It’s likely Biden wouldn’t have won in 2020 without their strong support. Engaging them seems particularly important, if not by itself sufficient.” Still, equating online activity with voting trends is a dangerous game: “Social media is mostly a reflection, not a cause, of political behavior,” Dean Lacy, a government professor at Dartmouth, noted to me via email. Research has not borne out a link between social-media traction and the results of an election, he added. It’s too early to see how Harris would play among young people on Election Day, and the picture based on the polling thus far is mixed. (Much of that polling was conducted before she became the likely nominee, so the findings may yet shift as her presence in the race turns from a hypothetical to a real possibility.) CNN polling conducted late last month found that although slightly more people aged 18–34 supported Harris than Donald Trump, she lagged behind other Democrats who saw more support in recent elections. So what is a buzzy online moment worth? Normally, Masket said, he wouldn’t see a huge advantage from this type of online flurry. But young people seemed “incredibly unenthusiastic” about Joe Biden as the nominee, so targeting Gen Z with memes and cultural references may help engage them. And Harris’s campaign doesn’t have much time to spare in bringing aboard the undecided among those voters. The line between participating in an online joke and being cringe is a thin one. Harris is teetering on that line right now—and so far, she’s on the right side of it. It helps that most of the posts and memes are coming from her fans, not from her or her campaign. But the positive online energy could quickly curdle, my colleague Charlie Warzel reminded me, if voters perceive a gap between how Harris acts and how she posts. “If she runs a very staid, normal political campaign, then I think it will feel very inauthentic and cringey if her staff tries to make her seem Extremely Online,” he said. The value of these memes, for Harris, is in what they prove about her candidacy. After months of controlling Biden’s public appearances, the Democrats now have a candidate they can proudly draw attention toward. Harris, as Charlie told me, can “take some of the oxygen away from the Trump campaign. That ability is more of an asset than any set of memes.” Related: Stephanie Bai contributed research.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says he’s not ready to join them just yet. Sanders said Tuesday evening that he hopes Harris will defeat Donald Trump in November, telling reporters: “I’m gonna do everything I can to make sure that she becomes president” — but with a caveat that he needs to see more from her. Sanders stopped short of an endorsement, saying that Harris needs to outline a specific plan to help working-class Americans before he will formally back her campaign. “I look forward to strongly supporting her. But I think if she is going to win, she’s going to have to focus a great deal of attention on the plight of the American working class, come up with some very specific suggestions as to how she’s going to address the reality that 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck,” Sanders said, though he did not outline what specifics he hopes to see from the vice president. Harris has “to make it clear that she’s on the side of the working class of this country. If she does that, she’s going to win and I think she can win big.” Asked whether Harris’ choice of a running mate will be important to his endorsement, Sanders said, “Yes, it is.” Sanders had demanded similar commitments of President Joe Biden before supporting him in the past. The Vermont senator has tended to seize opportunities to elevate his key issues, like expanding Social Security and raising the minimum wage. In fact, Sanders had publicly backed Biden up until the moment he dropped out of the 2024 race, saying the president still had a path to victory if he supported expanded Medicare benefits, a bigger child tax credit and tax hikes on the wealthy to preserve Social Security. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a fellow progressive, had also backed Biden until the end of his campaign as she pressed him to embrace a bolder agenda. But she endorsed Harris hours after Biden exited the race on Sunday. “Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy,” Ocasio-Cortez said on X. Forty-eight Democratic senators have endorsed Harris, along with 175 House members, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York. A majority of pledged delegates to the Democratic convention have also endorsed Harris ahead of an early August vote to make her the party’s nominee for president.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Dozens of Democrats across the party&#8217;s political spectrum quickly endorsed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Senator Bernie Sanders pledges dedicated effort to support Harris&#8217; election, stops short of endorsing her at present first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/senator-bernie-sanders-pledges-dedicated-effort-to-support-harris-election-stops-short-of-endorsing-her-at-present/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Sen-Bernie-Sanders-says-hell-work-hard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 23:03:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.17},{"id":252466422,"title":"Biden heads to Washington after COVID, ending campaign","text":"WILMINGTON, Delaware >> President Joe Biden headed to Washington on Tuesday, two days after ending his re-election bid and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination to take on Republican former President Donald Trump.

Keeping straight on how to dispose of items in each jurisdiction is nearly impossible. Labels “recyclable” or “compostable” are misleading. At Congregation Shir Hadash, we embarked on a journey to improve the sorting of our trash, compost and recycle bins. We have posted signs showing what goes in each bin and a disclaimer that our sorting may differ from people’s homes. People don’t understand the inconsistency and give up. Within the Bay Area, a used pizza container might be recyclable, compostable or trash.

Shaun McCutcheon’s op-ed piece aims to blame Democrats for political violence, but his diatribe misses the point from many angles. He starts by claiming that the answer is speech. However, speech is futile if the other side is not listening. The Republicans did not listen to the polls that showed majority support for a woman’s right to decide about control of her own body. They did not listen when minorities and the underprivileged asked for respect from law enforcement. They did not listen when the middle class demanded that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. They did not listen as multiple judges dismissed lawsuits about the 2020 election for lack of evidence. Worst of all, McCutcheon blames the left for political violence when hundreds of right-wing rioters have been convicted since the Jan 6 insurrection, incited by Donald Trump’s speech at the preceding rally. Campbell Scott Los Gatos Events make Trump no better suited to lead Whatever has happened to big-picture thinking? It is frustrating to me to see the dark predictions for the Democrats coming out of the Donald Trump shooting. The press has been calling this election since the debate. The stakes are so high it shouldn’t matter who is headlining the ticket for the Democrats. What matters is the vision for this country’s future. Claims that photos of a bleeding Trump will become the “defining image of this race” are not helpful, and are being trumpeted by the press in a way that smacks of hysteria. Does anyone remember Jan. 6? Donald Trump created this tragic ecosystem of hate. The New York Times finally came through in their editorial, “Donald Trump is unfit to lead,” calling him “dangerous in word, deed and action.” I hope more editorial boards and columnists stop the knee-jerk reacting and help us to realize what is at stake — democracy.

He blames the media writing that No. 45 would end our democracy as we know it if reelected. I need to ask Jerry Kroth if it’s the media’s fault that the lying candidate keeps giving us reasons to believe exactly what the media is reporting he’ll do if reelected. When reporting what someone states, exactly as they say it, it’s not the reporters’ fault that the person that said it, said it. It’s called reporting.

Trump’s complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday accuses the president and vice president of running afoul of campaign finance laws by turning Biden’s now-ended campaign into the “Harris for President” campaign, allowing Harris to tap into more than $91 million in the campaign’s coffers. After Biden ended his re-election campaign on Sunday, Biden notified the FEC that his committee was changing its name to Harris for President, with Harris as the beneficiary. But as Biden’s running mate, Harris was already sharing the campaign committee with the president, and legal analysts have doubted the arguments at the heart of Trump’s attempt to take the wind out of his rival’s sails. The Trump campaign’s legal team is now accusing Harris of “seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden’s leftover campaign cash — a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,” according to the complaint, which has been reviewed by The Independent. “This is little more than a thinly veiled $91.5 million excessive contribution from one presidential candidate to another, that is, from Joe Biden’s old campaign to Kamala Harris’s new campaign,” reads the complaint, written by Trump campaign general counsel David Worrington. “This effort makes a mockery of our campaign finance laws,” he added. The complaint was first reported by The New York Times. “Team Harris will continue to build on our more than 250 coordinated offices and more than 1,300 coordinated staffers across the battleground states — just like we built on the $240 million cash on hand that we had at launch this week, raising $100 million in our first 36 hours and signing up 58,000 volunteers,” Harris campaign spokesperson Charles Kretchmer Lutvak said in a statement to The Independent. “Republicans may be jealous that Democrats are energized to defeat Donald Trump and his MAGA allies, but baseless legal claims — like the ones they’ve made for years to try to suppress votes and steal elections — will only distract them while we sign up volunteers, talk to voters, and win this election,” he added. Campaign finance analysts have doubted the legal theory propelling Trump-allied challenges to Harris’s campaign. The committees that have raised funds for Biden’s re-election — Biden for President, Biden Victory Fund and Biden Action Fund — all have included Harris. The committees remain the same, just with different names. But right-wing legal groups have been eager to slow down any Democratic momentum now that Biden is no longer in the race. “Because Biden and Harris share a campaign committee, the Vice President and her running mate can continue using the campaign’s existing funds for the general election if she is on the Democratic ticket as either the presidential or vice-presidential nominee,” according to Trevor Potter, president of Campaign Legal Center. Among the arguments in the complaint, Trump’s counsel argues Harris is not in a position to inherit contributions because she is not yet officially the Democratic Party’s nominee, and that the campaign’s treasurer “attempted fraud” by using government documents to “rename and repurpose” Biden’s committee. Moments after Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign, Trump-appointed FEC chair Sean Cooksey posted an excerpt of campaign finance law that requires contributions to a candidate for the general election be refunded or redesignated if that candidate doesn’t run. A group of House Democrats sent him a letter on Tuesday to clarify campaign finance law, warning that his statements could risk fueling “uncertainty and mistrust” in the nation’s campaign finance system and “our democracy more generally.” “All I did was quote federal regulations,” he wrote in response on X. “Why are Democrats afraid of the law?”","summary":"Trump’s FEC complaint accuses Harris of committing a ‘brazen money grab’ after Biden dropped out of the race","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fec-complaint-biden-harris-b2584772.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/23/23/2162572795.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TskseQan-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:58:41","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":252468236,"title":"Canadian Olympic Committee offers 'heartfelt apology' after New Zealand accuses Canada Soccer of spying","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Pennsylvania state police commissioner reveals stunning details about Trump shooting A local law enforcement commissioner revealed during a House Homeland Security hearing on Tuesday stunning new details about the security failures that led to the near assassination of Donald Trump, raising more questions for the embattled U.S. Secret Service.

About 120 remain held and around a third are believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities.Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, per AP. The rising death toll has led to international calls for a ceasefire, and heavy division over the conflict remains in the U.S.Since it was announced Netanyahu would give an address, several Democratic lawmakers have said they will not attend, citing the war.In a statement released on Tuesday, representative Mark Takano of California became the latest Democratic lawmaker to announce he's skipping the speech.Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email for comment Tuesday.\"For weeks I have wrestled with whether or not to attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's joint address before Congress. In recent months, I've grown increasingly troubled by Mr. Netanyahu's actions, which have sought to further his own political survival rather than securing the return of hostages and a much-needed ceasefire. As someone who cares deeply about Israel, I recognize that any path towards a permanent peace must begin with a bilateral ceasefire. Mr. Netanyahu has consistently demonstrated that he is an obstacle to the peace that both Israelis and Palestinians alike deserve,\" Takano said in a news release.This follows Senate Pro Tempore Patty Murray, who was expected to sit behind Netanyahu at the address, declining to attend the speech, along with Representatives Greg Casar, Jim Clyburn, Lloyd Doggett, Pramila Jayapal, Hank Johnson, Stephen Lynch and Jan Schakowsky.In June, AP reported that interviews with more than a dozen Democrats revealed the discontent over Netanyahu's address, and how some feel it is a Republican ploy to divide Democrats.\"It is apparent Republican leadership have given this platform to the Prime Minister in order to sow division amongst Members of Congress during this precarious time. Rather than engage in political games, I plan to meet with Israeli citizens during the morning of the address to support families that have suffered in the wake of the October 7th attack,\" Takano added on Tuesday.GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson, who helped facilitate Netanyahu's address, is expected to highlight Republican support for the Israeli leader.During the visit, Biden is expected to focus his talk with Netanyahu on negotiating a hostage release and ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Jake Sullivan, national security adviser, indicated at a security conference in Colorado last week.According to AP, Biden expressed optimism of a deal as he spoke to campaign staffers on Monday: \"I think we're on the verge\" of ending the war.The outlet also reported that before he departed Israel for the U.S., Netanyahu pointed toward his intent to discuss continuing the conflict with Hamas and confront other Iran-backed groups, along with addressing the release of hostages.Protests are also planned, according to AP, as the demonstrations outside the Capitol are expected to include demonstrators condemning the Israeli military campaign as well as others expressing support for Israel. The largest protest could see at least 5,000 people and is set for Wednesday morning, with organizers planning to march and demand Netanyahu's arrest on war crime charges.","summary":"Division remains in the U.S. as more Democrats are deciding to skip Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's expected speech.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-snub-netanyahu-address-trump-welcome-him-mar-lago-1929352","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2435170/benjamin-netanyahu.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:56:43","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":252466012,"title":"Conservative lawmakers, activists want Homeland Security’s Mayorkas to resign, too, over Trump assassination attempt","text":"US Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and other conservatives are calling on Alejandro Mayorkas, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, to resign in the wake of the resignation of the head of the Secret Service. Hawley made his remarks Tuesday’s resignation of Kimberly Cheatle as the director of the US Secret Service. Cheatle was lambasted for vague answers before the Congressional Oversight Committee Hearing on Monday related to security failures before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump. “Now, Mayorkas must do the same,” Hawley posted on X on Tuesday. Jim DeMint, a former Republican U.S. senator from South Carolina and former president of The Heritage Foundation, also called for Mayorkas to resign. “DHS Secretary Mayorkas must resign as well,” DeMint posted on X. “He has oversight of Cheatle and Secret Service, which lied that Trump had not been denied requests for more Secret Service protection. He should step down immediately.” The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security. US House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February over his handling of the border crisis, in which more than 12 million foreign nationals have illegally crossed the U.S. border under his watch. Mayorkas was the first sitting cabinet member to be impeached in US history, but the Democratic-controlled Senate dismissed the charges without ever holding a trial. Riley Gaines, a former college swimmer turned political activist, also joined the chorus pointing a finger at Mayorkas. “Cheatle answered to Mayorkas. Why hasn’t HE had a press conference on this? Why didn’t HE fire Cheatle before she resigned? Has HE been to the site in Butler, PA?” Gaines posted on X. “This administration is disastrous and it would be the same with Kamala. The whole house needs to be cleaned.” Monica Crowley, a former assistant secretary for Public Affairs for the US Department of the Treasury and a political commentator, also called for Mayorkas’ resignation. “It’s not enough for Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign,” Crowley stated on X. “She and her boss Open Borders Traitor Alejandro Mayorkas MUST be criminally charged, prosecuted and jailed. Mayorkas released a statement on X about Cheatle’s resignation. “I am grateful to Kimberly Cheatle for her leadership as the Director of the United States Secret Service and for her lifelong devotion to our country,” Mayorkas said. “The men and women of the United States Secret Service risk their lives every day to protect others. They make the Secret Service the finest protection agency in the world.”","summary":"Sen.

Ogles' first article of impeachment appears to be in response to President Joe Biden putting Harris in charge of leading diplomatic efforts to determine the root causes of mass migration from Central America to the United States. Republicans misinterpreted this as Biden making Harris his administration's \"border czar,\" which was never a title she held. However, if the GOP is attempting to suggest that the Southern border is Harris' responsibility, then Harris would have an opening to run on illegal border crossings dropping by roughly 40% since Biden issued an executive order clamping down on asylum applications. The second article of impeachment for \"breach of public trust,\" which blames Harris for allegedly concealing Biden's cognitive health from the public and not invoking the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in order to usurp her boss. While Biden's performance in the June debate with former President Donald Trump was lackluster, he sought to distance himself from that with an hour-long solo press conference at the most recent NATO summit in which he answered complex questions on domestic and foreign policy. It's unlikely that Ogles' impeachment effort will pick up steam, as impeachments of high-ranking members of an administration are typically preceded by public hearings and supported by a significant swath of lawmakers. And with the August recess less than two weeks away it's not likely that any hearings in the House Judiciary Committee to discuss Ogles' articles of impeachment will be scheduled. READ MORE: 'What we need in a president': Biden lauded for 'sharp' answers to questions despite gaffe Ogles' effort to impeach Harris over the Southern border is similar to Republicans' impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas earlier this year. However, even top Republican lawyer Jonathan Turley admitted his party had no standing to impeach a cabinet secretary over what amounted to a policy dispute. He instead encouraged Republicans to take their disagreements with Mayorkas and the Biden administration to the polls in November. \"There is no jurisdictional question for Mayorkas, but there is also no current evidence that he is corrupt or committed an impeachable offense,\" Turley wrote in January. \"He can be legitimately accused of effectuating an open border policy, but that is a disagreement on policy that is traced to the President.\" Republicans were unable to impeach Biden despite House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R-Kentucky's best efforts. Even after multiple public hearings, Comer failed to gin up enough support for his crusade against Biden, and the committee effectively scuttled its inquiry this spring.

The 28-year-old put her supermodel credentials on display in a monochrome polka-dot two-piece that brought back memories of the 1960s. Her silky curtains of dark hair fluttered freely in the breeze, and her luminous complexion was amplified with a natural makeup look. After more than a decade of global fame, the reality star and model candidly revealed that she does not 'read criticism' of herself online. 'Social media entails much more than just exposing certain things for the whole world to see. It also means exposing your energy. I take great care to protect my energy and preserve my mental health,' she told Vogue France. Kendall Jenner showed off her sculpted bikini body as she soaked up the sun on the beach for her latest magazine cover Read More Hailey Bieber reveals why she is no longer as close to father Stephen Baldwin and uncle Alec Baldwin as she expects 1st baby with Justin Bieber Her retro chic look was the perfect complement to the theme of the issue, which was dedicated to the memory of 1960s songstress Françoise Hardy. In addition to being a pioneer of the yé-yé musical genre, Françoise was a celebrated fashion icon and a muse to Yves Saint Laurent. She died last month at the age of 80 after a protracted battle with cancer so brutal that she became a vocal advocate of euthanasia. Kendall's latest magazine cover came as she appeared in a sizzling new set of bikini snaps taken in Mallorca for the fashion brand FWRD. The photo-shoot was billed as a salute to 'Old Hollywood elegance,' and in keeping with the idea, Kendall accessorized her swimsuit with a floral headscarf. All of the pictures were in black-and-white, intensifying the sense of throwback glamour that permeated the new images. Kendall's globetrotting summer plans have included a trip to Puerto Rico with her on-again boyfriend Bad Bunny, who is originally from the island. They first went public as a couple in February 2023, but by the end of that year it emerged that they had brought the curtain down on their romance. Her retro chic ensemble was the perfect complement to the theme of the issue, which was dedicated to the memory of the 1960s songstress Françoise Hardy (pictured 1969) Kendall's latest magazine cover came as she appeared in a sizzling new set of bikini snaps taken in Mallorca for the fashion brand FWRD The photo-shoot was billed as a salute to 'Old Hollywood elegance,' and in keeping with the theme, Kendall accessorized her swimsuit with a floral headscarf All of the pictures were in black-and-white, intensifying the sense of throwback glamour that permeated the new images 'Kendall and Bad Bunny have been doing their own things lately and things slowly started to fizzle out between them,' an insider informed Entertainment Tonight. 'They have crazy busy schedules and know they're still young and have a lot more to experience individually before settling down.' However the source insisted that there was no 'negativity between them' and added that 'Kendall’s family still thinks highly of him.' By the first Monday of this May, Kendall and Bad Bunny were spotted together at a Met Gala afterparty, igniting a feverish round of reunion rumors. A few weeks later an insider confirmed they were back on, explaining to People: 'There wasn't ever any drama in their breakup and they missed each other.' They apparently split last year because they were 'not on the same page in life' and 'needed the break to miss each other enough to figure things out.' The supermodel and the rap star 'always had this crazy attraction to each other,' the insider dished, adding: 'Things are great again.' Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Ocasio, was allegedly displeased when he caught wind of the rumors that Kendall was considering getting back together with her previous ex, basketball heartthrob Devin Booker. Kendall's globetrotting summer plans have included a trip to Puerto Rico with her on-again boyfriend Bad Bunny; the pair are pictured last September at Milan Fashion Week By the first Monday of this May, Kendall and Bad Bunny were spotted together at a Met Gala afterparty, igniting a feverish round of reunion rumors; pictured leaving the party The source shared that 'Benny was not happy that Kendall was dating' and had 'been wanting her back,' noting that since their relationship resumed 'Kendall is happy. Benny is very charming and is always sweet to her.' Kendall's latest sighting comes after her sister Khloe Kardashian revealed what she would do if the two of them were able to swap lives. While Khloe, 39, has her hands full as a mother of two, Kendall is the only one of her siblings not to have any children yet. If she were in Kendall's shoes, Khloe would indulge in the freedom of having 'no kids' and not having 'to wake up for carpool' in the morning. She would throw herself into a party girl lifestyle, enjoying 'a f***ing tequila bottle for breakfast' and 'hooking up with every f***ing person,' she declared. Kendall on the other hand 'definitely doesn't do any of those things, that's why she's wasting her life,' Khloe joked on a recent episode of The Kardashians. 'You're wasting it, Kendall. Let me be you for a second.'

Explaining Kamala Harris’s rapid rise","text":"Democrats dragged President Joe Biden for weeks, questioning his physical and mental acuity and whether he could be a winner for them in November. During the Republican National Convention, the idea of former President Donald Trump returning to the White House almost felt like a formality. Fast-forward a few days and Biden’s decision to drop out of the race, and the lightning quick coalescing round Vice President Kamala Harris has re-energized the Democratic Party and gotten the gears of its well-funded political machine going.

In one afternoon, she had taken control of the president’s enormous political operation, managed to contact more than 100 party officials, labor union leaders, and Democratic heavyweights in Congress to ask for their support. The Biden campaign formally recast itself as “Harris for President,” that very afternoon, giving her access to $96 million in cash. And now, she’s clinched a majority of the delegates needed to shore up the nomination. It helps that no other top Democrat has announced plans to challenge her either. “We have 107 days until Election Day,” she said in a statement. “Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.” People like former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy have complained that the GOP is not up against a candidate but a political “managerial machine,” while conservative strategist Scott Jennings claimed hard launching Harris’s White House bid at record speed might have been something that was always in the works. “I was right, though, that the Democrats would turn to Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden’s replacement,” he said. “Though Harris piously proclaims she wants to ‘earn’ the nomination, anyone can see that the fix is in. Biden was taken out in an undemocratic way, and Harris will be installed through a rigged process. Inspiring.” Others, like Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, said Harris is benefitting from an unusual set of circumstances. “I think they realized that it was getting late very quickly,” she said. “It’s only three weeks until the convention. We only have four months until Election Day, and that they had spent three weeks basically wringing their hands after the June 27 debate about what to do about Joe Biden, watching their poll numbers really sink very deeply and down ballot candidates really starting to get incredibly nervous about the impact of the top of the ticket on their own races.” In other words, Democrats were waiting and worrying but the second Biden stepped down, it was go-time. Harris has been able to quickly place herself at the top of the minds of donors, delegates, and voters because “Democrats want to turn to the general election as quickly as possible and avoid more chaos and uncertainty,” Elaine Kamarack, founding director of the Center for Effective Public Management at Brookings, said. Harris was also able to shore up support so quickly because people were familiar with her. “Harris passed the vetting test, and four years in the White House was plenty of time for any other skeletons in her closet to be outed. Not so for the other possible candidates,” Kamarack added. It also helps that delegates know and like her. “Throughout this long process, everyone has wanted to know what members of Congress, senators, and former presidents have to say,” Kamarack said. “While their influence is heavy, they have only one vote each. No one has managed to actually poll the several thousand state delegates on this topic. Vice presidents traditionally do a lot of political work, and Harris was no different. Of all the people mentioned as successors to Biden, I bet that aside from Biden, Harris is the person who has actually met the most delegates.” With the momentum rising, Harris’s campaign announced Tuesday morning that it had raised more than $100 million from 1.1 million donors since Sunday afternoon. She also not so subtly went after Trump during a visit to her new campaign headquarters. Harris, a former San Francisco prosecutor who took on “predators” and “fraudsters,” told a cheering crowd, “Hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” Behind the scenes, Harris tapped former Attorney General Eric Holder to vet her choice of a potential running mate, the New York Times, citing two people briefed on the matter, reported. Her top two political advisers, Sheila Nix and Brian Fallon, made their presence known on a Monday morning senior staff call on the Biden-turned-Harris campaign. Another thing helping Harris are all of the endorsements coming in from high-profile Democrats like Biden, former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to name a few. Former President Barack Obama is the only Democratic big hitter who has yet to endorse her. “President Biden’s very quick endorsement went a long way to make sure the Democratic mayors and other local elected officials across the country united around the vice president,” Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb told the Hill. Bibb said he was glad it happened fast. “This is a unique opportunity to be united as a party, because this is going to be a hard election,” he said. The excitement for Harris was also palpable among Democratic-allied groups, including the American Federation of Teachers. The union’s president, Randi Weingarten, noted that the convention’s order of business had been changed on Monday to endorse Harris.

Even though Harris has been on a roll, Walter warned not to get too comfortable. “They’re conveying the Biden campaign to the Harris campaign, but that’s going to be an integration that’s going to take a little bit of time. I’m sure there are going to be some bumps along the way there,” she said. “And then Harris has to go out and perform as a candidate. She hasn’t had to do that as a candidate since she was on the — well, not even on the trail in 2020, when they were sort of campaigning remotely, and then before that in her failed bid for the nomination. So this is a very different experience that she is going to have to get up to speed on.”","summary":"Democrats dragged President Joe Biden for weeks, questioning his physical and mental acuity and whether he could be a winner for them in November.&#160; During the Republican National Convention, the idea of former President Donald Trump returning to the White House almost felt like a formality.&#160; Fast-forward a few days and Biden&#8217;s decision to drop [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3096380/managerial-machine-right-place-right-time-explaining-kamala-harris-rapid-rise/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kamala-Harris-voters-campaign9833.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:48:03","author":"Barnini Chakraborty","authors":["Barnini Chakraborty"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":252465822,"title":"Kamala Harris' Husband Douglas Says 'They Are Not Vice President and Second Gentleman' When Together","text":"Kamala Harris is on her way to make history again if she gets officially nominated by the Democrats as the frontrunner to face-off Donald Trump in the presidential elections.

In an exclusive word with People, VP Harris disclosed the dynamics she shares with her husband Douglas Emhoff, and her family. Emhoff who is the first Jewish person to be counted among the big four in the White House revealed, how the duo end and start their day on a daily basis. \"We try to approach those moments as husband and wife, not vice president and second gentleman,\" Emhoff said. Adding on the second gentleman shared, \"It’s really our time to be a couple. The morning check-in is a little more procedural: ‘Where are you today? Love you too.

Efforts to secure an agreement have been ongoing for months and picked up renewed momentum in late May after US President Joe Biden laid out the details of a plan to bring home the hostages and eventually bring about an end to the war. Now, as the Israeli Prime Minister prepares to deliver a high-stakes speech to Congress on Wednesday and meet with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday, US officials claim a final deal is within reach. For the families of the hostages held more than nine months in Gaza, there is no time to wait. On Monday, Biden said he believed the different parties were on the “verge of being able to” secure a deal to bring home the hostages and end the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that they are “inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a ceasefire, get the hostages home, and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability.” US officials insist that Israel and Hamas have both agreed to the broad framework of a deal, but specifics and crucial technicalities need to be hammered out. Mediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been leading efforts to finalize those details. A source familiar with the negotiations told CNN Tuesday that an Israeli delegation that was expected to leave on Thursday to transmit the latest Israeli response to the mediators is likely to delay its trip until at least Friday as a result of Netanyahu’s meeting with Biden being postponed until Thursday afternoon. The Israeli prime minister wants to meet with Biden before the Israeli delegation formally transmits its response to the mediators, the source said. The Israeli response is expected to include Netanyahu’s eleventh-hour demands regarding barring armed men from northern Gaza and Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor – key sticking points in the negotiations. If Hamas agrees to those demands, a deal is likely to follow. “If Hamas will say yes, there will be a deal,” the source said. The latest Israeli response will also coincide with the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, going into recess next week. That will make it harder for any right-wing opponents of the deal to move to collapse the government. US officials have been sensitive to the Knesset recess as they remain convinced that politics are at play for Netanyahu back in Israel. Still, as Israel prepares to transmit its response, it has become increasingly clear to multiple parties involved that clinching a ceasefire now depends on the Israeli prime minister and his government. “It’s really Israel’s decision,” an official familiar with the talks told CNN. There’s real concern among the families of Israeli hostages as to whether Netanyahu is willing to make a deal to end the brutal war, after numerous false dawns suggesting a ceasefire was close. Netanyahu ‘has to take it’ Aviva Siegel, a former hostage whose husband, Keith, is still a hostage, told CNN Tuesday that Netanyahu “has to take it and not continue the war.” “He needs to stop the war for kids to come home and the hostages to come home. They are much more important than continuing the war. They’ve suffered. I’ve been there. I know what the situation is. I know what they’re going through,” said Siegel, who was freed after 51 days in Hamas captivity. There are believed to be 116 people who were abducted during the October 7 Hamas attack remaining in Gaza – 44 of them are believed to be deceased. The families said ahead of Netanyahu’s address to Congress that they expect to hear the Israeli prime minister tell Congress that he has agreed to a deal – anything less, they said, is a failure. The families praised Biden’s leadership on the efforts to bring their loved one’s home but now that the US president has announced he will not seek reelection, they are urging him to ratchet up the pressure to finish the deal – something they say could be a key part of his legacy. The families are expected to meet with Biden and with Netanyahu on Thursday. “Not only should you not all collectively take your foot off the gas but put it on even harder and make sure that part of your legacy, Mr. President, is that you get the credit for saving the lives of as many of these hostages as possible,” said Jon Polin, the father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Indeed, the conflict in the Middle East has been a consuming issue for the US president since the October 7 attack. Whether it comes to an end before Biden’s first term will be consequential for his predecessor – whether that is Donald Trump, or possibly Harris, whom Biden has endorsed for the Democratic nomination. When Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House this week, she plans to convey to the Israeli leader that it is time for the war to end, a Harris aide said. Many Israelis, including family members of hostages, are convinced Netanyahu doesn’t want a deal, instead preferring to extend the war and thereby his grip on power. “We expect from our prime minister to cease all stalling, to cease torpedoing any hope for a negotiated return of hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza to stop the suffering of the people of Gaza,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen. “We expect to hear him declare that Israel is going to sign this imperfect, imperfect agreement with Satan, meaning Hamas. But it is a national necessity and anything less than that would be a total failure of his leadership.” Netanyahu, who met on Monday in Washington with families of hostages, said his Israeli government is “determined to return everyone.” “The conditions to bring them back are ripe, for the simple reason that we are putting very strong pressure on Hamas. We are seeing a certain change, and I think this change will continue to grow,” the Israeli prime minister said. However, Daniel Neutra, whose brother Omer is being held hostage, said that “the urgency of the matter did not seem to resonate with” Netanyahu at Monday night’s meeting. ‘Remaining issues’ On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that they “have significantly narrowed the disagreements between the parties,” but there are “a few remaining issues that need to be resolved.” “We continue discussions with the other mediators, and with the Government of Israel to try to reach resolution, but we don’t have that yet, and I don’t have any kind of forecast about when we might come to one,” Miller said. According to an official from a mediating country, the latest proposal from Hamas earlier this month “was very close” to the Israeli position from late May so when Hamas responded, it was believed that Israel’s reaction “would be positive and ready to move forward” with technical teams dispatched to iron out the final details. Negotiators are currently awaiting a response from Israel to a Hamas document received on July 3, according to that official, and recent Israeli responses have been unexpected and unclear, the official said, pointing to Israel’s reneging on a previous, critical position about allowing the unrestricted return of Palestinians to northern Gaza during a pause in the fighting. There’s also significant debate around the Philadelphi corridor and Rafah border crossing, both located between Egypt and Gaza. Netanyahu has argued Israel troops will not withdraw from the nine-mile-long Philadelphi corridor while Hamas has insisted on a full eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and their response, according to a source familiar, is expected to stick to that demand. A central sticking point has been whether a first pause in the fighting would flow seamlessly into a permanent ceasefire, something Israel has rejected. The Biden framework – and a UN resolution that followed – says the first phase will continue as long discussions do over a second phase. That, theoretically, could mean talks could break down and fighting resumes. Meanwhile, the situation on the ground in Gaza remains dire and US officials involved in the humanitarian and security efforts have grown increasingly frustrated by Israeli aggression in recent weeks. There remains no effective communication between the Israel Defense Forces and humanitarian groups, and just in the last week a UN convoy was shot at by the IDF. US officials believe it is possible that Israelis are seeking to put maximum pressure on Hamas ahead of a deal. If a first phase of the ceasefire is launched, Hamas is expected to release just over 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Biden’s natioanl security advisor Jake Sullivan acknowledged on Friday that the exact numbers and type of Palestinian prisoners to be released need to be finalized. There is still discussion around the number of vetoes Israel would have over Palestinian prisoners Hamas wants released, with an expectation that Israel would oppose more hardened prisoners serving longer – or life – sentences, according to details provided by the official from a mediating country, who was granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations. As negotiations on the deal continue, there are also ongoing discussions about security, humanitarian aid, and governance once an agreement is put into place. Those discussions will continue with Netanyahu this week. US and Egyptian officials have begun preparing the flood of humanitarian aid that would enter Gaza if a ceasefire deal goes into effect. Egypt has worked to pre-position nearly 200,000 metric tons of supplies in the northern Egyptian city of el-Arish, one official familiar with the matter said, and talks to prepare for the enormous logistical effort have intensified in the last week. “What we can’t have is an agreement that’s followed by some kind of void that will either be filled, if it’s there, by Hamas coming back, which is unacceptable; by Israel prolonging its occupation, which they say they don’t want to do and is unacceptable; or just having a vacuum that’s filled by lawlessness, that’s filled by chaos, which we see in so many parts of Gaza right now, which is also inimical to actually helping people who desperately need it,” Blinken said Friday. “So making sure that we have a plan in place, which we’ve been working on also every single day – with Arab partners, with Israel, with many others for governance, for security, for humanitarian assistance, for reconstruction – that’s critical.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Thankfully, the similarities of our situations stop there. It took my partner and I three years to conceive our child, something that was very taxing on our marriage and at times very fraught. When our daughter was born, we vowed to support her whoever she, or whatever she calls herself, no matter what. Being a parent has been one of the most challenging, yet rewarding things I’ve ever done. I also worry daily that I will fall short at times, letting my child down when she needs me most. Even now, I hesitate to write about her, given that she did not ask for this, nor is she a public figure. Being a writer means bringing other people into our own words, many times without their explicit consent. Largely, it doesn’t affect them, and it is impossible to write about existence without noting that we are never truly alone. Even acknowledging this, I’ve done more than the world’s richest man has when talking about his daughter Vivian, an episode of The Jordan B. Peterson podcast. In what can only be described as a hateful diatribe, Musk goes on to deadname and misgender his daughter, say that he was “tricked” into provided gender affirming care for her, and declare that she was “killed by the woke mind virus” for transitioning and cutting off contact with her father. Parenting a child means coming to terms with the fact that much of what you expect out of them may not come to pass, and that is more than okay. I would love to share my fervent sports fandom with my child, but I’m not demanding her loyalties lie where mine do. If she chooses to associate with different groups, or avoid ever watching a game with me that’s more than okay. Sports fandom is much more trivial than one's own identity, however. Whatever my child decides about herself in the future, I am there for her. Full stop. I remember coming out to my parents at the age of 29 being so scared to tell them I was transgender that I wrote two letters, one to my mom and stepdad and one to my dad, explaining who I was and introducing them to my authentic self. I gave those letters to my parents, and chose not to be there in person while they read them because I was utterly terrified of their reaction. My parents have been more than affirming, and wonderful in support. I never doubted that for a second, but the act of coming out is such a vulnerable process. Any possibility of misunderstanding was enough to paralyze me with fear and want to either stay in the closet or just not tell the people who raised me the most important facet of myself. Now imagine someone in the throes of adolescence having these fears and lack of clarity about themselves? Instead of reflecting back on support given to his daughter, Musk has chosen to rewrite his child’s story to reflect his political agenda. An agenda that many in the Republican Party have adopted with vigor around the country in the 2024 legislative session. Dr. Jack Turban, Director of the Gender Psychiatry Program at The University of California, San Francisco and author of the book Free to Be: Understanding Kids & Gender Identity, told The Daily Beast that when parents are not affirming it is one of the “greatest predictors of bad mental health outcomes for transgender youth—including anxiety and depression.” That feeling of abandonment and lack of affirmation is not just a short-term feeling that goes away for youth struggling with their identity. In fact, it is something that can stay with someone long into adulthood, requiring future psychological treatment and therapy. “Our relationships with our parents create an essential framework for the other relationships we have in our lives,” Turban says. “It’s essential that our parents be able to listen to and understand us. Even when a child and a parent disagree about something, there are communication skills that can be taught to maintain the relationship even while working through difficult topics in which two people don’t see eye-to-eye.” That’s not to say parents’ feelings and anxieties surrounding their childrens’ identities are not valid and do not deserve support, he added. Providing space for parents to process their own feelings separate from the support they are giving their children, is vital to helping all members of families navigate difficult situations to the best of their abilities. Watching a public figure like Musk disparage their own child’s journey for political gain, is not something that just affects him and his fans. Parents outside of Musk’s own bubble now have to see peers possibly influenced by the weight of his words, and navigate dealing with children that could one day need support like Vivian had during her transition. “As the trans parent of a trans kid who co-parents with a less-than-supportive cis father, these comments terrify me,” one parent, who wished to remain completely anonymous, told me after watching the clip of Musk’s interview making the rounds. “The political debate isn’t just theoretical, I wake up some mornings to see these talking points being weaponized against my own child and I feel so helpless to stop it.” Other parents reflected that while their situations for their gender expansive children were stable, it just shows how out of touch Musk was as a parent for trying to impose their own beliefs post-hoc when they are no longer in control of that child’s life. Katie, a parent with a middle school child, told me that Musk’s comments made her grateful that her child was “able to live their own life,” and that trying to control that even after they grew up is “self-absorbed” behavior. “He’s choosing to be sad, like some perverse self-martyrdom,” she said. “Buddy, your idea of who your kid was gonna be is dead, and sorry to burst your bubble, but as a parent that is always gonna happen.” For many, just like my partner and I, the journey to parenthood is not a linear fashion and the risks of childbirth and the first few days of life can be full of complications. The challenges we faced as early parents were terrifying and something that I will never take for granted when choosing to pursue having future children. Steve, a parent with a preteen child, told me that Musk’s comments made him reflect on the “traumatic” stress of having a long NICU stay after his child was born. Making such statements when Musk has discussed having had a child die from a SIDS-related incident was a beyond hateful choice in his mind. “Musk’s sentiment that a child transitioning was equivalent to the child dying was, simply put, profane.” There will always be disagreements between parents on how best to raise children, as there is no single way to be a parent. Even my wife and I have disagreements on what we think is best for our own child, but we also communicate about these issues and learn from each other. Unfortunately, Musk’s comments matter not just for their reach and his platform as the owner of social media site X, but because he has pledged to spend $45 million a month to help elect Donald Trump as President of the United States. Such an investment will likely push the right-wing candidate towards policies that would ban gender-affirming care for American minors, even if studies show these policies are based on flimsy evidence and a lack of understanding of how transgender healthcare works. Hearing such words against a child that has grown up and chosen to live as their authentic self is painful, especially as someone who was terrified to come out themselves. I just hope my child knows, I’m so excited to see whoever they become.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyRegrettably, I have to say that Elon Musk and I have something near and dear in common: we both have used fertility treatments to conceive our children.\n\nThankfully, the similarities of our situations stop there.\n\nIt took my partner and I three years to conceive our child, something that was very taxing on our marriage and at times very fraught.

This series of events has not only shocked the United States but has also drawn widespread condemnation from around the globe. As the nation prepares for another contentious election, it is crucial to critically examine Trump’s chances of winning and the potential trajectory of the United States under his leadership if he succeeds. The attempt on Trump’s life is a stark reminder of the intense polarization that characterizes contemporary American politics. The incident has been condemned universally, with leaders from diverse political backgrounds and countries expressing their disapproval. This widespread condemnation underscores a global consensus against violence and highlights the heightened tensions surrounding Trump’s candidacy. Analyzing Trump’s prospects for victory involves considering several factors. Firstly, his loyal base remains a formidable force, unwavering in their support despite numerous controversies. His rhetoric and policies resonate with a significant portion of the electorate who feel disenfranchised by the political establishment. However, Trump’s divisiveness also galvanizes opposition. His presidency was marked by numerous scandals, policy reversals, and a contentious handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors have left a considerable segment of the population deeply opposed to his return to the White House. Furthermore, the broader Republican Party is experiencing internal divisions. While some factions staunchly support Trump, others seek a more moderate or alternative candidate. This split could impact his ability to consolidate the party’s support. If Trump wins, the United States could see a continuation and intensification of his previous policies. His administration would likely focus on stringent immigration policies, deregulation, and a robust “America First” foreign policy stance. Economic policies might emphasize tax cuts and reduced government intervention in the market, aiming to spur growth but potentially increasing inequality. On the international stage, Trump’s approach could lead to strained relationships with traditional allies while fostering closer ties with authoritarian regimes. His skepticism towards multilateral organizations might result in further withdrawals from international agreements and a pivot towards bilateral deals. Domestically, Trump’s leadership could exacerbate the existing social and political divides. His confrontational style and often incendiary rhetoric might fuel further polarization, making bipartisan cooperation increasingly difficult. Issues such as healthcare, climate change, and social justice could become even more contentious under his administration. As Donald Trump embarks on his journey to reclaim the presidency, the nation stands at a crossroads. The assassination attempt and its subsequent global condemnation highlight the volatile nature of this election cycle. While Trump’s dedicated supporters provide a solid foundation for his campaign, the opposition he faces, both within his party and from the general electorate, poses significant challenges. The direction in which he might lead the United States, characterized by his previous tenure, suggests a period of intensified partisanship and a dramatic shift in both domestic and foreign policies. The upcoming election will undoubtedly be a defining moment for the country, determining the path it will take in the years to come.","summary":"&#160; Yog Rahi Gupta Donald Trump&#8217;s official nomination as the Republican presidential candidate has stirred significant controversy, compounded by a recent assassination attempt on his life.

The Trump campaign’s general counsel filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday, according to the New York Times, criticizing Democrats for transferring Biden’s campaign coffers to Harris after the president dropped his reelection bid. “Kamala Harris is seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden’s leftover campaign cash — a brazen money grab that would constitute the single largest excessive contribution and biggest violation in the history of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended,” David Warrington wrote in the FEC complaint. Although Biden’s heir apparent, Harris is not yet the Democratic presidential nominee. The Trump campaign said that until she is the nominee, contributions made to Biden should not be rolled over to the vice president. “To date, Biden for President has provided no indication that it will return or redesignate all of its general election contributions,” Warrington wrote in the complaint. “Thus, each and every general election contribution received by Biden for President is an excessive contribution.” According to the newspaper, the FEC complaint may not be resolved until the election. However, the Trump campaign has suggested it may file a lawsuit to block the transfer of funds to Harris.

The main purpose of Netanyahu’s visit is a speech to a joint meeting of Congress. But at stake, in meetings with administration officials, are hopes for progress in U.S.-led efforts to mediate an end to the nine-month Israel-Hamas war. The visit comes as the toll of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza nears 40,000. It’s also in a week when new deaths were reported among the surviving hostages — who include Israelis, Americans and other nationalities — held by Hamas and other militants since the first hours of the war. Netanyahu planned his trip weeks before the ground abruptly started heaving under U.S. politics this summer. That includes a July 13 assassination attempt against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and President Biden’s decision Sunday to give up his faltering reelection campaign and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the presidency instead. Protests are planned for Netanyahu’s planned speech to both houses of Congress on Wednesday. A look at the visit: WHY NETANYAHU IS COMING The political aspect for Netanyahu is that his popularity has plummeted at home, and the visit — at least originally — was seen as giving him a chance to show himself as a global statesman, welcomed by the lawmakers and leaders of Israel’s closest ally and the world’s only superpower. House Speaker Mike Johnson helped bring about Netanyahu’s address to lawmakers, highlighting firm Republican support for the Israeli leader. Netanyahu has had tense relations with Biden despite the administration’s military and diplomatic support for Israel’s war. Biden and Netanyahu are expected to meet Thursday, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the White House announcement. Harris will also meet with Netanyahu separately that day. Speaking for the White House side of things, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at a security conference in Colorado last week that Biden planned to focus on working out what it will take for the United States, Israel and others to get a hostage-release and cease-fire deal done in the coming weeks. Biden called in to a meeting of campaign staffers Monday, telling them, “I think we’re on the verge” of ending the war. For his part, Netanyahu pointed to longer-term issues before flying out of Israel Monday. He said he wanted to talk to Biden about continuing the war against Hamas, and confronting other Iran-backed armed groups in the region, as well as freeing hostages. WHY NETANYAHU’S VISIT IS CONTROVERSIAL Israel’s war has been intensely divisive in the United States, spurring protests and resulting in arrests on college campuses, alienating some voters on both sides of the issue, and frustrating months of effort by Biden to bring the fighting to a close. The trip is the first time Netanyahu has traveled abroad since the war broke out Oct. 7. It’s also his first since the International Criminal Court said it was seeking his arrest in what it said were possible war crimes in Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Israel denies wrongdoing, and the U.S. does not recognize the ICC. Netanyahu faces complaints in Israel that he is avoiding closing a cease-fire and hostage-release deal so as to stay in power, a charge repeated Monday by a relative of one hostage. Netanyahu also has not been shy about criticizing Democratic administrations, including Biden’s. In 2015, the Israeli leader used a speech to both houses of Congress to try to torpedo lawmaker and popular support for President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. He condemned it as a bad and dangerous deal, angering administration officials. Sullivan said administration officials don’t expect this week to be a repeat of 2015. Netanyahu’s timing It appears bad. Even as Netanyahu was headed for Washington on Monday, American politics and voters were still adjusting to the abrupt shift of focus from Biden to Harris in the Democratic presidential race. Biden was still in Delaware getting over COVID-19. Harris, as Senate president, would normally sit behind foreign leaders, but she’ll be away Wednesday, on an Indianapolis trip scheduled before she became the leading Democratic presidential candidate over the weekend. Trump agreed to a Friday meeting with the Israeli leader. Trump announced it on Truth Social, using it to promote what he wrote was his “PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH Agenda” abroad. Trump has had a mixed relationship with Netanyahu, including cursing him for what Trump portrayed as Netanyahu’s quick recognition of Biden’s victory in the 2020 elections. PROTESTS ARE PLANNED Netanyahu’s joint address to Congress will look a bit different from previous such addresses, in part due to opposition among Democrats to his conduct of the war in Gaza. With Harris away, Senate Pro Tempore Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is next in line to fill the seat behind Netanyahu, but she is among the lawmakers declining to attend. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Ben Cardin will sit there instead. He told The Associated Press he hoped Netanyahu would use the speech to lay out a future for both Israelis and Palestinians. While families of some hostages were reported to be traveling with Netanyahu, other relatives who fault his handling of the crisis said they would also be sitting in the chamber. Some lawmakers who planned to boycott the address said they would spend the time talking with the families of those held by Hamas. Multiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages. The largest protest is set for Wednesday morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu’s arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants. Protests were held Tuesday and were to continue throughout the day Wednesday. Relatives of Israeli hostages are planning a vigil on the National Mall. SECURITY IS TIGHT Fencing was up around entry points to the Capitol and the hotel along the Potomac River where Netanyahu is staying. Capitol Police and Secret Service were out in greater numbers, stepping up screening and protection for the Israeli leader’s visit. The Metropolitan Police Department announced an extended series of street closures that will last most of the week. The visit comes at a moment the Secret Service, which handles protection of visiting foreign leaders, is under greater security and intense political criticism from both parties over security failures in the attack on Trump. Kimberly Cheatle, director of the Secret Service, quit Tuesday over the failures. Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Zeke Miller in Washington and Josef Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, blamed “a bit of a hangover” after rivals cut prices “very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla”. Tesla has sought to drum up interest in its plans for robotaxis, artificial intelligence and “genuinely useful” humanoid robots as deliveries slipped amid cooling demand. Production of the carmaker’s next-generation Roadster sports car is scheduled to begin next year, Musk said on a conference call with investors on Tuesday. He also said he would be “shocked” if Tesla does not introduce “unsupervised” self-driving software by 2025, and claimed that “several thousand” Optimus robots will be deployed in the company’s factories next year, before it starts manufacturing them for wider use. Its latest results underlined the challenges Tesla has faced in recent months, however. Total sales at the business rose 2% to $25.5bn in the latest quarter, ahead of expectations of $24.8bn on Wall Street. But profits dropped 45% to $1.48bn. Shares in Tesla dropped 6.9% during out-of-hours trading in New York. “We don’t see this as a long-term issue,” Musk said of discounting in the electric vehicle market, “but really fairly short-term.” Musk, the world’s richest man, has in recent weeks endorsed Donald Trump for president and reportedly plans to donate tens of millions of dollars to back his campaign. “I’m not suggesting that Trump is without flaws,” he wrote on Sunday, “however we need an administration that is more likely to be meritocratic and promote individual freedoms over the heavy hand of government.” Musk, who also leads SpaceX, the rockets and satellites business, and controls X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, declared earlier this month that both companies would follow Tesla by relocating their headquarters from California to Texas. He cited California’s new law banning school transgender notification requirements as one of the reasons for the move. Shareholders in Tesla, which is based in Austin, approved a $45bn pay deal for Musk in June, following a fiercely contested referendum on his leadership. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush, said ahead of Tesla’s latest results that the company had “clear momentum” and was on track “over the coming quarters” to build up production to an annual rate of 2 million vehicles, citing stabilization of worldwide demand.","summary":"CEO Elon Musk blames ‘bit of a hangover’ from rivals’ discounting but insists challenges are ‘fairly short-term’\n\nEarnings at Tesla almost halved as discounts and price cuts pile pressure on the electric carmaker’s profit margins.\n\nElon Musk, the company’s CEO, blamed “a bit of a hangover” after rivals cut prices “very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla”.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/23/tesla-quarterly-earnings-elon-musk","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e3c88c7c3c258b65a825b3173cf8cb4a7075a4/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:40:57","author":"Callum Jones","authors":["Callum Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":252465152,"title":"Chicago Biden delegate won’t rule out Gov. Pritzker as Harris VP: ‘Understands how to work with people’","text":"(The Center Square) – With President Joe Biden no longer the Democratic Party’s nominee, the party’s national convention could be full of intrigue. Nearly 740,000 Illinois voters voted for Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president in the March primary in Illinois, 91% of the votes Democrats cast. Biden announced Sunday he would not seek reelection. He later endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party’s nominee at the convention next month. The endorsements for Harris continue to pour in, including from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. “I am proud to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for President of the United States,” Pritzker said through his campaign Monday. “It’s important to be thoughtful about what’s next for the Democratic Party and for the country, which is why I spent hours yesterday talking to fellow leaders in our Party getting and giving input about the road to victory in November. I am also cognizant of the unique role we play here in Illinois as hosts of the Democratic National Convention.” State Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, is a Biden delegate and urged for a strong ticket. He wouldn’t discount Pritzker possibly being on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate. “And he’s already proven that he understands how to be inclusive,” Ford told The Center Square. “He understands how to have a big tent and work with people.” As for how it plays out on the convention floor, Ford hopes there’s unity for whatever ticket emerges. “Whereas individuals in our party start fighting and possibly causing looting and rioting in the streets,” Ford said. Democrats from across the country meet in Chicago for their national convention beginning Aug. 19. Whoever the party selects to be its presidential and vice presidential candidates will take on the ticket of former Republican President Donald Trump and Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance in the Nov. 5 election. In May, Pritzker signed a hastily enacted measure prohibiting a statehouse candidate from the November ballot if they didn’t run in a party primary, calling it an ethics bill. State Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville, said what’s transpiring at the top of the Democrat’s ticket is hypocritical. “For Illinois state House or Illinois state Senate candidates, if it’s unethical and these backroom deals are terrible, what does it say when it’s the president of the United States?” Plummer told The Center Square. Ford said the national party’s rules are meant to handle such situations. “It’s not even a new process. This is something that is in writing for the Democrats and the Republicans to be able to do in case of emergency, or in the case that the current presumptive nominee is not capable or willing to run again,” Ford said. The Illinois State Board of Elections said Illinois’ ballot won’t be certified until Aug. 23, after the DNC, which begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.","summary":"With President Joe Biden no longer the Democratic Party’s nominee, the party’s national convention could be full of intrigue.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/23/us-news/chicago-biden-delegate-wont-rule-out-gov-pritzker-as-harris-vp-understands-how-to-work-with-people/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85884009.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:33:23","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":252465608,"title":"We are Not ‘DEI Hires’: Why Conservative Media’s Obsession With Minimizing Kamala Harris and POC’s Accomplishments Will Ultimately Fail","text":"Here we go again.

Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy’s presidential office, and Phil Gordon discussed the situation at the front and Russia’s campaign of aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, Yermak’s office said. “He (Yermak) emphasized the importance of strengthening Ukrainian air defense with modern Western systems,” the statement said. Zelenskiy referred to the conversation in his nightly video address, recalling that Harris had represented the United States at last month’s peace summit in Switzerland. “It is important that the dynamics of our joint work for a just peace do not diminish,” Zelenskiy said. “All our partners at all levels know and will continue to know the prospects for a just peace to be restored as soon as possible.” The United States has been a vital wartime ally of Ukraine, supplying many billions of dollars of military and financial assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

As of Monday, her campaign said that she has secured enough support from delegates to be her party's presumptive nominee, and the last 48 hours have brought in a record number of donations for Democrats.According to a poll conducted by NPR, PBS News and Marist, however, Harris is likely in for a neck-and-neck battle against former President Donald Trump, who formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination last week. The poll released on Tuesday found that Harris trailed Trump by 1 percentage point (45 percent to 46 percent, respectively) across nationally registered voters. In such a close contest, either candidate will have to rely on key demographics—such as independent women voters—to push them to victory in November.Trump, according to the Marist poll, surpasses Harris in this crucial category. Forty-six percent of independent voters surveyed this week said that they would pick the former president in a hypothetical matchup between him and Harris, compared to 32 percent of independents who said they would back the vice president. Breaking down even further, Harris only gained the support of 29 percent of independent women, compared to the 43 percent that said they would back Trump if the election was held today. The poll was conducted on July 22 and includes the response from 1,117 registered voters nationwide.The results are a significant step back from how Biden, who dropped out of the 2024 election on Sunday, was faring among independent women. In an NPR/PBS/Marist poll conducted between July 9 and 10, 48 percent of independent women said that they would back the president if the election was held today. That result followed Biden's rocky first debate performance on June 27, which ignited concerns among Democrats about the president's ability to defeat Trump in November.Newsweek sent an email to Marist Poll for comment on Tuesday.Polling prior to Biden dropping out of the race showed that Harris may have a tough time winning over independent and moderate voters. According to the compiling of polling data conducted by NBC News in January, April and July, Harris has a lower net score than Biden among independents—while Biden's net rating was negative favorability review by 25 percentage points between the three months reviewed, Harris had a net negative of 29 points among independents.NPR pointed out, however, that the most recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that a growing number of independents may be up for grabs following Biden's exit. Nearly 1 in 5 independents indicated in the survey this week that they are undecided when given Harris and Trump on the ballot. Earlier this month, when voters were asked to choose between Biden and Trump, only 4 percent of independents indicated they were undecided.Harris hosted her first rally as the presumptive Democratic nominee in Wisconsin on Tuesday, a pivotal swing state that Biden flipped in 2020 against Trump. Much of her campaign messaging has focused on protecting women's rights and access to abortion, a winning issue for Democrats since the overturn of Roe v. Wade that could help the vice president's popularity among suburban and independent women voters before November.Harris told her supporters in Milwaukee on Tuesday, \"We who believe in reproductive freedom will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.\"\"And when Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,\" Harris added while the crowd cheered.","summary":"Harris appears to be trailing former President Donald Trump among independent women voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-independent-women-problem-poll-1929355","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2435175/harris-has-independent-women-problem-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-23 22:28:25","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":252466046,"title":"Lifetime Pennsylvania Democrats are becoming Republicans","text":"TYRONE, Pennsylvania — Shirley Hall has always lived in this charming Blair County borough, located a few miles from the big city of Altoona and once the home of booming coal and paper mill industries. She has also been a Catholic all of her life and for most of it a registered Democrat, two attributes she says are, or at least were, a profound part of her identity. She is still a Catholic, faithfully so, but last week when watching former President Donald Trump walk into the convention hall in Milwaukee just two days after being shot, she changed her voter registration on the spot. In short, she is not just a Democrat voting for Trump come November, but she is now a Republican and will be voting so up and down the ballot. How solidly Democrat was Hall? The retired administrator for a local Catholic church voted for Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton in 2016 and did not vote for Donald Trump in 2020. “I didn’t vote for Biden either. I just didn’t vote for either man that year,” Hall said. Hall said a number of things led to her pivotal decision last week. “The last three years had really disheartened me in how my party had handled inflation, never recognizing that it is really impacting people’s lives, but also the border and how that has made accessing drugs even easier for people,” she said. But the 78-year-old grandmother of two said she has great concern for the younger generation because of her grandsons, “not just because of them but because of all young people, with the debt, higher taxes, our education system, our immigration system, and I’ve been really frustrated with the whole thing.” She adds, “I want to tell you, oh, I’m not a big Trump fan when he goes on too much, but I also recognize he can also be very likable. But after the shooting, as an American citizen, I really felt bad.” Hall says she was curious to catch Trump at the convention, something she would not normally watch. “I wanted to see his demeanor, and I was really moved by him when he came in,” she said. “As a matter of fact, I had tears in my eyes when he did. He really looked like he took a blow, not only physically but emotionally, which I’m sure he did.” She added, “I used to work for a priest [who was] a bit gruff and a pain in the butt, and he grumbled and growled and shouted and yelled. And yet he had the wherewithal to feel for people. He did that. Well, that was what I saw in Trump. And I thought, ‘I’m changing my party.’ Click, click, click, click, click. I went into my computer and did it.” The choice of Vice President Kamala Harris to replace President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket after last weekend’s dramatic turn of events changed nothing for Hall, who said, “First, I like her less than Biden. She is much further left than I am comfortable with for our country. And second, she was shoulder to shoulder with Biden on every big policy decision that has been made the past three years, so she is the same as him only more removed from now former Democrats like me.” Hall’s decision is notable, Chris Borick, political science professor at Muhlenberg College, explained, in that she is not just a Democrat voting for Trump but “she has shed her Democratic Party identity in its entirety, that is as personal to her as her identity as a Catholic.” And Borick said her experience is not anecdotal. “She is part of a shift in party registration in Pennsylvania that has been seismic in this past state that began in 2016 and has accelerated in the past 18 months,” he said. In 2008, the same year Obama won this state by a resounding 10 percentage points, Democrats held a sizable 12% registration advantage over Republicans. In 2022, that number had shrunk in half to a 529,000 Democratic registration edge, and by this year, that number had shrunk even further to 360,982, which is barely a 4% advantage. Republicans have actually surpassed Democrats in the all-important counties of Bucks and Beaver, for the first time ever in the latter. And Borick explains that sometimes registration numbers are lagging indicators. “What I mean by that is that voters have changed their voting patterns before they change their registration,” he said. “So they might vote, have been voting Republican for a long time, or at least since 2016 with the ascension of Trump and the GOP.” “By the way, this is not an easy decision for a voter to make, especially for legacy Democrats in this case that might’ve had family for years be Democrats to say, ‘OK, well, I’m no longer a Democrat,’” he said. “That’s part of our identity. There’s lots of research, by the way, that shows we hold fast to our political identity more so than some of our other identities like religion.” Borick said the effect in Pennsylvania of Harris’s entry into the race is going to be highly scrutinized because of the importance of the state’s 20 electoral votes. While most recent polling showed Trump favored to varying degrees over Harris, CNN polling expert Harry Enten warned on air that number might be tough for her to overcome. “Beating Trump won’t be easy,” Enten said. “His favorable rating is higher now than it has ever been [per two polls taken over the weekend].” Harris may poll better than Biden did against Trump, but Trump is running 5 points further ahead nationally against her than he finished against Biden in 2020. Borick said Harris’s challenges are much the same as Clinton faced in 2016 in that she doesn’t connect with them where they are.“We always try to quantify likability and how people relate to others in the political realm,” he said. “The vice president certainly has contended with those challenges and will, in terms of her connection.” Borick said Harris has opportunities based on identity and her demographics to maybe make some connections that Biden was struggling with. “That’s unquestionable with younger voters, with voters of color. At the same time, does her ability to resonate with voters that are often older and older in a state like Pennsylvania, are those going to be new challenges she faces?” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Overall though, Borick said Harris’s challenges with voters here are no different than Biden’s in that they rarely addressed the issues in a way that voters needed them to be meaningful, and “inflation is of course front and center.” “That is part of why I changed my registration,” Hall said. “They never saw me, they never heard me. It was hard for me to leave until I realized they didn’t want me anymore, and then it wasn’t hard to leave at all.”","summary":"TYRONE, Pennsylvania — Shirley Hall has always lived in this charming Blair County borough, located a few miles from the big city of Altoona and once the home of booming coal and paper mill industries.

Harris holds a two-point lead over Trump, 44 percent to 42 percent, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. It was conducted in the two days after Biden announced Sunday he was dropping out of the race and endorsing his vice president. In the previous week's poll, Harris, 59, and Trump, now the elder in the presidential race at 78, were tied at 44 percent. Harris, the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination who is raking in endorsements and donations as well as pledged delegates, narrowly trails Republican flag-bearer Trump in another survey also released Tuesday. Both results are within the polls' margins of error. The new surveys followed both the Republican National Convention, where Trump formally accepted the party's presidential nomination, and Biden's leaving the race. Harris's performance in the polls, bolstered by the excitement among Democratic voters about the shakeup in the race, shows her apparently neutralizing the bounce that a nominee gets in the days after his or her party's nominating convention. In a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted Monday, Trump edges Harris with 46 percent to 45 percent of US registered voters, with nine percent undecided. If third-party candidates or independents are included in the contest, Trump and Harris are tied at 42 percent, with the others far behind. The PBS News survey notably found that 87 percent of all Americans think Biden's decision to drop out was the right move, a view that crossed partisan and generational lines. A plurality of respondents (41 percent) said Biden's decision increases Democrats' chances of winning in November, compared to 24 percent who said it decreases the party's odds and 34 percent who said it makes no difference. Both surveys come in the aftermath of Trump surviving a shock assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. Trump maintains a very narrow advantage of 1.6 percentage points against Harris, according to an average of polls collated by RealClearPolitics.
