Our top stories and themes. The stock markets edge up even as prominent initial public offers that entered the market recently get hammered.Donald Trump has wiped out an entire India's market capitalisation on Wall Street at close to $5 trillion. Why it makes sense to buy gold in India and not Dubai. Building resilience in climate change, in telecom infrastructure, lessons for other industries as well.And computer programming jobs are disappearing at a dramatic rate in the United States. The Markets Edge Up But Not IPOsIt was a warm but bright Monday as markets started somewhat shakily but then edged up and stayed there despite some selling as is usually the case into the trading day. Financial stocks were amongst the key drivers of the indices on Monday. The BSE Sensex finally closed 341 points higher at 74,170 after some swinging, while the NSE Nifty 50 was up 112 points at 22,509.In the broader market, the BSE Mid Cap Index was up about 0.8 or just under 1%. The Small Cap Index was mostly unchanged. The overall market breadth, despite the markets going up at the benchmark level, was negative according to the business standard.There were 2,500 declining stocks against 1,617 advancing stocks. There was carnage among several IPO stocks, a good reminder that most of them only seem to work for smart and active traders who can sell on listing. The business standard once again pointed out that many recent IPOs tanked up to 15% or hit new lows just on Monday.The names included prominent ones thanks to all the money spent on hype and marketing, so you know which ones. Many, of course, were never profitable to start with. So maybe in the next round, investors will be or could be more cautious with where they put their money when it comes to IPOs or how they select them.—Wall Street has seen a $5 trillion correction, more than the entire value of the Indian stock market, which of course has declined in recent months. This is also the worst period since 2009 when Barack Obama took office amidst the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, according to author and speaker Scott Galloway. Since mid-February, the S&P has lost more than $5 trillion or almost six times the value of the entire trade deficit that Donald Trump's tariffs are attempting to narrow.On the other hand, Galloway also says that valuations were stretched and the S&P had gone through 343 days without correction. Valuations of the S&P 500 were around 25x compared to long-term averages of about 16x. On the other hand, the big losers are actually the Trump trades, which also highlights the challenges or maybe even the fallacy of investing behind a specific political figure in a broad market.The Galloway newsletter points out that the Trump trades range from Amazon, Apple, Google, Nvidia, as well as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, apart from many small caps. And of course, there's Tesla, which is down about 38% this year. Meanwhile, on Monday, futures were trading lower and the markets were low after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen dismissed recent declines as healthy, reinforcing the view that the Trump administration was unlikely to step in to boost markets, according to Bloomberg. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts were down as Bessen told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that he was not worried by the slump in U.S. stocks after that $5 trillion was wiped out. A strategist at Rabobank told Bloomberg that this statement caused alarm for many Wall Street types who've been counting on Bessen to be the second Trump administration's voice of reason on economic policy. Another geopolitical risk also opened up, meanwhile, with the U.S. threatening unrelenting military strikes on Yemen's Houthi militants who said they would respond by ...","url":"https://www.thecore.in/podcasts/markets-edge-up-even-as-prominent-ipos-get-hammered-831681","image":"https://www.thecore.in/h-upload/2025/03/17/1051721-e533-1200x630.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 01:13:58","author":"Govindraj Ethiraj","authors":["Govindraj Ethiraj"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":301260428,"title":"US struck by deadly cross-country storm","text":"By Hanna Park, Robert Shackelford, Rafael Romo and Mary Gilbert, CNN\n\n(CNN) — A powerful storm system that tore across the United States in recent days was winding down Monday, but in its wake are devastated communities hit with violent tornadoes, wildfires and dust storms spun off by the massive system.\n\nAt least 42 people died in storm-related incidents in eight states, according to officials. Missouri has the most deaths with 12, followed by Kansas with eight. Most of Alabama was severely impacted, and at least three died there.\n\n“Disaster,” one Alabama resident told CNN, when asked to describe the scene. “I’ve seen nothing like this since I was a kid.”\n\nRecent layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, coupled with potential cuts and drastic changes to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have sparked widespread concern about the nation’s ability to respond to severe weather and natural disasters.\n\nThe remainder of the rain and storms from the system exited the mid-Atlantic early Monday but wet weather was to linger in the Northeast into the evening.\n\nTrail of destruction\n\nThe storm unleashed a deadly wave of tornadoes across the Central and Southern US starting Friday. There have been around 80 tornado reports, with dozens confirmed. Storm surveys will happen over the next few days to get a final tornado count.\n\nThe National Weather Service said two EF4 tornadoes tore through Arkansas on Friday, marking the first time in over 25 years the state has experienced multiple EF4 tornadoes in a single day.\n\nOne EF4 tornado, with winds peaking at 170 mph, struck near Larkin in northern Arkansas, while another devastated the town of Diaz with an estimated 190 mph winds, according to the weather service.\n\nTornadoes of EF4 strength are labeled as “violent” and can be devastating, easily destroying homes, tossing cars and downing large trees.\n\nAt least three people have died in connection with the storms in Arkansas.\n\nIn Alabama, three deaths were confirmed in Plantersville, Dallas County, and Winterboro, in Talladega County, as damage assessments continued across more than half of the state’s counties, Gov. Kay Ivey said.\n\n“Yesterday’s severe weather impacted most of Alabama,” Ivey said in a statement, offering condolences to the affected communities.\n\nHigh winds worsened the devastation, with over 710 windstorm reports filed across central and eastern states. The storms and punishing winds knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses over the weekend, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nWinds topping 80 mph whipped across the Plains on Friday. Four people in Texas were killed in car crashes attributed to dust storms. At least eight people died in a 50-vehicle crash caused by a severe dust storm in Kansas on Friday afternoon.\n\nPowerful winds also turned deadly in North Carolina early Sunday. Two children in Brevard, about 30 miles south of Asheville, were killed in their home after a tree fell onto their bedroom, fire officials said.\n\nFire threat remains\n\nWhile parts of the South and East start to clean up and survey the damage from the storm, Plains states are contending with renewed fire weather risks after deadly wildfires broke out over the weekend.\n\nA level 2 of 3 risk of fire weather was in place Monday for parts of the Plains and the Rockies, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Dry air, parched soils and the return of gusty winds will increase the risk of wildfire spread in these areas.\n\nMore than 20 million people from Texas to South Dakota and Iowa are under red flag warnings for hazardous fire weather conditions early this week.\n\nIn Oklahoma, more than 130 wildfires fueled by high winds from the storm system damaged more than 400 homes and killed four people in separate counties in recent days, according to Keli Cain, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.\n\nAmong the victims was Allen Ferguson, a youth wrestling coach in Lincoln County who died after suffering severe burns Friday. His son was also critically injured, a family GoFundMe page said.\n\n‘I’ve seen nothing like this’\n\nCleanup efforts began Sunday in Alpine, in Alabama’s Talladega County, where volunteers from Revive Church were left stunned by the destruction in the storm’s wake.\n\n“Disaster,” said James Stewart, 39, when asked to describe the scene.\n\n“I’ve seen nothing like this since I was a kid,” he told CNN as he raked leaves and debris into piles at the cemetery of Winterboro Community Church. “I’ve seen a few tornadoes in my lifetime, a couple of hurricanes. But other than that, this is pretty bad.”\n\nThe area was strewn with debris: twisted metal, splintered wood and insulation. Nearby, a partially split tree leaned precariously over gravestones at the edge of a cemetery.\n\nBrandon Chittam, another volunteer, estimated about two dozen people were helping with the cleanup.\n\n“It’s a wreck, but it’s coming together real quick,” he said. “It’s a blessing to have people with God in their life that would reunite together — and not even know one another — to help with the effort of cleaning up.”\n\n“It could have been a lot worse,” said Charles Kelly, pastor of Alpine’s Winterboro Community Church, as he stood in front of his church surveying the damage.\n\nDespite the destruction, Kelly voiced hope in the resilience of his community.\n\n“You’re going to see people at their best in the days ahead, because there’s a lot of things that were lost and damage to some stuff that people care a little bit about, but they’re going to see the best in the most important thing, which is people,” he said.\n\nAmid the wreckage, 16-year-old Trenton Garrett was directing traffic around the damaged school buildings. A junior at the adjacent high school and a member of the volunteer fire department, Garrett said he wanted to serve his community.\n\n“Most people at this age really don’t want to get involved, but I love getting involved in my community,” Garrett said. “These folks don’t have to listen to me, but they are listening.”\n\nChanges to NOAA and FEMA raise alarm over preparedness\n\nThe Trump administration and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have been fixated on reforming or eliminating FEMA, arguing it’s ineffective and inefficient. While touring hurricane damage in North Carolina in January, President Donald Trump even suggested he may eliminate FEMA entirely and instead send money directly to states to manage their own disaster relief efforts.\n\nExperts and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have raised concerns about how the changes may impair storm readiness and recovery.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said his administration is ready to assist in the aftermath of the past few days’ devastating tornadoes and severe storms.\n\n“We are actively monitoring the severe tornadoes and storms that have impacted many States across the South and Midwest,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. “The National Guard have been deployed to Arkansas, and my Administration is ready to assist State and Local Officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage,” he added.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He did this in a respectful way and in front of my husband, of which we thanked him. He also assured me that they had a medical team on board in case anything happened and they were aware of how pregnant I was.'\n\nShe was responding to a version of the event outlined by Axios reporter Alex Isenstadt in his book Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump’s Return to Power, which comes out Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Rep.

She doesn't like other women on my bed,' he added.\n\nLuna, a darling of the MAGA world and close friend of Trump, said she was responding to the because it was 'attacking @POTUS, his marriage, our first lady, and frankly implying something distasteful about me.'\n\n'This was the most compassionate thing that could’ve been done at the time. I find it disgusting that the author fails to recognize that,' she wrote on X.\n\n'The author of this book never reached out to me for comment.

Fox News obtained the dramatic video that shows the jets taking off towards the terrorist targets. It comes soon after President Donald Trump launched \"decisive and powerful\" airstrikes against the Iran-backed organization, which has targeted commercial merchant vessels and U.S. military ships for several months. \"It has been over a year since a U.S.-flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday. \"The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times.\" \"Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,\" the president continued. \"These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.\" US NAVY SHIPS REPEL ATTACK FROM HOUTHIS IN GULF OF ADEN Trump promised that the U.S. military would \"use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\" \"To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY.

But how does someone file a request for that data?What We KnowA lawsuit was initiated by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) against the U.S. DOGE Service and other entities.Court records state that CREW filed a FOIA requests to gather information on actions taken by the U.S. DOGE Service regarding significant changes and firings within federal programs early in President Donald Trump's second term.The court ruled that DOGE must process CREW's request on an expedited basis due to the public interest and potential harm caused by delays in releasing the information.Why It MattersTesla CEO Elon Musk, who is spearheading DOGE, has said he wants to cut the federal budget by $2 trillion a year, and earlier this year began a process of collecting information ahead of drastic cuts in many government departments.Growing concerns about privacy have sparked interest in government transparency. Maryland's Raskin has been vocal on transparency and individual privacy rights.Through his website, Raskin has encouraged Americans to submit Privacy Act requests to DOGE. His advocacy aligns with broader efforts to hold government agencies accountable for data collection and usage.What Is the Federal Privacy Act of 1974?The Privacy Act of 1974 was enacted to provide U.S. citizens with certain rights regarding records maintained by federal agencies. According to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, federal agencies may not disclose information without consent unless certain exceptions apply.The Privacy Act provides Americans with the following rights:\nTo request access to their records that government agencies hold about them (with certain exemptions)\nTo amend incorrect or misleading information in those records\nProtection against unwarranted invasion of privacy from the collection of information\nHow to Submit a Privacy Act Request to DOGETo request personal data from DOGE, citizens should follow these steps:\nObtain the Privacy Act Request Form: According to the Federal Trade Commission, individuals can submit a request online or through the mail, but online is the most efficient.

Despite this, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists reaffirmed its support for diversity reform.\n\n In a resolution passed by the SAG-AFTRA National Board Saturday, the actors union reported that the accurate portrayal of the “American Scene” is “essential to the integrity and credibility of the entertainment and media industry,” according to a letter by Fran Drescher, SAG president, and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, national executive director and chief negotiator. In addition, the letter states that SAG diversity measures have existed since the Sixties, when the formerly known Screen Actors Guild and producers agreed to the “American Scene” clause, which affirmed a non-discrimination policy for “any actor because of race, creed, color or national origin.”\n\n Disney’s Reimagine Tomorrow initiative, which magnified stories from marginalized groups, was pulled in recent weeks, with Walt Disney Co. changing some of its internal DEI policies. Warner Bros. Discovery changed its DEI program to “Inclusion” and Paramount eliminated staffing goals related to race, ethnicity, sex, and gender. The slashing of DEI programs occurred as the Trump administration implemented multiple executive orders aimed at cutting back diversity efforts helmed by federal grant recipients and contractors.\n\n Previous SAG contracts have included provisions that required diversity across Hollywood productions. When SAG-AFTRA ratified its TV/Theatrical contract with Hollywood studios and streamers in December 2023, one of the proposals expanded its pool of hair stylists and makeup artists in an effort to curb hair discrimination. Ultimately, Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland acknowledged that systemic barriers still exist in order to reach inclusion, equal employment opportunities, and accessibility.\n\n “For decades, SAG-AFTRA has advocated for equal employment opportunity within the entertainment and media industry, including meaningful representation of historically underrepresented communities and holding employers accountable to their commitments,” the statement from the organization reaffirming its support for diversity reform said. “That advocacy continues unabated, and is as important now as it has ever been.”","summary":"Previous SAG contracts have included provisions that required diversity across Hollywood productions, such as adding more hair and makeup stylists with experience with different hair and skin tones","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sag-aftra-diversity-efforts-resolution-1235298253/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/sag-aftra-DEI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:42:36","author":"Kalia Richardson","authors":["Kalia Richardson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.196},{"id":301260050,"title":"Trump-Putin bincang genjatan senjata Russia-Ukraine esok","text":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, berkata beliau bercadang untuk berbincang dengan Presiden Russia, Vladimir Putin, esok mengenai penyelesaian konflik di Ukraine, lapor media AS, yang dipetik Xinhua.\n\n\"Kami berada dalam kedudukan yang baik dengan Russia, saya rasa...Saya akan bercakap dengan Presiden Putin pada Selasa. \n\n\"Banyak persiapan telah dilakukan sepanjang hujung minggu,\" kata Trump kepada wartawan di dalam Air Force One semasa penerbangan dari Florida ke Washington pada petang Ahad.\n\nTrump, yang sedang berusaha untuk memuktamadkan perjanjian gencatan senjata 30 hari antara Russia dan Ukraine berkata tanah dan loji kuasa akan menjadi sebahagian daripada perbualannya dengan pemimpin Russia itu.\n\n\"Kami akan bercakap mengenai tanah.

half?","text":"NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said US President Donald Trump was ‘far more prepared’ for his second term, furnished with a clear roadmap, speaking in a podcast interview weeks ahead of reciprocal tariffs planned by Washington.\n\nIndia is among the trading partners set to face the tariffs from April, which threaten to cause distress to its exporters in industries from automobiles to agriculture.\n\nAfter Modi and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.\n\n“This time, he seems far more prepared than before,” Modi said in a podcast with American computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman released on Sunday, referring to Trump’s second term, which began in January.\n\n“He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,” he added.\n\nDuring the discussion, which ran for more than three hours, Modi spoke on issues from diplomacy and artificial intelligence to his early life, in a conversation Fridman called one of the most “powerful” of his life.\n\nModi praised Trump for what he described as his graciousness and humility, underscoring a strong bond between the leaders.\n\n“His (Trump’s) reflection showed his ‘America First’ spirit, just as I believe in nation first. I stand for India first, and that’s why we connect so well,” Modi said.\n\nIndia’s relations with neighbour China improved last year after striking a milestone pact to lower military tension on their Himalayan border following talks between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia.\n\n“Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm, and energy will return,” Modi said during the podcast, as the two countries work to restore relations to their state before a military border skirmish in 2020.\n\n“But of course, it will take some time, since there’s been a five-year gap,” he said, adding that the focus of the two nations was to ensure their differences “do not turn into disputes”.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry welcomed Modi’s comments, adding that the October meeting in Russia between Xi and Modi laid the foundation for improving ties.\n\n“The two countries should be partners that contribute to each other’s success,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters, adding that a cooperative dance “of the dragon and the elephant is the only right choice for both sides”. On ties with archfoe Pakistan, Modi expressed hope for peaceful relations.\n\n“Every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal,” he said, adding, “we sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace.”\n\nPakistan’s foreign ministry criticised Modi’s remarks as “misleading and one-sided”, accusing India of being involved in “fomenting terrorism on Pakistan’s soil”, a charge New Delhi has denied in the past. “Pakistan has always advocated constructive engagement and result-oriented dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” a Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.","summary":"NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said US President Donald Trump was ‘far more prepared’ for his second term, furnished with a clear roadmap, speaking in a podcast interview weeks ahead of reciprocal tariffs planned by Washington.\n\n\nIndia is among the trading partners set to face the tariffs from April, which threaten to cause distress to its exporters in industries from automobiles to agriculture.\n\n\nAfter Modi and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of $500 billion by 2030.\n\n\n“This time, he seems far more prepared than before,” Modi said in a podcast with American computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman released on Sunday, referring to Trump’s second term, which began in January.\n\n\n“He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,” he added.\n\n\nDuring the discussion, which ran for more than three hours, Modi spok","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40353445/pakistan-china-more-proof-that-indias-pm-is-too-clever-by-half","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/03/1805014030109b5.jpg?r=050145","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:33:48","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.192},{"id":301259794,"title":"Trump claims Biden pardons of his opponents are void","text":"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump declared Monday he was annulling pardons issued by Joe Biden to shield Trump critics from retribution, claiming that they were invalid because his Democratic predecessor had supposedly used an autopen for his signature.\n\nIt was unclear what, if any, authority Trump has to void presidential pardons issued by his predecessor.\n\nIt is extremely rare for pardons to be revoked in US history, and doing so in this case could see Trump again testing the limits of executive power as he takes aim at his political enemies. Trump claimed that Biden’s signature on the documents had been carried out with an autopen, a commonly used device, and therefore was not valid.\n\nThe pardons “are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect, because of the fact they were done by Autopen,” Trump posted on his social media account Truth Social.\n\nHowever, he provided no evidence either for the use of an autopen or his contention that it would invalidate the signature.\n\nUS presidents have long used autopens, including to sign bills into law. But Trump and his supporters, such as those linked to the right-wing policy document Project 2025, have sought to turn the issue into a way to delegitimize Biden’s presidency.\n\nBiden issued pardons to former senior Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney and other members of the congressional committee that had investigated the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump’s supporters and multiple attempts by Trump to overturn the 2020 election in which he lost.\n\nThe Biden pardons, issued at the end of his presidency, were effectively a blanket immunity to shield the lawmakers from Trump’s repeated promises that he would take revenge against them if he won the 2024 election.\n\nTrump appeared to acknowledge that his action entered disputed legal territory.\n\nAsked by reporters early Monday whether everything Biden signed with an autopen should be voided, Trump said “I think so. It’s not my decision, that’ll be up to a court.”\n\nBut he said on Truth Social that the committee members “should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.”\n\nExperts who spoke to Axios media outlet pointed out that even if Trump were to lose a court challenge over the move, the damage would already have been done, with those he targets being dragged into stressful legal battles.\n\nBiden also issued preemptive pardons to former Covid pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, retired general Mark Milley, and — perhaps most controversially — to close family members including his son Hunter. All of them had become public targets of the incoming Republican president.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump declared Monday he was annulling pardons issued by Joe Biden to shield Trump critics from retribution, claiming that they were invalid because his Democratic predecessor had supposedly used an autopen for his signature.\n\n\nIt was unclear what, if any, authority Trump has to void presidential pardons issued by his predecessor.\n\n\nIt is extremely rare for pardons to be revoked in US history, and doing so in this case could see Trump again testing the limits of executive power as he takes aim at his political enemies.

Boasberg was incredulous over the administration’s contentions that his verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed, that it couldn’t apply to flights that had left the U.S. and that the administration could not answer his questions about the deportations due to national security issues.\n\n“That’s one heck of a stretch, I think,” Boasberg replied, noting that the administration knew as the planes were departing that he was about to decide whether to briefly halt deportations being made under a rarely used 18th century law invoked by Trump about an hour earlier.\n\n“I’m just asking how you think my equitable powers do not attach to a plane that has departed the U.S., even if it’s in international airspace,” Boasberg added at another point.\n\nDeputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli contended that only Boasberg’s short written order, issued about 45 minutes after he made the verbal demand, counted. It did not contain any demands to reverse planes, and Kambli added that it was too late to redirect two planes that had left the U.S. by that time.\n\n“These are sensitive, operational tasks of national security,” Kambli said.\n\nThe hearing over what Boasberg called the “possible defiance” of his court order marked the latest step in a high-stakes legal fight that began when President Donald Trump invoked the 1798 wartime law to remove immigrants over the weekend. It was also an escalation in the battle over whether the Trump administration is flouting court orders that have blocked some of his aggressive moves in the opening weeks of his second term.\n\n“There’s been a lot of talk about constitutional crisis, people throw that word around. I think we’re getting very close to it,” warned Lee Gelernt of the ACLU, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, during the Monday hearing. After the hearing, Gelernt said the ACLU would ask\n\nBoasberg to order all improperly deported people returned to the United States.\n\nBoasberg said he’d record the proceedings and additional demands in writing. “I will memorialize this in a written order since apparently my oral orders don’t seem to carry much weight,” Boasberg said.\n\nOn Saturday night, Boasberg ordered the administration not to deport anyone in its custody through the newly-invoked Alien Enemies Act, which has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during congressionally declared wars. Trump issued a proclamation that the law was newly in effect due to what he claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nTrump’s invocation of the act could allow him to deport any noncitizen he says is associated with the gang, without offering proof or even publicly identifying them. The plaintiffs filed their suit on behalf of several Venezuelans in U.S. custody who feared they’d be falsely accused of being Tren de Aragua members and improperly removed from the country.\n\nTold there were planes in the air headed to El Salvador, which has agreed to house deported migrants in a notorious prison, Boasberg said Saturday evening that he and the government needed to move fast. “You shall inform your clients of this immediately, and that any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States,” Boasberg told the government’s lawyer.\n\nAccording to the filing, two planes that had taken off from Texas’ detention facility when the hearing started more than an hour earlier were in the air at that point, and they apparently continued to El Salvador. A third plane apparently took off after the hearing and Boasberg’s written order was formally published at 7:26 p.m. Eastern time. Kambli said that plane held no one deported under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nEl Salvador’s President, Nayib Bukele, on Sunday morning tweeted, “Oopsie…too late” above an article referencing Boasberg’s order and announced that more than 200 deportees had arrived in his country. The White House communications director, Steven Cheung, reposted Bukele’s post with an admiring GIF.\n\nLater Sunday, a widely circulated article in Axios said the administration decided to “defy” the order and quoted anonymous officials who said they concluded it didn’t extend to planes outside U.S. airspace. That drew a quick denial from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said in a statement “the administration did not ‘refuse to comply’ with a court order.”\n\nThe administration argues a federal judge does not have the authority to tell the president whether he can determine the country is being invaded under the act, or how to defend it.\n\nAfter Boasberg scheduled a hearing Monday and said the government should be prepared to answer questions over its conduct, the Justice Department objected, saying it could not answer in a public forum because it involved “sensitive questions of national security, foreign relations, and coordination with foreign nations.” Boasberg denied the government’s request to cancel the hearing, which led the Trump administration to ask that the judge be taken off the case.\n\nKambli stressed that the government believes it is complying with Boasberg’s order. It has said in writing it will not use Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport anyone if Boasberg’s order is not overturned on appeal, a pledge Kambli made again verbally in court Monday. “None of this is necessary because we did comply with the court’s written order,” Kambli said.\n\nBoasberg’s temporary restraining order is only in effect for up to 14 days as he oversees the litigation over Trump’s unprecedented use of the act, which is likely to raise new constitutional issues that can only ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. He had scheduled a hearing Friday for further arguments, but the two organizations that filed the initial lawsuit, the ACLU and Democracy Forward, urged him to force the administration to explain in a declaration under oath what happened.\n\nAs the courtroom drama built, so did international fallout over the deportations to El Salvador. Venezuela’s government on Monday characterized the transfer of migrants to El Salvador as “kidnappings” that it plans to challenge as “crimes against humanity” before the United Nations and other international organizations. It also accused the Central American nation of profiting off the plights of Venezuelan migrants.\n\n“They are not detaining them, they are kidnapping them and expelling them,” Jorge Rodriguez, President Nicolas Maduro’s chief negotiator with the U.S., told reporters Monday.\n\nTrump’s proclamation alleges Tren de Aragua is acting as a “hybrid criminal state” in partnership with Venezuela.\n\nFamilies of some Venezuelans in U.S. custody scrambled to find out if their loved ones had been sent to El Salvador. Multiple immigration lawyers said they had clients who were not gang members who were being moved for possible deportation late Friday.\n\nFranco Caraballo was held by immigration authorities during a routine check-in Feb. 3. His immigration lawyer, Martin Rosenow, said Caraballo not been accused of a crime. Caraballo’s wife believes he’s been wrongfully accused of belonging to the gang because of a tattoo he got marking his daughter’s birthday,\n\nHe called his wife Friday night in a panic because he was being handcuffed and put on a plane to an unknown destination in Texas, from where flights to El Salvador departed.\n\nThat was the last the family heard of him and he’s disappeared from the federal immigration detainee locator system. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” said Rosenow.","summary":"District Judge James E.

But political observers suspect there’s practically a bridge of political distance spanning between the two Brooklyn Democrats now. Schumer decided to help Republicans break a filibuster and forestall a government shutdown last week. Schumer’s decision triggered howls of derision from House Democrats who were practically unified in their opposition to the GOP spending package. Schumer and nine other Democrats voted to break the filibuster. That sent many Democrats into a fit of apoplexy. Distance and geography helps us understand this perceived chasm between Schumer and Jeffries. It’s a solid 40 miles from the Lansdowne Resort in Leesburg, Va., to the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. After the House voted to approve the emergency spending bill last Tuesday, Democrats high-tailed it to Leesburg for their annual issues retreat. Jeffries and other Democratic leaders held a press conference on the first day. Other Democrats spoke at nine news conference on the succeeding days. TOP HOUSE DEMOCRAT LEAVES SCHUMER IN THE COLD AMID LEFT'S DISARRAY ON SHUTDOWN DRAMA But back on Capitol Hill last Friday, Jeffries and other Democratic leaders would speed back from Leesburg for a news conference just before the vote to break a filibuster on the spending measure. Schumer asserted that sidestepping a government shutdown was the lesser of two evils. He argued that a shutdown would further empower President Trump and Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce and shutter departments. Jeffries wasn’t buying it. And he needed to signal to House Democrats about what side he was on. \"House Democrats remain strongly opposed to the partisan Republican spending bill that will hurt families, hurt veterans, hurt seniors, and hurt the American people,\" said Jeffries. \"It is a false choice that Donald Trump, Elon Musk and House Republicans have been presenting.\" Schumer and Jeffries spoke after the top Democrat in the Senate announced he would reluctantly vote to break a filibuster – and bring several Democratic colleagues along with him. Republicans control the Senate. But they only have 53 votes. Sixty votes are necessary to crush a filibuster. That’s where Democrats come in. And Schumer relented. SCHUMER UNDER FIRE FROM DEMOCRATS FOR SUPPORTING REPUBLICAN SPENDING BILL, FUELING LEADERSHIP CONCERNS: REPORT \"Is it time for new leadership in the Senate,\" asked Chase Williams of Fox Business to Jeffries at the hastily arranged House Democratic leadership news conference on Capitol Hill. \"Next question,\" replied Jeffries. Another reporter tried a different approach. \"Have you lost confidence in him, the fact that you guys see this so differently,\" asked the reporter. \"Next question,\" echoed Jeffries. What’s unsaid is often what speaks the loudest in politics. That’s what was so striking about Jeffries’ identical responses when asked about his fellow Brooklynite. Again, Jeffries seethed about the bill and how Schumer caved to the Republicans. Otherwise, he and other Democratic leaders wouldn’t have hustled back to Capitol Hill from suburban Virginia to blast the legislation. DEMOCRATS BLAST SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER FOR BACKING GOP SPENDING BILL Yours truly wanted to follow up after the press conference, given Jeffries’ direct reticence about Schumer. \"Why were you afraid to say anything about Schumer when you were asked?\" I questioned Jeffries as he walked out of the House Radio/TV Gallery studio. Jeffries demeanor is usually cooler than a swirled Mister Softee cone under a shade tree in Prospect Park in August. But after my question, Jeffries stopped in his tracks and flashed a hint of anger. \"Don't characterize! No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No,\" admonished Jeffries, \"But my question was, why are you afraid to say anything?\" I interjected. \"Do not characterize my remarks. I'm not afraid about anything. Anything!\" said Jeffries. \"You went to another question,\" I noted. \"I said I was very clear that we look forward to working with every single one of our Senate Democratic colleagues. Every single one of them who pushed back against the Trump administration. Every single one of them. It's very clear,\" said Jeffries. MSNBC PANEL GRILLS SCHUMER FOR SUPPORTING GOP SPENDING BILL So Jeffries had the fine line to walk. Incinerate the interim spending bill. Show rank-and-file Democrats how unhappy he was with what the Senate was doing. Yet be careful about what he says about Schumer. But as we said, what’s unsaid often speaks the loudest. Jeffries demonstrated his displeasure. But frankly, Jeffries didn’t have to say much. Just returning to the Capitol said everything. And doing so right after getting an earful from House Democrats about Schumer’s maneuver may have scored Jeffries some points. So, back to the questions at the House Democratic leadership press conference… \"Is it time for new leadership in the Senate?\" And, has Jeffries \"lost confidence\" in Schumer? The second interrogative is not as important. Democrats nationally – if not Senate Democrats – will determine what they want to do with Schumer. If anything. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., opposed the interim spending bill. Warner was torn because he represents so many federal workers in northern Virginia. DEMOCRATS LASH OUT AT SCHUMER FOR ‘BETRAYAL’ OF SIDING WITH TRUMP \"Are you going to issue a statement on Schumer’s leadership?\" asked one reporter of Warner after the vote to fund the government. \"Is Leader Schumer the right leader in this moment,\" asked another. \"I have faith in Chuck Schumer,\" replied Warner. Scribes asked similar questions of Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., following the vote. \"We also need to figure out how to use our leverage,\" said Heinrich. In other words, some Democrats believed the interim spending bill was an inflection point. They might not be able to stop President Trump and Congressional Republicans from approving the \"big, beautiful bill\" to slash spending and cut taxes. But they could have shuttered the government by filibustering the spending plan because it failed to reflect any major Democratic priorities. They needed to stand up. \"Leader Schumer has been very effective in a lot of battles. But these are new times,\" said Heinrich. \"Second guessing Leader Schumer out here isn't going to accomplish the kind of unity that we're going to need to be able to stand up the President. So we'll have that conversation inside the caucus.\" The Senate is out until next week now. That might cool some of the tensions. But it also may exacerbate them. Schumer was supposed to go on a tour this week, promoting his book \"Antisemitism in America.\" Appearances in Baltimore and Washington are now canceled \"due to security concerns.\" Regardless, it’s possible that dissonance about Schumer’s leadership may have overshadowed anything he could say about antisemitism in his forthcoming book. SCHUMER DISMISSES POSSIBLE AOC PRIMARY CHALLENGE, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BRINGING TRUMP'S NUMBERS DOWN Some Democrats are calling on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.. to primary Schumer if he runs for another term in 2028. Should Senate Democrats try to oust Schumer? Good luck with that. In the House of Representatives, the full membership elects the Speaker. He or she is the Constitutional officer of the legislative branch of government. In the Senate, the positions of Majority and Minority Leader are determined by their respective party caucuses or conferences – behind closed doors. Therefore, there’s no \"motion to vacate the chair\" like in the House. The real power of the Majority Leader stems from the custom of the Senate recognizing the Majority Leader first – ahead of the 99 others. The Senate has only removed one party leader in recent memory. And that wasn’t even done formally on the floor. The administration of President George W. Bush and other Republicans pounced on former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott made remarks suggesting the nation would have been better off with late Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and some of his racist policies had he won the presidency. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Truth be told, some Republicans were just looking for a reason to dump Lott. And so Lott departed in favor of former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn. It’s possible the spending bill filibuster vote may have Democrats now looking to dump Schumer. There is a growing chasm now between Schumer and liberal Democrats. Democrats wage internal warfare – while Republicans appear unified behind President Trump. And the distance between some Democrats now is a lot wider than a few blocks in Brooklyn.","summary":"Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries may reside just blocks away from one another – but their recent spending clash shows two Democratic caucuses operating on opposite planets.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/political-geography-quarrelling-nyc-neighbors-country-mile-apart-trump-era-policy","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/931/523/jeffries-schumer-split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:26:19","author":"Chad Pergram","authors":["Chad Pergram"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":301259216,"title":"European Stocks Close Higher, Boosted by Energy, Healthcare Shares","text":"Brussels, March 17 (QNA) - European stocks closed higher Monday, boosted by gains in energy and healthcare stocks, as investors focused on fiscal reforms in Germany and the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.8 percent higher, kicking off the week on a positive note.\n\nThe index extended gains from last Friday, when it recorded its biggest gain in more than a month after German political parties reached a historic agreement to increase government borrowing.\n\nThe oil and gas sector led the gains, rising 1.5 percent, while healthcare stocks rose 1.4 percent, posting gains for the fourth consecutive session and their longest winning streak since late January.\n\nInvestors are also focused on talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, on Tuesday, as an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is expected to lead to lower energy costs across Europe.

Roosevelt and James Polk – while others he picked out of a catalog. \n\nAnchor and Senior White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said that the Oval Office now ‘has much more of the Trump stamp on it.’\n\nWhen asked about the renovations by The Spectator, Trump said it ‘keeps my real state juices flowing but it will be beautiful.’ \n\nOne of his big projects is to build a new ballroom for hosting state dinners similar to the one at Mar-a-Lago on the South Lawn.\n\n‘One of the things we’re doing over here is very interesting. I’m a very good developer. I do it really good. You can ask a lot of people. I mean, I did it really well for a long time, and they’ve always needed a ballroom here,’ he said.\n\nThe ballroom will be based on the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and has said he’ll pay for it himself. \n\n‘One of the things I’m going to do is build a beautiful, magnificent ballroom at the White House. Beautiful ballroom,’ he said.\n\nIt’s a far cry from what Melania Trump said the first family would do with the White House a month ago.\n\nShe will make the place feel just like home as she intends to have the residence look just like it did when they left it.\n\n‘A little bit of changes. Not much,’ she told Fox News about her plans.\n\nAll first families place their mark on the White House – particularly the upper floors where they live – and Melania was no exception.\n\nIn her memoir, she wrote that she focused on ‘redecorating a dozen rooms in the private residence, as the existing style was outdated and not to my taste.’ She even designed a new rug for one of the main family rooms.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump put his own touch on the place with his infamous ‘Diet Coke’ button – a red button on the desk of the Oval Office that, when he pressed it, his favorite beverage was brought in on a silver tray.\n\nIn her first White House tenure, Melania Trump worked with designer Tham Kannalikham to refurnish a number of rooms, including the Yellow Oval Room, the Queens’ Bedroom and the Center Hall.\n\nShe detailed her work in her memoir ‘Melania,’ writing her goal was to ‘preserving the history and beauty of the White House for future generations.’\n\nShe said the Yellow Oval Room in the residence was a ‘favorite’ and she designed the rug on the floor.\n\n‘I carefully selected beautiful antiques from the White House collection,’ she wrote in ‘Melania’. ‘I personally designed a custom rug featuring American Beauty roses, blue ribbons and a trellis motif to tie everything together.’\n\nShe also refurbished the president’s private dining room and the Queen’s Bedroom, named after Elizabeth II who slept there. \n\nMelania noted she ‘replaced the old bed with a more refined piece, laid a lighter, floral-pattered rug, and painted the walls a delicate shade of pink.’\n\nShe also restored much of the flooring in the state rooms on the first floor, which hadn’t been repaired in years and has hundreds of visitors walk over them on a monthly basis. \n\nEach family puts its own mark on the residence so it reflects the needs of the occupants. For example, the Obamas, who had two young daughters, made the upstairs of the White House more homey and child-friendly.\n\nFor the upstairs rooms, which was the Trump family’s personal living space, Melania used soft pastel colors – yellow paint on the walls, pink and blue furniture, light-colored rugs – to give a relaxing and inviting feel.\n\nShe also added a Tennis Pavilion to the grounds and renovated some damaged furniture and accessories in the East Room and Red Room. And – to much controversy – she redid the White House Rose Garden.\n\nDonald Trump put his mark on the Oval Office, including that now infamous Diet Coke button. \n\nHe could press the button whenever he wanted the soda, which he drank constantly. Walt Nauta, his personal valet who left the White House with him, was in charge of answering the call. Nauta would bring Trump a glass of Diet Coke on a silver tray. \n\nTrump even joked about the red button, which was by his phone, saying people thought it was to activate nuclear weapons.\n\n‘Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button,’ he said. \n\nTrump also had pictures of his parents and his challenge coin collection on display. He also displayed a model of his redesign for Air Force One, painted in the same blue, red and white as his Trump Force One.\n\nThe Oval Office is always redone to reflect the occupant. For example, Biden used a dark blue rug on the floor. Trump used a soft beige one.\n\nBoth men used the Resolute Desk, which was built from the timbers of the British ship and given to America by Queen Victoria.\n\nEach president also picks their own artwork, which became a subject of controversy when Democrats Biden and Barack Obama removed a bust of Winston Churchill that Republicans George W. Bush and Trump had in the Oval.\n\nBesides the decorations, the biggest question is who the Trumps will hire to be chief usher.\n\nThe chief usher is the head of household staff and operations at the White House. The holder of the position runs the 55,000-square foot, six-floor White House residence and oversees the permanent staff.\n\nThe person answers directly to the president and first lady. They hire and fire staff and manage the funds allocated by Congress to run the house, including the cost of heating, lighting, air-conditioning and the staff’s salaries.\n\nThe position pays around $200,000 a year.\n\nThe job, which was once a non-political one, has become exactly that with presidents naming their own pick to run the household.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump has given the Oval Office a golden makeover and a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: President Trump&#8217;s surprise plans for White House renovation include transforming the Rose Garden to mimic Mar-a-Lago. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/president-trumps-surprise-plans-for-white-house-renovation-include-transforming-the-rose-garden-to-mimic-mar-a-lago/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/17/23/96291137-14508883-image-a-11_1742253630459.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:19:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.346},{"id":301254834,"title":"Conor McGregor criticizes ‘illegal immigration scheme harming our nation’ and warns Ireland is at risk of ‘losing its cultural identity’ in passionate speech at the White House before meeting with Trump","text":"Conor McGregor has launched an attack on an ‘illegal immigration racket ravaging’ Ireland in a rant at the White House before meeting US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Irish mixed martial arts fighter visited Trump in Washington today, telling reporters in the West Wing that he would voice concerns about immigration issues in Ireland when speaking to Trump.\n\nIn a press conference prior to the meeting, McGregor claimed Ireland was close to ‘potentially losing its Irishness’ due to an ‘illegal immigration racket is ravaging our country’.\n\nMcGregor said he was at the Whiter House ‘to raise the issues the people of Ireland face’ as ‘what is going on in Ireland is a travesty’.\n\nThe US is home to millions of descendants of Irish immigrants who fled poverty for the ‘American dream’ and a better life across the pond, with McGregor addressing some of his remarks to them.\n\n‘The 40 million Irish Americans need to hear this. Because if not, there will be no place to come home and visit,’ McGregor, former lightweight and featherweight Ultimate Fighting champ, said.\n\nMcGregor is meeting with President Trump at the White House on St. Patrick’s Day and the Trump fan made a surprise trip to the White House podium on Monday.\n\nHe was accompanied by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who was showing him the room where she battles the press. Both wore green in a nod to Ireland – with McGregor decked out in a three-piece suit.\n\nLeavitt said it wasn’t planned, but ‘very festive.’ When DailyMail.com asked the champ a question about undocumented Irish immigrants living in the US, Leavitt joked that he was ‘taking over the podium,’ and let him go.\n\n‘Ireland and America we are siblings,’ McGregor responded, saying it was important ‘for Irish Americans to have a place to visit.’\n\n‘We wish to be taken care of by the big bro. The United States should look after its little bro. That’s how we feel,’ he continued.\n\n‘I’m here to raise the issues the people of Ireland face. It will be music to the people of Ireland’s ears,’ he said.\n\nMcGregor added: ‘Never on the main stage has the issues the people of Ireland faced been spoke. Our government has long since abandoned the voices of the people of Ireland and it’s high time that America is made aware of what is going on in Ireland.\n\n‘What is going on in Ireland is a travesty. Our government is the government of zero action with zero accountability. Our money is being spent on overseas issues that is nothing to do with the Irish people.\n\n‘The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country.\n\n‘There are rural towns in Ireland that have been overrun in one swoop, that have become a minority in one swoop, so issues need to be addressed and the 40 million Irish Americans, as I said, need to hear this because if not there will be no place to come home and visit.’\n\nMcGregor is meeting with other members of the administration as well. When he got hit with another question about simmering trade disputes – which were on tap when the Irish Taoiseach visited the White House last week – Leavitt tagged in.\n\nShe reclaimed the podium and said McGregor would be meeting Trump later. ‘We couldn’t think of a better guest to have with us on St. Patrick’s Day,’ she said. \n\nBut Irish political leaders have insisted McGregor does not speak for Ireland after the fighter visited the White House.\n\nIn response to McGregor’s comments to reporters in the White House briefing room, Irish premier Micheal Martin later said his claims were ‘wrong’, and did not reflect the views of the Irish people.\n\nMr Martin wrote on X: ‘St Patrick’s Day around the world is a day rooted in community, humanity, friendship and fellowship. Conor McGregor’s remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St Patrick’s Day, or the views of the people of Ireland.’\n\nDeputy premier Simon Harris said that McGregor was not in the US to represent Ireland and did not speak for the people of Ireland, and ‘has no mandate to’.\n\nTanaiste Mr Harris said: ‘It’s for President Trump to invite wherever he wants to his home, and he’s perfectly entitled to do whatever he wishes in relation to who he decides to invite to the White House.\n\n‘But let me be very clear, Conor McGregor is not here in the United States representing Ireland or the people of Ireland. He’s here in a personal capacity.\n\n‘He doesn’t speak for Ireland. He doesn’t speak for the people of Ireland. He has no mandate to do such. My views on him are very clear, well established, previously articulated, long standing and on the public record.’\n\nThe appearance comes just days after Trump gushed over McGregor, delivering a glowing verdict of the fighter – despite the sexual assault allegations facing him. \n\nSpeaking with conservative Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin at the White House last week, Trump professed an appreciation for McGregor, who recently appeared at the President’s inauguration in January.\n\n‘He’s got the best tattoos I’ve ever seen,’ Trump said. ‘Conor’s great, right?\n\n‘You have a lot of great Irish fighters. I don’t know what that is, but Ireland has always had a lot of good fighters. You know why? Because they’re tough people. They’re smart people and they’re passionate people.’\n\nIt was at this moment when Trump remembered that Martin’s father Paddy was a boxer in addition to being a soldier in the Defense Forces and a bus driver.\n\n‘I think your father was a great fighter, right?’ Trump asked Martin. Martin immediately agreed: ‘He was.’\n\n‘And yet, look at you, you’re so smooth,’ Trump told Martin, drawing a few laughs from reporters.\n\nTrump then added: ‘Genetically, I’m not gonna mess around with you.’\n\nMcGregor’s visit to the White House came months after he was found civilly liable in a High Court damages case in Dublin taken by a woman who accused him of rape.\n\nNikita Hand, also known as Nikita Ni Laimhin, won her claim against McGregor after accusing the professional fighter of raping her in a Dublin hotel in December 2018.\n\nMs Hand, 35, was awarded damages and costs after a three-week trial last year in which the jury found him civilly liable for assault.\n\nA judge at the High Court in Dublin later said the jury had ‘conclusively determined’ that McGregor had raped Ms Hand.\n\nMcGregor is appealing against the outcome of the civil case.\n\nTanaiste Mr Harris said in his statement following McGregor’s White House visit: ‘I’ve spoken to Nikita Hand. I admire her bravery, her courage, and I’d much rather be talking about Nikita Hand than Conor McGregor, quite frankly.’\n\nFurthermore, McGregor and the NBA’s Miami Heat are currently facing a federal lawsuit over claims the MMA legend sexually assaulted a woman in a bathroom at the Kaseya Center while security stood guard outside the stall.\n\nNot only is he accused of sexually assaulting a woman at that game, but in a misguided on-court bit, McGregor struck the team mascot, Burnie, sending the costumed performer tumbling down to the hardwood earlier in the evening. A second punch sent the mascot kicking his feet and rolling in apparent agony.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra later confirmed that the person portraying the mascot was taken to the hospital, but assured reporters Burnie didn’t suffer any permanent injuries.\n\n‘We won’t reveal who that is, but yeah, he can take a punch and get back up,’ Spoelstra said at the time. ‘He’s not going to miss any time.’\n\nMcGregor has since portrayed the incident as a ‘skit’ gone awry.\n\n‘The mascot’s good, my man,’ he told Adam Glyn in June of 2023. ‘The Mascot is good. It was a skit, and it went the way it went, but all is well.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nConor McGregor has launched an attack on an &#8216;illegal immigration racket ravaging&#8217;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Conor McGregor criticizes &#8216;illegal immigration scheme harming our nation&#8217; and warns Ireland is at risk of &#8216;losing its cultural identity&#8217; in passionate speech at the White House before meeting with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/conor-mcgregor-criticizes-illegal-immigration-scheme-harming-our-nation-and-warns-ireland-is-at-risk-of-losing-its-cultural-identity-in-passionate-speech-at-the-white-house-before-meeting-with/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Conor-McGregor-issues-plea-to-Trump-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:17:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":301258906,"title":"Trump Strips Hunter and Ashley Biden’s Secret Service Protection Early.

Because of this, South Africa has been taken off our list of Countries receiving Economic and Financial Assistance,” the president wrote, referring to an executive order he signed last month to cut assistance to South Africa due to the country’s Expropriation Act. \n\n (The Expropriation Act was signed into law last month and was meant to address actions taken during South Africa’s racist apartheid era, reports the Associated Press. It grants the government the power to take lands in some instances that are not being used or in cases where it would help the public if redistributed. The White House claims the law “blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority Afrikaners.”)\n\n Trump also announced that Biden's daughter Ashley, 43, “who has 13 agents will be taken off the list.”\n\n At the end of Trump’s first term in office, he extended Secret Service protection for his children for six months after he left the White House. In September 2021, the Washington Post reported that protection for Trump’s four adult children cost taxpayers approximately $1.7 million, citing spending documents. \n\n The Post reported that other non-Trump family members, including former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien were also granted extended protection.\n\n Earlier on Monday, Trump also took aim at Biden’s preemptive pardons of political figures who have spoken out against him, including members of the bipartisan House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, members of the Capitol and D.C. police forces who testified before the committee, and Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\n Trump “declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” he wrote on Truth Social, although the Constitution has no framework for a future president to undo their predecessors' pardons.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In December 2024, Biden pardoned his son Hunter in his illegal gun possession and tax charge cases.","summary":"Trump's own children had Secret Service protection for six months after he left the White House in 2021","url":"https://people.com/trump-strips-hunter-and-ashley-biden-secret-service-protection-early-11698726","image":"https://people.com/thmb/tM44TjvFWVwqm_k96RIOpSwT-Fg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/trump-hunter-biden-ashley-biden-031725-15e49d3d78764bc58861480fa4265f3c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:15:20","author":"Daniel S.

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:26 GMT, 17 March 2025 | Updated: 23:26 GMT, 17 March 2025\n\nDonald Trump has given the Oval Office a golden makeover and a paving over of the Rose Garden as he looks to the place he's long referred to as 'the Winter White House' for inspiration.\n\nThe president has spent the beginning of his second term hard at work at reshaping America's immigration and economic policy, as well as working on ending wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nHowever, he's also taken time to reshape what his home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue looks like.\n\nTrump is said to be taking cues from his beloved Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to help with the re-design. \n\nSome of the new features include pieces directly shipped from his famous club, as small golden cherubs brought in are placed above the doorways to the Oval Office.\n\nThe president is known for his love of gold, given his world famous Trump Tower in Manhattan, and that has played a big part in the decorations.\n\nHis future plans include a 'paving over' of the Rose Garden to turn it into a more 'patio style' similar to the areas where he meets with friends and allies at Mar-a-Lago. \n\n'He’s personally reviewed those blueprints and even met with the curators as he seeks to put his stamp not just on the Oval Office, but really the entire West Wing in general,' said CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\nDonald Trump has given the Oval Office a golden makeover and a paving over of the Rose Garden as he looks to the place he's long referred to as 'the Winter White House' for inspiration\n\nThe president personally selected some of the portraits of his favorite past presidents - Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Polk - while others he picked out of a catalog\n\nShe also noted that just in the Oval Office, there are gold vermeil figurines, medallions, gold eagles, gilded Rococo mirrors on the doors and even Trump's TV remote is 'wrapped in gilt.'\n\nHe has also chosen to further decorate the world's most famous office with paintings, tripling the number in the room under Joe Biden.\n\nBiden himself had increased the number of portraits from two to six from back when Barack Obama was in office. \n\nThe president personally selected some of the portraits of his favorite past presidents - Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Polk - while others he picked out of a catalog. \n\nAnchor and Senior White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said that the Oval Office now 'has much more of the Trump stamp on it.'\n\nWhen asked about the renovations by The Spectator, Trump said it 'keeps my real state juices flowing but it will be beautiful.' \n\nOne of his big projects is to build a new ballroom for hosting state dinners similar to the one at Mar-a-Lago on the South Lawn.\n\n'One of the things we’re doing over here is very interesting. I’m a very good developer. I do it really good. You can ask a lot of people. I mean, I did it really well for a long time, and they’ve always needed a ballroom here,' he said.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe president has spent the beginning of his second term hard at work at reshaping America's immigration and economic policy, as well as working on ending wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. However, he's also taken time to reshape what his home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue looks like\n\nThe ballroom will be based on the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles and has said he'll pay for it himself. \n\n'One of the things I’m going to do is build a beautiful, magnificent ballroom at the White House. Beautiful ballroom,' he said.\n\nIt's a far cry from what Melania Trump said the first family would do with the White House a month ago.\n\nShe will make the place feel just like home as she intends to have the residence look just like it did when they left it.\n\n'A little bit of changes. Not much,' she told Fox News about her plans.\n\nAll first families place their mark on the White House - particularly the upper floors where they live - and Melania was no exception.\n\nIn her memoir, she wrote that she focused on 'redecorating a dozen rooms in the private residence, as the existing style was outdated and not to my taste.' She even designed a new rug for one of the main family rooms.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump put his own touch on the place with his infamous 'Diet Coke' button - a red button on the desk of the Oval Office that, when he pressed it, his favorite beverage was brought in on a silver tray.\n\nThe president is known for his love of gold, given his world famous Trump Tower in Manhattan, and that has played a big part in the decorations\n\nTrump is said to be taking cues from his beloved Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to help with the re-design\n\nIn her first White House tenure, Melania Trump worked with designer Tham Kannalikham to refurnish a number of rooms, including the Yellow Oval Room, the Queens' Bedroom and the Center Hall.\n\nShe detailed her work in her memoir 'Melania,' writing her goal was to 'preserving the history and beauty of the White House for future generations.'\n\nShe said the Yellow Oval Room in the residence was a 'favorite' and she designed the rug on the floor.\n\n'I carefully selected beautiful antiques from the White House collection,' she wrote in 'Melania'. 'I personally designed a custom rug featuring American Beauty roses, blue ribbons and a trellis motif to tie everything together.'\n\nShe also refurbished the president's private dining room and the Queen's Bedroom, named after Elizabeth II who slept there. \n\nMelania noted she 'replaced the old bed with a more refined piece, laid a lighter, floral-pattered rug, and painted the walls a delicate shade of pink.'\n\nShe also restored much of the flooring in the state rooms on the first floor, which hadn't been repaired in years and has hundreds of visitors walk over them on a monthly basis. \n\nEach family puts its own mark on the residence so it reflects the needs of the occupants. For example, the Obamas, who had two young daughters, made the upstairs of the White House more homey and child-friendly.\n\nAnchor and Senior White House Correspondent Kaitlan Collins said that the Oval Office now 'has much more of the Trump stamp on it'\n\nDonald Trump takes questions after signing Executive Orders at Mar-a-Lago\n\nFor the upstairs rooms, which was the Trump family's personal living space, Melania used soft pastel colors - yellow paint on the walls, pink and blue furniture, light-colored rugs - to give a relaxing and inviting feel.\n\nShe also added a Tennis Pavilion to the grounds and renovated some damaged furniture and accessories in the East Room and Red Room. And – to much controversy – she redid the White House Rose Garden.\n\nDonald Trump put his mark on the Oval Office, including that now infamous Diet Coke button. \n\nHe could press the button whenever he wanted the soda, which he drank constantly. Walt Nauta, his personal valet who left the White House with him, was in charge of answering the call. Nauta would bring Trump a glass of Diet Coke on a silver tray. \n\nTrump even joked about the red button, which was by his phone, saying people thought it was to activate nuclear weapons.\n\n'Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button,' he said. \n\nTrump also had pictures of his parents and his challenge coin collection on display. He also displayed a model of his redesign for Air Force One, painted in the same blue, red and white as his Trump Force One.\n\nThe Oval Office is always redone to reflect the occupant. For example, Biden used a dark blue rug on the floor. Trump used a soft beige one.\n\n'Just in the Oval Office, there are gold vermeil figurines, medallions, gold eagles, gilded Rococo mirrors on the doors and even Trump's TV remote is 'wrapped in gilt\n\nTrump is also looking to build a ballroom on the South Lawn\n\nBoth men used the Resolute Desk, which was built from the timbers of the British ship and given to America by Queen Victoria.\n\nEach president also picks their own artwork, which became a subject of controversy when Democrats Biden and Barack Obama removed a bust of Winston Churchill that Republicans George W. Bush and Trump had in the Oval.\n\nBesides the decorations, the biggest question is who the Trumps will hire to be chief usher.\n\nThe chief usher is the head of household staff and operations at the White House. The holder of the position runs the 55,000-square foot, six-floor White House residence and oversees the permanent staff.\n\nThe person answers directly to the president and first lady. They hire and fire staff and manage the funds allocated by Congress to run the house, including the cost of heating, lighting, air-conditioning and the staff's salaries.\n\nThe position pays around $200,000 a year.\n\nThe job, which was once a non-political one, has become exactly that with presidents naming their own pick to run the household.\n\nWhite HouseDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump's shock White House renovation revealed as he moves to 'pave over' the Rose Garden to resemble Mar-a-Lago\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump has given the Oval Office a golden makeover and a paving over of the Rose Garden as he looks to the place he's long referred to as 'the Winter White House' for inspiration.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14508883/donald-trump-white-house-renovation-rose-garden-mar-lago.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/17/23/96291137-0-image-a-8_1742253610482.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:09:31","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to launch a primary challenge against him.\n\nThe 74-year-old senator isn’t up for re-election until 2028, which is too long for Democrats to wait, according to The Nation — the progressive magazine’s Jeet Heer is calling for Schumer to resign immediately, both from leadership and the Senate. \n\nNo wonder CNN’s latest poll shows Democrats with a record-low favorability rating of just 29% — the party is at war with itself, and Democratic voters themselves increasingly dislike what they see from their elected officials, and leaders like Schumer. \n\nYet the CNN survey shows only 16% of Democrats think their party is too extreme.\n\nSchumer knows better: That’s why he’s lying low instead of out selling his antisemitism book.\n\nNew York’s senior senator is a moderate by the standards of his party today, but his book, and not just its wrecked publicity tour, is a sign of how badly adrift the Democrats are. \n\nSchumer is publishing a warning about antisemitism at the same time he’s embroiled in the party’s infighting over Israel, Palestine and campus protests targeting Jews.\n\nHe’s taken a weaker stand against campus antisemitism than the Trump administration has and opposes deporting Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian immigrant studying Columbia University, for his anti-Israel activism.Yet Schumer outraged progressive opinion yet again on Sunday, when answers he gave in an interview with The New York Times led critics to his left to accuse him of essentially agreeing with Trump’s decision to withhold $400 million in federal funding from Columbia because of its poor record in combating antisemitism. \n\nLate last year, however, a report by the House Education and Workforce Committee — under Republican control, it should be noted — claimed Schumer had told Columbia’s then-president, Minouche Shafik, not to worry about a reckoning over antisemitism if Democrats took over the Senate. \n\nThe university’s “political problems are really only among Republicans,” Schumer was alleged to have said — though a Schumer spokesman denied those were his words and called the report “hearsay.”\n\nSchumer’s trouble, though, is that the more he does to try to appear moderate, the more the progressives in his own party identify him not with centrism, but with Trump.\n\nStopping a government shutdown? \n\nThat’s Trumpism.\n\nTelling the Times when a campus protest “shades over to violence and antisemitism, the colleges had to do something, and a lot of them didn’t do enough”?\n\nThat’s Trumpism.\n\nIn the eyes of his own party, Chuck Schumer isn’t a moderate, he’s a coward, handing Trump victory after victory when what Democrats need most is the will to resist the president.\n\nBut to anyone who’s not a Democrat, Schumer’s pretense of moderation is completely exploded by the simple fact that he’s a leader of a party that’s nowhere near the center.\n\nSchumer isn’t alone in his agony.\n\nOther prominent Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom, are finding it just as hard to distance themselves from the left without winding up too close to Trump for the comfort of the party base.\n\nNewsom’s sin has been to have MAGA masterminds like Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on his podcast.\n\nThe California governor who still dreams of higher office has also “evolved” on the question of letting men participate in women’s sports — that is, he’s come around to a view closer to Trump’s, because that’s where the common-sense center of politics is today.\n\nThe Democratic base wants the party to be defined by vehement opposition to the president — while the Democrats’ clever and unprincipled leaders know the smart play is to become more like him.\n\nLast year Donald Trump defeated the Democrats. \n\nThis year, he gets to sit back and watch them defeat themselves, as progressive protesters who might have picketed his events eight years ago now turn their ire on Chuck Schumer.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.","summary":"Because Schumer couldn’t outmaneuver

proposes 15-year rescue for bank at heart of giant fraud, documents show","text":"HANOI : The bank at the centre of Vietnam's biggest financial fraud has received a central bank bailout amounting 5 per cent of the nation's 2024 economic output, which a local white knight hopes to repay in 15 years, documents seen by Reuters show.\n\nThe nearly $26 billion pumped into Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB) since a 2022 run on the bank, triggered by the arrest of the real estate tycoon who effectively controlled SCB, highlights Vietnam's struggles to oversee its banks and contain potential sectoral risk.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation is scrambling domestically while its export-driven economy faces the risks of a global trade war as President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on U.S. trading partners.\n\nSCB remains \"completely dependent on special loans\" from the State Bank of Vietnam to cover deposit withdrawals, and the central bank's lending would reach 657 trillion dong ($25.8 billion) in the first year of restructuring, according to the rescue roadmap prepared by Sun Group, the developer mandated by the central bank in November 2023 to help SCB.\n\nThe lender, under Sun Group ownership, would start repaying the central bank in the 14th year of the rescue plan, subject to market conditions, under the base scenario of the 222-page plan, which has not been reported previously.\n\nUnder this scenario, SCB would fully repay the central bank within 15 years of the approval of the restructuring, which Sun Group hopes to obtain as early as the start of next month.\n\nReuters could not determine whether Sun Group's plan, dated February 17, has the support of Vietnam's government and ruling Communist party or whether it will be approved under the developer's timeline.\n\nSun Group, SCB, the central bank and the finance ministry did not respond to email and phone requests for comment.\n\nDEPOSITS PLUNGE, LOSSES SOAR\n\nThe scandal broke in October 2022 with the arrest of businesswoman Truong My Lan, who built a real estate empire that prosecutors say was funded for a decade by $44 billion in SCB loans.\n\nThe arrest of Lan - who used proxies to control what was one of Vietnam's largest commercial banks by deposits - triggered a panic among depositors, prompting the central bank to inject $4 billion in the three weeks after the arrest and billions more later to keep the bank from collapsing, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nA court upheld Lan's death sentence in December, rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery, state media reported.\n\nSCB's already dire state at the time of the bank run has only deteriorated, necessitating the proposed multi-year restructuring, the Sun Group report says.\n\nDeposits had plummeted to 19.2 trillion dong at the end of last year from 669 trillion dong at the start of October 2022, according to the document. \n\nVietnam requires banks with subsidiaries, like SCB, to have capital worth 9 per cent of risk-weighted assets as a buffer against potential losses. SCB's capital adequacy ratio just before the bank run was minus 100 per cent, worsening to minus 176 per cent at the end of 2024 as losses burgeoned, the Sun Group document says, citing new audited data that have not been reported previously.\n\nPATH TO PROFITS?\n\nIn documents produced by Vietnam's police for Lan's trial, the latest figures disclosed on SCB's charter capital are for 2017, when investigators found its capital adequacy was minus 4.2 per cent. That year the bank had reported a positive ratio of about 10 per cent and its auditor, Deloitte, raised no warnings in its annual report.\n\nDeloitte did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe central bank had lent SCB 652.7 trillion dong ($25.6 billion) as of February 18, according to an internal SCB document, reviewed by Reuters, that provides daily updates on cash injections.\n\nSun Group's plan aims to make SCB profitable again, citing the developer's banking experience as a key shareholder since 2021 in a smaller Vietnamese lender, National Citizen Commercial Joint Stock Bank.\n\nIt proposes investing at least 3 trillion dong ($120 million) in SCB's charter capital - funds injected by owners towards core capital buffers.\n\nThe document forecasts SCB generating income from sources including investments in government bonds and infrastructure projects funded with resources recovered from loans.\n\nIt would repay about half the central bank's loans by selling recoverable assets, land rights and properties used as collateral for SCB loans, with the remainder coming from profits from new investments, the roadmap showed. \n\nRecoverable assets, however, are only a small portion of those on the banks' books, Sun Group's plan says, as the bulk of the credit SCB extended was to shell companies owned by Lan against collateral with inflated values.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/exclusive-vietnam-developer-proposes-15-year-rescue-bank-heart-giant-fraud-documents-show-5006751","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--93Ge7sq_--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-03-18t000312z_1_lynxmpel2h001_rtroptp_3_vietnam-finance-trial.jpg?i","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-18 00:03:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":301253150,"title":"UK politics live: Labour to unveil plan to slash billions from benefit bill amid backbench backlash","text":"Labour is set to unveil plans to slash billions of pounds from the UK’s benefit bill amid a growing backlash among the party’s backbenchers.\n\nWork and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out plans for welfare reform on Tuesday to get more people back to work and cut the cost of the benefits bill by as much as £5 billion.\n\nThe proposals have been met with fierce criticism from Labour backbenchers, with veteran left-winger Diane Abbott branding the overhaul “not a Labour thing to do”.\n\nBut the prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Monday that Sir Keir Starmer “has been clear there is both a moral and an economic case for fixing our broken social security system that’s holding our people back, and our country back”.\n\nThe spokesperson also rejected claims the reforms were being carried out because of the UK’s difficult fiscal situation.\n\nThere are fears as many as 1 million people could see their benefits reduced, while charities have warned thousands of disabled people could be forced into poverty.\n\nLeading think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the disabled and long-term sick could consequently lose as much as £1,200 a year.\n\nLabour faces growing backlash within its own ranks over welfare reformsFresh blow to Rachel Reeves as UK’s economic forecast slashedNigel Farage tetchy as journalists question him over Rupert Lowe rowLib Dem councillor among latest defections to ReformRachel Reeves summons regulators to Downing Street to cut bureaucracy\n\nTwo protesters kicked out during London speech by Kemi Badenoch\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 18:06 , Andy Gregory\n\nTwo protesters have been kicked out during a speech by Kemi Badenoch at London’s Guildhall.\n\nThe Conservative leader began to speak when a woman holding a banner that said \"Abolish Billionaires\" held up a banner and began to shout.

I do hope she will think again, before the damage is done.”\n\nShe said she was “astonished… by the speed and thoroughness with which Bridget Phillipson has moved to dismantle every main pillar of the system”.\n\nThe government source added: “This government is doing the hard yards of fixing the hundreds of stuck schools that were failed by Spielman and her allies in the Tory party.

help.”\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Liz Jarvis said her constituents were “desperately concerned about any potential cuts to benefits, including personal independence payments (PIP),” and asked the Government to confirm that “disability benefits for people who are unable to work will not be cut.”\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said: “Treating people with dignity and respect is at the

country.”\n\nMs McGovern also addressed delays in processing access to work applications, stating: “We’ve put more staff in place to deal with that, but we’ve got more to do.”\n\nBreaking | Mike Amesbury resigns\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 15:41 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nMike Amesbury has written to Chancellor Rachel Reeves formally resigning as the MP for Runcorn & Helsby, after he was handed a suspended prison sentence for punching a man in the street.\n\nEarlier today, Mr Amesbury said he apologised to the constituent he punched, telling GB News: “I’m so sincerely sorry to Mr Fellows, his family, my own family.”\n\nHe described reliving the moment as “like a living nightmare” and added: “I’m the one that got things wrong, so I own it.”\n\nJust nine of 29 Reform defectors unveiled in Farage’s ‘special announcement’ are new\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 15:36 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nNigel Farage’s unveiling of 29 new Reform UK councillors fell apart within less than an hour as it emerged just nine are new, with only three of those standing for election.\n\nThe Reform leader used a press conference at a swanky London hotel on Monday to unveil the slew of new councillors, claiming their defections proved “this party is very much on the up”.\n\nBut the lack of high-profile names and a slew of new defectors fed speculation that a steady stream of turncoats has largely dried up as a result of a bitter spat between Mr Farage and Rupert Lowe, the ousted ex-Reform MP.\n\nThe Conservatives said Mr Farage was seeking to distract from the open warfare engulfing Reform and hoodwink journalists. Tory officials pointed out that, while Mr Farage claimed all of the councillors had defected in the past two weeks, four had joined Reform a month or more before the press conference.\n\nRead the full report from my colleagues Archie Mitchell and David Maddox here.\n\nBenefits reform plans to be published ‘imminently’, says Liz Kendall\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 15:13 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nWork and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has told MPs that the government’s benefits reform proposals will be published “imminently” to ensure “trust and fairness in the social security system.”\n\nLabour MP Chris Curtis raised concerns about the rising number of young people out of work due to mental health issues, saying: “I think this is a key factor behind the nearly 12 per cent increase in young people claiming unemployment benefits in Milton Keynes since 2024.”\n\nMs Kendall responded: “I really share (his) concern about the number of young people not in work due to mental health conditions,” highlighting a “more than 25%” rise in the last year and stressing the need for “early intervention” and a “youth guarantee.”\n\nDUP MP Jim Shannon said he was “really really worried sick” about the impact of reforms on his constituents, adding: “There must be a system that protects those people, protects my constituents, protects the people that I represent in this house and the people that we all represent.”\n\nWork and pensions minister Stephen Timms acknowledged concerns, saying: “We do want to see improvements in assessments,” and confirmed that a green paper on health and disability benefits reform would be published “shortly.”\n\nJonathan Brash, the MP for Hartlepool, added it is “imperative that those who are sick, vulnerable or disabled are always protected.\n\nMr Timms replied: “There will of course always be people unable to work through disability or ill health, and we are absolutely committed to fully supporting them, too.”\n\nFull report | Minister defends planned benefit cuts amid growing Labour backlash\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 14:59 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nMy colleague Archie Mitchell reports: \n\nHow much does the UK spend on welfare as government set to announce cuts\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 14:32 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nThe UK’s welfare budget is forecast to rise sharply in the next few years, driven by higher spending on pensioners and an increase in the number of people receiving health and disability benefits.\n\nBut tomorrow, work and pension secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out plans for welfare reform in an effort to get more people back to work and cut the cost of a benefits bill.\n\nHow much does the UK spend in total?\n\nThe government spent £296.3 billion on welfare in 2023/24, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). This is the equivalent of 10.9% of UK GDP.\n\nThe OBR forecasts total spending on welfare to reach £377.7 billion in 2029/30, or 11.1% of GDP.\n\nSpending on disability benefits, which includes disability living allowance and personal independent payments, is forecast to rise from £36.3 billion in 2023/24 (accounting for 12% of the total welfare budget) to £59.4 billion in 2029/30 (16%).\n\nGovernment expenditure on all health and disability benefits across all age groups, including pensioners, is forecast to rise from £67.4 billion in 2023/24 to £100.7 billion by 2029/30, a jump of 56%.\n\nKemi Badenoch touts ‘biggest programme of policy renewal in a generation’\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 14:05 , Andy Gregory\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch has touted the announcement of what she claimed would be “the biggest programme of policy renewal in a generation”.\n\nSince being elected Tory leader in November, Ms Badenoch has faced criticism over a lack of clear policy, as her party faces a challenge on the right from Nigel Farage’s Reform UK following a bruising general election defeat in July.\n\nMike Amesbury ‘devastated’ to stand down as MP today\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 13:55 , Andy Gregory\n\nMike Amesbury has said that he is “devastated” to stand down as an MP today, telling GB News that “as from today I will no longer be the Member ofParliament for Runcorn and Helsby after nearly eight years as being an MP”.\n\nThe former Labour MP said last week he would quit the Commons after he was given a 10-week prison term for punching a constituent which was reduced to a suspended sentence following an appeal.\n\nHe said he was “sad” and “devastated”, adding: “Not only for me, but ... my staff as well, because, course, it goes beyond me, for my family. This is a result of something that I did on October 26.”\n\nAsked about the incident, Amesbury said “I should have walked away” and “I don't recognise myself”, adding: “But it is me, and it's very important that I've owned that through the legal process ... a plea of guilty”\n\nHe continued: “I’ve paid a price, I’ve been punished and rightfully so, and I hope that I learn from this.”\n\nApologising to the constituent he punched, he said: “I'm so sincerely sorry to Mr Fellows, his family, my own family”, and described reliving the moment as “like a living nightmare”.\n\nWho is the Lib Dem councillor who defected to Reform?\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 13:45 , Archie Mitchell, Political Correspondent\n\nIt is an unlikely transition, from Sir Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, but Reg Kain made the jump last week and was given a hero’s welcome at the party’s press conference on Monday.\n\nAt the time of his defection, he told the BBC that Reform was “the only mainstream party at this time that is genuinely listening to the concerns and needs of the British people”.\n\n“I intend to be a moderate and constructive voice within Reform, helping to shape a party that truly represents the interests of ordinary people,” he added.\n\nHe was elected to Cheshire East Council in May 2023 and became the council’s first Reform UK member when he defected.\n\nFarage denies having ‘assassinated his enemies’\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 13:34 , Andy Gregory\n\nNigel Farage has denied having “politically assassinated his enemies”, after MP Rupert Lowe was suspended over bullying allegations just days after he described the Reform UK leader as “messianic”.\n\nAsked whether he was somebody who did this, Mr Farage said: “No. They normally do it to themselves.”\n\nMr Farage added that he had been “appalled” by some of the comments made about party chair Zia Yusuf.\n\nHe said “racism” and “abuse” had been taking place online and claimed that, if it had been directed towards any senior member of the Tories or Labour, then it would be a “major national story”.\n\nMr Farage was also asked about suggestions that billionaire X owner Elon Musk could be open to donating to another political party.\n\nHe replied: “Great, thank you.”\n\nFarage tetchy over Rupert Lowe row in press huddle\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 13:23 , Archie Mitchell, Political Correspondent\n\nNigel Farage has for decades been one of the UK’s best politicians when it comes to dealing with the media.\n\nBut a different side of the Reform UK leader was on show when he was asked about Rupert Lowe after his press conference on Monday.\n\nMr Farage was tetchy, snappy and at one point attempted to scarper off amid questions about his former MP.\n\nHe insisted discontent among Reform members was contained to the fringes of the party, and refused to mention Mr Lowe by name. He even repeatedly said “I’m bored” of being asked about the bitter spat which rocked the party this month.\n\nElsewhere in his post-conference huddle with journalists, he gave snappy one-word answers and even challenged a journalist to prove they had written an article they claimed to have.\n\nIt was a far cry from the charming Brexiteer who has long known how to put his best foot forwards when the cameras are rolling.\n\nAndy Burnham urges ‘caution’ over benefits reforms\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 13:17 , Andy Gregory\n\nAndy Burnham has urged “caution on how changes are made” to the benefits system, after an outcry from some Labour MPs over the planned reforms.\n\nWriting in The Times, the Greater Manchester mayor said that Sir Keir Starmer is “right” and “the British state is not sustainable in its current form” but said the government should focus on helping people into work rather than simply cutting benefits.\n\nHe said: “I would share concerns about changing support and eligibility to benefits while leaving the top-down system broadly in place. It would trap too many people in poverty.\n\n“And to be clear: there is no case in any scenario for cutting the support available to disabled people who are unable to work.”\n\nNo10: Benefits overhaul driven by moral and economic duty, not fiscal pressures\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:55 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nThere is a moral and economic case to overhaul the benefits system, Downing Street said, denying the plans were purely because of the UK Government’s difficult fiscal situation.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters: “I think the Prime Minister has been clear there is both a moral and an economic case for fixing our broken social security system that’s holding our people back, and our country back.\n\n“Three million people are out of work for health reasons, and one in eight young people not currently in work, education or training.\n\n“So we’ve got a duty to fix the system, to ensure that that safety net is always there for the most vulnerable and severely disabled, but also supports back into work, rather than leaving people written off.”\n\nAsked if the reforms were being carried out because of the UK’s fiscal backdrop, the spokesman replied: “No, I think when you look at the fact that we have the highest level of working-age inactivity due to ill health in western Europe, we’re the only major economy whose employment rate hasn’t recovered since the pandemic, there is a duty to fix the broken system that is letting millions of people in this country down.\n\nFor context, \n\nWork and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out plans for welfare reform on Tuesday in an effort to get more people back to work and cut the cost of a benefits bill.\n\nHowever, there has been an outcry from some Labour MPs over the reforms.\n\nWatch | Nigel Farage addresses Rupert Lowe 'turbulence'\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:50 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nWhat patterns do we see with the councillor defections?\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:49 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nStrong Conservative shift\n\nNearly half of the defections (13 out of 29) were former Conservative councillors. 10 were previously independent, and perhaps most surprisingly, one Liberal Democrat.\n\nIt is well known that Reform UK’s strategy centres around appealing to disillusioned Tory voters.\n\nGeographical spread\n\nThere are notably multiple councillors from Kent, Powys, and South Holland, suggesting potential strongholds or areas where dissatisfaction with mainstream parties is high.\n\nNigel Farage: ‘We are growing… we are strengthening’\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:30 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nNigel Farage has unveiled 29 councillors who have defected from parties including the Conservatives, independents and even a Liberal Democrat to Reform UK.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mr Farage said: “We are growing, we are building we are deepening we are broadening we are strengthening, we are getting ready for the first of May.”\n\nAnalysis | Rupert Lowe row not dampening Reform’s spirits\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:22 , Archie Mitchell\n\nNigel Farage is never one to beat around the bush, but he just explained his way around the Rupert Lowe row with a heavy dose of spin.\n\nThe Reform leader said there had been “turbulence” in the party, but that any discontent was around the edges.\n\nIt comes despite polling showing a drop in support for Mr Farage as leader in recent weeks amid the row.\n\nHe said: “But I can promise you that in terms of our progress and our planning, that upset is very much at the edges.”\n\nTory vote in Runcorn will be total waste, Farage claims\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:19 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nNigel Farage is pitching for Runcorn and Helsby voters to back Reform UK in a bid to oust Labour in the by-election to replace Mike Amesbury.\n\nThe party leader said a vote for the Conservatives would be a total waste, urging voters to rebel against Sir Keir’s party.\n\nStarmer using ‘Brexit freedoms’ to stand tall on world stage\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:17 , Archie Mitchell\n\nNigel Farage has said Sir Keir Starmer is using “Brexit freedoms” to stand tall on the world stage.\n\nThe Reform UK leader said the prime minister has been able to succeed as a statesman because of the UK’s role outside the European Union - as a bridge between Europe and America.\n\nBut despite the praise for his diplomacy, Mr Farage said the next election will be decided on domestic issues such as immigration and the cost of living, with Sir Keir having “not got off to a very good start”.\n\nReform UK has ‘stunning momentum’, Yusuf says\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:13 , Archie Mitchell\n\nZia Yusuf said today’s announcement will underscore the “stunning momentum” behind Reform UK.\n\nThe party chairman said that, “in the last eight months, reform has delivered the most historic acceleration politically in British history”.\n\n“We are now looking ahead to 1 May (local elections),” Mr Yusuf said.\n\nHe has now handed over to Reform leader Nigel Farage, describing him as “the next prime minister of the United Kingdom”.\n\nNigel Farage set to announce councillor defections\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 12:10 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage is set to announce that 29 local councillors have defected to the party ahead of local elections in May.\n\nOur Political Correspondent Archie Mitchell is attending the press conference at the Royal Horseguards Hotel in London.\n\nWe will be bringing you the latest lines from the conference.\n\nExplained | What welfare cuts could Labour announce tomorrow? From PIP to Universal Credit\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:57 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nMore details on the rumoured billions in welfare cuts Labour plans to announce this week have been revealed as reports indicate ministers are looking to shave £6 billion from disability benefits claimed by millions of people.\n\nMy colleague Albert Toth explains: \n\nNews analysis | Why Lee Anderson was called ‘a total k**b’ and what it means for Farage, Reform and Rupert Lowe\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:52 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nThe Independent’s Political Editor David Maddox highlights the parallels between Lee Anderson's past and current political controversies.\n\nIn 2024, Mr Anderson, known for his outspoken views, was expelled from the Conservative Party after refusing to retract comments linking London Mayor Sadiq Khan to terrorism.\n\nSubsequently, the Ashfield MP joined Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage.\n\nA year later, as Reform UK's Chief Whip, Mr Anderson played a role in suspending Rupert Lowe over allegations of bullying.\n\nThere is an irony in Mr Anderson's journey from being ousted for insubordination to enforcing party discipline, David Maddox writes.\n\nRead the full analysis from David here.\n\nStarmer's diary | New Canadian leader Mark Carney expected to meet PM and King\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:39 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nSir Keir Starmer and the King are due to host the new Prime Minister of Canada today.\n\nThe PM will meet with the ex-governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, as he undertakes his first foreign trips since being sworn into office in Canada last week.\n\nCanada has been taking part in discussions around a coalition of countries willing to contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and it comes amid tensions between Ottawa and Washington DC.\n\nFor context, \n\nMr Carney replaced Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Canada last week.\n\nHe served as governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, the first non-Briton to hold the position.\n\nRachel Reeves summons regulators to Downing Street to cut bureaucracy\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:32 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nThere is “too much bureaucracy” which is making it “too slow to get things done” across the UK, Rachel Reeves has told regulators.\n\nThe chancellor told watchdog chiefs on Monday morning she wanted to reduce duplication by regulators.\n\nSpeaking as the meeting began, Ms Reeves said: “You know that the number one mission of this Government is to grow the economy. There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them – if we are honest and you know better than anyone – is the regulatory landscape.\n\n“Too much overlapping regulation, too much bureaucracy, too slow to get things done. It is something that myself and other ministers hear all the time.”\n\nThe Chancellor is expected to unveil 60 measures Britain’s regulators have agreed to take in order to boost economic growth following Monday’s meeting.\n\nFor context, \n\nThe Labour government have stepped up its efforts to cut red tape across all departments.\n\nLast week, Sir Keir Starmer announced that NHS England – an administrative body dubbed the world’s largest quango – would be scrapped as part of efforts to cut costs and boost economic growth.\n\nAs well as abolishing NHS England, the government has already announced plans to fold the Payments Systems Regulator into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and Ms Reeves is likely to scrap more regulators.\n\nFresh blow to Rachel Reeves as UK’s economic forecast slashed\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:27 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nRachel Reeves’ mission to grow the UK economy has taken yet another knock, as the country’s economic forecast has been slashed as a result of a mounting trade war sparked by Donald Trump’s global tariffs.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.2 per cent in 2026, down from 1.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent in its previous predictions.\n\nThe graph below shows the OECD economic outlook predictions for countries across the world as US president Donald Trump’s tariff war begins to bite: \n\nThe Independent’s Political Correspondent Millie Cooke has the full report on the OECD’s projections here.\n\nGovernment faces growing backlash within its own ranks over welfare reforms\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:20 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nWork and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out plans for welfare reform on Tuesday in an effort to get more people back to work and cut the cost of a benefits bill.\n\nHowever, there has been an outcry from some Labour MPs over the reforms.\n\nSeveral backbenchers have expressed frustration at the lack of communication from ministers, with one describing “engagement sessions” held by Number 10 as a “tickbox exercise” and another saying many of their colleagues had made it clear they would vote against such proposals.\n\nBut, Emma Reynolds, the economic secretary to the treasury, said Labour backbenchers are “jumping to conclusions” about expected reforms to the welfare system before the plans are confirmed.\n\nComing up | Reform UK press conference\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:16 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nNigel Farage will lead a Reform UK press conference as the party grapples with a bitter feud that threatens the group’s soaring popularity.\n\nThe Reform leader will be joined by MPs Richard Tice, Lee Anderson, James McMurdock and chairman Zia Yusuf at the Royal Horseguards Hotel, London.\n\nIt comes as Techne’s weekly tracker poll for The Independent has shown Reform falling to its lowest point since January in the wake of Mr Farage’s suspension of fellow Reform MP Rupert Lowe over claims that he made threats against Mr Yusuf.\n\nFor context, \n\nA police investigation has been launched into claims of “verbal threats” allegedly made by MP Rupert Lowe.\n\nThe 67-year-old MP for Great Yarmouth was suspended by Reform UK amid allegations about his conduct, which he denies.\n\nReform said Mr Lowe had been reported to the police over alleged “threats of physical violence” to party chairman Zia Yusuf.\n\nIt also claimed that two women working in the MP’s offices had made complaints about “workplace bullying” and “derogatory remarks”.\n\nMr Lowe has strenuously denied the claims.\n\nWelcome to our live politics coverage\n\nMonday 17 March 2025 11:14 , Jabed Ahmed\n\nGood morning,\n\nWelcome to The Independent’s live politics coverage.\n\nWe will be bringing you the

Even Democrats and left-leaning respondents were less enthusiastic about their party, with just 63% favorability—down from 72% in January.\n\nThis starkly contrasts with the survey’s Republican and right-leaning respondents, who reported 79% favorability of the Republican Party.\n\nMeanwhile, a second survey released Sunday by NBC News revealed that 27% of registered voters hold a positive view of Democrats—the lowest rating recorded in the outlet’s polls since 1990. And merely 7% of respondents indicated a “very” positive view of Democrats.\n\nWhile NBC’s poll also found that the Republican Party has a net negative image—49% of voters view it unfavorably and 39% view it favorably)—it noted that the GOP could at least take comfort in controlling both chambers of Congress and the presidency. Democrats, however, have to cling to the hope that their party might reclaim maybe one chamber of Congress in 2026.\n\nBoth surveys suggest that the lack of support for the Democratic Party stems from its own voters feeling fed up. Not only have they witnessed their party’s loss to Trump in 2024, but now they face Democratic leaders attempting to compromise with the president—something Republicans would never consider if the roles were reversed.\n\nAs Democrats continue to bend a knee to Trump, he and Elon Musk have taken a hatchet to the federal government, making massive cuts via the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe results of these surveys come as Democrats continue disagreeing on the best way to govern. Over the weekend, progressives—and even some lawmakers from the party’s more moderate wing—harshly criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for conceding to Trump on the GOP-backed government spending bill.\n\nAfter the House passed a partisan spending bill, Schumer and nine other Senate Democrats voted for cloture on Friday, ending a filibuster of Republicans’ detrimental funding bill. The bill proposed significant cuts to the federal budget while increasing defense spending by approximately $6 billion.\n\nSchumer has defended his decision, even amid calls for him to step down or be replaced. But it remains unclear who he is trying to please. Some of his party members are weary of him, and now the public is shifting their support away from him, too.\n\nIn the SSRS poll for CNN, 57% of Democrats and left-leaning respondents expressed a desire for the party to focus on obstructing Trump’s agenda, compared to 42% who favored working with the GOP.\n\nAnd NBC reported a similar finding: 65% of self-identified Democratic voters want their party to “stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington.” \n\nOnly 32% indicated a desire for Democrats to compromise with Trump, which marks a complete reversal from where Democrats stood in 2017, when 59% wanted members of Congress to seek consensus on policy.\n\nThese numbers may get worse over time, as both polls were largely or wholly conducted before the standoff over the government funding bill. Still, the results underscore how much Democratic voters are itching for their party to play at least some form of defense.\n\n“I’m scared that compromising will lead to the downfall of our democracy, to only be slightly hyperbolic. It’s really scary to see the things being done, the things being slashed left and right without any regard for the outcome,” a Democratic voter and survey respondent told NBC.\n\nThese findings also align with a series of polls released last week, which suggest that Democratic voters view their party as ineffective and lacking direction. \n\nNevertheless, some Democratic leaders appear content to acquiesce to Trump rather than push back. And in doing so, they are alienating voters.","summary":"Two new polls indicate that Democratic voters are continuing to lose faith in their party as leadership struggles to respond to President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nAn SSRS poll for CNN released Sunday found that only 29% of adults view Democrats favorably, marking a new low in CNN’s polling since 1992 and a 20-point drop since January 2021. Even Democrats and left-leaning respondents were less enthusiastic about their party, with just 63% favorability—down from 72% in January.\n\n\n\nThis starkly contrasts with the survey’s Republican and right-leaning respondents, who reported 79% favorability of the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a second survey released Sunday by NBC News revealed that 27% of registered voters hold a positive view of Democrats—the lowest rating recorded in the outlet’s polls since 1990. And merely 7% of respondents indicated a “very” positive view of Democrats.\n\n\n\nWhile NBC’s poll also found that the Republican Party has a net negative image—49% of voters view it unfavorably and 39% view it

industry on US visit","text":"The Business Secretary is expected to raise the interests of Britain’s steel industry in talks on a potential UK-US economic deal as he visits Washington after Donald Trump said there would be no exemptions to his metal tariffs.\n\nJonathan Reynolds will seek to advance “pragmatic and positive” discussions on transatlantic trade as he meets his White House counterpart on Tuesday, the Government said.\n\nMr Reynolds will hold the first in-person talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to take place under the new administration.\n\nIt comes after the US president told reporters aboard Air Force One there would be no exemptions from a 25% tax on global steel and aluminium imports.\n\nThe Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said Mr Reynolds would “represent the interests of key industries including the UK steel sector and will kick off talks on securing a wider economic deal” on the visit.\n\nUnlike the European Union, which announced counter-measures on a range of American goods, the UK Government has resisted taking immediate retaliatory action against the tariffs.\n\nBut ministers have expressed disappointment in the move and said “all options” remain on the table to respond in the national interest.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the talks, the Business Secretary said: “Protecting and growing the industries that power the UK and play a key role in delivering our Plan for Change is a priority for this government.\n\n“Today’s visit to Washington DC is the latest step in our pragmatic and positive engagement with the new administration to agree a wider economic deal in both our interests.\n\n“The UK and US share a fair and balanced relationship, one that has benefited both sides for many decades, and we will both benefit as we strengthen this relationship further.”\n\nAsked whether the Business Secretary would be seeking to secure an exemption to the tariffs in his discussions this week, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “I’m not going to get ahead of his talks, but he’s going to to continue these discussions on a wider economic deal with the US and that’s what we’re focused on at the moment.”\n\nThe Government said around 5% of UK steel exports and 6% of aluminium exports by volume go to the US, although trade bodies for both industries claim that is an underestimate of the scale of shipments across the Atlantic.\n\nThe move is the latest blow to a steel industry, which has seen thousands of job losses in recent years due to issues including global competition, high energy costs and the shift to cleaner technologies.","summary":"Jonathan Reynolds will seek to advance ‘pragmatic and positive’ discussions on trade as he meets

I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people,\" Trump told reporters right before signing the pardon in the Oval Office.\"He wasn't quite as successful, but he had somebody that saw what was going on. I didn't know him other than, I believe he was on The Apprentice.\"Blagojevich had previously been convicted of 17 counts of corruption for giving political favors in exchange of financial benefits. This also involved trying to secure campaign money for an appointment to Barack Obama's Senate seat once he was elected president in 2008, charges show.\"I've got this thing and it's f****** golden,\" Blagojevich was recorded saying about the Senate seat. \"I'm just not giving it up for ... nothing.\"Another recording showed Blagojevich implying he was offered $500,000, and charges at the time stipulated he forced a children's hospital CEO to pay $25,000 for approving pediatric reimbursement policies.Blagojevich, who served eight years in prison, has since claimed he was set up by the \"corrupt and dishonest\" FBI.\"They feel like they're a power center in their own right,\" Blagojevich said in a podcast conversation with Joe Rogan.\"The post was a satirical take on Trump's tactics, highlighting how absurd his claims about Biden's pardons are,\" Jackson told Newsweek. \"Despite knowing better, Trump and his allies deliberately sow doubt about these perfectly legal actions.

A laudable goal, but beware the ‘anti-bureaucatic revolution’","text":"Friends of mine work for the federal government. We spoke some days ago about the chaos that the new administration has unleashed in the U.S. and the repercussions around the world. More than a hundred countries have lost life-giving medicines that come from USAID, leaving millions of people vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other deadly diseases; U.S. security organizations are being dismantled, to the delight of autocrats everywhere, access to personal data in our financial institutions is available to unvetted, untrained, and unelected people – all in the name of cutting the size of the government and its departments, laudable goals but terrifying in the unplanned and devastating effects on individuals, families, communities and entire countries.\n\nMy friends are originally from Bosnia, previously a republic in former Yugoslavia. They told me that their father remembers with great anguish that actions like these in Yugoslavia, led by Slobodan Milošević, were called the “anti-bureaucratic revolution,” the destruction of the government and its agencies that had held the economy, the country and the ethnically- and religiously-diverse population together for decades.\n\nThat so-called “revolution” served as the beginning of a vicious civil war and genocide from the early 1990s to 1995, killing 140,000 people. The Bosnian city of Sarajevo was under siege for 1,425 days, the longest siege in modern warfare history, during which nearly 14,000 people perished.\n\nMilošević was ultimately arrested by an international tribunal on charges of war crimes, and he died in a prison cell in 2006.\n\nAnti-bureaucratic revolution, my friends said with sobs — it’s what they see now in the U.S.\n\nSeveral years ago a prominent article in the Observer was titled “Warning: Donald Trump is America’s Slobodan Milošević” (Schindler, 12-27-2017). Former National Security Analyst John Schindler compared the two leaders’ platforms of populist nationalism and the manipulation of angry, disenchanted people. He concluded that, in 2017 when the article was written, U.S. institutions were strong enough to withstand the challenge, while weaker former Yugoslavia had crumbled into chaos and violence. But he issued a warning.\n\nMy friends are terrified. Their country’s history shows what happens when unelected people amass huge power; sycophants swear loyalty to a leader at all costs; longstanding institutions that protected individual rights break down; and civil society organizations are harassed, threatened and ultimately collapse.\n\nThe Guardian is calling it out quite plainly. “Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos” (Feb. 3, 2025). The editorial board writes, “The U.S. president is testing the limits of executive authority, sidelining Congress and enriching allies while destabilizing the global economy.” They conclude by describing Trump’s attempt to centralize financial power in the executive branch. “If he succeeds, Nobel laureate Paul Krugman warns, it would be a 21st-century coup – with power slipping from elected officials’ hands.”\n\nIt is becoming obvious to us. Yet where are the strong protests, the loud voices, the masses of people taking to the streets, to the courts — making it stop before it’s too late?\n\nThe loyalists in Washington today pledge fealty not to the Constitution but to the administration through all three branches of government: the legislative, Congress; the judicial, the Supreme Court; and the executive, with key Cabinet positions and departments staffed by many notoriously unqualified people. The brave federal judges who stand up for the rule of law are likely to face harsh recriminations or even violence on their own doorsteps, especially now that the Proud Boys and their ilk have the president’s personal imprimatur.\n\nWe have been warned. What will we do?\n\nEllen J.

But it was just the start.\n\nBillions for USAID: An 80/20 issue. Dems took the 20% side. \n\nKeeping boys out of girls’ sports: Another 80/20 issue, Dems took the 20% side. \n\nClosing the border, energy independence, supporting Israel, deporting dangerous aliens, on and on. \n\nTrump has the Democrats jumping to defend basically every issue that a Democratic strategist of 20 years ago, or maybe even 10 years ago, would have told them to avoid like the plague.\n\nHeck, while Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) was performatively trading in his Tesla for a gas-guzzling Tahoe SUV, Democrats’ new bete noir Elon Musk was rescuing Kelly’s fellow astronauts stranded on the International Space Station. (You can tell this dramatic space rescue is a good look for Trump and Musk and a bad one for the Democrats by the non-coverage it’s received in the mainstream media.)\n\nAs a consequence, Democrats have hit a new all-time low in approval ratings, while Trump’s approval is up, and the most Americans since 2004 say the country is on the right track.\n\nNow Trump is drawing out the nation’s partisan district judges, causing them to overextend themselves in ways that will cost them — and the judiciary itself — a lot.\n\nLower-level federal judges have been issuing orders against the administration, purporting to block Trump-ordered spending cuts, halt layoffs of government employees and more.\n\nIn the latest incident, Chief Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court for the District of Columbia on Saturday tried to block Trump’s deportation of more than 250 illegal aliens tied to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, a federally designated foreign terrorist organization.\n\nTrump was relying on the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a venerable statute that allows the president to order the deportation of “alien enemies” in times of war, invasion, incursion or threat thereof. \n\nTrump’s deportation order declared that Tren de Aragua members were specifically exported here by the hostile Venezuelan government, as he placed them on airplanes and sent them to points south.\n\nThough the law dates back to the 18th century, it has been employed regularly in modern times. A 1948 Supreme Court case, Ludecke v. Watkins, interpreted presidential authority under the law very broadly, holding that it precluded judicial review of the removals. \n\nJudge Boasberg is obviously inclined to disagree.\n\nBoasberg’s ruling is part of a wide-ranging legal resistance effort, mostly organized by various left-leaning legal groups that engage in “judge shopping” to get anti-Trump decisions out of friendly district jurists. \n\nBut in doing so, they, like the Democrats, may be playing into Trump’s hands.\n\nAs these cases pile up, it’s becoming more likely that the Supreme Court will rein in this judicial overreach. \n\nThe ability of a single federal judge to block government action nationwide — let alone a president’s exercise of foreign policy — is not well established. It was a rare occurrence before Trump’s first term.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts has frequently expressed concern with the “institutional legitimacy” of the federal judiciary. At times that’s seemed limited to gaining the approval of the editorial pages of The Washington Post and The New York Times.\n\nBut he may need to consider what the rest of America thinks, lest he wind up on the 20% side of an 80/20 issue — an awkward place to be when you’re concerned about legitimacy.\n\nCongress, too, may take action.\n\nUtah Sen. Mike Lee has proposed a law requiring a three-judge panel — two district judges and one court of appeals judge, ideally from three different circuits, for diversity’s sake — to rule on challenges to presidential orders.\n\nIt’s similar to a procedure that existed before 1976. Appeals would go directly to the Supreme Court. \n\nThe Supremes wouldn’t like this — it would increase their workload, and place them in the line of political fire. \n\nBut the threat of Lee’s legislation intruding on judicial independence may nudge the Chief Justice and his peers into restricting the lower courts’ actions themselves — sooner rather than later.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"The nation’s partisan district judges are following the Democrats and taking up the wrong side of 80/20 issues, causing them to overextend themselves in ways that will cost them dearly.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/17/opinion/how-federal-judges-trump-hate-is-harming-the-courts/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/us-president-donald-trump-talks-100635444-e1742252515394.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-17 23:51:24","author":"Glenn H.

He’s a Ukrainian TikToker with more than a million followers… who wears a carpet mask and performs R&B. His falsetto is overpowering.\n\nAmy Winehouse reportedly performed here in 2007 inside a wrestling ring that a bar used for problematic events. I’m not sure if this lore is true—she played a handful of shows in 2007 in Austin, Texas during SXSW—but I believe it. A SXSW superfan who runs a Discord about SXSW told me so, after a searing performance by Beth McCarthy on Saturday. \n\nMcCarthy is the U.K.’s response to Chappelle Roan. I’m confident she’ll be a festival headliner within the year.\n\nSo what exactly is SXSW? Think about Christmas. It’s what you make it.\n\nIt is a business conference where people in the arts and tech startup space discuss the future. Where internet culture takes root. The QR code and Twitter were breakout ideas here. As was TikTok-viral rapper Flo Milly. Streaming series and comedies get the full-service red carpet premieres that other film festivals reserve for dramas.\n\n“When I saw the potential in this category, I had to be a part of it,” Ryan Winkler told me about his journey into the THC drink market. We were at punk rock club the Mohawk, about to watch Memphis soul legends the Bar-Keys. Winkler is the former Minnesota House majority leader, and he noticed I was sampling his product.\n\nFor nine days this month, the Daily Dot was on the ground reporting at SXSW. Here is the best stuff that we watched. —Ramon Ramirez\n\nThe best of SXSW 2025\n\n1) Friendship\n\nA24’s comedy film Friendship, starring Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd, had its U.S. premiere this year as part of SXSW’s Film lineup. The festival-favorite drew in big crowds, rapturous laughs, and a subsequent “buzz screening,” giving audiences another chance to view the movie not to be missed. \n\nWriter-director Andrew DeYoung’s debut feature follows Craig Waterman (played by Tim Robinson) as he desperately seeks a friend in his too-cool neighbor Austin Carmichael (played by Paul Rudd) in this funny, friendship-breakup-nightmare odyssey. \n\nCraig Waterman can’t get it quite right. He overfills his coffee mug at his mundane corporate job, where he creates “habit-forming” technology. His wife, Tami (played by Kate Mara), would rather hang out with her ex-boyfriend Devon after a battle with cancer (she opens the film with a compelling monologue Craig hysterically interjects). He just wants to watch the new Marvel movie with his family (with no spoilers, for god’s sake). Craig awkwardly stumbles through his ordinary life—DeYoung wrote the role for the comedian and creator of I Think You Should Leave and wanted to shoot the film like Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master.\n\nWhen a package is accidentally delivered to Craig’s home instead of his neighbor Austin, Craig abandons the post of his living room to return it—and its friendship at first sight. He’s enamored by Austin’s suburban suave and effortless cool. Austin’s a local TV weatherman and band frontman with a penchant for ancient artifacts. With Austin’s charisma opposite Craig’s lack thereof, watching the unlikely pair is thrilling.\n\nA budding friendship sprouts. Craig will seemingly do anything to be with Austin (who wouldn’t obsess over being Paul Rudd’s friend?). However, the bromance quickly falls out when Craig painfully embarrasses himself in a group hang of Austin’s other pals. Left with the taste of a sweet friendship, Craig fixates on trying to mend things to the point of destruction across all aspects of his life (whose descent into madness is wildly and hilariously entertaining). In this absurd yet endearing tale of male friendship with a fever-dream quality in its cinematography and score, and knockout performances, audiences have much to look forward to. Friendship will be available to view in theaters starting May 9. \n\n2) U.S. Girls \n\nSometimes, you leave a set with a new, clear mindset, invigorated by the performance, even enlightened. I left U.S. Girls’ singular SXSW set at the Mohawk on Tuesday feeling confused. The Toronto-based experimental pop project’s careening between bluesy licks and soul-pop fare felt stilted, despite bandleader Meghan Remy’s demeanor being anything but. Remy’s voice stretches like bubblegum but reverberates from a deep pit in her stomach. Those qualities are clear from the album recordings, but seeing it paired to a body, I can’t help but imagine she’s a Jenny Slate character. —Laiken Neumann\n\nThis is the least weird SXSW I’ve been to (derogatory), but there was still some cool stuff to check out; Austin’s own punky, avant-garde duo J’cuuzi put on a real fun performance at Hotel Vegas. Vocalist Gorge Bones, in a bra and Doc Martens, started a mosh pit (where I spotted my boss), sang from atop the merch table, and did split-leg headstands on a spinning chair. It was dancey, the vibes were good. —Mariam Sharia\n\n4) Ginuwine, performing with a Sandy Hook dad\n\nYou remember Ginuwine? The paralegal turned R&B superstar? He headlined an anti-gun violence concert that also booked millennial sad bros Passion Pit and ‘90s alt bros Everclear. His set was open to the public and you would have thought it was 1997 the way fans lined the block at Empire Garage. At the end, he brought out Marc Barden, father of a Sandy Hook victim and activist. Barden’s a secret shredder. Barden led a 10-minute, set-closing version of “Pony” with extended guitar jamming. Who says virality can’t be merit-based? —R.R.\n\n5) Deepfaking Sam Altman\n\nMy unintentional mission to get to the bottom of AI at this year’s festival began with the film Deepfaking Sam Altman. The documentary from Adam Bhala Lough, who gained acclaim for 2023 HBO doc series Telemarketers, similarly tries to get to the bottom AI itself. Lough attempts to interview OpenAI Sam Altman, who simply won’t return his calls. The director meets Altman at his level by creating a deepfake, which he comes to know as SamBot. Traversing the legal implications of his fake tech billionaire, Lough pokes fun at Altman’s own use of celebrities’ personas without consent. The humor wears off, though, once Lough’s attempts to contradict the “relationship” he’s built with SamBot to his relationship with his son in reality. This leaves a muddled message, spitting cliches about “real” connections. Is Lough just trolling Altman and the audience the whole time? I’m not sure. But in the growing age of insincerity now backed by artificial intelligence, I should probably figure that out. —L.N.\n\nREAD MORE of the Dot’s SXSW 25 coverage:\n\n‘There’s so many ways this could go wrong’: Should you be scared of AI? Experts say absolutely\n\nBryan Johnson is playing the internet like an improv stage\n\n‘I must accept the title’: Whataburger Museum of Art realizes long-time dream for Texas artists\n\n6) Eye-rollin’ at A.I.\n\nMuch of the panels contemplated A.I.’s imminent impact on various industries; to me it sounded like a lot of unsubstantiated predictions or brand advertising, maybe because I remember this same sort of hype with NFTs three years ago. When’s the last time you heard about NFTs? Of course I do acknowledge A.I. is different, even inevitable, maybe even game-changing; I just don’t know how exactly, and neither does anyone else. —M.S.\n\n7) The Dutchman\n\nThe Cinema Center hosted one wrap party after another during its four-day SXSW residency at Higbie’s. Celebs from Matthew McConaughey to Daisy Ridley dropped by. And you can tell it was a good movie because the cast has just seen it and now they are exuberant. Based on vibes alone, The Dutchman looks like a must-watch. Leads André Holland, Kate Mara, Zazie Beetz, and Aldis Hodge were chatty and all stayed for the full three hours. Early reviews are positive, too. And Mara’s being hailed as the “Queen of SXSW” by the L.A. Times because she debuted three projects this year. The film is an adaptation of a heralded 1964 play about race, love, and identity. No release date has been set. —R.R.\n\n8) Taxidermists\n\nIt doesn’t get much more lo-fi than this. A Massachusetts duo featuring just a fuzzy guitar and bass-heavy drums, Taxidermists delivered loose indie-rock to a packed Hotel Vegas Thursday night. One of the two also performed last year’s SXSW as LUCY (Cooper B. Handy), a synthy, experimental pop project that samples the Titanic theme over a trap beat (I did not enjoy it). Either way, lo-fi is at his core. As Sophie Kemp wrote for Pitchfork, “Handy is kind of a white rapper, but he’s also kind of like Daniel Johnston.” East Coast rockers leaning into the punk influence a bit too hard with a subtle British affectation? Well, it is New England! —L.N.\n\nI checked out Holland, a horror movie starring Nicole Kidman and Matthew Macfadyen. It sort of fell apart in the middle but was still enjoyable for me, being a fan of both actors. What else? A lot of weed sodas and gummies and stuff being handed out, constrained by Texas’ weird weed laws, delta 8, delta 9, what have you. I spoke with anti-aging biohacker Bryan Johnson the day before his keynote address — he was lovely and earnest. He may have a new convert in me. Oh and I spotted my favorite Austin legend, the Batman. —M.S.\n\n10) Shiho Yabuki\n\nMusic at SXSW isn’t the glossy blowout that it was a decade ago. Next year, the conference will condense into seven days and cut the final music-only Saturday altogether. \n\nSaturday night I walked from the Belmont to Hotel Vegas at midnight to watch ‘80s electronica icon Egyptian Lover. The line was so long I made the 1.2-mile hike for nothing. Why the heck was there such a demand for a 63-year-old producer? We call this chunk of the conference “Deep South By,” where the record nerds show out.\n\nAnd for music nerds, SXSW remains incredible: You can watch New Orleans twerk queen Big Freedia debut her gospel project. You can watch Afrobeats artists who sound like Wizkid and Burna Boy dance the night away at Flamingo Cantina, one of Austin’s few dedicated venues for Black music. You can watch the masked BlackGold, fresh off a stint opening for Limp Bizkit, play nu-metal that sounds like peak P.O.D. You can watch rapper Wave Chappelle fresh off an 18-hour drive from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, work a room like only a seasoned emcee can.\n\nYou can watch Rolling Stone-cover-donning country darling Megan Moroney belt breakup anthems. You can watch Grupo Frontera, which recently denounced rumors that its members supported President Donald Trump by saying it wouldn’t support political parties that were anti-immigrant, play to a sea of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with full-force arena lighting. And afterward, you’ll get free bags of McDonald’s egg McMuffins. \n\nYou can watch New Zealand R&B stars Teo Glacier and J. Tajor, who effectively make Backstreet Boys B-sides, play bonafide hits in front of 30 people. You can watch the nearly 80-year-old John Fogerty play the CCR songs now that he’s won a lawsuit to get his catalog back.\n\nI’ll most remember 69-year-old experimental pianist Shio Yabuki performing at the Central Presbyterian Church. She’s prodigious enough to compose at will. So her interpreter would ask the audience for a feeling such as “despair” or “death,” and she’d offer up 3-minute piano songs to match the mood. At the end, someone asked for “unicorn on the sea,” and then danced in a unicorn mask next to her grand piano. She does this on TikTok Live, too, her interpreter said.\n\nStudies show that consuming art changes our neural pathways and makes us more empathetic people. You really can’t do it enough. —R.R.\n\nInternet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email. Sign up for the Daily Dot’s web_crawlr newsletter here.
