Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James as people who are 'guilty as hell', before he lamented that no criminal charges have been brought against them by the Department of Justice.\n\nMuch of his exasperation was with Erik Siebert, the former US attorney from the Eastern District of Virginia who reportedly declined to prosecute James for mortgage fraud because the case was lacking evidence.\n\nSiebert also did not prosecute Comey after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused him of threatening Trump in a social media post, the Washington Post reported. \n\nThe media initially reported that Siebert resigned from his position, but Trump contradicted that in his post.\n\n'He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,' Trump wrote.\n\nAlso in the post, Trump also appeared to float Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer currently serving as a special assistant to the president, as a replacement for Siebert. \n\nIn a follow-up post made about a half hour later, Trump officially announced his intention to nominate Halligan to the US Attorney position in Virginia's eastern district.\n\nHe described Siebert as a 'Democrat Endorsed \"Republican\"' and said Halligan will 'be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!'\n\nTrump also appeared to walk back his prior exasperated tone with Bondi, saying she is 'doing a GREAT job' as attorney general. \n\nHalligan has been representing Trump for years, most prominently serving as one of his attorneys in the case against him for retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn August 2024, that case was dismissed by US District Judge Aileen Cannon, with her arguing that Special Prosecutor Jack Smith's appointment was unconstitutional.\n\nSmith appealed the ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which then formally dismissed the case in February 2025, marking its end.\n\nHalligan's promotion comes after Bondi reportedly tapped Mary 'Maggie' Cleary to be the acting US attorney in that office.\n\nCleary has served as an assistant US attorney in the Western District of Virginia and is perhaps most known for her attempts to beat back an allegation made by an anonymous individual that she was present during the January 6 Capitol Riot.\n\nCleary, a conservative Republican, was briefly placed on administrative leave but was cleared after a brief internal investigation, Politico reported.","summary":"President Donald Trump piled pressure on Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political enemies in a post to Truth Social.

TRUMP'S IRAN ULTIMATUM STARTED A 60-DAY CLOCK TICKING FOR DECISIVE JUNE STRIKES, BOMBER COMMANDER REVEALS On Thursday, the president said the administration is \"trying\" to get the former U.S. Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan \"back\" from the Taliban. In remarks to the press while standing alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president criticized the handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden and said he had \"a little breaking news.\" \"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said. \"We're trying to get it back because they need things from us.\" Trump did not expand on whom he was referring to or, if referring to the Taliban, the terrorist organization that took over the country in 2021, what they \"need\" from the U.S. \"We want that base back, but one of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\" Trump added. On Saturday evening, Trump told reporters the administration wants Bagram back \"right away,\" and \"if they don't do it, you're going to find out what I'm going to do.\" The Taliban took over the country after the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021. The U.S. claimed Bagram Air Base, which was built by the Soviets in the 1950s, in 2001 when the military went into Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks. In 2021, when the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, it secretly left the base in the middle of the night on July 1, leaving it to the Afghan government. ELDERLY BRITISH COUPLE RELEASED BY TALIBAN AFTER EIGHT MONTHS IN CUSTODY FOLLOWING NEGOTIATIONS The Taliban captured the base six weeks later in August of 2021, on the same day Kabul fell. Earlier this year, White House hostage envoy Adam Boehler met with Taliban officials in Kabul while working to get hostage George Glezmann released, the first direct meeting since the pullout in 2021. Boehler, along with another U.S. envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, met with the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and reportedly discussed ways to \"develop bilateral relations between the two countries, issues related to citizens, and investment opportunities in Afghanistan,\" according to a Taliban statement. The removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan began during the first Trump administration in March 2020, and open-source intelligence showed that the Taliban had been making gains across Afghanistan in the year leading up to the August 2021 withdrawal.

We are a trusted partner, an ally, a country that plays a positive role in our region, in the Pacific as well as, of course, with our ASEAN neighbours and traditional allies such as Five Eyes partners including the US and UK.”\n\nIn recognising a Palestinian state, Australia will join a majority of UN member states – 147 out of 193 – which already do.\n\nThe United States does not recognise Palestine and has vetoed past attempts by the Palestinian Authority to join the UN.\n\nMr Albanese previously said there would be “no role for the terrorists of Hamas in any future Palestinian state”, adding: “This is one of the commitments Australia has sought and received from President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority has reaffirmed it recognises Israel’s right to exist in peace and security.”\n\n﻿﻿‘Punitive measures’: Washington’s warning\n\nThe pledges to recognise Palestinian statehood have not gone down well in Washington, with Donald Trump’s top diplomat dismissing them as motivated by “internal politics” and “largely meaningless”.\n\nAhead of the UNGA, Senior Republicans closely allied to the US President penned a letter to Mr Albanese and the leaders of Canada, France and the UK calling on them to rethink the “reckless policy” and warning that it “sets the dangerous precedent that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas to achieve their political aims”.\n\n“Hamas’s war crimes are clear, and its rejection of diplomacy should lead your countries to impose more pressure. Instead, you offer greater rewards,” they wrote.\n\nThe group, which included former presidential candidate Ted Cruz, also warned recognition “imperils the security of your own countries”.\n\n“Proposed recognition is coinciding with sharp increases in anti-Semitic activity in each of your countries.

Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Trump’s insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve healthcare programmes as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline.\n“We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people,” the two New York Democrats wrote.\n“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they said. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.” Trump, in an exchange with reporters on Saturday evening, suggested that he remains open to a potential meeting but was dismissive of the Democratic leadership.\n“I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” he said.\nCongress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.\nThe House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted healthcare funds also failed.\nIt all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expires. Trump’s first term in office saw a month-long shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-2019.\nTrump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in a closure.\nRepublicans have insisted they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, turning it back on Democrats.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.\nWhile the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold that means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.\nDemocrats are working to protect health care programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax break and spending cut bill enacted earlier this year.\nRepublicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.

Their hatred consumes them and is now apparent to the world.' \n\nProminent conservative activist and podcast host Riley Gaines also weighed in after quoting Omar's 'dustbin of history' comment.\n\n'You're wrong. You WILL be judged,' Gaines posted. 'I pray for your salvation.' \n\nDespite Collins pressing Omar on the tastelessness of blaming a dead man for his own murder, Omar stood her ground and offered no apology.\n\nThe controversy reached a boiling point earlier in the week when House Republicans attempted to formally censure Omar over her comments about Kirk, though the measure narrowly failed. \n\nOmar had previously criticized Kirk's views on gun ownership and race, particularly in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing in her home city of Minneapolis.\n\nAfter the vote to censure her fell short, President Donald Trump delivered his own scathing rebuke of Omar.\n\n'She's terrible,' Trump said, furious the House would not punish one of its own over what he called 'grotesque comments about a murdered patriot.' \n\nKirk, 31, was assassinated earlier this month at Utah Valley University during what authorities have described as a targeted political attack. \n\nThe alleged gunman, Tyler Robinson, reportedly had a history of left-wing extremism and allegedly confessed the murder to a trans-identifying partner.","summary":"Rep.

The group claims captives are dispersed across Gaza City's neighbourhoods.The release of the \"farewell\" image came as large-scale protests were expected in Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities, with demonstrators demanding a deal to secure the captives' return and halt the war, Al Jazeera reported.Earlier this month, Hamas published footage of two Israeli captives, following a separate video showing two others in deteriorating condition, one of whom was depicted digging his own grave. The images drew sharp condemnation from captive families, Israeli authorities, and international allies, including the United States.Meanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza reports that since October 2023, Israeli strikes have killed at least 65,208 people and wounded 166,271. Following Israel's breach of a ceasefire on March 18, 12,653 Palestinians have been killed and 54,230 injured, as reported by Al Jazeera.","summary":"Hamas releases &#39;farewell picture&#39; of 48 Israeli hostages amid Israel&#39;s intensified assault on Gaza City, warning captives&#39; lives are at risk.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/hamas-releases-farewell-picture-of-48-israeli-hostages-amid-intensified-israeli-assault","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/hamas-releases-farewell-picture-of-48-israeli-hostages-amid-intensified-israeli-assault-1758412745593-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:59:12","author":"Asian News International","authors":["Asian News International"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.018},{"id":362167832,"title":"Pentagon imposes new restrictions on media","text":"WASHINGTON: The Pentagon has unveiled new restrictions on media covering the US military, requiring them to pledge not to disclose anything not formally authorized for publication and limiting their movements within the Department of War.\n\nThe new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply — or risk losing their media credentials.

Trump said that Washington, DC has become “beautiful and safe,” mentioning that it is because of the “good governance.”In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “Just toured Washington, D.C., and it is a totally different place than it was last year. No tents, manicured grass and parks, clean streets, no gangs or vicious criminals — THE PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL AND SAFE, and it is going to remain that way! What a difference good government makes! Go to D.C. and enjoy history being made!” These remarks came days after the national emergency and federal takeover he declared in August had expired. The deployment had included National Guard troops and additional federal officers.However, Trump warned on Monday that he would once again declare a national emergency in Washington, DC, if local police decline to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, CNN reported.In a late-night Truth Social post, Trump claimed that his earlier emergency order had reduced crime in the capital but cautioned that crime would surge if the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) refused to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Trump has argued that such measures are necessary to combat crime and has threatened similar actions in other Democratic-led cities. Critics, however, have denounced the approach as an “unprecedented power grab.”As reported by CNN, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a September 2 order, directed city agencies to cooperate indefinitely with federal law enforcement but clarified that DC did not require a continuing federal emergency. The directive did not cover immigration enforcement. Bowser later stressed that MPD would not participate in ICE operations, saying the department would return to its “status quo.”“Immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won’t be what MPD does in the future,” she said last week.Trump, in his Monday post, criticised Bowser’s position: “Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalise, if necessary!!!”While reported crime in Washington has declined under the federal surge, Trump’s repeated claim that the city now has “no crime” is inaccurate. His latest remarks also signal a shift from recent weeks, when he praised Bowser for her cooperation with federal agencies. White House officials previously indicated that Trump was comfortable letting the 30-day emergency lapse, believing the city had taken steps toward coordination with federal authorities.

Prosecutors were considering four potential charges against Homan: bribery, conspiracy and two types of fraud, according to a document seen by MSNBC.\n\nInvestigators agreed to monitor Homan’s actions once he returned to public office, but the probe was closed in recent weeks by appointees of President Donald Trump after FBI Director Kash Patel requested a status update, MSNBC reports.\n\nBoth agencies and the White House dismissed the outlet’s report as politically motivated and baseless. \n\n“This matter originated under the previous administration and was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors,” Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement to MSNBC. “They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The Department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.”\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson told MSNBC the probe was a “blatantly political investigation, which found no evidence of illegal activity, is yet another example of how the Biden Department of Justice was using it’s resources to target President Trump’s allies rather than investigate real criminals and the millions of illegal aliens who flooded our country.\"\n\n“Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,\" Jackson added in a statement on behalf of Homan.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House, the FBI and the Justice Department for comment. \n\nThe federal investigation was launched in western Texas after an earlier probe in the summer of 2024 that claimed Homan “was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts” should Trump go on to win the presidential election, according to MSNBC.\n\nHoman served in the first Trump administration as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In the 2024 presidential election, he was open about the fact that he would likely play a prominent role in Trump’s mass deportation operation in a second administration.\n\nUndercover FBI agents were posing as contractors when they met with an unnamed business associate several times last summer, who connected them to Homan. According to documents obtained by MSNBC, Homan “indicated he would facilitate securing contracts for them in exchange for money once he was in office.”\n\nHidden cameras allegedly caught Homan accepting the cash on September 20, 2024, according to an internal summary of the case seen by MSNBC. \n\nAfter the alleged undercover operation, the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas then asked the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section to join the investigation, described in documents as a probe “into the Border Czar and former Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan and others based on evidence of payment from FBI undercover agents in exchange for facilitating future contracts related to border enforcement,” the outlet reports.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section oversees federal crimes affecting government integrity. They agreed to join the case in November 2024, MSNBC reports. \n\nThen, in either late January or February of this year, former acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told Justice Department officials he did not support the investigation. One of Trump’s Justice Department appointees also called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025, MSNBC’s sources said.\n\nThe report has prompted several Democratic lawmakers to speak out against Homan.\n\n“Border Czar Tom Homan was caught by the FBI accepting bribes - on camera - to deliver government contracts in exchange for $50,000 in cash,” Democratic Senator Adam Schiff wrote on X. “Pam Bondi knew. Kash Patel knew. Emil Bove knew. And they made the investigation go away. A corrupt attempt to conceal brazen graft.”\n\nDemocratic Representative Pramila Jayapal wrote: “The most corrupt administration we have ever seen.”\n\nOther commentators have also weighed in. Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president of economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, called for Homan to be jailed if the MSNBC report is true.\n\n“The FBI recorded Trump’s border czar accepting a $50,000 bribe. Then the Trump administration buried it to protect their guy,” Nowrasteh wrote on X. “If true, Tom Homan should be in prison with those who covered it up. Pretty minor corruption for Trump’s 2nd term though.”","summary":"A White House spokesperson called the probe ‘blatantly political’ and said it yielded ‘no evidence of illegal activity’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tom-homan-border-czar-bribery-investigation-b2830605.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/20/22/13/GettyImages-2234492873.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jHYzViRk-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:40:14","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":362164222,"title":"Holly Willoughby is 'secretly plotting a spectacular TV comeback' with her producer husband Dan Baldwin after being left without a TV show for the first time in 21 years as she ditches daytime for primetime","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Sep 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFergie's Epstein lies exposed in bombshell email: She publicly apologised for taking abuser's cash and vowed to cut ties with him, then weeks later told him: I only said it to save book deals\n\nIs a CULT at the heart of why baby killer Constance Marten has cut her mother out of her life?\n\nPM's decision to recognise a state of Palestine could lead to UK paying £2trillion in reparations\n\nAt the age of 67 this is the most powerful anti-ager I've found - and it's far better than Botox: ALEXANDRA SHULMAN\n\nWhy can't I get rid of the bumpy red rash on the tops of my arms?

We're trying to get it back, by the way,\" he added.According to Tolo News, several members of the US Congress have backed Trump's position, calling his push to regain Bagram Air Base both strategic and correct.Meanwhile, China has dismissed Trump's remarks, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating: \"China respects Afghanistan's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The future of Afghanistan should be in the hands of its people. We call on all parties to play a constructive role in regional peace and stability.\" He added that fueling confrontation in the region lacked public support.The Islamic Emirate has not officially responded. Earlier, however, Afghanistan's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said, \"Not even an inch of Afghan soil is acceptable for foreign military presence. This message must reach President Trump and other countries. Engagement will only be political and economic.\"Zakir Jalaly, head of the second political department of the Foreign Ministry, echoed this view, saying: \"Afghans have never accepted military presence throughout history. This was completely rejected in the Doha Agreement, but the door to other forms of engagement remains open.\"These statements come amid repeated warnings from Russia in recent months about Western efforts, particularly by the US, to re-establish a military presence in Afghanistan.","summary":"Trump demands Afghanistan return Bagram Air Base, warning &quot;bad things are going to happen&quot; if Taliban don&#39;t comply.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-warns-bad-things-are-going-to-happen-if-afghanistan-doesn-t-return-bagram-air-base","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/bad-things-are-going-to-happen-trump-threatens-afghanistan-to-return-bagram-air-base-1758411472731-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:37:57","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":362164212,"title":"Israel presses on with Gaza offensive: IDF tanks level city streets while troops move in to root out Hamas - as bleak images show civilians fleeing assault","text":"Israel's military has continued its offensive into Gaza City and the Gaza Strip as 10 countries look set to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nIDF tanks rolled through the city's streets as Israeli troops dismantled underground shafts and destroyed booby-trapped buildings which they believe to have been organised by Hamas.\n\nAt least 60 Palestinians died as a result of the operation, according to Gazan health authorities, while the IDF said one of its soldiers was injured by a sniper shot on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe Israeli military say many Hamas field commanders were killed during the mission.\n\nIt is believed more than 300,000 people have fled Gaza City as a result of the military's expansion, with images this week showing displaced Palestinians - including children - looking for safe refuge.\n\nIsraeli forces have targeted the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, with the military estimating that it has demolished up to 20 tower blocks over the past fortnight.\n\nFrom where they are striking, the IDF would be positioned to advance on central and western parts of the city - where most of Gaza City's remaining population is believed to be sheltering.\n\nIt comes as Britain and nine other countries are scheduled to formally recognise an independent Palestinian state ahead of the annual leaders' gathering at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly tomorrow.\n\nThe UN meet in New York will take place just days after the global governmental body said Israel was committing a genocide. They said it is 'clear there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza'. \n\nSir Keir Starmer was pressed on his decision to recognise the Palestinian state at a press conference alongside Donald Trump at his country residence, Chequers, earlier this week.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the move was part of a 'process' that could eventually lead to a two-state solution and that it was not a reward for Hamas, who he says could have no role in running an independent state.\n\nThe US President openly disagreed with Sir Keir's comments, saying: 'I have a disagreement with the Prime Minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually.'\n\nHamas' military wing released a montage-type image of Israeli hostages on the messaging site Telegram, warning that their lives were at risk due to Israel's continued military offensive.\n\nHamas estimates that since August 11, Israel's military has destroyed or damaged more than 1,800 residential buildings in Gaza City, and destroyed more than 13,000 tents housing displaced families.\n\nThe group claims around around 900,000 people remain in Gaza, including Israeli hostages - of which 20 are thought to be alive.\n\nIn almost two years of fighting, Israel's offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians and caused widespread famine, say Gazan health authorities.\n\nHowever, Israel says the hunger crisis in Gaza has been exaggerated and that much of the blame lies with Hamas.\n\nCOGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into the enclave, said earlier that Hamas fired at U.N. teams on Saturday and prevented the opening of a new humanitarian route in the southern Gaza Strip.\n\nThe war began after Hamas led attacks in Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper branded Israel's offensive 'utterly reckless and appalling' earlier this week, saying it would 'only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages'.\n\nBritain is providing medical treatment to badly wounded Palestinian children, with between 30 and 50 understood to have been admitted to hospitals after being airlifted to the UK.\n\nElsewhere, the US continues to support Israel. The presence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jerusalem when the offensive began has been interpreted as the White House giving its backing.\n\nBoasting about the Israeli military's achievements on social media, defence minister Israel Katz said: 'Gaza is burning. We will not relent or turn back until the mission is complete.","summary":"IDF tanks rolled through the city's streets as Israeli troops dismantled underground shafts and destroyed booby-trapped buildings which they believe to have been organised by Hamas .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15118205/Israel-Gaza-300-000-Palestinians-flee.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/20/21/102312255-0-image-m-96_1758399904921.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:29:45","author":"Ciaran Foreman,Editor","authors":["Ciaran Foreman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":362169890,"title":"Amid Looming Confusion, White House Clarifies $100K H-1B Visa Fee Applies To New Applicants Only","text":"Washington: President Donald Trump’s latest plan to overhaul the American immigration system has left some immigrant workers confused, forcing the White House on Saturday to scramble to clarify that a new $100,000 fee on visas for skilled tech workers only applies to new applicants and not to current visa holders.The president on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick by his side, signed a proclamation that will require the new fee for what are known as H-1B visas — meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find hard to fill.“Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a posting on X. “This applies only to new visas, not renewals, and not current visa holders.”The fee takes effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday. It is scheduled to expire after a year. But it could be extended if the government determines that is in the interest of the United States to keep it.The White House in a social media post also sought to make clear the new rule “does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.”But immigration attorneys said that the White House move threatened to upend the lives of many skilled workers and has far-reaching impact on American business.Kathleen Campbell Walker, an immigration attorney with Dickinson Wright based in El Paso, Texas, said in a posting on LinkedIn that the White House move “inserts total chaos in existing H-1B process with basically a day’s notice.”Lutnick on Friday told reporters that the fee would be an annual cost for companies.But a White House official said Saturday that it’s a “one-time fee.” Asked if Lutnick’s comments sowed confusion, the official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the new fee “currently does not apply to renewals but that policy is under discussion.”Meanwhile, India's government expressed concern Saturday that the Trump administration move would dramatically raise the fee for visas that bring tech workers from there and other countries to the United States.Trump also rolled out a $1 million “gold card” visa for wealthy individuals. The moves face near-certain legal challenges amid widespread criticism he is sidestepping Congress.To be certain, if the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215.India’s Ministry of External Affairs said Saturday that Trump’s plan “was being studied by all concerned, including by Indian industry.\" The ministry warned that ”this measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families. Government hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the U.S. authorities.\"More than 70% of H-1B visa holders are from India.H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor’s degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program undercuts American workers, luring people from overseas who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually. That is well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Lutnick, meanwhile, claimed “all big companies” are on board.Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.“We’re concerned about the impact on employees, their families and American employers,\" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said. \"We’re working with the Administration and our members to understand the full implications and the best path forward.”Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because “it’s just not economic anymore.”“If you’re going to train people, you’re going to train Americans,” Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. “If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.”Trump also announced he will start selling a “gold card” visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.The “Trump Platinum Card” will be available for $5 million and allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa — this is now the platinum card.Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it “the next best thing” to abolishing the visas altogether.Doug Rand, a senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said the proposed fee increase was “ludicrously lawless.”“This isn’t real policy — it’s fan service for immigration restrictionists,” Rand said. “Trump gets his headlines, and inflicts a jolt of panic, and doesn’t care whether this survives first contact with the courts.”Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval.Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn’t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.","summary":"Trump&#39;s proclamation imposes $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for skilled tech workers, applying to new applicants only, not renewals or current holders.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/amid-looming-confusion-white-house-clarifies-100k-h-1b-visa-fee-applies-to-new-applicants-only","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/h-1b-visa-i-us-president-donald-trump-1758333629085-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:27:01","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":362162026,"title":"Why Meghan has suddenly been silenced: Once a loud and proud social justice warrior, she's now (whisper it) quite boring. Experts say it's all part of a master plan","text":"A man had been murdered and protests were spreading across the United States.\n\nTraumatized Americans, sickened by violence, were searching their souls, asking what should be done. It was a fraught time, but the Duchess of Sussex knew she had to speak out.\n\n'I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that I wouldn't, or that it would get picked apart,' she told students at her old Los Angeles high school in June 2020, after the killing of George Floyd.\n\n'I realize,' she said, 'the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing.'\n\nMeghan Markle seemed fearless back then.\n\nNow, with the country stunned once more by murder - this time of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk - and with President Donald Trump visiting her husband's homeland, Meghan's relative silence may speak volumes.\n\nNatalie Trice, who has spent 30 years advising clients about public relations and communications, senses a 'scaled-back approach' that 'feels like a deliberate shift, but maybe not one she has decided on.'\n\nAnd, Trice says, that's a bit of a shame.\n\n'Right now, look at what's happening to women's voices, and the voices of minorities,' she added. 'Meghan could use her voice not just for Hollywood visibility, but for impact, to amplify others, shape conversations and challenge the status quo.'\n\nIndeed, it's not that the 44-year-old has disappeared in the last 18 months - far from it.\n\nAsked in August whether there were any issues she was 'dying' to weigh in on but couldn't, Meghan told Bloomberg: 'No. I just make a choice of what matters to me, and what is important to me.'\n\nShe added: 'If there was anything I wanted to say or felt necessary to say then I'd say it.'\n\nMeghan relaunched her Instagram account in January and has been busily documenting date nights with her husband Prince Harry and idyllic scenes from their picture-perfect garden. Even their two children - six-year-old Archie and Lilibet, four - feature in the glossy montages: something that was once an anathema to the privacy-obsessed pair.\n\nWhen the Los Angeles wildfires broke out earlier this year, the couple visited an evacuation center and helped hand out emergency food parcels.\n\nShe tried again with a podcast.\n\nHer 12-part Archetypes series had been dropped by Spotify in June 2023 and Confessions of a Female Founder debuted in April with much fanfare, but as of today there have only been nine episodes, with the last released in June. And last month the second season of her critically panned Netflix lifestyle show, With Love, Meghan, made its debut.\n\nTrice said that Meghan's apparent pivot from meaty issues to soft-focus Instagram photos could be orchestrated by Netflix, which signed a deal to promote both her shows and her lifestyle brand, As Ever. \n\nBoth the Duchess and Netflix were approached by the Daily Mail for comment, but declined to do so. \n\nTrice said it was a delicate decision.\n\n'Meghan is walking a communications tightrope,' Trice said. 'Say too much, she's criticized. Say nothing, and she's accused of being performative. It's a classic case of \"damned if she does, damned if she doesn't\".'\n\nEden Gillott, a PR specializing in crisis communications, agrees.\n\n'She has a business brand to protect and a show built around friendship and joy that doesn't align with political hot takes,' he claimed. 'By holding back, she is repositioning her voice to be more intentional, closer to the Michelle Obama model, where people lean in when she does choose to speak.'\n\n'Holding back' is not a trait that many may associate with Meghan.\n\nShe often tells the story of her childhood activism, describing how at the age of 11 she wrote to a dishwasher liquid company and demanded they change their advertisements that appealed to only women to ones that targeted all consumers.\n\nIn May 2016, she said on a Comedy Central late-night show that Donald Trump was 'misogynistic' and 'divisive'. He, in return, called her 'nasty.' She prided herself on 'speaking her truth', claiming to the world that there was racism inside the British royal family and championing political causes such as paid family leave and voting rights.\n\nMeghan declared in Glamour magazine in 2017 that her heroines included Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, and trailblazing environmentalist Jane Goodall. On moving to California in March 2020, she contacted Gloria Steinem to ask her to work on a voter-registration drive.\n\n'She reminds me that when you have anger, you have to channel that energy into something that makes a difference,' said Meghan at the time. 'That's what activism is. It's about how we show up.'\n\nOnly years later, in 2021, the Duchess told a summit why she was so passionate about paid parental leave, insisting: 'Even before I had any sort of privilege in my life - when my life and my lifestyle were very, very different - I always stood up for what was right.'\n\nFor a moment, Meghan even took up the mantle of gun-control activist.\n\nShe visited the Texas town of Uvalde in May 2022 following one of the worst school shootings in US history and sent a letter of support to members of the Moms Demand Action movement, founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting. She returned with Harry in March 2024 to visit the family of teacher, Irma Garcia, who was among the 21 Uvalde victims.\n\nBut that crusading activity, too, seems to have faded: she had nothing to say about last month's Minneapolis church shooting, during which two young students were killed and nearly two dozen adults were injured.\n\nOnce, her name was even tossed around as a possible political candidate, with Meghan and Harry reportedly meeting Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, in October 2020 via Zoom to discuss her replacing then-Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nThe rumors surged once more in 2023 when Senator Dianne Feinstein died, with speculation that Meghan might seek the seat.\n\nNow she is adamant that the idea does not appeal.\n\n'No,' Meghan said in April, when asked if she would ever consider running for office. 'Never. Oh, God. I mean, you could say, \"Never say never.\" No, I'm not interested in that. No.'\n\nMark Borkowski, a crisis PR consultant, said: 'Meghan has learned, the hard way, that volume isn't the same as influence. The early phase of \"finding her voice\" became a cacophony - every speech, every podcast clip, every political nudge was amplified and often weaponized against her. The result? Fatigue. The media got bored of the sermon, the public got tired of the tone, and her commercial partners got nervous.'\n\nBorkowski said she was likely being warned to steer clear of controversy, in a bid to maintain a broad appeal.\n\n'Netflix and her other backers don't want noise - they want focus,' he said. 'A glossy docuseries or lifestyle brand can't thrive if the headlines are dominated by political spats or stray comments about the royals. Silence, in this case, is a strategy: it keeps the attention on the product, not the controversy.'\n\nWhich leaves her, well... chatting to her friends on her podcast and TV show, and making jam?","summary":"Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was once weighing in on women's rights, gun control and politics.

Bagram Air Base is currently under the control of the Taliban government after the US troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021.Trump has repeatedly indicated that he would have kept control of the air base, given its strategic importance near the border between Afghanistan and China.A few days ago, during his visit to London, Trump stated that the US is trying to regain control of the air base.“We were going to leave Afghanistan, but we were going to leave it with strength and dignity, and we were going to keep Bagram, the big air base – one of the biggest air bases in the world,” Trump said during a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.“We gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back, by the way,” he added.According to Tolo News, several members of the US Congress have backed Trump’s position, calling his push to regain Bagram Air Base both strategic and correct.Meanwhile, China has dismissed Trump’s remarks, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating: “China respects Afghanistan’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The future of Afghanistan should be in the hands of its people. We call on all parties to play a constructive role in regional peace and stability.” He added that fueling confrontation in the region lacked public support.The Islamic Emirate has not officially responded. Earlier, however, Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said, “Not even an inch of Afghan soil is acceptable for foreign military presence. This message must reach President Trump and other countries. Engagement will only be political and economic.”Zakir Jalaly, head of the second political department of the Foreign Ministry, echoed this view, saying: “Afghans have never accepted military presence throughout history. This was completely rejected in the Doha Agreement, but the door to other forms of engagement remains open.”These statements come amid repeated warnings from Russia in recent months about Western efforts, particularly by the US, to re-establish a military presence in Afghanistan.

The Virginia office was thrown into turmoil when its acting U.S. attorney abruptly left on Friday.Mary \"Maggie\" Cleary said in an email to staff on Saturday that she had been named the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, according to her email.She replaces Erik Siebert, who resigned amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Multiple sources had told CBS News Friday that federal prosecutors for the district were concerned that Siebert could be removed for failing to prosecute James. President Trump did not push back on those concerns, saying Friday, \"Yeah, I want him out.\" \"While this appointment was unexpected, I am humbled to be joining your ranks,\" Cleary told employees in the email. \"The Eastern District of Virginia has a distinguished legacy upon which we will build.\" Cleary will take over an office in tumult over political pressure by administration officials to criminally charge James, a longtime foe of President Trump. In May, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News that the Justice Department had launched a criminal fraud probe targeting James. The investigation stems from allegations that James provided false information on mortgage applications to get better loan rates for a home in Virginia. The Justice Department has spent months conducting the investigation but has yet to bring charges, and there's been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence necessary to secure an indictment. James' lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.In 2022, James sued Mr. Trump for years of alleged financial fraud, claiming Mr. Trump and his family participated in a conspiracy to inflate his net worth by billions of dollars in order to secure better loan rates, among other things. A judge found them liable and ultimately ruled Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization must pay $354 million in fines, though the actual total recently climbed to above $500 million due to interest while he appeals. While Siebert said in an email to colleagues Friday evening that he had submitted his resignation, Trump wrote in a social media post: \"He didn't quit, I fired him!\" Mr. Trump wrote Friday that he \"withdrew\" Siebert's nomination for U.S. attorney when he \"was informed\" that Siebert had \"received the UNUSUALLY STRONG support\" of Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia. Both senators had expressed support for Siebert's nomination back in May.\"What is Trump focused on?\" the two senators wrote in a joint statement Friday. \"Threatening to pull anyone who criticizes him on TV off the air. And now, pushing out the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia that we recommended and he himself nominated because Erik Siebert is an ethical prosecutor who refused to bring criminal charges against Trump's perceived enemies when the facts wouldn't support it.\"The president reiterated his statement that he fired Siebert in follow-up Truth Social post Saturday, writing that Siebert \"lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.\" Cleary recently rejoined the Justice Department as a senior counsel in the criminal division after working as a prosecutor in the Culpepper Commonwealth's Attorneys Office. She also worked as deputy secretary of public safety in Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's administration and later served in Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares' office. Cleary wrote in an article for The Spectator World earlier this year about being wrongly identified in a photo which allegedly placed her on Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6 riot. Cleary, who at the time was working as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Virginia, wrote: \"Everyone knew I was a conservative. It was all over my resume. I was in leadership in my local Republican Committee. But I had not gone to the Capitol that day.\" She described being placed on administrative leave and interviewed by agents before later being cleared to return to work. \"In the last four years, I've been somewhat cautious about sharing my experience, but now, while Donald Trump is president, I feel emboldened to finally tell how, I, too, was targeted politically,\" Cleary wrote. At the time the article was published in May, she was interviewing to serve as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Cleary said she wanted that job \"to end this type of treatment.\"","summary":"Mary \"Maggie\" Cleary has been tapped to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-attorney-virginia-letitia-james-trump/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/04/22/20a5a9a4-691e-48f5-8b37-2341f2befa62/thumbnail/1200x630g2/c4d61831c83fc84cfc621617763e96ad/gettyimages-2016269562.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:15:02","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":362166276,"title":"Why Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian state","text":"The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, called for the government to pause its decision. \"It is a reward for terrorism, while the hostages remain in chains, and has been celebrated by Hamas as 'one of the fruits of 7th October',\" he said.\n\nSources in government strongly deny the move is symbolic. They point to the first statement from Arab nations calling for Hamas to disarm and end its rule of Gaza as evidence that British recognition can shift the dial in the Middle East.\n\nBut it also puts the UK at odds with the US. \n\nDuring his state visit to the UK, President Donald Trump, who is strongly opposed to recognising a Palestinian state, acknowledged he had a \"disagreement\" with Sir Keir on the issue.\n\nBack at home, there is no doubt among Labour MPs that the party's position on Gaza has driven some Labour voters towards the Green Party and pro-Gaza independent candidates.\n\n\"We have been behind the curve,\" said one Labour MP who wants the government to go further. \n\n\"I think this is a step in the right direction,\" they added, but noted the majority of UN member states have long recognised a Palestinian state.\n\n\"It shows we're late,\" they said. \"But better late than never.\"\n\nLabour's difficulties over the war in Gaza began long before it came to power. In the eyes of many Muslim voters, Sir Keir's original sin was in a 2023 LBC interview shortly after the 7 October Hamas attacks, when he appeared to say Israel had the \"right\" to cut off water and energy to Gaza.\n\nThen a month into the conflict, several shadow ministers resigned and 56 of his MPs rebelled over Sir Keir's refusal to back a vote for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nThree months later in February 2024 the party changed from supporting a \"humanitarian pause\" to an \"immediate ceasefire\".\n\nParty strategists believe some voters are still punishing them for these initial positions, and have not given them credit for the changes since then.\n\nOfficials in Downing Street argue that within a year of coming to power, Labour has driven a major shift in British policy in the Middle East. Ministers point to the fact the government has now suspended some arms export licences to Israel, sanctioned some Israeli ministers, and moved to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nBut there is little sense this will appease the anger on Labour's backbenchers about the situation in Gaza, nor the calls for the government to go further.\n\nDr Simon Opher, a Labour MP blocked by Israel from entering the country this week, said the government had tried to use the threat of recognition as leverage to achieve a ceasefire but it had not worked.\n\n\"Now we have to very categorically opt out of any arms deals with Israel, stop any cooperation, and we need to think about proper trade sanctions. We still do quite a lot of trade with Israel so that will be the next logical step.\"\n\nHowever, other Labour MPs fear the move panders to the party's left, and has not achieved anything.\n\n\"It was the final diplomatic card we had to play,\" one said. \"You only get to do this once and actually this is not going to catalyse a peace process but drive Israelis away from it.\"\n\nOthers said it would please the party's members and core supporters, but was not a factor in those constituencies that would decide the next election.\n\n\"It feeds into the narrative that the government cares more about Palestinian flags than Union flags,\" another Labour MP said. \n\n\"It gives the impression we care more about borders in the Middle East than the borders at Dover.\"\n\nSo will it make a difference to Labour's political fortunes? Few in government think so. \n\nSome hope it might help navigate the party's conference when activists largely supportive of the Palestinian cause flock to Liverpool next week. \n\nBut, as one senior aide said, the question will be whether the situation on the ground in Gaza has changed come election time.","summary":"The PM had signalled a shift in policy unless Israel took steps including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9848kxp2go","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a40b/live/3e2a30b0-9575-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 23:02:17","author":"Harry Farley","authors":["Harry Farley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":362159754,"title":"Trump Warns Taliban Of 'Bad Things' If Bagram Air Base Isn’t Returned","text":"President Donald Trump intensified pressure on the Taliban on September 20, 2025, issuing a pointed warning on social media over Bagram Air Base, a key facility once central to US operations in Afghanistan. “If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” Trump wrote, reflecting his longstanding criticism of the 2021 withdrawal. The base, featuring a two-mile runway and previously hosting B-52s and Black Hawks, has become a focal point for US strategic interests, including monitoring potential threats in western China. Insider reports indicate ongoing discussions between US hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on broader diplomatic issues, including detainee releases, though Bagram’s status was reportedly not formally addressed. Taliban officials swiftly rejected the warning. Spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid stated that Bagram is “Afghan soil, not a Chinese outpost,” while Deputy Minister Muhajer Farahi emphasised in comments to BBC that any US troop presence “is completely rejected” (BBC, Sept. 20). Analysts note this follows the Taliban’s established approach: offer engagement on economic or humanitarian issues while maintaining strict sovereignty over military infrastructure. Strategic Implications and Regional Stakes Observers highlight Bagram’s enduring significance as a strategic hub. Trump has repeatedly linked the site to monitoring China’s western nuclear facilities, and US officials have explored options to leverage economic or diplomatic pressure without committing troops (NPR, Sept. 18; CNN, Sept. 19). Analysts also note Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, including lithium deposits, may underlie broader strategic interest in maintaining access to key airfields. For now, the dispute remains a high-stakes standoff. While Trump’s rhetoric signals urgency, senior US officials insist no immediate military action is planned, calling the social media post “more rhetoric than roadmap”. Social media reactions have been intense, with users amplifying the threat and regional analysts debating potential scenarios.

I'm so grateful for all the love, kindness and support I've been shown so far. \n'It means the world to me, and I can't wait to give it my all on that dancefloor.

Not only that, but we\u0019re seeing worldwide support for Kirk, mass demonstrations against illegal immigration in Europe, the fall of France\u0019s government, and a grassroots movement saying, \u001cEnough is enough,\u001d here in America.

I guess it could be characterized as enough is enough. Hello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal.\n\nSomething is happening in the United States, I think worldwide too. It's almost as if there were fuel and the death of Charlie Kirk ignited it. It's not a George Floyd movement at all or moment.\n\nWe've talked about that. It's very different. It's building up frustration.\n\nIt's not a top-down DEI mandate. It's a grassroots kind of collective shrug throughout Western civilization. I guess it could be characterized as enough is enough.\n\nWe're witnessing large-scale demonstrations in Ireland, Great Britain. The government of France has fallen. Mr. Macron will have to appoint a new prime minister. There is unrest in the Netherlands. We used to think during the Cold War that Eastern Europe was supposedly backward politically, under the Soviet sway, economically stagnant. But since the Cold War, and especially lately, the Eastern Europeans seem the most sensible of all Westerners.\n\nThey believe in tradition. They believe in borders. They believe in legal-only immigration.\n\nThey believe in fossil fuel development. And they have strong militaries because they've experienced Soviet aggression and German aggression in the past. And yet, they also are having a reinforcing moment.\n\nWhat is this moment? We're seeing it in the United States with thousands of people are commemorating the death of Charlie Kirk. There's no tolerance for the usual left-wing socialist craziness, the abhorrent, violent smears of conservatives who've died.\n\nAnd you don't see major bureaucrats or generals or Hollywood figures. Increasingly, they're not coming out and rejoicing because they feel that they're going to get a big pushback. This is not violent.\n\nIt's just a collective shrug. And what is the shrug, basically? It's saying, we're tolerant of people with alternate lifestyles, but whether we like it or not, the nuclear two-parent family for 2,500 years has ensured the survival of Western civilization.\n\nIt gives us two to three to four children, and we can reproduce the species. We're tolerant of Islam and Buddhism, Hinduism. We have a multiracial, multicultural population.\n\nBut whether we like it or not, the foundations of the United States are Judeo-Christian, as they are of Western civilization. In general, we have no apologies for that. The Sermon on the Mount is a unique document.\n\nWe also are tired of what I call boutique anti-Americanism. We see Ilyan Omar suggesting that our elected government is worse than the dictatorship in Somalia. Or we see AOC calling Donald Trump a fascist, as she has in the past.\n\nOr we see Rashida Tlaib just demonizing and damning the United States, even though her parents fled the Middle East to come here. And we're tired of it. It doesn't mean we're going to outlaw free speech or try to use the same tactics as the critics of America do.\n\nBut what we're saying is, we're a unique place. We're better than the alternative. We don't have to be perfect to be good.\n\nSo you can say all you want, but we're going to not just ignore you. We're going to do our best to make sure your voices have no influence. And that's why people are taking to the street in Europe.\n\nThey're saying an open border and illegal immigration brings in millions of people from the Middle East. They have no proven desire that they wish to readily assimilate, integrate into a culture and a civilization that they feel is antithetical to that of their home. And that presents a paradox, because they voted with their feet to join the West, but they want to bring their culture and values into the West, which if they were successful, would mean that the West would look like their homelands, but of which they have forsaken.\n\nDoesn't make sense, but we see the same thing in the United States. We have an open southern border, we're criticized by immigrants that come across, and yet if we were to embrace the values and culture of Latin America and turn the United States into Latin America, then the immigrants would not wish to leave Latin America to find another Latin America. The left cannot deal with that paradox, but we can on the conservative side.\n\nSo we're saying open borders does not work. We're saying that if you dismantle natural gas energy, if you dismantle oil, if you dismantle nuclear power, and you choose to subsidize inefficient and unreliable solar and wind, then you're going to be a pre-civilizational society. Germany was the juggernaut of Europe, and now it's a pathetic weakling economically.\n\nWhy? Because its energy costs are four times what they used to be, and it's not a competitive country. So what I'm getting at is people throughout the West say, we've sat still where we had open borders.\n\nWe have let in millions of people that do not like us and do not share our values. We have opted for economic irrationalism that has in suicidal fashion harmed our economies and hurt our lifestyles. We have embraced critical legal theory, critical race theory that suggested the criminal is a victim rather than a victimizer, and we see the effects and the verdict is in it doesn't work.\n\nAnd we see that our governments, our bureaucracy, our culture at large doesn't want to hear this message. And we know they're influential in the media, in the corporate boardroom, in the university, but they don't have one thing. They don't represent 51% of the people, and crowds are now marching in Europe, in the United States, and the message is, what has worked in the past does not have to be perfect, as I said.\n\nIt's better than the alternative, and we're going to return to it, and we wish you would join us, but if you don't want to join us, and you want to dismantle Western civilization, or you hate the United States, or you despise your particular European country, then you're going to be voted out of office, and you're going to have zero political power, as it should be.

White House Clarifies Changes For New Lottery Cycle","text":"White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt on Saturday clarified that the newly announced $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is a one-time charge, applying only to new visa applicants in the next lottery cycle. The move will take effect at 12.01 am on Sunday. Current H-1B holders and renewals will not be affected, as officials seek to ensure the change targets only future visa approvals. The announcement, made on Friday by President Donald Trump, is part of a broader overhaul of the H-1B visa system aimed at prioritizing highly skilled foreign workers while discouraging companies from using the program to replace American employees with lower-paid labour. What Are H-1B Visas? H-1B visas are designed to allow US-based employers to temporarily hire highly skilled workers of “distinguished merit and ability” when they cannot find that talent domestically, according to the Labor Department. “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,” White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said. “It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system,” Rogers added. Impact On Indian Professionals And IT Firms India-born professionals are the largest group benefiting from H-1B visas. Between October 2022 and September 2023, 72 percent of nearly 400,000 H-1B visas went to Indian nationals. Major IT companies like Infosys, TCS, HCL, and Wipro sponsored about 20,000 employees to work in the US during this period. The new fee has sparked concern among visa holders and their families, especially those traveling outside the US, with some rushing to return to avoid being stranded. The Trump administration said the move is intended to prevent companies from replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign labour. Officials said that the foreign share of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs in the US has grown significantly, and H-1B-dependent IT firms have allegedly taken advantage of the system to reduce costs. Gold Card Program Trump had signed a “Gold Card” visa program for foreigners of extraordinary ability. Those who pay $1 million individually or $2 million via corporate sponsorship can access expedited visas and a pathway to a Green Card, aiming to attract top talent while protecting American jobs. Trump said that the new rules ensure only highly skilled and productive workers enter the US “Valuable people only for America. Stop the nonsense,” he said. The administration said the change will also generate revenue for the US Treasury and strengthen the labor market for American citizens.

There can be no place, no place at all for Hamas.\n\n“The humanitarian situation is just desperate and we have continued to press Israel to deal with the scenes of malnourishment and starvation that we’re seeing, to open up more sites to get more aid in to Gaza and we are very concerned about this continued offensive into Gaza City.”\n\nCongressional Republican leaders, including chairwoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Rick Scott, have sent a letter to the UK, France, Canada, Australia and other key allies about recognition.\n\n“This is a reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace,” wrote Ms Stefanik and Mr Scott.\n\n“It sets the dangerous precedent that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas to achieve their political aims.”\n\nDuring his state visit to the UK, US President Donald Trump said he has “a disagreement with the Prime Minister” about recognition.\n\nA group of families of hostages taken in the October 7 attack warned that recognition could hamper efforts to release them.\n\nIn an open letter to Sir Keir, they said: “Your regrettable announcement of the UK’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones.\n\n“Hamas has already celebrated the UK’s decision as a victory and reneged on a ceasefire deal.\n\n“We write to you with a simple plea – do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.”\n\nIlay David, brother of hostage Evyatar David, who was seen emaciated in a Hamas video last month, said: “Giving this recognition is like saying to Hamas: ‘It is OK, you can keep starving the hostages, you can keep using them as human shields.’\n\n“This kind of recognition gives Hamas power to be stubborn in negotiations. That is the last thing we need right now.”\n\nCriticism also came from opposition parties, with shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel accusing Sir Keir of “capitulating” to his backbenchers to shore up his leadership.\n\n“With the terrorist organisation Hamas still holding hostages in barbaric conditions and glorifying acts of terror, Starmer is sending a dangerous message, where violence and extremism are tolerated and rewarded,” she said.\n\nDame Priti also described the preparation of fresh sanctions on Hamas as a “feeble last-minute attempt” to placate Mr Trump.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said: “Hamas and a Palestinian state are inseparable for now. This is typical of Starmer, he can’t really decide where he stands.\n\n“Whatever the caveats in his statement, this announcement is a surrender to terrorism and a betrayal of Israel.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the Prime Minister’s move, but said it must be matched by deeds.\n\nSecretary general Wajid Akhter said: “We call on the Government to accompany recognition with tangible action: an immediate halt to all arms sales to Israel, a reassessment of trade agreements, and full support for international justice mechanisms such as the ICJ (International Court of Justice) and ICC (International Criminal Court).\n\n“Only then can recognition carry real meaning.”","summary":"The Prime Minister is understood to have concluded the situation has deteriorated since he urged Israel to change course.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-west-bank-david-lammy-prime-minister-priti-patel-b1248835.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/20/22/00dce940d968c8e1cdf8f6ec1a0c9473Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU4NDg2MjQ0-2.81466371.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:53:47","author":"David Hughes","authors":["David Hughes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":362156834,"title":"PM's decision to recognise a state of Palestine could lead to UK paying £2trillion in reparations","text":"Keir Starmer's controversial decision to recognise a state of Palestine could lead to demands for the UK to pay more than £2 trillion in reparations to the country, legal experts have said.\n\nSir Keir has said the UK will press ahead with the move, which is expected to be announced ahead of his visit to the UN this week, unless Israel meets certain conditions, including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of a two-state solution.\n\nIt has been condemned by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch for 'rewarding terrorism', while the US Government says that it will have 'disastrous consequences'.\n\nNow legal experts have warned that it could also be a costly decision – because the new country would ask for eye-watering damages in compensation for land 'taken from the Palestinian people' when Britain relinquished control of the region after the Second World War.\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who has a long history of threatening to sue Britain, is demanding 'reparations in accordance with international law' based on the value of the land which was under British rule between 1917 and 1948. \n\nSome international law experts have described £2 trillion, roughly the size of Britain's total economy, as a 'good place to start'.\n\nFamilies of the hostages abducted by Hamas in the October 7 attacks have written to the Prime Minister to condemn the decision, which they claim has 'dramatically complicated' efforts to be reunited with their relatives. \n\nIn an open letter to Sir Keir, they said: 'Your regrettable announcement of the UK's intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones.\n\n'Hamas has already celebrated the UK's decision as a victory and reneged on a ceasefire deal. We write to you with a simple plea - do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.'\n\nIlay David, brother of hostage Evyatar David, who was seen emaciated in a Hamas video last month, said: 'Giving this recognition is like saying to Hamas: \"It is OK, you can keep starving the hostages, you can keep using them as human shields.\"\n\n'This kind of recognition gives Hamas power to be stubborn in negotiations.

This is typical of Starmer, he can't really decide where he stands.\n\n'Whatever the caveats in his statement, this announcement is a surrender to terrorism and a betrayal of Israel.'\n\nIt is expected the government will look to impose sanctions on Hamas, after Sir Keir said during a joint conference with Donald Trump last week that the terror group could have no part in running an independent Palestine.\n\nBut this move has been branded as a a 'feeble last-minute attempt' to placate the US President by former Home Secretary Priti Patel.\n\nDame Priti told The Telegraph: 'With the terrorist organisation Hamas still holding hostages in barbaric conditions and glorifying acts of terror, Starmer is sending a dangerous message, where violence and extremism are tolerated and rewarded.\n\n'Peace in the Middle East will never be secured by rewarding terrorists. His feeble last-minute attempts to appease the United States are shallow and will never justify his reckless decision on recognition.'\n\nCongressional Republican leaders, including chairwoman Elise Stefanik and Senator Rick Scott, have sent a letter to the UK, France, Canada, Australia and other key allies about recognition.\n\n'This is a reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace,' wrote Ms Stefanik and Mr Scott.\n\n'It sets the dangerous precedent that violence, not diplomacy, is the most expedient means for terrorist groups like Hamas to achieve their political aims.'\n\nTory justice spokesman Robert Jenrick says reparations for Palestine would amount to 'Chagos 2.0', in reference to Sir Keir's surrender of the islands to Mauritius – which leaked government documents reveal will cost UK taxpayers more than £35 billion to rent back from them.\n\nBritain handed over the territory in the Indian Ocean in response to pressure from international courts, which pro-Israeli lawyers warn could act as a precedent. \n\nThe campaign group called Britain Owes Palestine has demanded an apology from Britain for 'war crimes' in the region. \n\nDeputy Prime Minister David Lammy once supported calls for reparations for slavery, saying: 'As a Caribbean people, we are not going to forget our history. We don't want to just hear an apology, we want reparations,' while the Government's lawyer-in-chief, Lord Hermer, has given legal assistance to nations seeking reparations for slavery.\n\nLord Hermer's advice resulted in a 'ten-point plan for reparations', as former colonies seek to seize up to £18trillion in compensation from the UK.\n\nMr Jenrick said: 'Not a penny of taxpayer money should be spent on so-called reparations.\n\n'This is a load of ahistorical nonsense.

As per MSNBC's exclusive report, Homan accepted $50,000 in cash after suggesting to undercover agents — who posed as business executives — he could help them secure government contracts in a second Trump administration.The probe began in Texas the summer of 2024, after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election. At the time, he was the president and owner of a private consulting business that offered to help companies in the border security sector secure government contracts. The FBI and Justice Department held off to see whether he would follow through if formally empowered under Trump.On November 11, 2024, six days after the presidential election that he won, the Republican named Homan as his “border czar.” Because the role is adversarial in nature, it did not require Senate confirmation or a full FBI background check.The matter stalled in January - shortly after Trump began his second and final term - despite investigators believing they had a strong criminal case. In recent weeks, the probe was officially closed after FBI director Kash Patel called for a status update.In a joint statement to the outlet, Patel and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche gave the following explanation:\"The case originated under the previous Joe Biden administration. It was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.\"The White House criticised the probe as \"blatantly political\" and one that found no evidence of illegal activity.\"Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,\" White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said.In Trump's first term, Homan, 63, briefly served as the interim head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-border-czar-in-trouble-tom-homan-probed-by-fbi-for-bribery-in-2024-report-says-case-closed-under-trump/articleshow/124021137.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-124022648/124022648.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:48:07","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":362156380,"title":"Trump says ‘bad things’ will happen if Afghanistan does not return Bagram base","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened Afghanistan with unspecified punishment if the Taleban-controlled country did not “give Bagram Airbase back”.\n“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform.\nThe vague threat comes just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom.\nBagram, the largest airbase in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.\nA massive, sprawling facility, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others have repeatedly raised allegations of systematic human rights abuses by US forces at Bagram, especially pertaining to detainees in Washington’s murky “War on Terror”.\n\nTrump has often lamented the loss of access to Bagram, noting its proximity to China, but Thursday was the first time he has made public that he was working on the matter.\n“We’re trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news.

He said yes and was turned away at the gate by personnel who told him he'd have to contact representatives with Turning Point USA if he wanted to be let in.\n\nAt roughly 2:00pm, Runkles was seen inside the stadium, according to the probable cause statement. It's unclear at this time how he gained access.\n\nHe was then arrested and was caught with 'a loaded pistol, a revolver and several knives', police said.\n\nHis law enforcement identification badge and ID card were found not to be active, and officials confirmed he was no longer employed by the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, according to police. \n\nHe has been charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and carrying a weapon into a prohibited place. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nRunkles was released on bond around 10am on Saturday, Arizona police told the Daily Mail. \n\nIt comes as officials are, 'tracking several threats of unknown credibility' ahead of the high-profile event on Sunday, per ABC News. \n\nKirk, 31, was shot dead on September 10 in front of crowds of students and supporters at Utah Valley University while on his 'American Comeback' tour.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has designated his memorial service as a Level 1 Special Event, the highest possible rating.\n\nIt will feature speakers such as President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. \n\nThe service, called 'Building a Legacy: Remembering Charlie Kirk', is due to begin at 11am local time, with doors open from 8am.\n\nGuests are asked to don their 'Sunday best', wearing red, white and blue for the United States. \n\n'This event is first come, first served based on stadium capacity,' according to the event's website. \n\nAll guests will be screened with metal detectors upon entry, and patted down as a last resort. Those who do not consent will be denied entry, officials said.\n\nAlcohol, weapons, fireworks, drones, bags and clothing deemed obscene or indecent are all among the long list of prohibited items.\n\nThe stadium, home to the NFL Arizona Cardinals, has seating for 63,400 people and can expand to over 73,000 for larger events. \n\nTrump is said to have personally requested the 63,000-capacity home of the Arizona Cardinals to welcome mourners travelling from across the country. \n\nAs of Friday, the full list of speakers included Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, Trump and Vance, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump Jr. Tucker Carslon, White House advisor Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor. \n\nChristian singers such as Chris Tomlin, Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes are also set to perform at the service. \n\nLocal law enforcement have said their preparations are on a level usually reserved for major sporting events like the Super Bowl.\n\nGlendale's police chief said his department is deploying 'every available resource', bolstered by reinforcements from neighboring jurisdictions.\n\nBomb squads and tactical units will also be on standby for the event.\n\nKirk is set to be laid to rest in Phoenix, Arizona. The state is where Kirk lived with is wife, 36, and their two children before his death.\n\nHis casket was flown from Utah to Arizona aboard Air Force Two on Thursday, accompanied by JD Vance, Second Lady Usha Vance, and Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk. \n\nThe service is being organized by Turning Point USA, which was co-founded by Kirk when he was a teenager in 2012. His wife, Erika, took on the role of CEO and Chair of the Board following his passing. \n\nThe non-profit, which advocates for conservative politics on American campuses, invited fans to celebrate Kirk, 'an American legend,' and his 'remarkable life and enduring legacy.' \n\nKirk's death has prompted fierce political debate around upholding free speech and the threat of political violence to American democracy.\n\nHis suspected killer Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody on September 12 and appeared in court for the first time by video link on September 17.\n\nRobinson faces seven charges, including aggravated murder and witness tampering. He did not enter a plea to any of the charges on Wednesday.\n\nProsecutors are seeking the death penalty 'based on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime', they said in a court filing.\n\nErika Kirk, giving a tearful address after her husband was killed, said: 'You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry.\n\n'They should all know this: if you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before you have no idea, you have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world.'\n\nShe has vowed to continue Charlie Kirk's mission, announcing that their campus tour will continue through autumn.","summary":"The armed man claiming to be a law enforcement officer at the site of the Charlie Kirk memorial in Arizona was identified by authorities.

In turn, his heir is said to be angry about the meeting with Harry.\n\nSources say that as part of the cautious plans being drawn up to resolve the crisis:\n\nHarry agreed to keep a low profile during Donald Trump's visit as a goodwill gesture to his father.\n\nThe Duke might take part in more UK public events, though not officially as a working member of the Royal Family.\n\nHarry is said to be 'hopeful' of re-establishing a relationship with William despite the froideur between them since Megxit.\n\nDespite the cautious positive steps, Harry is said to be 'realistic' that some reputational damage from the last few years is irreversible.\n\nBut after last week, many royal commentators agreed that Harry was back in his element, meeting the public and larking around for the cameras with children.\n\nThe warm public reaction to him did not go unnoticed at the Palace, sources insist, where working members of the Royal Family – particularly those keen to do the bread-and-butter public engagements – are in short supply.\n\nA source said: 'Harry's visit to the UK was not about trying to show up or compete with his brother – in fact, the opposite.\n\n'It was to remind William that Harry can be there to take some of the load off, given some of the criticism William has received for carrying out a lower number of engagements than his father.\n\n'That doesn't need to be as part of the \"working\" Royal Family. It can just be doing what he loves to do and does best – supporting causes close to them both, such as the Diana Award and conservation.\n\n'More than anything, though, he wants to see his father more. He wants to make him proud and be there to support him through his treatment.' \n\nOn his later trip to Kyiv, when asked about meeting the King, all Harry would say was that in the coming year 'the focus really has to be on my dad'.\n\nAs part of rebuilding trust between the pair, Harry agreed, at the King's request, to avoid any publicity which would distract from President Trump's visit.\n\nThe Sussex royal household were given two days off to coincide with the trip and Harry ensured he did not carry out any engagements at home or abroad, and was not photographed at his home in Montecito, California.\n\nIn a BBC interview this year Harry said he knew that some members of his family will 'never forgive him' for the accusations he made alongside Meghan in their TV chat with Oprah in 2021, and in his excoriating memoir Spare.\n\nFor the moment William remains firmly in that camp. Last week, a source said relations between the brothers are now so bruised that William can't even stand the mention of Harry's name.\n\nBut Harry, who plans to come to the UK 'four or five times' a year from now on, is said to be hopeful that he can at least find a working relationship with William. \n\n'Whatever he can do to continue rebuilding those relationships and that trust, he will do,' a source said.\n\nRoyal biographer Tina Brown suggested that the King, who made 372 appearances last year, was 'less irritated' by Harry than he was by William.\n\nShe said that tensions are brewing between the King and heir over William's workload, which pales in comparison to his cancer-stricken father and has been punctuated by numerous holidays.\n\nMs Brown added the King feels William's carefully cultivated image as a doting father, while genuine, is a tacit criticism of his past shortcomings as a parent.\n\nShe said Harry's return to the UK had been a great success for him, which is 'bad news for the Prince of Wales'.\n\n'The King is, I am told, less irritated with the prodigal Harry than he is with his elder son and heir. \n\n'Somehow, William's parenting dedication always seems couched as a tacit criticism of the King's own paternal deficiencies.'\n\nIf the King does play a significant role in rehabilitating Harry, it will not be the first time he has done this for someone close.\n\nHe faced an uphill battle to have Camilla accepted publicly and worked closely with his mother on a message she issued during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.\n\nRoyal sources now believe the same could happen for Harry.\n\nLast night Buckingham Palace and a spokesman for the Duke of Sussex declined to comment.","summary":"It is understood that courtiers in both households are tentatively discussing how to get father and son (pictured) together more frequently over the next year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-15118105/King-Harry-meet-regularly-royal-aides-plan-unity-public-appearance-six-years-cards.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/20/20/102311883-0-image-m-25_1758396679950.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:20:58","author":"Charlotte Griffiths,Editor","authors":["Charlotte Griffiths","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":362156858,"title":"U.S. attorney in Virginia forced out amid mortgage case pressure","text":"Sept. 20 (UPI) -- The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was forced out after failing to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James regarding mortgage loan fraud.\n\nErik Siebert notified staff on Friday that he resigned, but President Donald Trump said he was fired. Siebert was nominated for the position and was awaiting Senate confirmation.\n\nOn Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Mary \"Maggie\" Cleary, an attorney active in Republican politics, as acting U.S. attorney for the division, according an internal email obtained by Politico and The Washington Post.\n\nThis month, Cleary rejoined the DOJ as a senior counsel in the criminal division in the District of Columbia after working in the Culpepper Commonwealth's Attorney's Office and Virginia state agencies.\n\nShe was placed on administrative leave in the DOJ's Virginia Western District for being on Capitol grounds during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Clear said she was \"framed\" and was ultimately cleared.\n\n\"This evening, I submitted my resignation as interim US Attorney for EDVA,\" Siebert's email, obtained by ABC News, read. \"For the last eight months, I have had the pleasure of leading the finest and most exceptional of DOJ employees, who care deeply about our nation and our EDVA community. Thank you for the lessons you have taught me, the sacrifices you have made, and the pursuit of justice you strive for every day.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump posted on X that he \"withdrew the Nomination of Erik Siebert as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, when I was informed that he received the UNUSUALLY STRONG support of the two absolutely terrible, sleazebag Democrat Senators, from the Great State of Virginia. He didn't quit, I fired him! Next time let him go in as a Democrat, not a Republican.\"\n\nHe was referring to Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.\n\nIn a joint statement, Kaine and Warner said Siebert lost his job because his office was \"unable to find incriminating evidence of mortgage fraud\" against James, noting that there had been bipartisan support for his nomination.\n\n\"In April, after an extensive interview process that included the input of a bipartisan panel of former Virginia U.S. attorneys and other well-respected members of the Virginia legal community, Warner and Kaine sent a letter to the White House recommending Siebert for the U.S. attorney position,\" they wrote. \"In May, the White House announced that Siebert was formally nominated for the role,\" Warner and Kaine said.\n\nBoth senators from a nominee's state are sent a blue slip in which they may submit a favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee, regardless of their party. The Senate Judiciary Committee takes blue slips into consideration when deciding whether to recommend that the Senate confirm a nominee.\n\nMedia outlets, including CNN and The New York Times, reported that Justice Department prosecutors in Virginia believed they have not gathered enough evidence to indict James.\n\n\"Erik Siebert is an ethical prosecutor who refused to bring criminal charges against Trump's perceived enemies when the facts wouldn't support it,\" the senators wrote. \"The Eastern District of Virginia is at the forefront of significant cases essential to our national security, and just like any court in America, should be focused on justice instead of a thin-skinned president's vendettas.\"\n\nSiebert, who worked for 15 years in Virginia as an assistant U.S. attorney, was the lead attorney for the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and the deputy criminal supervisor for the Richmond Division.\n\nHe was also a police officer with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn March, he appeared with Attorney General Pam Bondi, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and FBI Director Kash Patel on the arrest of an alleged MS-13 gang member in Northern Virginia.\n\nBefore posting on Truth Social, Trump told reporters, \"Yeah, I want him out. When I learned that they voted for him, I said, I don't really want him.\"\n\nNew York's attorney general is among three people targeted by the Trump administration for alleged loan fraud involving claims about two primary residences in Virginia and New York. No Republicans have been named, though Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin have two primary residences on loan paper, ProPublica reported.\n\nWilliam Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to Bondi alleging that James had \"in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government-backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.\" The letter was obtained by CBS News.\n\n\"The allegations are baseless,\" James told NY1, \"The allegations are nothing more than a revenge tour.\"\n\nJames has been in Trump's crosshairs since June 2022, when she sued Trump and the Trump Organization, alleging they inflated the values of properties.\n\nTrump was ordered to pay $355 million in restitution for \"ill-gotten gains\" from his inflated financial statements, state Superior Court Judge Arthur Engoron ruled. With interest, the amount was raised to $527 earlier this year. But the Appellare Division in New York earlier this year canceled the fine and James has appealed.\n\nPulte has also targeted California Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, appointed by President Joe Biden. Trump fired Cook, but the district and appeals courts have ruled that Trump doesn't have the authority to fire someone from the Federal Reserve without due process and only for cause. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in.","summary":"Erik Siebert, acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was forced out after failing to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/09/20/US_Va-Erik-Siebert-acting-US-attorne-forced-out-Letitia-James-loan-fraud/9121758385520/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9121758385520/2025/i/17583892851975/v1.5/US-attorney-in-Virginia-forced-out-amid-mortgage-case-pressure.jpg?lg=5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:18:57","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.165},{"id":362156706,"title":"Russian air attack on Ukraine leaves three people dead","text":"Night of Wings and Fire: How a New Wave of Drone Swarms Tore Through Ukraine’s Quiet\n\nBy the time dawn bled pale over the Dnipro River, neighborhoods that had been humming with life the evening before were ringing with a different soundtrack — the relentless whine of propellers, the staccato rattle of air-defence batteries, the long, hollow clang of an alarm that seems to live in the chest of a whole city.\n\n“I could hear the Shahed coming closer and closer. I knew it was heading for us,” said Yulia Chystokletova, voice still trembling over a phone line from Kyiv. “My child and I were very frightened. It should not be happening in the 21st century. We are all people. Sit down at the negotiating table.”\n\nNumbers that make your head spin\n\nThe scale of last night’s assault — as described by Ukrainian officials — reads like a new chapter in modern warfare: roughly 580 drones and about 40 missiles launched across the country. Ukraine’s air force reported shooting down 552 of those drones and 31 missiles, but the strikes still left scars. President Volodymyr Zelensky said three people were killed, dozens were injured, and residential blocks and critical infrastructure suffered heavy damage.\n\nAttacks reported across multiple regions, including Dnipro, Chernihiv and Khmelnytskyi.\nIn Dnipro a missile reportedly carrying cluster munitions struck an apartment building — at least one person died and 26 were wounded, officials said.\nUkraine said it struck refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions of Russia in retaliatory raids; Russian regional officials reported four dead in Samara.\n\nIndependent verification of battlefield claims remains limited — Reuters and other outlets have cautioned that some reports could not be independently confirmed. Still, the human stories are unmistakable: flattened facades, a child’s backpack in the rubble, a landlord trying to account for tenants.\n\nFrom trickle to flood: the evolution of the drone threat\n\nWhat is most striking is not only the death toll but the tactic. Early in the war, Russia used dozens of drones in single raids. Last night’s assault — hundreds launched in coordinated waves — reveals a dramatic escalation in resources and operational coordination. These are not lone, errant toy-like machines but organized swarms intended to saturate air defences and strike deep into civilian areas.\n\n“We are living through a watershed moment in conflict technology,” said Dr. Tomasz Kowalczyk, a Warsaw-based security analyst. “Swarms amplify effects: they force defenders to spend interceptors, strain radars, and most perniciously, they convert logistics and small weapons factories into strategic assets. This is asymmetric attrition in the air.”\n\nUkraine’s response has been to strike back — aiming for fuel depots, refineries, and logistics hubs far across the border. Kyiv’s General Staff said operations hit refineries in Samara and Saratov overnight; the Samara attack was described by regional authorities as one of the deadliest such strikes on Russian soil, with four civilian casualties reported.\n\nOn the ground: the quiet bravery\n\nIn Dnipro, near where the river widens and the city’s Soviet-era apartment blocks stand shoulder to shoulder, life has folded into a new rhythm. Cafés that once served late coffee now hand out water and bandages. A bricklayer named Oleksandr, who spent the night hauling debris with neighbors, shrugged and said, “We have no choice. We clean up, we bury what’s broken, we cook for those whose homes were hit. This is what people do.”\n\nOlena, who runs a tiny bakery on the corner of a street pocked by shrapnel, kept bringing out loaves to volunteers in reflective vests. “My oven keeps working,” she said, “so I will keep baking. The smell of bread comforts the hurt.”\n\nThere are practical, wrenching realities behind the statistics: hospitals filling with the wounded, power lines flickering as transformers take hits, schools closing or moving underground into basements and metro stations that have become makeshift shelters.\n\nDiplomacy, danger, and the risk of spillover\n\nCompounding the threat at home are the geopolitical ripples abroad. Last week three Russian jets were accused of violating Estonian airspace — a claim Moscow denied — and Polish authorities said allied aircraft scrambled this morning after strikes neared NATO’s eastern flank. Officials say Polish and allied fighter jets were patrolling to safeguard Polish airspace as debris and drones traversed skies near the border.\n\nPresident Zelensky announced he plans to meet US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. “I will discuss security guarantees and sanctions,” Zelensky said, underscoring Kyiv’s insistence that Western-backed protection is essential to prevent future attacks.\n\n“If Western troops were to deploy in Ukraine, Moscow has warned they would become legitimate targets,” noted Dr. Kowalczyk. “That is the grim chessboard — every move shifts thresholds for action and danger.”\n\nWeapons, law, and moral lines\n\nOne detail that has provoked particular alarm is the reported use of a missile with cluster munitions in a residential area. Cluster munitions are banned under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, a treaty signed by more than 100 countries; their use has devastating long-term effects, scattering bomblets that can maim civilians months and years after conflict subsides.\n\n“Those are weapons designed to terrorize populations,” said Mariana Petrova, a humanitarian aid coordinator working with displaced families in central Ukraine. “Even if a cluster munition hits a field, children could find remnants later. The human cost echoes.”\n\nWhat the world should feel — and do\n\nThere are numbers and tidings to digest, but what should stay with us is human. A mother in Kyiv clutching her sleeping child, a café owner kneading dough at dawn, a volunteer directing traffic around rubble. These are faces behind the facts.\n\nSo ask yourself: how do we, as distant observers or policymakers, respond to a conflict that is increasingly technological and intimate at once? Do we accept drone swarms as the new normal or marshal coordinated action — humanitarian corridors, tighter export controls on drone components, stronger air-defence aid to cities under threat?\n\nFor Ukrainians, the calculus is simple and immediate: survive the night, clear the glass, tend the wounded, preserve some small measure of normalcy. For the rest of the world, the question is whether we will treat this as a distant headline or a test of collective responsibility.\n\nAs smoke still curled into the morning, Zelensky’s words cut through the ash: “All night, Ukraine was under a massive attack. Every such strike is not a military necessity but a deliberate strategy to terrorize civilians.” If that is the strategy, then the counter-strategy must be equally human: solidarity, diplomacy, and pragmatic steps to blunt the tools of terror.\n\nAnd in the months to come, when we read of raids and counterstrikes and diplomatic posturing at international gatherings, perhaps we will also remember the smell of fresh bread in a bakery on a shattered street — and the people who, despite everything, keep baking.","summary":"Night of Wings and Fire: How a New Wave of Drone Swarms Tore Through Ukraine’s Quiet By the time dawn bled pale over the Dnipro River, neighborhoods that had been humming with life the evening before were ringing with a different soundtrack — the relentless whine of propellers, the staccato rattle of air-defence batteries, the [&#8230;]","url":"https://jowhar.com/russian-air-attack-on-ukraine-leaves-three-people-dead/","image":"https://jowhar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Russian-air-attack-on-Ukraine-leaves-three-people-dead.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:17:59","author":"hanad","authors":["hanad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"so","sentiment":0.037},{"id":362165766,"title":"Republicans warn PM of 'punitive measures' over Palestinian recognition","text":"A group of US Republicans have warned Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his allies of \"punitive measures\" if they move ahead with plans to recognise a Palestinian state. \n\nIn an open letter, Republican representatives urged Australia, France, Canada and the United Kingdom \"to reverse course\" to recognise Palestinian statehood at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. \n\nThe letter, signed by 25 members of the House and the Senate, said the \"reckless policy … would empower Hamas, endanger Israel’s security, and eliminate a path to a negotiated peace\". \n\n\"International leaders will convene at the UN General Assembly in New York, and we will be watching if close allies like France and Canada and the UK move ahead with plans to recognise a Palestinian state.\"\n\nRepublicans warn Western allies\n\nThe letter — addressed to Mr Albanese, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer — had 25 Republican signatures and President Donald Trump cc'd in. \n\nIt warned the recognition would increase antisemitism in Australia and promote violence. \n\n\"Hamas's war crimes are clear, and its rejection of diplomacy should lead your countries to impose more pressure.

The move comes despite pressure from the US and the families of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nStarmer said in July he would recognise Palestine before the gathering of world leaders at the UN general assembly next week if the situation did not improve.\n\nAlongside the continued military offensive and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the UK government is alarmed at plans to accelerate Israeli settlements in the West Bank which ministers fear will end any hope of a two-state solution.\n\nLabour has sought to stress that recognition of a Palestinian state is not a reward for Hamas, and emphasised that it would have no role in the future governance of Gaza. It is expected the government will ratchet up sanctions on Hamas in due course, and it has stepped up demands for the release of hostages.\n David Lammy, the deputy prime minister who will represent the UK at the general assembly, said: “It’s important to state that the recognition of a Palestinian state, it is a consequence of the serious expansion that we’re seeing in the West Bank, the settler violence that we’re seeing in the West Bank and the intention and indications that we’re seeing to build, for example, the E1 development that would run a coach and horses through the possibility of a two-state solution.”\n\nIsrael has ramped up its offensive on Gaza City, including with strikes that health officials said on Saturday killed at least 14 people overnight. Later in Israel, thousands of demonstrators joined the families of hostages still being held by Hamas to demand that Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, negotiate an end to the war.\n\nHigh-level meetings at the UN summit involving world leaders begin on 23 September. Starmer has found himself at odds with Donald Trump’s administration over the move, which is opposed to giving official recognition to the state.\n\nThe Labour leader previously suggested British recognition was conditional and he would refrain if Israel committed to a ceasefire and long-term sustainable peace that delivers a two-state solution, and allow the UN to restart the supply of aid.\n\nAll three conditions are however unlikely to be met given the Israeli government opposes these terms. The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.\n\nFamily members of some of the 48 hostages still in captivity have written an open letter to Starmer condemning the move.\n\nThe letter said: “Your regrettable announcement of the UK’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations general assembly has dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones.\n\n“Hamas has already celebrated the UK’s decision as a victory and reneged on a ceasefire deal. We write to you with a simple plea – do not take this step until our loved ones are home and in our arms.”\n\nCriticism also came from opposition parties, with the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, accusing Starmer of “capitulating” to his backbenchers to shore up his leadership.\n\nLammy added: “In relation to what is happening in Gaza … we’ve got to see the hostages out. There can be no place, no place at all for Hamas.\n\n“The humanitarian situation is just desperate and we have continued to press Israel to deal with the scenes of malnourishment and starvation that we’re seeing, to open up more sites to get more aid in to Gaza, and we are very concerned about this continued offensive into Gaza City.”","summary":"Keir Starmer expected to confirm move after concluding the situation has worsened significantly in recent weeks\n\nThe UK is expected to recognise a Palestinian state on Sunday after Israel failed to meet the conditions set out by Keir Starmer in July.\n\nThe prime minister is to make the announcement after concluding the humanitarian situation has deteriorated significantly in the past few weeks. The move comes despite pressure from the US and the families of hostages held by Hamas.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/20/uk-to-recognise-palestinian-state-despite-pressure-from-us-and-families-of-hostages","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9dce38129da3456be86294705188293a36130b/1178_14_5009_4008/master/5009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:13:23","author":"Nadeem Badshah","authors":["Nadeem Badshah"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":362158722,"title":"Prosecutor threatens Gavin Newsom with Secret Service action after tweet predicting ‘bad day’ for Kristi Noem","text":"A federal prosecutor claims he has contacted the U.S. Secret Service because California Governor Gavin Newsom’s press office shared a post predicting DHS Secretary Kristi Noem will have a “bad day.”\n\nNewsom’s press office posted on Saturday morning that Noem “is going to have a bad day,” adding, “you’re welcome, America.” Bill Essayli, the acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, later shared the post on X and claimed he contacted the Secret Service to request a threat assessment.\n\n“We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials,” Essayli wrote. “I've referred this matter to @SecretService and requested a full threat assessment.”\n\nNewsom’s press office then re-shared its post about Noem and attached a press release announcing the governor’s plan to sign legislation that will “protect immigrant communities” and “hold Trump accountable,” suggesting that’s what the original post was referencing. \n\nWhen asked Saturday to explain why Noem will have a “bad day,” Newsom further clarified that the legislation will “run in complete contrast to what [Noem’s] asserting and what she’s pushing,” Politico reports.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Newsom’s office and the U.S. Secret Service for comment. Essayli’s office declined to comment.\n\nNewsom signed five bills on Saturday, including one that bans most law enforcement officials — including federal immigration agents — from wearing face coverings when conducting official operations, with some exceptions. \n\nThe legislation comes in direct response to the increase in immigration raids throughout California — and across the country — under President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration agenda.\n\n“The impact of these policies all across this city, our state and nation are terrifying,” Newsom said at a press conference. “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. No due process, no rights, no right in a democracy where we have rights.” \n\n“Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today,” he added.\n\nFederal officials have already pushed back, with one DHS official calling it “despicable” and warning it could put agents in danger, the Associated Press reports. \n\nEssayli also condemned the legislation, writing on X that he’s “directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations.” It’s currently unclear how exactly California will enforce the ban on federal agents.\n\n“Our agents will continue to protect their identities,” Essayli wrote. \n\nThis comes as Newsom’s press office has made headlines in recent weeks for trolling Trump and his conservative allies. The office also parodies Trump’s online writing style by sharing their own posts written in all-caps and signed off with the governor’s initials.\n\nNewsom will not be seeking re-election next year because he is term-limited. He’s set to leave office in January 2027, and many have speculated he could be preparing a bid for the White House afterward.","summary":"Newsom said he predicted Noem will have a ‘bad day’ because he signed legislation that runs ‘in complete contrast to...what she’s pushing’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-secret-service-kristi-noem-b2830590.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/20/21/46/SEI264370772.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jA2w4J0B-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-20 22:07:25","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":362156854,"title":"Thomas Skinner's wife breaks silence as friends reveal she is 'upset' and finding it 'difficult' after Strictly star's cheating scandal was revealed","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Sep 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFergie's Epstein lies exposed in bombshell email: She publicly apologised for taking abuser's cash and vowed to cut ties with him, then weeks later told him: I only said it to save book deals\n\nIs a CULT at the heart of why baby killer Constance Marten has cut her mother dead?\n\nPM's decision to recognise a state of Palestine could lead to UK paying £2trillion in reparations\n\nAt the age of 67 this is the most powerful anti-ager I've found - and it's far better than Botox: ALEXANDRA SHULMAN\n\nWhy can't I get rid of the bumpy red rash on the tops of my arms?

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:53 BST, 20 September 2025 |Updated:23:03 BST, 20 September 2025 \n\nThomas Skinner's wife Sinead has broken her silence on her husband's cheating past after the scandal hit headlines this week. \nThe Apprentice star, 34, admitted to cheating on his wife with Amy-Lucy O'Rourke just weeks after their wedding in May 2022. Claiming the 'two week fling' was a 'moment of madness' that saw him almost 'ruin his life.'\nDaily Mail revealed that communication between Thomas and Amy-Lucy began on May 13 2022 – just eight days before he married Sinead.\nAnd now a friend of Sinead has reportedly revealed how the star's wife is really feeling as they confessed she is finding it 'difficult'. \n'This has of course all been upsetting for Sinead. The attention has been difficult for her as it brings it all back but she is resilient and her family is strong, her marriage is strong,' they told The Sun on Sunday. \nThey added: 'And, as she says, she knew about this more than three years ago and they dealt with the aftermath together back then. This is old news to her, she forgave him then. \n\nThomas Skinner's wife has broken her silence as friends revealed she is 'upset' and finding it 'difficult' after the Strictly star's cheating scandal was revealed\n\nThe Apprentice star, 34, admitted to cheating on his wife with Amy-Lucy O'Rourke just weeks after their wedding in May 2022\n'What people probably don’t realise is that Sinead is an incredibly strong woman. Tom has described her as his rock and it is so true, she is.' \nDaily Mail has contacted Thomas's representatives for comment. \nThomas admitted to his infidelity in an interview, tearfully stating: ‘The best advice I can give anyone is to be honest and own up.\n'Because we are in an incredible place now. We are strong. It’s forgotten about.’\n However 'secret mistress' Amy-Lucy later suggested in an interview with the Daily Mail that their secret relationship lasted three months, during which time he said he was in love with her and unhappy with his wife. \nAmy-Lucy had also insisted she wasn't a 'homewrecker' after being targeted by trolls. \nTaking to her Instagram Stories, the aesthetician said: 'I just wanted to come on and say thank you to everyone for sending me really nice messages.'\n'Obviously I've had a few trolls, but their opinions are clearly not important, because the masses can see through his lies.'\n\nA friend of Sinead said: 'This has of course all been upsetting for Sinead. The attention has been difficult for her as it brings it all back but she is resilient and her family is strong, her marriage is strong'\n\nDuring Saturday's launch episode it was revealed Thomas will be taking to the floor with Amy Dowden as the pair beamed together \n\nSpeaking to Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman he admitted he feels like the 'underdog' of the competition: 'I am buzzing to be here, what an opportunity' \n\nAmy-Lucy went on to insist that she hasn't revealed the affair for money or for 15 minutes of fame but instead to make clear how badly she feels she has been treated.\n'No-one knows the full story, the story's massive the story is insane. I've had to give recipes I've had to show text messages, phone calls, voice notes, CCTV. There's message with me saying \"I cant believe you've done this to me\" I've proved it.'\nBefore adding: 'It's not about money it's about speaking my truth and about what Thomas put me though.'\nDuring Saturday's launch episode it was revealed Thomas will be taking to the floor with Amy Dowden as the professional dancer makes her return to the dancefloor following her battle with breast cancer. \nThe Welsh dancer, 35, was partnered with JB Gill during last year's series, however she sadly had to withdraw from the competition due to injury. \nThomas gave a shoutout to his three children and wife in his introduction video as he revealed they will be watching every week's show at home. \nSpeaking to Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman he admitted he feels like the 'underdog' of the competition: 'I am buzzing to be here, what an opportunity.\n'I do feel like the underdog, as the only dancing I have done is at wedding's after a couple of beers. But I will give it my best and I will learn.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThomas Skinner's wife breaks silence as friends reveal she is 'upset' and finding it 'difficult' after Strictly star's cheating scandal was revealed\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 13\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that $300 billion \"could be conservative,\" though others list the valuation somewhere in between from $20 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump said that the United States would get a \"tremendous fee\" for its part in brokering the deal.\n\n\"The people that are investing in it are among the greatest investors in the world - the biggest, the richest and they'll do a great job,\" Trump said at a joint news conference Thursday in England with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. \"We're doing it in conjunction with China, but the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus - I call it a fee-plus -- just for making the deal and I don't want to throw that out the window.\"\n\nIn the arrangement, China's ByteDance will hold less than 20% with the new investor group, which includes Oracle Corp., Andreessen Horowitz and the private equity firm Silver Lake Management LLC.\n\nOracle, which is a multinational technology company headquartered in Austin, Texas, will serve as TikTok's security provider and monitor the app for safety, working with the U.S. government. Data of American users will be stored in the U.S. with no access by China, Leavitt said.\n\n\"The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,\" Leavitt said.\n\nLarry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, became the world's richest person on Sept. 10, but Elon Musk was back on top at the end of the trading day, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

The proclamation imposes a $100,000 fee for new H-1B petitions, sparking fears that it would broadly impact tech talent already in the United States. White House officials stressed that these claims are “deliberate distortions” by lobbying groups and firms benefiting from low-wage outsourcing. The administration clarified that the fee is limited to fresh applications and does not affect renewals, travel, or currently employed visa holders. “This isn’t about punishing success stories already here; it’s about ensuring new entries bring real firepower,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated during Friday’s briefing (White House Press Office). The move aims to prioritize skilled labor while discouraging exploitation of foreign talent for cheap labour. Fee Details Demystified – One-Time Hit, No Recurring Pain Officials explained that the $100,000 levy is a one-time charge, applicable only to the next H-1B lottery cycle beginning February 2026. Companies that secured visas in 2025 are exempt, as are renewals. Immigration attorneys have largely welcomed the carve-outs, noting that while it increases costs for employers, it avoids disruption for existing workers. “Clients are relieved—it's not the apocalypse some headlines screamed,” one New York-based immigration lawyer told Reuters. The proclamation also includes a broader goal of funding STEM programs within the US, a point emphasised in internal White House memos leaked to The Hill. By reallocating revenue from new visa petitions, the administration seeks to bolster domestic technical training and workforce development. Broader Ripples and Pushback – What Lies Ahead for Tech Talent? Industry reactions remain mixed. Tech giants like Google and Meta may recalibrate hiring strategies, while the US Chamber of Commerce warned the fee could create “immediate talent shortages” (Statement, Suzanne Clark, CEO). Meanwhile, bipartisan lawmakers, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), have endorsed similar measures to protect domestic workers. The White House maintains that existing visa holders need not worry, but newcomers should prepare for a pricier route to the US workforce.

That probe is tied to the bureau's prior investigation of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn the probes against both officials, Siebert had previously told officials that he did not believe the evidence was strong enough to bring charges, the sources told Reuters.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nGet the key points from this story with Reuters AI\n\nCleary recently served as a deputy commonwealth attorney in Culpeper County, Virginia, according to her biography on the University of Virginia's Law School page where she is listed as a lecturer. She previously worked briefly as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia.\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, she returned to the Justice Department earlier this month where she has served as senior counsel in the Criminal Division.\n\nCleary later penned an article in \"The Spectator World\" in which she said she was framed by a person who said she was among Trump supporters in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn the article, Cleary said she was falsely identified as having been on the Capitol grounds that day, and was briefly investigated by the Justice Department. Within a few hours, she was cleared to return to work. Although she was never prosecuted, Cleary wrote in the article that she was targeted politically and she now feels emboldened to share her story since Trump is president again.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV2049621718 \nAbout ConnatixV2049621718 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\nReporting by Sarah N.

Joe and I love kids, and that's definitely something that we would absolutely love. I haven't really thought about how many I would like.
