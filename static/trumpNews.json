In the end the president is going to make that judgment.\" This comes after a White House source has made a bombshell claim. The source, who is familiar with the trade talks, told Politico that the tariff threats and the talks surrounding them are \"all fake\" and only a \"theatrical show.\" The US President initially aimed to engage in bilateral tariff rate discussions, but was met with stalled progress with key allies such as Japan and the European Union. So far, Trump has secured only two trade deals - one with Britain, maintaining a 10 per cent tariff with carve-outs for autos and aerospace, and another with Vietnam, which slashed tariffs on Vietnamese goods to 20 per cent and eliminated duties on several US products.

These communications, described by Trump as \"take it or leave it\" offers, may trigger steep tariff hikes of up to 70 per cent on selected imports effective August 1. Speaking aboard Air Force One en route to New Jersey, Trump told journalists, \"I signed some letters and they'll go out on Monday, probably twelve. Different amounts of money, different amounts of tariffs.\" Also Read: Trump's Tariff Deadlines Are Not Real, Only A 'Theatrical Show': White House Insider Make Sensational Claim This move follows Trump's April announcement of a baseline 10 per cent tariff on most imports, with higher duties up to 50 per cent for countries deemed to have unfair trade practices. That decision was temporarily paused for 90 days — a window that ends on July 9 — to allow for bilateral talks.

The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds!”\nHailing his party, the US President wrote, “Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running “machine,” that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country.”\n“It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time. I have been strongly opposed to that from the very beginning,” Trump mentioned.\n“People are now allowed to buy whatever they want – Gasoline Powered, Hybrids (which are doing very well), or New Technologies as they come about – No more EV Mandate. I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate – It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had.”\n“He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!” Trump mentioned.\n“Additionally, Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before. Elon probably was, also.”\n“I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life. My Number One charge is to protect the American Public!” the US President wrote. \n\nAlso speaking to reporters, and responding to a question on Musk announcing a new party, Trump said, “I think it’s ridiculous to start a third party. We have a tremendous success with the Republican Party, the Democrats have lost their way but it has always been a two party system.”\n“And I think starting a third party just adds to the confusion, third parties have never worked. So, he can have fun with it, but I think it is ridiculous,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, as he returned to Washington upon visiting his nearby golf club.\nOn Saturday, Musk announced that he is establishing the ‘America Party’ in response to Trump’s tax cut and spending bill, which Musk said would bankrupt the country.\nMusk said his new party would in next year’s midterm elections look to unseat Republican lawmakers in Congress who backed the sweeping measure known as the “big, beautiful bill.”\nMusk spent millions of dollars underwriting Trump’s 2024 re-election effort and, for a time, regularly showed up at the president’s side in the White House Oval Office and elsewhere.\nTheir disagreement over the spending bill led to a falling out that Musk briefly tried unsuccessfully to repair.\nTrump has said Musk is unhappy because the measure, which Trump signed into law on Friday, takes away green-energy credits for Tesla’s electric vehicles.\nThe President has threatened to pull billions of dollars that Tesla and SpaceX receive in government contracts and subsidies in response to Musk’s criticism.","summary":"Donald Trump has slammed Elon Musk’s formation of a new political party, calling it \"ridiculous\" and saying third parties only create confusion.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/donald-trump-slams-elon-musk-america-party-train-wreck-off-the-rails-us-president-musk-party-ridiculous-9424771.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/MixCollage-07-Jul-2025-06-33-AM-1262-2025-07-a98d1db5f8d89bba2c0b3911ec39d7ac.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 01:19:06","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":338927102,"title":"As Texas reels under floods, Shakira donates San Antonio concert proceeds to relief fund for affected families","text":"APColombian singer Shakira announced she will donate proceeds from her San Antonio concert to Catholic Charities of San Antonio to support disaster relief for affected families.\n\nAs Texas continues to reel from deadly flash floods, Colombian singer Shakira announced she will donate proceeds from her San Antonio concert to Catholic Charities of San Antonio to support disaster relief for affected families.

I say I'm not retired because if something special came up, I'd go back, but otherwise, no,' he said before later joking about the only role he is 'happy' to play nowadays.\n\nMichael Douglas said that he had 'no real intentions' of acting again and explained why he has been on an indefinite hiatus\n\nHe said that he is 'happy to play the wife' to his wife of nearly 25 years, Catherine Zeta-Jones, 'in the spirit of maintaining a good marriage.' \nThe actor is widely recognized for his iconic portrayal of Gordon Gekko in the 1987 film Wall Street, for which he also won an Academy Award.\nDouglas said that he has 'one little independent movie' he is currently working on trying to 'get a good script out of' but otherwise has no projects going on in Hollywood. \nDouglas was in attendance at the film festival to introduce the screening of a newly restored version of Miloš Forman's 1975 classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starring Jack Nicholson. \nDuring his introduction, he was surprised with a Crystal Globe statuette from the festival's executive director. \nBack in May, Douglas told Deadline that he was 'enjoying' his break from acting as he continued to focus on his personal life as well as producing movies. \nHe founded an indie production company Further Films in 1997. \n'It was overwhelming running the production company and acting at the same time,' he told the outlet earlier this year. \n\nHe explained that he wanted to enjoy time off after his decades-spanning career.The actor is widely recognized for his iconic portrayal of Gordon Gekko in the 1987 film Wall Street, for which he also won an Academy Award\n\nHe later emphasized that he does not consider himself officially retired because he would be open to returning to Hollywood if the right opportunity came along; pictured Juen in Taormina\n\nHe said that he is 'happy to play the wife' to his wife of nearly 25 years, Catherine Zeta-Jones, 'in the spirit of maintaining a good marriage; pictured December 2024 in Jeddah\n\n Catherine Zeta-Jones fans are saying the same thing about her daughter \nWhen asked about his potential return to the screen, he said: 'If something good comes up that I really like.

I still love bringing people together.' \nMeanwhile, his 24-year-old son Dylan Douglas is set to make his acting debut in the upcoming thriller I Will Come to You, Variety reported in March. \nDouglas shares Dylan along with his 22-year-old daughter Carys with Zeta-Jones, whom he married in 2000. \nHe is also father to son Cameron Douglas, 46, whom he shares with his ex-wife Diandra Luker. \nMichael DouglasCatherine Zeta Jones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMichael Douglas, 80, explains why he has 'no real intentions' of acting ever again\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicenter of the flooding, among them 28 children. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing. President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added. \"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,\" he told reporters as he left New Jersey. Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counselor were still missing, according to Leitha.Live Events \"It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,\" said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing. The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County. \"You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,\" said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday. Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 85 miles (140 km) northwest of San Antonio. Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of \"an additional wall of water\" flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday's rains. \"We're evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,\" he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. U.S. Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts. SCALING BACK FEDERAL DISASTER RESPONSE Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government's role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves. Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm. Trump's administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service's parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said. Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency's ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts. Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump's oversight. \"That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,\" he said referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. \"But I wouldn't blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.\" He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only \"They're busy working, so we'll leave it at that,\" Trump said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a \"moderate\" flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system. Joaquin Castro, a Democratic U.S. congressman from Texas, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous. \"When you have flash flooding, there's a risk that if you don't have the personnel ... to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,\" Castro said. 'COMPLETE DEVASTATION' Katharine Somerville, a counselor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night. \"Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y'all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,\" Somerville said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday. Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe. The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as 29 feet (9 meters). A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83 m) from the floor. Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, one had a missing wall.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTexas floodsTexas floods newsTexas floods latest newstrumpTexas floods causeTexas floods reasonTexas newsTexas latest news\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Concerns are rising about potential further flooding and the impact of federal workforce cuts on accurate weather predictions.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/death-toll-from-texas-floods-reaches-78-trump-plans-visit/articleshow/122286824.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-122286829,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-304554,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 01:13:40","author":"Martin Shwenk Leade","authors":["Martin Shwenk Leade"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":338926146,"title":"Texas Business Owner Determined to Keep Doors Open Amid Worst Flood in Two Decades","text":"“Current live updates from the field indicate unconfirmed reports of more water coming in,” said Kidd. “As the governor mentioned, the region is still experiencing rain.”\n\n“Our DPS aircraft are currently flying to locate this wall of water. We’re advising residents in the reported areas, although these reports remain unconfirmed and are on our communication systems, to evacuate the water and clear the area to prevent further rescue operations,” he added.\n\nAdditionally, on Sunday, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha cautioned that the Guadalupe River and Johnson Creek could potentially rise by another one to two feet as the rain persists.\n\n“There was additional rain in the upper Guadalupe basin this afternoon, leading to a rise in Johnson Creek,” the sheriff’s office shared in a Facebook update. “This water may lead to a rise of 1-2ft downstream when it enters the Guadalupe river in Ingram. Please be aware if you are near the Guadalupe River or Johnson Creek.”\n\nDuring a Sunday news conference, Leitha said they have recorded 68 deaths in Kerr County.\n\n“Among those who are deceased, we have 40 adults and 28 children,” Leitha said. “18 adults are pending identification and ten children are also pending identification.”\n\n“At present there are ten Camp Mystic campers unaccounted for, and one counselor. We continue to offer our condolences to those affected, and we will work tirelessly till we reunite them with their families,” he continued.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was planning on visiting Texas, “probably on Friday.”\n\n“We want to leave a little time. I would have done it today, but we’d just be in their way. Probably Friday,” Trump said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#8220;Current live updates from the field indicate unconfirmed reports of more water&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Texas Business Owner Determined to Keep Doors Open Amid Worst Flood in Two Decades first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/texas-business-owner-determined-to-keep-doors-open-amid-worst-flood-in-two-decades/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Man-vows-to-keep-Texas-business-running-despite-worst-flood.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 01:08:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":338927098,"title":"US tariffs to kick in August 1, barring trade deals","text":"US tariffs will kick in on August 1 if trading partners from Taiwan to the European Union do not strike deals with Washington, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday. The rates will \"boomerang back\" to the sometimes very high levels that President Donald Trump had announced on April 2 -- before he suspended the levies to allow for trade talks and set a July 9 deadline for agreements, Bessent told CNN.Bessent confirmed comments by Trump to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday in which he also cited a new deadline: \"Well, I'll probably start them on August 1.\" The president told reporters Sunday he had signed about a dozen letters to inform countries of rate hikes, to be sent out on Monday. \"I think we'll have most countries done by July 9, either a letter or a deal,\" Trump told reporters Sunday, adding that some deals have already been made.Live EventsStanding at his side, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed tariffs would kick in on August 1, \"but the President is setting the rates and the deals right now.\"The tariffs were part of a broader announcement in April where Trump imposed a 10 percent duty on goods from almost all trading partners, with a plan to step up these rates for a select group within days.But he swiftly paused the hikes until July 9, allowing for trade talks to take place.Countries have been pushing to strike deals that would help them avoid these elevated duties.So far, the Trump administration has unveiled deals with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, while Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily lower staggeringly high levies on each other's products.Bessent said the administration was \"close to several deals.\"\"I would expect to see several big announcements over the next couple of days,\" he said.But he would not say which countries he was referring to, adding: \"I don't want to let them off the hook.\"'Maximum pressure' playbookAboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said sending notices would be much easier than \"sitting down and working 15 different things... this is what you have to pay, if you want to do business (with) the United States.\"Bessent pushed back at CNN host Dana Bash's assertion the administration was using threats rather than negotiations, and denied that Trump was setting a new deadline with the August 1 date.\"It's not a new deadline. We are saying, this is when it's happening. If you want to speed things up, have at it. If you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,\" he said.He said the playbook was to apply \"maximum pressure\" and cited the European Union as an example, saying they are \"making very good progress\" after a slow start.EU and US negotiators are holding talks over the weekend, and France's finance minister said Saturday he hoped they could strike a deal this weekend.Other countries were still expressing unease, however.Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Sunday he \"won't easily compromise\" in trade talks with Washington.And BRICS leaders of fast-growing economies meeting in Rio de Janeiro raised \"serious concerns\" that the \"indiscriminate\" import tariffs were illegal and risked hurting global trade.When probed about worries that steep levies could feed into broader US inflation, Bessent said there was a difference between \"inflation and one-time price adjustments.\"\"Inflation is a generalized monetary phenomenon. We're not going to see that. And thus far, we haven't even seen the one-time price adjustments,\" Bessent told Fox News Sunday.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onUS tariffsUS tariffs newsTrump administrationtrade dealsAugust 1 deadlineEU trade negotiationsScott Bessent\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy MELODY FLETCHER \n Published:01:54 BST, 7 July 2025 |Updated:02:03 BST, 7 July 2025 \n\nOzzy Osbourne's pals have lifted the lid on his future plans, saying he won't stop making music as it's 'in his DNA'.\nThe rocker has been on the music scene for decades, and it doesn't look like he will be quitting anytime soon.\nThe husband of Sharon Osbourne, 76, performed his final gig at Birmingham's Villa Park this weekend - but his nearest and dearest say the Black Sabbath frontman has told friends he still sees a future for himself in the music industry.\nDespite having neck and back issues and Parkinson's, Ozzy can't see himself quitting after what happened to his late father when he retired.\nOne of Ozzy's closest friends says he 'always thinks about his dad when it comes to retirement' because his father died just a few days after giving up work.\n\nOzzy Osbourne 's pals have lifted the lid on his future plans, saying he won't stop making music as it's 'in his DNA' (pictured at his final performance at Villa Park on Saturday)\n\nThe rocker has been on the music scene for decades, and it doesn't look like he will be quitting anytime soon\n'I would not be surprised if, knowing Ozzy, he would do something around a stage to promote that,' the friend told The Mirror.\n'Oz has made it clear many many times that he doesn't want to simply retire and stop making music or feeling the love from live audiences.\n'He feels that he will wither away and pass if he stops altogether. His biggest worry - and he has said this often - is that the same thing happens to him as his father. That haunts him.'\nThey claimed 'working is what keeps Ozzy going' and 'it's in his DNA'.\nOzzy closed out his final ever live performance with some emotional words at Birmingham's Villa Park Stadium on Saturday night.\nHe reunited with his Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward for their first performance in their original line-up since 2005 - and their final ever show as a band.\nOzzy has spoken openly about his health in recent years after undergoing seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal operation in 2023.\nAnd the heavy metal singer had some poignant words for Villa Park as he brought the show to an emotional close in his hometown, Birmingham - where Black Sabbath formed some 56 years ago. \n\nDespite having neck, back and Parkinson's issues, Ozzy can't see himself quitting after what happened to his late father when he retired\n\nClosing the band's final gig, Ozzy said: 'It's the last song ever. Your support has enabled us to live an amazing lifestyle, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.'\nA message on screen then read: 'Thank you for everything, you guys are f***ing amazing. Birmingham Forever,' before the sky lit up with fireworks.\nThe band's final performance was overwhelming for frontman Ozzy, who repeatedly thanked fans for their ongoing support over his five decades in the music industry.\nAs the 42,000-strong crowd cheered him on, Ozzy admitted at one point: 'You have no idea how I feel.'\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOzzy Osbourne's pals share heartbreaking reason Black Sabbath rocker, 76, 'won't stop making music' after he performed farewell gig\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

They demanded that all countries, especially those in the Global South, have equal access to AI technologies, data and research capacity.\n\nThe statement further called for open-source collaboration, the protection of digital sovereignty, fair competition in AI markets and safeguards for intellectual property that do not hinder technology transfer to poorer countries. The leaders highlighted the role of Brics in fighting climate change and supporting economic transitions to low-carbon growth.\n“The benefits of AI for sustainable development must be continuously promoted,” the statement said.\n“We will focus on research, development and innovation initiatives that promote and strengthen local technological capabilities and aspirations and narrow the technology gap between developed and developing countries.”\nThe Brazilian presidency said in a separate statement that the declaration had been unanimously approved by all full Brics members. Malaysia, Bolivia and Cuba, which are Brics partner countries, also backed the initiative.\nEarlier on Sunday, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva referred to the text as a “clear and unequivocal message” on the issue.\nIn a session on strengthening multilateral cooperation, Lula said that new technologies such as artificial intelligence must be governed by “a fair, inclusive and equitable governance model”.\n“The development of artificial intelligence cannot become the privilege of a few countries or an instrument of manipulation in the hands of billionaires, [but] neither is it possible to make progress without the involvement of the private sector and civil society organisations,” he said.\nThe new text comes as a broader agreement on AI involving the US, many of its allies and China remains at an impasse, even as Washington itself has pushed for separate rules on how militaries should use AI.\nIn February, leaders from more than 100 countries gathered in Paris to endorse a “Statement on Inclusive and Sustainable Artificial Intelligence”, which calls for AI development to be open, transparent and safe for people and the planet.\nDespite strong support from Europe and backing from China and India, the US and Britain refused to sign, arguing the text failed to address key national security questions and risked stifling innovation with heavy-handed regulation.\nThe Paris conference followed an earlier US-led initiative aimed specifically at curbing the use of AI in military operations. Unveiled at The Hague in 2023 and supported by dozens of American allies, the “Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI” set voluntary guidelines for how states develop and deploy autonomous systems in warfare.\nChina declined to endorse that effort and pushed its own vision for AI governance through the United Nations, a resolution promoting equal access to AI technology, which passed last year with broad support, including from Washington.\nThe competing declarations underscore how fast-growing technologies like AI have become another arena for contesting influence and standard-setting between the West and China.\nEven before US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, Washington has been increasingly curbing Beijing’s access to advanced technology and pushing allies to do the same, especially in sectors like hi-tech semiconductors critical to training AI models.\nIn recent years, the US has also loudly voiced concerns about China using the technology to advance its military capabilities.","summary":"Brics leaders have adopted a new declaration calling for the United Nations to take the lead in setting global rules for artificial intelligence, arguing that the fast-growing technology must not deepen inequalities between developed and developing nations.\nThe statement, agreed late on Sunday at the summit in Rio de Janeiro, described AI as a “unique opportunity” for driving inclusive growth, innovation and sustainability but warned that without fair governance it could widen the digital...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3317167/brics-push-un-take-lead-setting-rules-artificial-intelligence","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/07/2f8573f2-0172-4177-ab69-bfdcfbdbb4bb_f306a763.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 01:01:56","author":"Igor Patrick,Khushboo Razdan","authors":["Igor Patrick","Khushboo Razdan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.077},{"id":338925986,"title":"Dua Lipa cuts a VERY stylish figure in a whopping £10K Chloe outfit which she teams with her £25K engagement ring while stepping out for dinner in Paris","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jul 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was run over by two Tube trains and had two limbs amputated after slipping off wet platform - I can never hug my children with both arms again and TFL say it's MY fault\n\nCouple whose memoir inspired hit film The Salt Path angrily deny claims their story of hope in the face of adversity may not be as 'unflinchingly honest' as initially billed\n\nRevealed: The VERY strange ailments that are netting sufferers a free, brand-new car funded by the taxpayer\n\nKENNEDY: The most vile celebrities I've ever met, including an A-list actor who called me a m*****f*****.

The slightly wider than average band gives the ring a confident, chunky feel'.\n'It's a more modern look for a classic solitaire but still retains an elegant, wearable style. The diamond could either be set in a bezel, which is a gold surround that secures the diamond without the need of claws, or a simple four claw setting'.\nAnya explained that the diamond was either a round or cushion cut and in her expertise guessed it to be two carats.\n'From what I can see, it's a beautiful, classic solitaire - a long-term favourite beloved by brides-to-be - that can easily be teamed with Dua Lipa's many styles and outfits'.\nAnya added: 'Pricing always depends on the diamond's quality, but a high quality 2 carat diamond set on a classic wide band solitaire would cost around £20,000 to £25,000 at 77 Diamonds.’\nIt comes after the hitmaker set pulses racing, as she shared a number of jaw-dropping snaps posing up a storm in several tiny bikinis during yet another sunny getaway.\nShe left her followers stunned as she flaunted her incredibly toned figure and chiselled abs in a black string two-piece with a knitted cherry detail. \n\nDua was effortlessly stylish in the £2K light pink silk midi-dress which boasted lace detailing and she layered it with a long £6K leather coat\n\nIt boasted shiny cowhide with contrast shearling trims as well as concealed horn buttons, but can only be pre-ordered on the brand's website\n\nShe topped off the enemble with a mini bracket hobo bag made of suede calfskin, snakeskin and costs another £2K\n\nDua appeared in great spirits and flashed a huge smile as well as her £25K engagement ring, following Callum Turner's romantic Christmas proposal\n\nWhile she continued to rock her giant diamond ring, after finally confirming her engagement to actor Callum last month \nWhile other striking shots saw her slipping into a minuscule leopard print bikini top that barely contained her ample assets, which she teamed with denim shorts.\n\n Dua Lipa puts on a very risqué display in a black mesh dress as she continues lavish holiday in Europe \nDua proudly displayed every inch of her enviable physique, as she enjoyed sunbathing with her pals and tucking into some fresh fruit.\nThe hitmaker also donned a sheer sparkly cover-up over the top of her swimwear in another impromptu photoshoot, and snapped a mirror selfie holding up her T-shirt to flash a racy glimpse of her striped bikini bottoms.\nCaptioning the striking photos, she wrote: 'jusss 'avin a good time' as she soaked up every second of her latest holiday.\nWhile she continued to rock her giant diamond ring, after finally confirming her engagement to actor Callum last month.\nIn an interview with Vogue, the chart-topper said: 'Yeah, we're engaged. It’s very exciting.\n'This decision to grow old together, to see a life and just, I don’t know, be best friends forever - it’s a really special feeling.' \n\nIt comes after the hitmaker set pulses racing, as she shared a number of jaw-dropping snaps posing up a storm in several tiny bikinis during yet another sunny getaway\n\nShe left her followers stunned as she flaunted her incredibly toned figure and chiselled abs in a black string two-piece with a knitted cherry detail \nThough she admitted she never saw herself as the marrying type, explaining: 'I've never been someone who's really thought about a wedding, or dreamt about what kind of bride I would be.'\nWhile Dua also opened up on her family plans, revealing she's concerned about how having children will fit in with her career as a pop star.\nShe said: 'I'd love to have kids one day. But it's like the constant question of when would there ever be a good time – how it would fit in with my job and how it would work if I went on tour, and how much time out I'd have to take.\n'I think it's just one of those things that's going to happen when it happens. I love kids, but I think there's so much more to raising a child than just loving children.'\nParisDua Lipa\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDua Lipa cuts a VERY stylish figure in a whopping £10K Chloe outfit which she teams with her £25K engagement ring while stepping out for dinner in Paris\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

As he was leaving Israel for the US, Netanyahu said he was still committed to what he described as three missions: \"The release and return of all the hostages, the living and the fallen; the destruction of Hamas's capabilities - to kick it out of there, and to ensure that Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel.\"\n\nQatari and Egyptian mediators will have their work cut out during the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in trying to overcome these sticking points, which have have derailed other initiatives since the previous ceasefire ended in March.\n\nIsrael has since resumed its offensive against Hamas with great intensity, as well as imposing an eleven-week blockade on aid entering Gaza, which was partially lifted several weeks ago.\n\nThe Israeli government says these measures have been aimed at further weakening Hamas and forcing it to negotiate and free the hostages.\n\nJust in the past 24 hours, the Israeli military says it struck 130 Hamas targets and killed a number of militants.\n\nBut the cost in civilian lives in Gaza continues to grow as well. Hospital officials in Gaza said more than 30 people were killed on Sunday.\n\nThe question now is not only whether the talks in Qatar can achieve a compromise acceptable to both sides - but also whether Trump can persuade Netanyahu that the war must come to an end at their meeting on Monday.\n\nMany in Israel already believe that is a price worth paying to save the remaining hostages.\n\nOnce again, they came out on to the streets on Saturday evening, calling on Netanyahu to reach a deal so the hostages can finally be freed.\n\nBut there are hardline voices in Netanyahu's cabinet, including the national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir and the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who have once again expressed their fierce opposition to ending the war in Gaza before Hamas has been completely eliminated.\n\nOnce again, there is the appearance of real momentum towards a ceasefire deal, but uncertainty over whether either the Israeli government or Hamas is ready to reach an agreement that might fall short of the key conditions they have so far set.\n\nAnd once again, Palestinians in Gaza and the families of Israeli hostages still held there are fervently hoping this will not be another false dawn.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 57,338 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","summary":"The latest round of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas have ended without a breakthrough, a Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told the BBC.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/first-round-of-gaza-ceasefire-talks-ends-without-breakthrough/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-400.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:55:34","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 55am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 55am"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":338926262,"title":"President Trump gives bungled response when asked about when tariffs will return after 90-day pause","text":"President Donald Trump offered a bungled response when asked about when tariff rates are going to return to April levels, with the 90-day pause on most levies set to end next week.\n\nA week after implementing his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, which sent the stock market tumbling, the president announced a pause to his plan, delaying the “reciprocal” levies from taking effect for 90 days. That pause is set to expire on Wednesday, July 9. \n\nSpeaking at Morristown Municipal Airport on Sunday evening, a reporter asked Trump to clarify when the tariff rates are set to resume: “Mr. President, do the tariff rates change at all on July 9 or do they change on August 1?”\n\nPerhaps not hearing clearly over the roar of Air Force One nearby, Trump leaned in and asked the reporter to repeat her question. He then didn’t answer the question at all.\n\n“They're going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs. I think we'll have most countries done by July 9. Either a letter or a deal,” he said.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick then stepped in: “But they go into effect August 1. Tariffs go into effect August 1.” Lutnick added: “But the president is setting the rates and the deals right now.”\n\nEarlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries “where we don’t have very much trade,” many of which are “already at the baseline 10 percent” rate. \n\n\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.

Musk has positioned the America Party as an alternative to what he called the “Republican/Democrat Uniparty,” accusing both major factions of mismanaging the country’s finances and stifling voter choice.\n\n“Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question, but the focus for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate,” Musk wrote on X on Sunday, outlining his short-term priority to target the US midterm elections in November 2026, when 33 of the 100 Senate seats and all 435 House seats will be up for grabs.\n\n“The way we’re going to crack the uniparty system is by using a variant of how Epaminondas shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility at Leuctra: extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield,” Musk previously stated in another post.\n\nMusk also doubled down on his criticism of President Donald Trump’s fiscal policy, questioning the value of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a temporary agency Trump appointed him to lead.\n\n“What the heck was the point of @DOGE if he’s just going to increase the debt by $5 trillion??” Musk wrote.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social earlier on Sunday, Trump criticized Musk for what he described as erratic behavior in recent weeks, calling the entrepreneur a “train wreck” and accusing him of promoting “disruption and chaos” that undermines the stability of the American political system.\n\n“I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump wrote. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – the system seems not designed for them.”\n\nMusk, who supported Trump during his return to the White House last year, stepped down from his role in DOGE last month after clashing with the administration over a sweeping tax and spending package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill.” The legislation, signed into law on July 4, includes trillions of dollars in new expenditures, cuts to social programs, and a sharp increase to the federal debt ceiling.","summary":"The billionaire says his America Party initiative will focus on Congress ahead of 2026, but may back a presidential candidate on 2028 \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/621108-musk-third-party-plan/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/686b1a4285f5405c4c166964.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:53:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":338927480,"title":"Trump says is saddened to watch Musk go `off the rails’ with plans to create a third party","text":"WASHINGTON, July 7. /TASS/.

confusion, oil skids","text":"Stock markets have slipped in Asia amid much confusion as US officials flagged a delay on tariffs but failed to provide any detail or paperwork on the change, while oil prices slid as OPEC+ opened the supply spigots more than expected.\n\nThe United States is close to finalising several trade agreements in the coming days and will notify other countries of higher tariff rates by July 9, President Donald Trump said on Sunday, with the higher rates to take effect on August 1.\n\n\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1 you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN.\n\nTrump in April announced a 10 per cent base tariff rate on most countries and higher \"reciprocal\" rates ranging up to 50 per cent, with an original deadline of this Wednesday.\n\nHowever, Trump also said levies could range in value from \"maybe 60 per cent or 70 per cent tariffs to 10 per cent and 20 per cent\", further clouding the picture.\n\nWith very few actual trade deals done, analysts had suspected the date would be pushed out, though it was still not clear if the new deadline applied to all trading partners or just some.\n\n\"This renewed escalation in trade tensions comes at a time when major trade partners, including the EU, India and Japan, are believed to be at crucial stages of bilateral negotiations,\" analysts at ANZ said in a note.\n\n\"If reciprocal tariffs are implemented in their original form or even expanded, we believe it will intensify downside risks to US growth and increase upside risks to inflation.\"\n\nInvestors have grown somewhat used to the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and the initial market reaction was cautious. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures both eased 0.3 per cent.\n\nJapan's Nikkei lost 0.3 per cent, while South Korean stocks fell 0.7 per cent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 per cent.\n\nSafe-haven bonds were better bid, with 10-year Treasury yields down almost two basis points at 4.326 per cent.\n\nMajor currencies were little changed as the dollar index continued to languish near four-year lows at 96.913. The euro held at $US1.1787, just off last week's top of $US1.1830, while the dollar dipped to 144.38 yen.\n\nThe dollar has been undermined by investor concerns about Trump's often chaotic tariff policy and what that might do to economic growth and inflation. The same worries have kept the Federal Reserve from cutting rates and minutes of its last meeting should offer more colour on when the majority of members might resume easing.\n\nIt is a relatively quiet week for Fed speakers with only two district presidents on the docket, while economic data is also sparse. The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to cut its rates by a quarter point to 3.60 per cent at a meeting on Tuesday, the third easing this cycle, and markets imply an eventual destination for rates of 2.85 per cent or 3.10 per cent.\n\nNew Zealand's central bank meets on Wednesday and is likely to hold rates at 3.25 per cent, having already slashed by 225 basis points over the past year.\n\nIn commodity markets, gold slipped 0.3 per cent to $US3,324 an ounce , though it did gain almost two per cent last week as the dollar fell.\n\nOil prices slid anew after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, agreed on Saturday to raise production by a larger-than-expected 548,000 barrels per day in August.\n\nThe group also warned that it could hike by a similar amount in September, leaving analysts with the impression it was trying to squeeze lower margin producers and particularly those pulling oil from US shale.\n\nBrent dropped 52 cents to $US67.78 a barrel, while US crude fell $US1.01 to $US65.99 per barrel.","summary":"Stocks have lost ground in Asia as US officials flagged a delay on tariffs, while OPEC agreeing to increase production has led oil prices to slide.","url":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/business/markets/asian-stocks-slip-amid-us-tariff-confusion-oil-skids-c-19273020","image":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-19273020/7693396729b03d4729d83927ab1567c1af99f20e-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:39:54","author":"Wayne Cole,Wayne Colereuters","authors":["Wayne Cole","Wayne Colereuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":338921944,"title":"Scarlett Johansson becomes highest-grossing lead actor EVER after Jurassic Park Rebirth opens with $318M","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jul 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was run over by two Tube trains and had two limbs amputated after slipping off wet platform - I can never hug my children with both arms again and TFL say it's MY fault\n\nCouple whose memoir inspired hit film The Salt Path angrily deny claims their story of hope in the face of adversity may not be as 'unflinchingly honest' as initially billed\n\nRevealed: The VERY strange ailments that are netting sufferers a free, brand-new car funded by the taxpayer\n\nKENNEDY: The most vile celebrities I've ever met, including an A-list actor who called me a m*****f*****.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BRIAN GALLAGHER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:34 BST, 7 July 2025 |Updated:01:35 BST, 7 July 2025 \n\nScarlett Johansson just passed her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. as the highest-grossing lead actor ever.\nThe 40-year-old actress accomplished this impressive feat over the 4th of July holiday weekend, with the monstrous debut of her new film Jurassic Park Rebirth.\nThe seventh installment of the Jurassic Park franchise took in a whopping $147.3 million at the domestic box office since opening last Wednesday, and $318.3 million worldwide.\nThose figures bring Johanssen's worldwide total for leading roles up to $14.61 billion, just surpassing Samuel L. Jackson ($14.60 billion) and Robert Downey Jr. ($14.3 billion), according to The Numbers. \nWhat's perhaps even more impressive than that is Johansson managed to surpass her MCU peers in just 36 movies with leading roles, compared to Jackson's 71 films and Downey Jr.'s 45 films, coming after recent comments about how she fought her way out of being cast in movies as a 'sex symbol.'\nShe also has her male MCU co-stars beat in in average gross for her movies, with Johansson's average worldwide gross at $405.9 million, far ahead of Jackson ($205.7 million) and Downey Jr. ($318.1 million).\n\nScarlett Johansson just passed her fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe co-stars Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr . as the highest-grossing lead actor ever.\n\nThe seventh installment of the Jurassic Park franchise took in a whopping $147.3 million at the domestic box office since opening last Wednesday, and $318.3 million worldwide\nHowever, both Jackson and Downey Jr. have her beat as the top stars for the domestic box office. \nJackson - who also starred in the Star Wars prequel trilogy as Mace Windu - leads the way with $5.8 billion, ahead of Downey Jr. ($5.47 billion) and Johansson ($5.41 billion).\n\n Scarlett Johansson hits out at AI after a chatbot copied her voice: 'It threatens reality' \nOf course, not all films are counted in these grosses, including Oppenheimer, which Downey Jr. won a Supporting Actor Oscar for, so its $976 million worldwide gross is not counted for his tally.\nThe tallies for each actor includes both traditional lead roles or 'lead ensemble' roles, which means all of the Marvel movies Johansson, Jackson and Downey Jr. starred in will count towards their grosses in this regard.\nWith Downey returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Doom in Avengers: Doomsday next year and in Avengers: Secret Wars in 2027, it's possible he could pass both Jackson and Johansson in the years to come.\nAs for Jurassic World Rebirth - the only new release in theaters over the long holiday weekend - it took in an estimated $91.5 million from the traditional Friday-Sunday weekend, with a domestic tally since Wednesday of $147.3 million.\nIt also took in $171 million from foreign markets for a worldwide debut of $317.8 million at the global box office.\nIt has already nearly doubled its reported budget of $180 million in one weekend, and could be making a run at the two biggest movies of the year.\n\nThe tallies for each actor includes both traditional lead roles or 'lead ensemble' roles, which means all of the Marvel movies Johansson, Jackson and Downey Jr. starred in will count towards their grosses in this regard\n\nAs for Jurassic World Rebirth - the only new release in theaters over the long holiday weekend - it took in an estimated $91.5 million from the traditional Friday-Sunday weekend, with a domestic tally since Wednesday of $147.3 million.\n\nJackson - who also starred in the Star Wars prequel trilogy as Mace Windu - leads the way with $5.8 billion, ahead of Downey Jr. ($5.47 billion) and Johansson ($5.41 billion)\n\nIt also took in $171 million from foreign markets for a worldwide debut of $317.8 million at the global box office\nThe top 5 was rounded out by Warner Bros.' F1 ($26 million, $109.5 million domestic), Universal's How to Train Your Dragon ($11 million, $224 million domestic), Disney's Elio ($5.7 million, $55 million domestic) and Sony's 28 Years Later ($4.6 million, $60.2 million domestic).\nWarner Bros.' A Minecraft Movie ($423.9 million) and Disney's Lilo & Stitch live-action remake ($408.5 million) are currently the top domestic films of 2025, though only one film has passed $1 billion this year - the Chinese-language film Ne Zha 2, which has earned a whopping $1.89 billion almost entirely from the Middle Kingdom.\nJurassic World Rebirth will be facing some very stiff competition in the coming weeks, with Warner Bros.' Superman debuting this weekend, which is currently tracking to open somewhere between $130 million and $170 million at the domestic box office.\nParamount's Smurfs and Sony's I Know What You Did Last Summer open on July 18 with Marvel/Disney's Fantastic Four: First Steps arriving on July 25. \nScarlett JohanssonRobert Downey Jr\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nScarlett Johansson becomes highest-grossing lead actor EVER after Jurassic Park Rebirth opens with $318M\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

ALISON BOSHOFF reveals all\n\nFormer Top Gear host Clarkson opened his Farmer's Dog pub last August \n\nEllen DeGeneres and her wife Portia De Rossi moved to England last year \n\nBy ALISON BOSHOFF CHIEF SHOWBUSINESS WRITER\n\nPublished: 01:26 BST, 7 July 2025 | Updated: 01:32 BST, 7 July 2025\n\nThe disastrous opening of Jeremy Clarkson's Cotswolds pub is the climax of season four of the global hit series Clarkson's Farm.\n\nAnd now locals are claiming that one of the reasons why it was such a nightmare is down to his new neighbour, US TV star Ellen DeGeneres, filling the swimming pool at her new house.\n\nAs viewers of the show may recall, mains water failed on the second day of opening at The Farmer's Dog in August 2024.\n\nBoth the pub toilets and kitchen had to close, and customers were turned away in their droves.\n\nIn an exchange seen on-screen Clarkson's plumber claimed the problem was due to villagers in the nearby hamlet of Asthall using up all the water in the mains system - not leaving any for the pub, a mile away and also up a hill.\n\nClarkson said on episode eight of the show: 'I was hoping the problem was something trivial, but the plumber quickly realised it was being caused by the village down the hill.'\n\nClarkson's plumber then explained: 'As far as I know, the water pipe comes all the way up the hill from Asthall village.\n\n'When everyone in the village is turning their water supply on, showers, filling up pots and pans and kettles, it doesn't then have the oomph to push it up the hill [to the pub].'\n\nThe opening of Jeremy Clarkson's (pictured) pub in the Cotswolds was hit by difficulties, as the new series of his Clarkson's Farm programme shows\n\nFormer US TV host Ellen DeGeneres, pictured (left) with wife Portia De Rossi, with whom she moved to the Cotswolds with last year \n\nMains water failed on the second day of opening at The Farmer's Dog last August\n\nA local from Asthall, who did not wish to be named, reveals: 'It was around the August Bank Holiday weekend [2024] that the swimming pool at the Ellen's farmhouse was being refilled.\n\n'Pools of that size filled with normal mains water can take a week to nine days to fill - sometimes even longer depending on the local mains water pressure.\n\n'If you can imagine having all the taps on to fill the pool, that has to take a lot of water out of the system and Asthall really is just a very small hamlet with a handful of houses.\n\n'Then perhaps it is no surprise that Clarkson, with all the water a business like that uses, ran out of water.'\n\nThe local believes that Ellen's 56ft-long pool was emptied, cleaned and refilled around August Bank Holiday last year for the former chat show host and her wife, actress Portia De Rossi.\n\nEllen bought a £15million farmhouse in Asthall, a hamlet with only a handful of other houses, in June of last year.\n\nShe had decided to quit her home in Montecito, California, in an apparent protest at US President Donald Trump's second election win.\n\nEllen and Portia did not move in until last October, with various building works and landscaping being done in the period in between.\n\nClarkson says in the new Clarkson's Farm series: 'I was hoping the problem was something trivial but the plumber quickly realised it was being caused by the village down the hill'\n\nCustomers are seen queuing up outside The Farmer's Dog pub as it opened last August\n\nEllen DeGeneres bought the £15million farmhouse she shares with her wife Portia De Rossi in Asthall, a hamlet with only a handful of other houses, in June of last year \n\nJeremy Clarkson reveals staggering costs of keeping Farmer's Dog pub running in 'Starmer's Britain'\n\nThe pool itself measures 56ft by 12ft, with an average depth of 6ft, which means it holds 112,896 litres of water.\n\nFilling it with mains water will have taken anywhere between seven to nine days.\n\nIt is thought that the only other pool in the village is at Asthall Manor, which is owned by the aristocrat and local Green Party district councillor Rosie Pearson.\n\nThat has a natural swimming pond and a fish pond - however, it is not thought either were being refilled at that time.\n\nEllen and Portia's move to the Cotswolds came to light after they were videoed attending a live music night at The Farmer's Dog in December.\n\nIt subsequently emerged that Ellen and Portia had fallen in love with the only other pub in Asthall, The Three Horseshoes, just a short stroll from their house.\n\nSources said they loved the Three Horseshoes so much they had a version of the pub's bar built at their own farmhouse later.\n\nIn November last year, the 43 acres of land surrounding Ellen's farmhouse was badly flooded when a tributary of the Thames, which runs through the farm, broke its banks.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi were filmed visiting The Farmer's Dog last November\n\nThe Grand Tour host bought The Windmill in Asthall near Burford for about £1million and, after renovating it, he renamed the watering hole The Farmer's Dog\n\nThey were teething problems on the pub's second day after opening - with both the toilets and kitchen having to close and customers turned away in their droves\n\nThe pub's launch features in the new, fourth series of Clarkson's Farm - a hit on Amazon Prime\n\nHollywood star Ellen DeGeneres' idyllic multi-million-pound farmhouse is hit by floods\n\nThis spring, Ellen and Portia moved again – this time to a stunning £15million modern house in a hilltop location, near Chipping Norton.\n\nBut the star and his girlfriend Lisa Hogan say they cannot bear to watch the last two episodes because it brings back the stress and trauma of those pub-opening days so vividly.\n\nThe Grand Tour host Clarkson bought The Windmill in Asthall near Burford for about £1million and, after renovating it, he renamed the watering hole The Farmer's Dog in recognition of his pets and his nearby farm, Diddly Squat.\n\nJeremy ClarksonEllen DeGeneres\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nIs Ellen DeGeneres's swimming pool behind Jeremy Clarkson's disastrous Farmer's Dog pub opening?

That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend,” Summers told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on This Week.\n\n“In my 70 years, I’ve never been as embarrassed for my country on July 4th,” he added.\n\n“These higher interest rates, these cutbacks in subsidies to electricity, these reductions in the availability of housing, the fact that hospitals are going to have to take care of these people and pass on the costs to everybody else, and that's going to mean more inflation, more risk that the Fed has to raise interest rates and run the risk of recession, more stagflation, that's the risk facing every middle-class family in our country because of this bill.\n\n“And for what? A million dollars over 10 years to the top tenth of a percent of our population? Is that the highest priority use of federal money right now? I don't think so. This is a shameful act by our Congress and by our president that is going to set our country back,” Summers continued.\n\nHe also rejected out of hand projections from Trump’s White House Council of Economic Advisers, who claimed that economic growth resulting from the tax cuts and other measures in the bill would balance out the bill’s deficit spending. This proved to be a headache for conservatives who fought to make deeper spending cuts in the legislation, but were denied.\n\n“It is, respectfully, nonsense. None of us can forecast what's going to happen to economic growth,” said Summers. “There is no economist anywhere, without a strong political agenda, who is saying that this bill is a positive for the economy. And the overwhelming view is that it is probably going to make the economy worse.”\n\nSummers’s criticism will likely be written off by the administration as coming from a former Obama appointee, but even nonpartisan forecasters continue to fret that any growth of the U.S. economy resulting from tax cuts will likely be offset by the Trump administration’s tariff policies, which are set to go back into effect this Wednesday. A 90-day pause on the president’s so-called “reciprocal” tariffs is due to end, and the president is set to send letters to numerous U.S. trade partners informing them of the new tariff rates.\n\nNegotiations with the EU and various countries are ongoing, but officials have given no indication that another pause is on the table. Markets slid sharply upon the last announcement that the president would be sharply raising tariffs.\n\nSummers is one of many economists who has called the president’s tariff strategy naive.\n\n“The question is mostly how much damage is going to be done,” he said of Trump’s tariffs in April, during a Bloomberg interview, adding that the reciprocal tariffs plan was “bizarre”.\n\nAndy Beshear, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, also trashed Trump’s megabill on Sunday during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. \n\nThe governor of a state with many rural areas, Beshear was a vocal opponent of the bill’s provisions to cut Medicaid and SNAP benefits via the imposition of work requirements, which nonpartisan analysts project will cause millions to leave the programs due to issues with paperwork, government red tape or confusion about reporting requirements.\n\nOn Sunday, Beshear delivered vicious criticism of Republicans in Congress who supported the legislation, accusing them of believing “that poor people are stupid” as the GOP attempts to deny that the bill represents a cut to Medicaid. Republican lawmakers, defending the bill’s new work requirements, have repeatedly echoed the same depiction of a Medicaid recipient at risk of losing eligibility under the new law: a young, male twenty-something living unemployed in a basement collecting government benefits, a cartoonish stereotype Democrats say simply doesn’t exist in real life.\n\n“You can lie all you want about what's in this bill.

Abboud shared details of what it has been like since the storm ravaged Central Texas and how fast the storm's destruction worked. \"I wasn't here in the wee hours of the morning when it crested or came down like a wall of water. There's a monitoring station right up on FM 1431, monitors cubic feet per second. And when it got wiped out it was at 50,000 cubic feet a second. And I think somewhere around… 23 to 25 feet high, nothing like that. I mean, you can see the debris line up in these trees, but that's how high it got up in those trees,\" Abboud pointed out.

Abboud said that some people in the area also helped rescue people from a nearby home in the area. A creek near Abboud's business now covers where the road used to be just a few days ago, which Abboud described as not a new issue for him. \"We've done it before. We've had issues with the low water crossings really still there. This is the bank side, so it (the flood) widened it,\" Abboud explained. \"This guy put this wall in here. So it kind of concentrates the water on this side. So it has always been a problem ripping this up,\" he continued. Abboud added that he was surprised the wall was even still standing. TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS SHARE HARROWING STORIES, SEARCH CONTINUES FOR THOSE STILL MISSING \"I'm surprised the wall is still there. It's been coming down in pieces over the years, and we've kind of been cleaning it out of the creek when it dries up,\" Abboud said. During a press conference, Texas officials shared that they had received \"unconfirmed reports of another wall of water\" forming. \"Another thing I'm getting right this minute during this press conference is reports of an additional wall of water coming down some of the creeks going into the forks,\" Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said. Kidd said they were \"evacuating parts of the river because we're worried about another wall of water coming down in those areas.\" TEXANS PLEDGE $500,000 TO COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY DEVASTATING FLOOD: 'WE ARE HEARTBROKEN' \"This is the live updates that we're getting right now from the field is there are unconfirmed at this point reports of additional water coming in. And as the governor mentioned, there's rain still falling on the area,\" Kidd said. \"We've got DPS aircraft that are flying up to try to find this wall of water right now, and the people in the reported areas, again, unconfirmed, that are on our communication systems. We're asking them to get out of the water and out of the way so that we don't wind up having to do additional rescues.\" On Sunday, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha also warned that the Guadalupe River and Johnson Creek could rise another one to two feet as rainfall continues in the area. \"There was additional rain in the upper Guadalupe basin this afternoon, leading to a rise in Johnson Creek,\" the sheriff's office shared in a Facebook update. \"This water may lead to a rise of 1-2ft downstream when it enters the Guadalupe river in Ingram. Please be aware if you are near the Guadalupe River or Johnson Creek.\" During a Sunday news conference, Leitha said they have recorded 68 deaths in Kerr County. \"Among those who are deceased, we have 40 adults and 28 children,\" Leitha said. \"18 adults are pending identification and ten children are also pending identification.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"At present there are ten Camp Mystic campers unaccounted for, and one counselor.

Email freya.barnes@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TEDDIE BARRETT and FREYA BARNES \n Published:01:24 BST, 7 July 2025 |Updated:01:30 BST, 7 July 2025 \n\nThese are the chaotic scenes when drivers try to avoid an 'absolutely ridiculous' Low Traffic Neighbourhood that is raking in fines of £16,500 a day for a council.\nThe camera-enforced LTN roads in East Greenwich, south-east London are making it difficult for locals to go to the shops, drop their children to school and get to work, they say.\nAnd our video shows the lengths drivers are forced to go to in order to avoid a dreaded £100 fine. \nMailOnline footage shows one grey van braking abruptly before hastily turning around and a Waitrose truck making an awkward diversion.\nOther clips show a laundry delivery lorry driving down a restricted road before quickly backing out in a panic, cars approaching hesitantly to read the signs then re-routing and even some oblivious drivers hurtling straight through.\nBetween January and the end of May, the council has made £2.5 million from 47,836 notices penalty notices issued over rush-hour restrictions on Westcombe Hill, Vanbrugh Hill, Halstow Road and Maze Hill.\nIrene Asah, 48, was once able to drop her nine-year-old son right outside the school gates, but is now forced to park up before Halstow Road and let him walk the rest of the way on his own.\nThe mother-of-two doesn't have time to take the diverted route as she also has to drop her daughter to secondary school and get to work.\n\nFootage shows a Waitrose truck making an awkward diversion after almost driving through the restricted road on Vanbrugh Hill\n\nAnother clip shows a grey van breaking abruptly before hastily turning around to avoid a fine on Vanbrugh Hill\n\nPictured: A Range Rover attempting to reverse out of the LTN zone on Vanbrugh Hill to avoid a fine\n\nPictured: Another car making a U-turn on Halstow Road after realising they were not allowed to drive down it\n'I wish I could drop him straight to the school entrance, it would be easier and more secure, but I don't have time,' she told MailOnline.\nMs Asah said the LTN is 'really horrible' and 'bad for people who drive', adding: 'It does make our journeys longer. I work in central London, so when I come back after 3pm I can't go this direction. I have to go all the way past Shooters Hill, it's a long way.'\nIf she was able to use the road when she finishes work, it would only take her 15 minutes to get to her son's school and pick him up at 3.30pm.\nHowever, it now takes her 45 minutes which means she often arrives 15 minutes past the collection time.\n'The school are always calling me because I'm late and can't get there in time,' she said.\nColin Gifford, 55, lives at the top of Vanbrugh Hill and mentioned how the build-up of traffic can add an extra 20 minutes to his commute.\nHe told MailOnline: 'My quickest and easiest way to the Blackwall Tunnel is down Vanbrugh Hill through the LTN, but I'm forced to go all the way round during rush hour with everybody else and that's making those roads so much busier.'\nMr Gifford acknowledged the LTN is good for the people living on the restricted roads, but said it 'doesn't make sense' for other locals.\n'I don't think it stops people driving, they just go in a different direction,' he added.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nIrene Asah (pictured), 48, was once able to drop her nine-year-old son right outside the school gates, but is now forced to park up before Halstow Road and let him walk the rest of the way on his own \n\nIf Ms Asah was able to use Halstow Road (pictured) when she finishes work, it would only take her 15 minutes to get to her son's school and pick him up at 3.30pm\n\nPictured: A side road on Vanbrugh Hill which has been closed off with planters and bollards\n\nColin Gifford (pictured), 55, lives at the top of Vanbrugh Hill and mentioned how the build-up of traffic can add an extra 20 minutes to his commute\n\nPictured: Heavy traffic on Trafalgar Road where cars are forced to divert due to the controversial LTN\n\nPictured: An LTN enforcement camera on Halstow Road positioned to catch people driving through the restricted street\n\nElsewhere, Kirsty Dunlop explained how Greenwich has always been a 'pathway to the Blackwall Tunnel', but the easy access they once had is now blocked.\nThe 46-year-old said: 'The LTNs sound great in theory, but for us residents it's absolutely ridiculous and there's no help what so ever.'\nShe added: 'I live the other side of Amber Hill, so for me to get to the Blackwall Tunnel I have to go all the way up, over and around to get somewhere that would have taken me two minutes. \n'I understand there's the whole rat-run thing with people coming in, but it's just so unhelpful.'\nMs Dunlop said her neighbour recently received a £100 fine after she drove through Halstow Road at 6.59am.\nBut, when her friend appealed it and pointed out she had gone through just one minute before the controls start, she was told it 'doesn't matter'.\nThe build-up of traffic has also made bus journeys longer and even impossible at times because they can't 'physically turn down' some congested roads due to how narrow they are.\nShe said: 'It's a mile to my son's school and sometimes we don't want to walk in the pouring rain and get wet, so then you're waiting on a bus. \n'The bus will say it's going to be 10 minutes and next thing you know it's 20 minutes. That's putting pressure on all of us and it's just not fair.' \n\nKirsty Dunlop (pictured) explained how Greenwich has always been a 'pathway to the Blackwall Tunnel', but the easy access they once had is now blocked\n\nGreenwich Council are raking in £16,500 a day from fines dished out to locals who drive through camera enforced LTN roads in East Greenwich, south-east London (Pictured: Vanbrugh Hill)\n\nMarianne Chapman (pictured), 39, lives on Eastcombe Avenue, the first road past the Westcombe Park LTN, and believes they are 'just putting everyone in more traffic'\n\nPictured: The LTN on Westcombe Hill in East Greenwich which is restricted during rush hours\nShe mentioned how teachers are unable to park on the road where they work and end up late because they have to search for a spot further away.\nMs Dunlop said: 'It's just really put us at a disadvantage. I do think something needs to happen, but I don't think this is the way forward.\n'I don't think they have really thought this through for the people living here.'\nThe mother is 'not surprised' the council make so much money from fines, adding: 'As much as they package it up as fighting pollution and helping us, it is a money-making scheme.'\nMarianne Chapman, 39, lives on Eastcombe Avenue, the first road past the Westcombe Park LTN, and believes they are 'just putting everyone in more traffic'.\nShe told MailOnline: 'It means everyone comes down my road and it's completely blocked. \n'We've got the 380 bus and it can't come up the road because of the amount of people coming down and it's really narrow. So, the busses physically can't do the turn.'\nMs Chapman shared concerns about how the money from the fines is being used.\n'Where is this money Greenwich Council are collecting from fines going? They're making this much money, but are they showing us it's going into doing something about the environment and pollution?\n'Is it even being spent on something or is it just going into the councils budget? It should go towards something relevant to what it is meant to be stopping.'\nGareth Morgan, 46, said he is having to be 'very conscious' of the routes he takes and is 'yet to have met someone in favour of the idea'.\nThe Halstow Road resident revealed how he has to use public car parks because he doesn't currently have a parking permit for outside his property.\nHe added he might have been caught out by the unclear signage had not seen the consultation.\nOther residents noted they avoid talking to some of their neighbours who like the LTN because of how divisive the topic is, with some asking to give their comments anonymously.\nOne man said: 'They have to stop this game. London is not Amsterdam. Is this some kind of money making scheme?\n'The neighbourhoods that benefit from this system are the ones with beautiful houses. The square meter is way more expensive here.'\nAnother complained: 'I think it's a waste of time. I've had situations where taxis are not wanting to turn into this area to drop me off at home, so I'm being dropped off at the bottom of the hill.\n'People are not very clear on the rules. It seems very complicated.\n\nGareth Morgan (pictured), 46, said he is having to be 'very conscious' of the routes he takes and is 'yet to have met someone in favour of the idea'\n\nPictured: A sign stating the LTN restriction times on Vanbrugh Hill in East Greenwich, south-east London\n\nDonald Reid, who is in favour of the LTN, was unafraid to declare his opinion that it is a 'good thing'\n\nPictured: Long queues of heavy traffic along Trafalgar Road where motorists are diverted \n'I'd rather see the council spend money on actual things that are going help us with reaching net zero, like more cycle lanes and investing in better public transport, rather than these kinds of punitive measures that are there to punish motorists.\n'It's damaging the council's relationship with local residents.'\nMeanwhile, a few homeowners in East Greenwich - who also asked to remain anonymous - said they 'love' the scheme before hurrying away from any more questions.\nDonald Reid, who is in favour of the LTN, was unafraid to declare his opinion that it is a 'good thing'.\nThe 65-year-old said: 'It has reduced congestion, reduced pollution, and it makes the area nice to walk around.'\n'We need to get more people off the roads and using bikes or walking. There are a large number of unnecessary journeys being made by car.\n'People need to change behaviour to get closer to net zero.'\nHe said it was 'horrendous' before the restrictions, with cars 'banked up the road with pollution running'.\nCouncillor Matt Hartley, Leader of Greenwich Conservatives, who requested the figures on fines from the council, told us: 'Labour’s ideological war on drivers continues to hurt people here. \n'The scheme was chaotically introduced, with poor signage and widespread confusion. \n'The fines are now rolling in to the council and, predictably, there's no sign of the air quality benefits the council claimed. \n'What we can see is that some traffic is being displaced to roads in areas outside the zone, which have been badly let down by this council. \n'Labour councillors need to have the humility to listen to local people, instead of just seeing the pound signs above their heads.'\nMailOnline has contacted Greenwich Council for comment. \nLondonWaitrose\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe moment desperate drivers realise they've been snared by London's most-hated low traffic neighbourhood that pulls in £16,500 in fines a day\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

In a lengthy and personal tirade posted to Truth Social on Sunday, President Donald Trump unloaded on his former ally, expressing his profound disappointment and casting Musk as an ungrateful and confused figure who has gone “completely ‘off the rails.'”\n\nThe catalyst for the public condemnation was Musk’s launch of “The America Party,” a third-party movement aimed at disrupting the two-party system. For Trump, this was not a political calculation but a personal slight from a man he felt he had supported, even when he found his actions baffling.\n\n“I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump wrote, framing the situation as a tragic downfall rather than a simple policy disagreement. The post reads like a lament for a broken friendship, detailing a relationship that Trump suggests was always marked by his own confusion over Musk’s motives.\n\nThe backdrop for this political divorce was the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump’s signature domestic policy legislation. After Musk, who briefly led a government efficiency task force for the administration, turned on the bill, the relationship quickly soured. But Trump’s post makes it clear he sees Musk’s opposition and subsequent founding of a new party as rooted in something more personal and financial: the bill’s elimination of the electric vehicle (EV) mandate.\n\n“Unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time,” Trump wrote. He then detailed a private conversation that highlights his sense of betrayal, claiming he was shocked that Musk had offered his endorsement while knowing Trump’s firm opposition to the mandate.\n\n“I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate,” Trump recounted. “He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!”\n\nTrump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” that he signed into law on July 4, eliminates a $7,500 tax break for the purchase of a new EV, and $4,000 for a used one on September 30.\n\nThe anecdote paints Musk not as a political adversary, but as an inconsistent and perhaps disingenuous partner. Trump continued this theme by sharing another story that underscores his bewilderment with Musk’s judgment, this time involving a request to appoint a “close friend” to lead NASA.\n\n“Elon asked that one of his close friends run NASA and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before,” Trump wrote, expressing his astonishment. “I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon’s corporate life.”\n\nBy sharing these behind-the-scenes moments, Trump casts himself as the loyal and consistent leader, blindsided by the erratic behavior of a man he brought into his inner circle. The message is clear: the alliance is over not because of a political rift, but because, in Trump’s eyes, Musk has proven himself to be an unreliable and ungrateful actor. The once-celebrated “bromance” between two of the world’s most powerful men has ended in a spectacular public wreck, with the President himself sadly surveying the damage.","summary":"The U.S. President lamented the spectacular collapse of his alliance with Elon Musk, framing the tech billionaire’s new political party as a personal betrayal from a man he recently supported.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/trump-declares-musk-a-train-wreck-after-party-launch-2000624726","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/03/Elon-Musk-Donald-Trump-March-22-2025-GettyImages-2206428974-copy-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:07:41","author":"Luc Olinga","authors":["Luc Olinga"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":338927496,"title":"'Redskins' Should've Never Changed Their Name, Says President Trump","text":"The Washington Redskins, with their storied history as an NFL franchise, should've never changed the franchise's brand. President Donald Trump reiterated his support for the \"Redskins\" name after outraged critics called it offensive toward Native Americans, which forced Washington into changing its brand several times, none as revered as the Redskins. Trump, a major sports fan and former football executive, was asked by Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson if the now-titled Washington Commanders should go back to being the Redskins after giving up the title in 2022. READ: Donald Trump Backs School in Fight to Keep 'Chiefs' Brand Amid Woke Backlash \"Well, you want me to make a controversial statement? I would,\" Trump said. \"I wouldn't have changed the name. It just doesn't have the same, it doesn't have the same ring to me.\" No. 47 said the Commanders could eventually grow on people if they start winning.\"But, you know, winning can make everything sound good. So if they win, all of a sudden the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn't have changed the name.\" The Commanders reached the NFC Championship Game last season and were pounded by the Philadelphia Eagles, 55-23, who visited Trump in April after their Super Bowl victory. The Redskins' title change is largely attributed to the political pressure caused by 2020's George Floyd riots. Major sponsors like Nike, Amazon and Target threatened previous franchise owner Dan Snyder into changing the team name, claiming it was offensive to Native Americans, contrary to several groups of Native Americans' outcry to preserve the name as a means to highlight American Indians. READ: Native American Group Rekindles Fight for Return of 'Washington Redskins' The Washington Post published a poll in 2016 that found 90% of Native Americans were not offended by the Washington Redskins' name. Trump has long called for the franchise to turn back from its political posturing and give the majority of fans' wish to see the return of their beloved brand. In April, President Trump put out a fiery post supporting Massapequa High School after their teams were forced to remove their \"Chiefs\" name and iconography after progressives petitioned for the removal. \"The School Board, and virtually everyone in the area, are demanding the name be kept. It has become the School’s identity and, what could be wrong with using the name, 'Chief'?\" Trump posted. \"I don’t see the Kansas City Chiefs changing their name anytime soon!

This all-girls summer camp was left in shambles after flash floods tore through the area, washing homes from their foundations. Sadly, these violent floods have resulted in the death of at least 78 individuals in central Texas.\n\nRescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain continued their desperate search for the missing, including 10 girls and a counselor from the camp. For the first time since the storms began pounding Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said there were 41 people confirmed to be unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.\n\nIn Kerr County, home to Camp Mystic and other youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, searchers have found the bodies of 68 people, including 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said in the afternoon.\n\nHe pledged to keep searching until “everybody is found” from Friday’s flash floods. Ten other deaths were reported in Travis, Burnet, Kendall, Tom Green and Williamson counties, according to local officials. The death toll is certain to rise over the next few days, said Col. Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nThe governor warned Sunday that additional rounds of heavy rains lasting into Tuesday could produce more life-threatening flooding, especially in places already saturated.\n\nFamilies were allowed to look around the camp beginning Sunday morning. One girl walked out of a building carrying a large bell. A man, who said his daughter was rescued from a cabin on the highest point in the camp, walked a riverbank, looking in clumps of trees and under big rocks.\n\nA woman and a teenage girl, both wearing rubber waders, briefly went inside one of the cabins, which stood next to a pile of soaked mattresses, a storage trunk and clothes. At one point, the pair doubled over, sobbing before they embraced.\n\nOne family left with a blue footlocker. A teenage girl had tears running down her face looking out the open window, gazing at the wreckage as they slowly drove away.\n\nSearching the disaster zone\n\nWhile the families saw the devastation for the first time, nearby crews operating heavy equipment pulled tree trunks and tangled branches from the water as they searched the river.\n\nWith each passing hour, the outlook of finding more survivors became even more bleak. Volunteers and some families of the missing who drove to the disaster zone searched the riverbanks despite being asked not to do so.\n\nAuthorities faced growing questions about whether enough warnings were issued in an area long vulnerable to flooding and whether enough preparations were made.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County, activating the Federal Emergency Management Agency to Texas. “These families are enduring an unimaginable tragedy, with many lives lost, and many still missing,” Trump posted on social media.\n\nThe destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the river in only 45 minutes before daybreak Friday, washing away homes and vehicles. The danger was not over as flash flood watches remained in effect and more rain fell in central Texas on Sunday.\n\nSearchers used helicopters, boats and drones to look for victims and to rescue people stranded in trees and from camps isolated by washed-out roads. Officials said more than 850 people were rescued in the first 36 hours.\n\nPrayers in Texas — and from the Vatican\n\nGov. Greg Abbott vowed that authorities will work around the clock and said new areas were being searched as the water receded. He declared Sunday a day of prayer for the state.\n\n“I urge every Texan to join me in prayer this Sunday — for the lives lost, for those still missing, for the recovery of our communities, and for the safety of those on the front lines,” he said in a statement.\n\nIn Rome, Pope Leo XIV offered special prayers for those touched by the disaster. History’s first American pope spoke in English at the end of his Sunday noon blessing, “I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were in summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.”\n\nThe hills along the Guadalupe River are dotted with century-old youth camps and campgrounds where generations of families have come to swim and enjoy the outdoors. The area is especially popular around the Independence Day holiday, making it more difficult to know how many are missing.\n\nHarrowing escapes from floodwaters\n\nSurvivors shared terrifying stories of being swept away and clinging to trees as rampaging floodwaters carried trees and cars past them. Others fled to attics inside their homes, praying the water wouldn’t reach them.\n\nAt Camp Mystic, a cabin full of girls held onto a rope strung by rescuers as they walked across a bridge with water whipping around their legs.\n\nAmong those confirmed dead were an 8-year-old girl from Mountain Brook, Alabama, who was at Camp Mystic, and the director of another camp up the road.\n\nTwo school-age sisters from Dallas were missing after their cabin was swept away. Their parents were staying in a different cabin and were safe, but the girls’ grandparents were unaccounted for.\n\nLocals know the Hill Country as “ flash flood alley” but the flooding in the middle of the night caught many campers and residents by surprise even though there were warnings.\n\nWarnings came before the disaster\n\nThe National Weather Service on Thursday advised of potential flooding and then sent out a series of flash flood warnings in the early hours of Friday before issuing flash flood emergencies — a rare alert notifying of imminent danger.\n\nAt the Mo-Ranch Camp in the community of Hunt, officials had been monitoring the weather and opted to move several hundred campers and attendees at a church youth conference to higher ground. At nearby Camps Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, organizers also had mentioned on social media that they were watching the weather the day before ending their second summer session Thursday.\n\nAuthorities and elected officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months’ worth of rain for the area.\n\nKerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said authorities are committed to a full review of the emergency response, including how the public was alerted to the storm threat.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas (AP) — On Sunday, families began the arduous task of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Central Texas Flash Floods Claim 78 Lives; 10 Campers Still Unaccounted For first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/central-texas-flash-floods-claim-78-lives-10-campers-still-unaccounted-for/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Death-toll-in-central-Texas-flash-floods-rises-to-78.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:05:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":338922570,"title":"Pemimpin BRICS gesa gencatan senjata dilaksanakan tanpa syarat di Gaza","text":"RIO DE JANEIRO: Pemimpin negara-negara BRICS yang bermesyuarat di Rio de Janeiro semalam menggesa pihak berkaitan supaya mencapai persetujuan untuk melaksanakan gencatan senjata segera dan tanpa syarat bagi menamatkan perang di Gaza yang berlarutan sejak 22 bulan lalu. \n\nMenerusi kenyataan oleh blok yang dianggotai oleh 11 negara itu menggesa semua pihak untuk berunding secara ikhlas dan segera mencapai gencatan senjata secara kekal dan tanpa syarat. \n\nSelain itu, BRICS turut menuntut pengunduran penuh tentera Israel dari Semenanjung Gaza dan semua wilayah Palestin yang diduduki.\n\nKenyataan blok berkenaan dikeluarkan ketika rundingan gencatan senjata antara Israel dan Palestin disambung semula di Doha, dengan tekanan semakin meningkat supaya konflik yang tercetus susulan serangan Hamas pada 7 Oktober 2023 itu ditamatkan segera.\n\nKempen ketenteraan balas Israel dilaporkan meragut sekurang-kurangnya 57,418 nyawa di Gaza, majoritinya orang awam, menurut Kementerian Kesihatan Palestin, dengan angka berkenaan dianggap boleh dipercayai oleh Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB).\n\nSidang kemuncak BRICS kali ini turut dihadiri Iran, seteru utama Israel, selain negara seperti Russia yang mempunyai hubungan rapat dengan negara terbabit.\n\nPerdana Menteri Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu dijadualkan mengadakan pertemuan dengan Presiden Amerika Syarikat, Donald Trump di Rumah Putih hari ini bagi membincangkan usaha menamatkan perang itu, dengan Trump sebelum ini menyatakan harapan supaya persetujuan gencatan senjata dapat dicapai dalam tempoh seminggu.","summary":"RIO DE JANEIRO: Pemimpin negara-negara BRICS yang bermesyuarat di Rio de Janeiro semalam menggesa pihak berkaitan supaya mencapai persetujuan untuk melaksanakan gencatan senjata segera dan tanpa syarat bagi menamatkan perang di Gaza yang berlarutan sejak 22 bulan lalu.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/asia/2025/07/1416592/pemimpin-brics-gesa-gencatan-senjata-dilaksanakan-tanpa-syarat-di-gaza","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH7brics-o_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1751846569.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:02:54","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":1},{"id":338920852,"title":"Pope Leo XIV's touching message to families of Texas flood victims as death toll rises to 79","text":"Pope Leo XIV has broken his silence following the devastating floods in Texas that have claimed the lives of at least 79 pople.

According to the Guardian an official has received unconfirmed reports of “an additional wall of water” flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday’s rains. Pope Leo XIV took to X yesterday to say: \"I would like to express sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters, who were at the summer camp, in the disaster caused by flooding of the Guadalupe River in Texas in the United States. We pray for them.\" Donald Trump has said he will \"probably\" visit Texas on Friday, following the flash flooding that killed 79 people in the state. \"We want to leave a little time,\" he told reporters this afternoon. \"I would have done it today, but we would just be in their way, probably Friday.\" He said he has been in touch with the Texas governor. The Guadalupe River surged by 30ft above its typical level with racing watering destroying Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp in Hunt. Several young girls remain missing as a huge rescue effort continues to find those still unaccounted for. Many of the missing girls are younger children who had been sleeping just yards away from the river. They had been sleeping on the low-laying \"flats\" in the camp's cabins, with the older girls sleeping in cabins on higher grounds. The director of the camp, Richard Eastland, 70, died as he tried to save girls.

But the uncertainty of the last few months has already forced several companies to rethink their supply lines in radical ways. \n\nWhen an Illinois toymaker heard that Trump was introducing tariffs on Chinese imports, he was so incensed that he decided to sue the US government.\n\n\"I'm inclined to stand up when my company is in genuine peril,\" says Rick Woldenberg, who is the CEO of educational toy firm Learning Resources.\n\nThe majority of his company's products are made in China, so the tariffs, which US importers have to pay, not Chinese exporters, are now costing him a fortune.\n\nHe says his import taxes bill leapt from around $2.5m (£1.5m) a year to more than $100m in April when Trump temporarily increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. That would have \"devastated\" the company, he says.\n\n\"This kind of impact on my business is just a little bit hard to wrap my mind around,\" he says.\n\nWith US tariffs on Chinese imports now at 30%, that's still unaffordable for many American companies such as Learning Resources.\n\nSo in addition to its continuing legal fight, it is changing its global supply chain, moving production from China to Vietnam and India.\n\nThese two countries, like most others around the world, have seen the US hit them with general 10% tariffs, two-thirds lower than those on China. Although these 10% tariffs are due to run out on Wednesday, 9 July, uncertainly remains over what they may be replaced by.\n\nMeanwhile, many Canadian companies, who often trade in both their home country and in the US, are now facing a double hit to their supply chains.\n\nThese hits are the 25% tariffs put in place by Trump on many Canadian imports, and the reciprocal ones of the same level that Canada has placed on a host of American exports.\n\nAnd other businesses around the world are looking at exporting less to the US, because their American import partners are having to put up prices to cover the tariffs they now have to pay, which makes their products more expensive on US shelves.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l6n32ne5o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7b5c/live/dcbb3c00-485a-11f0-bbaa-4bc03e0665b7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:02:26","author":"David Silverberg","authors":["David Silverberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":338916178,"title":"US flood death toll hits 67, 11 girls missing","text":"Sheriff Larry Leitha said among those confirmed dead in Kerr County are 38 adults and 21 children, but 18 adult victims and four children have not yet been identified.\n\nDuring a news conference on Sunday local time, official said another four bodies had been recoverd in Travis County, three in Burnet County and one in Kendall County. \n\nMr Leitha said that 11 girls and one counsellor are still missing from Camp Mystic, the Christian girls’ summer camp just off the banks of the Guadalupe River. \n\nFive campers, ages 8 and 9, have been confirmed dead in the flooding — along with the camp’s owner.\n\nWhen asked why the camps weren’t evacuated before the water level rose and despite the Texas Division of Emergency Management’s warning days earlier a storm like this could occur. Mr Leitha and city manager Dalton Rice declined to comment, abruptly ending Sunday’s 10am press conference. \n\n“That, that is a great question, but again, we want to make sure that we continue to focus. We still have 11 missing children that we want to get reunited with our families,” Mr Rice said.\n\nSome 400 first responders from 20 agencies city, state and national are continuing the rescue operation in Kerr County, which saw the worst of the flash flooding along the river.\n\n“We will continue our search efforts until everyone is found,” Mr Leitha assured.\n\nThe three victims identified Saturday include a high school soccer coach and his wife and a beloved high school teacher.\n\nReece Zunker, a soccer coach in Tivy, Texas, and his wife Paula, who were on vacation with their two children when the flooding swept through Kerr County Friday, were among the latest victims identified by officials.\n\n“Our Tivy Soccer & KISD community is heartbroken with the loss of our leader and inspiration,” Tivy Boys Soccer wrote on Facebook Saturday night.\n\n“The Coach Reece Zunker was not just a soccer coach he was a mentor, teacher and a role model for our Kerrville kids.”\n\nLocal outlet the Kerrville Daily Times reported that the two children were still missing. The family had been staying in a river house in the town of Hunt, not far from Camp Mystic.\n\nAlso confirmed among the dead is Jeff Wilson, a teacher at Kingswood Park High School who taught in the Humble Independent School District for 30 years, the school wrote on X.\n\n“Tonight our [Humble Independent School District] family is grieving the devastating loss of teacher Jeff Wilson, who passed away due to the catastrophic flooding in Kerrville,” the mourning social media post read.\n\n“He was a beloved teacher and co-worker to many and will be deeply missed.”\n\nThe district added that Wilson’s brother-in-law shared that his wife, Amber, and son, Shiloh are still considered missing.\n\n“Please continue to keep their entire family, and ours, in your prayers,” the district urged.\n\nOfficials will provide the latest on the rescue effort in a press conference scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT Sunday (6am Monday AET).\n\nThe camp, which hosts up to 750 girls aged seven to 17, was overwhelmed by the floodwaters, which at one point saw the river swell by eight metres in just 45 minutes.\n\n“The camp was completely destroyed,” Elinor Lester, 13, one of the evacuated campers, told The Associated Press.\n\n“A helicopter landed and started taking people away. It was really scary.”\n\nThe family of Mystic’s director, Dick Eastland, confirmed he heroically died while trying to save the young girls from the storm.\n\nMr Eastland raced to one of the camp’s 23 cabins when the floodwater swept it away early Friday morning, Channel2Now reported. He had been involved with the private all-girls Christian camp since purchasing it in 1974 with his wife Tweety. His nephew confirmed his death via Facebook.\n\nFormer camper Paige Sumner said Mr Eastland and “was the father figure to all of us while we were away from home at Camp Mystic for six weeks”.\n\n“He was the father of four amazing boys, but he had hundreds of girls each term who looked up to him like a dad,” she wrote. “I would never have taken a fishing class if it wasn’t taught by my new friend Dick.”\n\nHarrowing photographs showed the damage wrought by the floodwaters, which reached the middle of the windows of the cabins where the girls slept, and higher than the bunk beds.\n\nEntire walls were ripped off the buildings, trees uprooted and the girls’ belongings tossed into shrubbery.\n\nThe National Weather Service first issued a flash flood watch at 1.18pm on Thursday estimating up to seven inches of rising water.\n\nAt 1.14am, a “life threatening” flash flood warning was issued for about 30,000 people, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nGrilled about the suddenness of the flooding overnight and why more precautions weren’t taken, Judge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in Kerr County, told reporters “we do not have a warning system” and that “we didn’t know this flood was coming”.\n\n“Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,” he said. “We have floods all the time. This is the most dangerous river valley in the United States.”\n\nThe camp is currently without power or internet. A statement from its administrators, read out by the Lieutenant governor, stressed that the level of flooding was “catastrophic”.\n\n“The highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help,” the camp said.\n\nThe communications problems are being exacerbated by the camp’s rule of imposing a ban on technology for the children staying there.\n\n“Technology is actually not allowed there,” said NewsNation reporter Tracy Walder, whose daughter is friends with some of the missing kids.\n\n“That’s why communication and information is kind of a bit difficult to come by.”\n\nMr Abbott, in a written statement, said Texas was “providing all necessary resources to Kerrville, Ingram, Hunt and the entire Texas Hill Country dealing with these devastating floods”.\n\n“The state of Texas today has mobilised additional resources in addition to the resources sent in preparation for the storms. I urge Texans to heed guidance from state and local officials and monitor local forecasts to avoid driving into flooded areas.”\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz, asked his followers on social media to “pray right now” for all involved, “especially Camp Mystic”.\n\n“It’s terrible, the floods,” US President Donald Trump told reporters Friday night. “It’s shocking.”\n\nAsked if Texas would receive federal aid, he said: “Oh yeah, sure, we’ll take care of it. We’re working with the governor.”\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Mr Trump said the federal government was working with state and local officials in response to the “tragic flooding”.\n\n“Our Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, will be there shortly,” he wrote.\n\n“Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy. Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!”\n\nMeanwhile, officials are warning residents of the area to continue being vigilant.\n\n“The rain has let up, but we know there’s another wave coming,” Mr Martin said, adding that more rain would be hitting areas around the cities San Antonio and Austin.\n\nForecasters issued a flood warning for one county, urging those living near the Guadalupe River to “move to higher ground”.\n\nFlash floods, which occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall, are not unusual in the region.\n\n– with AFP, NY Post and Fox News","summary":"The death toll from the catastrophic Texas floods has risen to 67 — with at least 11 girls and one counsellor still missing.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/texas-flood-death-toll-hits-59-11-girls-one-counsellor-still-missing/news-story/7c577a856981c52b9cb9d15ab50ce673?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/427aa19a6200489960c1382d0a609dec","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:01:57","author":"Copy Link","authors":["Copy Link"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":338916176,"title":"US politics live: TikToker slammed for insensitive ‘white girls’ rant about flood victims","text":"Donald Trump has slammed Elon Musk’s decision to create to a third US political as his public feud with his ex-advisor continues.\n\n“I think it’s ridiculous to start a third party,” the President told reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey. “We have a tremendous success with the Republican Party.

So there is indeed a sharp contrast post-truce period, one that is similar to [the] pre-truce period.”\nHong Kong exports surged by 15.5 per cent in May from a year ago, with economists attributing the increase to the front-loading of shipments by businesses racing to beat the deadline.\n“Our company remains financially challenged with exposure to material cancellation or orders that continue to be put on hold,” Chan said.\nHe confirmed he was facing renewed pressure from some clients in the United States to absorb tariff costs, even before the final rates were known.\nWhile the company could offer a small discount as a “gesture of support”, it could not afford to cover the bulk of the duties, he added.\n“Ultimately, if sharing the high tariff is the only way to retain the business, then we would rather walk away,” he said.\n\nThe United States and China have moved to restore access to critical technologies and high-priority exports.\nSome American companies have recently received notice from the US Department of Commerce to resume exports of certain software, ethane, aircraft engines and other products to China. Meanwhile, China has resumed rare earth magnet exports to the US.\nTo counter the uncertainty, Wynnewood is pushing ahead with diversification plans. Chan said the company had partnered with a factory in Indonesia and expected to make its first shipment by October. But progress on developing new markets in Europe had been slower, as it could take up to two years to secure a first order.\nLooking at the second half of the year, Chan said “most companies will remain challenged” while tariff levels remained unknown. He said the key to survival was for manufacturers to diversify into new markets and move up the value chain by designing or branding their own products rather than simply making them for others.\nChan’s on-the-ground experience reflects wider anxiety across the industry, with experts warning of significant risks ahead. They pointed to the repeated use of the US False Claims Act to police customs violations, with consequences far more severe than typical administrative fines.\nAndy Winthrop, a senior director in the Asia tax practice at global professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal, said cases could involve “up to treble damages, substantial penalties, lengthy litigation and potentially devastating collateral consequences”.\nUS customs defined the country of origin for exports as where they underwent “substantial transformation” rather than using a shipment’s point of departure, Winthrop said.\n“This assessment is highly technical and often subjective, blending legal, regulatory and manufacturing expertise,” he said.\nHenry Chambers, a managing director and co-head of disputes and investigations for the Asia practice at Alvarez & Marsal, said the risk was amplified not only by data analytics used to identify potential fraudulent behaviour or anomalies, but also by a surge in whistle-blower-driven lawsuits, which the US Department of Justice was encouraging.\n“All of these mean that the net has been broadened, increasing a company’s chances of exposure, especially those in high-risk sectors and even with unintentional errors,” he said.\nWhile experts were focusing on compliance risks, the city’s main business chamber suggested a broader strategic shift was already under way.\nHong Kong General Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Agnes Chan Sui-kuen said local businesses had already adapted their supply chains following the initial round of tariffs under the first Trump administration.\n“Because of Trump 1.0, everyone was already paying close attention … they have already diversified, and their supply chains have been strengthened,” she said.\nShe framed the current trade environment as a long-term reality for which businesses were already prepared, emphasising the growing importance of the Global South.\n“This is a long-term struggle,” Chan said. “Everyone is already mentally prepared for a long-term struggle.”","summary":"A recent surge in Hong Kong’s exports masks a grim reality for frontline manufacturers, with some facing a sharp drop-off in new orders and bracing for renewed pressure on costs as a 90-day tariff truce between Washington and Beijing ends on Tuesday.\nBryant Chan Wan-sing, president of toymaker the Wynnewood Corporation, said the sharp increase in orders during the truce was essentially a reinstatement of ones put on hold or cancelled when tariffs were introduced on US President Donald Trump’s...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3317156/hong-kong-manufacturers-brace-higher-costs-end-trade-truce-looms","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/06/90bce616-02a6-4a27-b8d7-31c90559bb02_07cd09b1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-07 00:00:20","author":"Lam Ka-Sing","authors":["Lam Ka-Sing"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":338922824,"title":"Fake it ‘til you make it?

Now, that ocean is in the crosshairs of Washington, which is leveraging the region’s persistent intellectual property violations in the tense final days of trade negotiations.\nTrump’s White House has imposed a July 9 deadline: if trade talks fail, then on Wednesday Southeast Asia’s export-driven economies could face punishing tariffs of up to 49 per cent.\n\nThe primary target is Chinese goods diverted through neighbouring countries – a practice known as transshipment that helps Chinese products sidestep Washington’s existing tariffs.\nYet Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia have also drawn Washington’s ire for their own lapses in intellectual property enforcement.\nOn the streets and online, knock-off Labubu dolls, Louis Vuitton handbags, Nike trainers, jewellery, Rolex watches – even counterfeit pharmaceuticals and perfumes – are easy to find, fuelling a vast, shadowy economy.\nFrom Bangkok’s MBK Centre to Saigon Square shopping centre in Ho Chi Minh City, recent weeks have seen high-profile seizures of fake goods worth millions, staged for television cameras as regional governments scramble to show they are tackling the problem.\nBut the counterfeit trade is never far from reach. Sometimes, it finds you at your table.\n\nRahul’s nightly rounds through the tourist hotspot of Sukhumvit in the Thai capital are often met with indifference or open hostility, with expletives trailing in his wake. But occasionally, his tenacity is rewarded.\nOn a recent Friday, two tourists from New Zealand bargained the price of a “Rolex” down from 10,000 baht to 2,000 baht (US$310 to US$62) – an instant 80 per cent discount that revealed the watch’s true provenance.\nTens of millions of fake timepieces are offered for sale each year, according to the Federation of Swiss Watches, many of which pass through Asia. Watches trail only clothing as the world’s most counterfeited goods.\nFor major brands, policing these low-level, transnational and dispersed crimes is an endless, Sisyphean task.\nLast year, Thailand’s Department of Intellectual Property prosecuted more than 1,300 cases, seizing over 2.7 million counterfeit items worth tens of millions of dollars.\nYet the country remains on a US watch list for intellectual property breaches.\n\n“While Thailand is making progress in these areas, concerns remain. Counterfeit and pirated goods are still readily available, particularly online,” the Office of the US Trade Representative said in a report released earlier this year.\nBangkok’s MBK Centre was cited as a “notorious market” teeming with fakes – a designation that carries weight as Thailand enters the final phase of negotiations with Washington, hoping to lower a threatened 36 per cent US tariff to the baseline of 10 per cent.\nThe pressure is intense: last year, roughly 20 per cent of all Thailand’s exports went to the US, making it the kingdom’s largest overseas market.\nA recent crackdown at MBK has made headlines, but the shopping centre is only one node in a continent-spanning network. Fakes produced in China, Cambodia, Vietnam, India and Thailand flood marketplaces both physical and digital.\nThe counterfeit trade is frequently linked to organised crime, including drug trafficking and human exploitation\nTilleke & Gibbins law firm\n“These items are frequently distributed through informal markets and increasingly via online platforms,” Tilleke & Gibbins, a Bangkok-based law firm specialising in intellectual property, told This Week in Asia.\nFor many, counterfeit shopping is a harmless thrill, even an indelible part of the Southeast Asian tourist experience – a way to bring home “luxury” on the cheap, or stock up for a side hustle.\n“However, this perception overlooks the broader consequences. Counterfeiting undermines legitimate businesses, causes tax revenue losses, and exposes consumers to health and safety risks,” Tilleke & Gibbins said in a statement.\n“Moreover, the counterfeit trade is frequently linked to organised crime, including drug trafficking and human exploitation. What may seem like a harmless bargain actually fuels a global illicit economy with far-reaching and damaging impacts.”\nPiracy and ‘princes’\nIn Vietnam, a manufacturing hub for trainers and apparel, counterfeit sales are an open secret, with factory rejects and near-perfect replicas easily found.\nThe country has earned praise for its crackdowns, including on piracy site Fmovies, which US officials described as “the world’s largest piracy ring … that drew more than 6.7 billion visits between January 2023 and June 2024”.\nBut even so, from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, fakes are still openly for sale.\nVietnam had faced the threat of a 46 per cent tariff on exports to the US market before President Donald Trump announced a deal on Wednesday slashing the rate to 20 per cent, with a steeper 40 per levy on goods deemed to have been transshipped. Hanoi had courted Washington to reduce the penalty, including through real estate deals with Trump’s son, Eric.\nCatching the counterfeiters is no easy task, however, especially in a region where law enforcement can be bribed to ignore the illegal trade and courts often regard counterfeiting as a minor offence.\n\nThe trial last year of a Frenchman nicknamed the “prince of fakes” revealed how luxury replicas move from Chinese factories to Thai distributors, then on to global buyers via encrypted WhatsApp groups.\nThe man, identified by a French court as Julien V, is believed to have pocketed millions of euros selling custom fakes for between €500 and €1,300 (US$590 to US$1,530) – watches that were nearly indistinguishable from originals that retail for tens of thousands of US dollars.\nE-commerce has complicated enforcement. With millions of parcels dispatched daily, illegal goods are easily concealed behind false names and shell companies.\nAsia’s leading online marketplaces – Shopee, India’s IndiaMART, and Indonesia’s Bukalapak among them – have all been flagged by the US as epicentres of counterfeit activity.\nStill, for those who prefer haggling in person, Southeast Asia continues to teem with infamous street markets. At Kuala Lumpur’s Petaling Street, for example, stalls selling fake Louis Vuitton bags and Rolex watches nestle between roasted chestnut vendors and pineapple tart kiosks.\n\nThough billed as a Chinatown, most stalls today are run by Bangladeshi migrants, not all of whom have legal work permits.\n“My boss is [Malaysian] Chinese,” said Alamgir, who sells travel luggage near an entrance to the market. “I have been working for six months now; the pay is decent.”\nPetaling Street’s counterfeit trade has waned since its heyday in the early 2000s, when shoppers were warned not to ask for prices unless they intended to buy, lest they be harassed by insistent vendors.\nBut the sale of fake luxury goods is far from a parochial problem. The financial repercussions are global: draining government coffers, deterring investment and complicating trade talks.\nFor Malaysia, especially in high-profile districts like Petaling Street, the counterfeit trade has long been a sticking point in international commerce – one now under sharper scrutiny than ever.\n“The continued tolerance of counterfeit trade places it [Malaysia] at a disadvantage compared to regional competitors like Singapore and Vietnam, both of which have made visible strides in strengthening their IPR [intellectual property rights] enforcement mechanisms to attract premium investments,” said Liew Chee Yoong, an economist at Kuala Lumpur’s UCSI University.\n*Full name withheld at interviewee’s request","summary":"Persistence is the lifeblood of the counterfeit trade – an attribute Rahul* has in spades.\nOn the bustling, neon-lit streets of Bangkok, the thirty-something from India hawks imitation Rolex watches with a practised ease.\n“This is nearly as good as the real one,” he says, grinning, before melting into the crowd, a bag of replica Swiss timepieces slung over his shoulder.\nHis trade is illegal, yet it flourishes out in the open – a mere ripple in Southeast Asia’s ocean of counterfeit goods.

Internally dubbed “M2”, this app version aims to let users continue enjoying the platform even as ByteDance prepares to divest US TikTok operations under a government-mandated timeline, a report by The Information revealed. The existing app is expected to remain functional until March 2026, though that date may shift as negotiations unfold. The push comes amid intensifying negotiations, with President Donald Trump confirming that he will engage China early this week to finalise the TikTok deal. Trump stated that a framework “pretty much” exists for the sale of TikTok’s US assets, but underscored that Chinese approval, likely from President Xi, will be necessary. With the divest-and-ban deadline extended to September 17, every component of TikTok’s plan hinges on securing both US and Chinese regulatory consent. US App Strategy Meets National Security Mandate The September 5 launch date gives TikTok a runway for transitioning its user base to the new M2 app ahead of the mandated divestiture deadline. In the interim, the original TikTok client will continue operating, ensuring no immediate disruption to users or advertisers, The Information's report revealed. However, TikTok must persuade both governments that the new app sufficiently severs Beijing’s control over US data and content flow. Reports indicate that ByteDance had initially pursued a full US spin-off earlier this year, but negotiations faltered as China declined approval in response to US tariff threats. TikTok’s new app initiative effectively resets the approach, launching under American investor oversight while still requiring Beijing’s blessing for any ownership change. Trump Signals Deal Underway with China Talks Speaking aboard Air Force One last Friday, Trump said talks with Chinese officials would begin “Monday or Tuesday” and that the US “pretty much” has a deal in place. He emphasised that China will need to formally approve the buyer, likely President Xi or his envoys, for the sale to move forward. The timeline is now tightly bound to the legal deadline of September 17, after which TikTok faces a forced divestiture or ban. Trump’s willingness to negotiate marks a softer stance compared to earlier threats of a total ban, and comes amid broader efforts to ease tit-for-tat tariff tensions. His message to Chinese leaders was clear: finalise the TikTok sale as a bilateral confidence-building measure. Still, he qualified his optimism: “I’m not confident, but I think so,” suggesting caution ahead of reaching an agreement. An estimated 170 million-strong user base of TikTok in the US stands at the centre of this high-stakes transition. For creators, advertisers, and brands, clarity on platform continuity is vital. On the regulatory front, TikTok must verify that M2 is effectively a domestic platform, free from foreign interference. This may necessitate US ownership of code, data servers, and perhaps even the algorithm, negotiations that could strain relations with the new investor group and with Chinese engineers maintaining the app. Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"TikTok is preparing to launch a new app version, codenamed \"M2,\" on US app stores by September 5, 2025, in a strategic effort to comply with American national security directives and avoid an outright ban.

Currently, that's almost 10 months.\nAgnifilo also recalled how after federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami in March 2024, he advised the hip-hop star that sex trafficking charges were imminent. \n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs, 55, received a 'standing ovation' from fellow inmates when he returned to jail after winning acquittals on charges that carried a life sentence; Pictured in 2020\n'I said: \"Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,\"' he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \n'They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.' \n\nEXCLUSIVE Cassie Ventura breaks cover for the first time after shock Diddy verdict \nThe verdict came after a team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.\nThe lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.\n'You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,' Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, 'is simply not sex trafficking.'\nAgnifilo said the blunt talk was a 'no brainer.'\n'The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,' he said.\nCombs and his lawyers appeared deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.\n\nThe disgraced music mogul's attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said inmates cheered Combs on for 'beating' a high-profile federal case; Combs pictured in a courtroom sketch on July 2\n\n'They all said: \"We never get to see anyone who beats the government,\"' Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview, days after a jury acquitted Combs of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges; Agnifilo pictured on July 2 outside the courtroom\n\nCombs remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time already served. Currently, that's almost 10 months\n\n'No one knows what to think,' Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.\n'I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"'\nHe said he 'kind of whipped everybody into feeling better' after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.\nAgnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.\nCombs mouthed 'thank you' to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: 'Dream Team! Dream Team!' Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.\n'This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,' said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited 'a dream team of defense lawyers' against prosecutors who almost always win.\nAgnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy - belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them - last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the 'federal government comes into our bedrooms,' he said.\nDuring an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.\nIronically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.\n\nCassie, the prosecution's star witness in Diddy's case, went through weeks of gut-wrenching testimony as she alleged that she was coerced into marathon 'freak off' sexual performances during her relationship with Combs; The pair seen in 2016\n\nDuring the eight-week trial Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses; Pictured in a courtroom sketch\n\n'I knew the weak points in the statute,' he said. 'The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.'\nHe said prosecutors had 'dozens of fail points.'\n'They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,' he said. 'They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.'\nSome personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura — who was seen for the first time since the verdict over the weekend — had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.\nFor Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed as he works on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.\n'He's doing OK,' said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.\nHe said Combs genuinely desires improvement and 'realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.'\n'He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune that can erase them,' he said. 'You can't cover them up.'\nCassie, the prosecution's star witness in Combs' case, went through weeks of gut-wrenching testimony as she alleged that she was coerced into marathon 'freak off' sexual performances during her relationship with the producer.\nCassie - who was heavily pregnant as she took the stand and has since given birth - claimed that Combs often beat and abused her during their 11-year relationship.\nDuring cross-examination, Diddy's defense attorneys brought up text messages from their relationship where Cassie wrote that she 'loved' the freak offs.\nThe messages undercut the prosecution's argument, and a jury on Wednesday was not swayed by her testimony as it rejected the top charges against Combs in a stunning verdict.\n\nCombs must remain in custody until his sentencing hearing on October 3; Pictured in 2023\n\nWhile Prosecutor Maurene Comey said the government will seek a 20-year maximum for Combs on charges of transportation to engage in prostitution, his defense tried to fight for less and requested he be freed on a $1 million bond.\nThat request was denied, meaning he must remain in custody until his sentencing hearing on October 3.\nCassie has since given birth with her husband Alex Fine. While she was not in attendance when the jury delivered the verdict on Wednesday, her attorney was.\nFollowing the verdict on Wednesday, Cassie's attorney praised her for 'paving the way' for the bombshell trial against one of the music industry's most powerful men.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDiddy received 'standing ovation' from fellow inmates after shock court victory\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
